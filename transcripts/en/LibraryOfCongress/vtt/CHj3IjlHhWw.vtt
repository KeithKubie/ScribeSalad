00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.760
And welcome.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.320
My name is Larry Appelbaum
from the Music division here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.880
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.540
It's my pleasure to say sitting
to my left is musician, scholar,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.170
and educator Ingrid Monson.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.720
Some of you will know that
Ingrid is Quincy Jones professor

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.930
of African-American music
at Harvard University.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.720
She has served as interim dean
of arts and humanities at Harvard

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.080
and chair of the Department
of Music.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.390
Ms. Monson is an award-winning
author.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.540
Her books include <i>Freedom Sounds:
Civil Rights Call Out to Jazz</i>

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.840
<i>and Africa</i> and <i>Saying Something:
Jazz Improvisation and Interaction</i>.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.470
Both books belong on the shelf

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.550
of any serious student
or scholar of jazz.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.320
I'm pleased that she's with us.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.670
She's here sort of
under the auspices

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.970
of a jazz scholar program -- part
of the Library of Congress' effort

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.760
with the Reva &amp; David
Logan Foundation.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.510
I hope you will help me
welcome Ingrid Monson.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.360
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.330
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Nice to
see you again, as always.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.630
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Nice to see you.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yes.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.700
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I first want
to say that I was just delighted

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.550
to be invited to come to the
Library of Congress and be here

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040
for two weeks in residence.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160
I've wanted to come and work

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.510
on the Max Roach papers
for quite some time.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.630
And you just made it easy.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
You're on sabbatical --

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.230
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: -- right now.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.830
So nice timing.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.130
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Perfect.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.430
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yes.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.500
So you arrived earlier this week,
and I know you wanted to look

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.200
at Max Roach; is there something
in particular you're hoping to find

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.020 position:56%
and what are you discovering so far?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I'm very
interested in this collection partly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.980
because I wrote a great deal about
Max Roach in <i>Freedom Sounds</i>.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.850
I interviewed him for it.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.470
I interviewed Abbey Lincoln
and a number of related people.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.620
And I went through the documents
that were available to me then.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.290
But his archive was
not available then.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.660
So one of the key things I want to
look at is what's in the archive

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.730
that can enrich the
story I've already told

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.520
or correct the story
I've already told?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.800
And so the first box I got
out on Monday were the scores

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.700
to the "Freedom Now Suite."

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.430
You know, and the care with which
these scores are put together is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.730
really interesting.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.540
And every part of the
suite has a score.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.050 position:56%
And they're very detailed, including
drum parts and things for tryptic,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.840
which is the middle movement.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.610
And then I learned that there was
originally an overture written

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.900
for it that I've never heard.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.710
And it's there in the box.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.660
And that there were some other
songs that were being, you know,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.800
considered between he and Oscar
Brown, and there are some scores

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
for that material as well.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.310
So already I have an
expanded sense of what --

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.140
you know, their process
of trying things out.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.950 position:56%
There's also a lot of correspondence
that relates to "Freedom Sounds"

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.800
and it also relates to
something else that I wrote

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.640
about in my book <i>Freedom Sounds</i>,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.650
which was about this Ira
Gitler's review of Abbey Lincoln's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.050
"Straight Ahead" in 1961,
which just shall we say --

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.710
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Stirred controversy.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.680
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: -- stirred
controversy is to put it lightly.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.170
And there was this huge debate
about racial prejudice in jazz

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.510
in the early 1962 in <i>Downbeat</i> in
which they had a panel discussion

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.290
and some very uncensored
things were said.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.660
What I found in the correspondence
just in the last couple of days is

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.130
that at the time that Ira
Gitler's review came out,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.720
which would have been
sometime in November

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.800
of 1961, they contacted a lawyer.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:53.360
And there's a handwritten thing
of Abbey responding to Ira Gitler.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.770
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Who
contacted the lawyer?

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.430
Was it Abbey and Max or was it --

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.440
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I
think Abbey and Max.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.280 position:56%
I haven't figured out exactly the
chain, but there were two attorneys.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.550
And a very stern letter
was sent by an attorney

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.550
to Ira Gitler in November of 1961.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.700
So this -- so the availability
of materials

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.460
like this just enriches what you're
able to see and what you're able

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.050
to know about this amazing
career that Max Roach had.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Since
you're talking about the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.000 position:56%
"Freedom Now Suite", can you talk a
little bit about the context of what

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.720
that work meant for the time
in which it was created?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It was an
extraordinarily important work.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.980
He and Oscar Brown began to
work on it in 1958 or 1959.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.670
Now, Sonny Rollins had done
something he called the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:03.380
"Freedom Suite" in 1957, but that
was a completely instrumental work.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.970
But he worked with Oscar Brown.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.920
Clearly Max had this vision
for this multimovement piece.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.450 position:56%
I mean, I think it's often forgotten
that Max Roach was a composer.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.410
And so he had this vision
for a multimovement piece.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.880
He wanted lyrics, he had
Oscar Brown write lyrics.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.080
He wanted Abbey Lincoln to sing.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.140
He got in touch with
Babatunde Olatunji.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.360
He wanted to do something
that included Africa.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.240
And evidently, one of the
debates between Oscar Brown

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.880
and Max Roach had to do with did
Africa come first in the suite

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.750
or did Africa come at the end?

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.680
And those of you who know the
work know that it comes at the end

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.890
in "Tears for Johannesburg"
and "All Africa."

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.200
and it speaks to independence.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.010
And right when this was
being composed is when a lot

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:05.840
of African nations gained
independence -- 16 of them in 1960.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.040
And African diplomats
began to be in New York.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.340
And guess what?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.970 position:56%
They went out and heard jazz and got
to know people within the community.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.680
So Max took it from being a story
of Africa to the United States

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.080
to a story that was really
the United States to look

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.810
at contemporary Africa in a
pan-African kind of sense.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.960
They were able to do
it as a statement.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.270
I also interviewed Nat
Hentoff about this.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.360
And the reason it was recorded
is because this was the year

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.240
that Nat Hentoff ran Candid Records

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.020
and he could really pretty
much put out what he wanted.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.990
It was an independent label.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.600
And he wanted Max to be able to
say what he -- you know, his piece.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.570
And he knew that Max Roach was,
you know, politically engaged,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.730
and the lyrics refer
to A. Philip Randolph.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.540
And so they made a
statement with it.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.850
And the cover, if you've
never seen it,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.710
has a picture like a
lunch counter sit-in.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.340
So the lunch counter
sit-ins happened this year.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.350
So a lot was going on in the
world when this came out.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.270
The first live performance
was a benefit for the Congress

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.480
of Racial Equality in early 1961.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.810
And, of course, it
immediately caught the attention

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:37.440
of the jazz world, that people were
standing up and saying something.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.260
And Nat Hentoff described
the time as that you just had

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.200
to stand up and say something.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.160
You weren't content to
just sit in your seat.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.460
And --

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What was the
response at the time to this work?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, the
response, as I remember,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.150
there were some people --

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.970
Dan Morgenstern wrote a really
nice review of it and liked it.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.330
And it included dancers
in the original program.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.210
And I guess Maya Angelou
was one of the dancers.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:20.210
And some other publications it was
dismissed as, "Oh, this is some,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.450
you know, new age, cool thing
that people in New York maybe

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.170
like but nobody else does."

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:32.460
You know? So that it was too
highbrow and it was too gloomy

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.830
and was not optimistic enough.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Or
in a generational sense,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.980
many older critics might have said,
"Hey, musicians should play music,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.650
they shouldn't be making
political statements."

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.300
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, right, and
that was certainly one attitude

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.830
about that to make a
political statement was

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.440
in some corners considered
to be beneath art.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.060
But overall, I think in jazz
people always felt compelled

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.090
in this time period that they
had to prove that jazz was art.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.970
This generation of musicians
really fought that battle

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.890
from bebop into the 1960's.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.880
We now take it for granted
that it's an art music,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.760
but it wasn't considered that then.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:23.070
And so there was an ambitiousness
to create a larger work to show

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:28.030
that this isn't -- you
know, that there's a --

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.250
we have a larger creative
vision and we're going to do it.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.340
And the thing that got talked
about most in the reviews

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.550
of the piece was the subset
of tryptic called "Protest"

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.060
where Abbey Lincoln does a kind

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.960
of stylized screaming
over drum accompaniment.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.470
And I looked at all the reviews
of it and none of the rest

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.200
of the pieces really talked
about it; all they did was focus

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.870
on the screams as if that were
not musically contextualized

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.360
in an extremely rich way.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:07.350
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So what have
you found so far about Max's vision

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:13.100
for the work and how it might
have changed through performance?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.830
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I haven't
addressed that question.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.750
I want to listen to this
recording you told me about,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.380
that they evidently
performed it in Iran.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.680
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.980
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I've
got to hear that.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.580
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I've got
to take a closer listen

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.920
to the German performance.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I'm just curious,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.200
how many people sitting
here have heard this work,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.560
the "Freedom Now Suite"?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.510
Okay. Sometimes it's called
"We Insist Freedom Now"?

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.980
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
the full name is

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.260
"We Insist Freedom Now Suite,"
Max Roach's "Freedom Now" suite.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.670
But among musicians and
things it's always referred

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.610
to as the "Freedom Now."

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.390
But the official title
says "We insist!

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.390
Freedom Now Suite."

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.320
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So when
you initially interviewed Max

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.290
about this, what was his
take all these years later?

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:15.660
What was his description of what
he was trying to do as explanation?

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.460
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I
think he was very proud of it.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.490
It was interesting, he
seemed to feel nostalgic

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.450
about Abbey Lincoln
when I spoke with him.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.460
He was doing -- he was
working with Baraka

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.920
on his autobiography at the time.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.650
And he was a little bit evasive in
terms of giving me lots of detail.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.450
But I went and I told him that
I talked with Oscar Brown.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:45.780
And he said that they had this
disagreement about, you know,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:51.070
the politics of the time and that
Oscar Brown was more moderate

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:57.460
and Max was moving in a more
nationalist kind of direction

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.800
and pan-Africanist direction.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.980
And he basically said,
"Oh yeah, we, you know" --

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.860
he was not giving me a
lot of detail about it

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.620
in my own interview with him.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.930
He kind of said, "Well, you know,
I'm working on this autobiography.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.230
I can only say" --

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: He's
saving it for the book.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.830
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: -- "so much."

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.220
And, of course, they didn't
finish the autobiography.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:24.370 position:56%
But here in the archive are the
interviews that they did around 1995

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.850
and some drafts that
they were working on.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.810
So that's another thing that
I'm taking a look at here.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: When
Ingrid talks about Baraka,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.180
she's referring to Amiri Baraka --

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.480
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Amiri Baraka.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.820
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: -- with
whom they were collaborating

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.580
on an autobiography.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.600 position:56%
So if -- and I may end up asking you
this question again in another week

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.260
or two -- if Max were here
with us today, what would you

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.750
like to ask him these years later?

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.460
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: You
know, these years later one

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.870 position:56%
of the things that's overwhelming
the last couple of days is I've gone

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.750
through a number of
his business papers.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:08.070
And it's very clear to me that he
was deeply involved in the running

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:15.100
of his own affairs, had very
clear conceptions of his works.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:24.410
So -- and in the archive
are these yellow notepads

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:31.040
where he's written these elaborate
letters in longhand in pencil

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.800
and that later before
they're sent, then,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.080
he's given them to
somebody to type up.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.310
So then there's a typed
version of it, too.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:43.900
But he goes back and
corrects things.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.150
And he was right on top of the
details of how he was going

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.000
to be represented in
pamphlets and things

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.190
that publicized his appearances.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.910
Very involved in fine-tuning
contractual issues.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.030
And I think he worked very hard

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.990
to get paid what he
thought he was worth.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:13.140
And so it's clear that he was a
tough negotiator with these things.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:19.160
But there are also drafts in there
of plays that I think he wrote

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:26.540
or play-like -- you know,
multimedia kinds of projects

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.270
in which he very carefully sketches
out the drafts, writes a rationale

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:35.250
for it, what his overarching
artistic goals are.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:40.590
So you see an artist at work
and you realize that one thing

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.430
that an artist like him
does is has a vision

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.920
and works extremely
hard to make it happen.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:52.250
So there he is, you know, the
logistics of all the instruments

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:58.270
that need to be hired, the
scoring, the staging, the lighting.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:05.850
I would simply want to ask him
more about this and how he moved

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.060
from the administrative
side of his career

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.010
to the creative side and back.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.330
But he was not hands-off at all.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: We can say
he was a disciplined person?

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.180
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Very.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.810
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Would
you say controlling?

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.450
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I
didn't know him well personally

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:31.340
to say that, but yes,
he probably was.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.860
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
There's evidence of that.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.010
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: When
you're artistically committed

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.360
and you want things a certain
way, you're going to push

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.560 position:56%
until you get what you want kind of.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.610
So I see that's on there.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.200
But we'd have to ask his family.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.130
I mean, I have a certain impression
from interviewing Abbey Lincoln,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.290
who I think found him
very controlling.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The vision of
the work that comes from both Max

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:03.360
and Abbey, were they in sync
or do they have differing ideas

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.290
of what they were trying to do?

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.190
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: It
was interesting,

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:13.490
when I interviewed Abbey Lincoln
for my book, she invited me

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:19.080
to her apartment and we
talked for three hours.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.960
And I arrived ready
to take down the story

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.380
of the revolutionary heroine --

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.720
that's the story I
thought I would be getting.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.020
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Maybe we should just --

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.310
for those who may be
watching this webcast --

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.610
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:35.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: --
just talk a little bit

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.210
about who Abbey Lincoln
was and the context.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:41.100
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Abbey Lincoln was
a fabulous singer and was married

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.760
to Max Roach during the '60s.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.880
She was involved with
him from the late 1950's,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.030 position:56%
and then they were divorced in 1970.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:58.080 position:56%
But it was clear that she was really
his deepest muse, it seems to me.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.820
And when I interviewed her,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.880
she wanted to distance
herself from all that.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.780
She kind of said, "Well,
Max made me do that.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.950
Max made me do the screaming.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.280
That wasn't my idea."

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.320
And it was really hard to sing
against those arrangements.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.100
And --

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.790
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: She
was also an actress?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.280
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: She
was also an actress.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.260
And she later, in what, 1964
does <i>Nothing But a Man</i> --

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.580
this film <i>Nothing But a Man</i>.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.490
If you've never seen
it, she's amazing in it.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.320
And then <i>For the Love of Ivy</i>.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.180
But I think the thing to
remember about the two

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.400
of them is the speaking
out had a price.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.670
So if you look at their
recordings in the 1960's,

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:48.930
Abbey Lincoln didn't do another
recording under her own name after

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.590
"Straight Ahead" until the 1970's.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:59.410
And Max had more recordings,
but he wasn't --

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.650
he wasn't lionized in the 1960's.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And do you
attribute this to the price

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.590
that they paid in commercial terms?

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.280
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I think
they were coded as difficult.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.030
They were coded as difficult.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.810
And so some people simply
didn't want to deal with them.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.840
And that's how the music industry
froze out outspoken artists,

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.500
"Oh, so-and-so is difficult."

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.780
And Abbey Lincoln, when I spoke
to her, talked about, you know,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.010
coming into her own in the
'80s in writing her own songs

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:42.160
and her own artistic musical
vision and viewed her old self

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.870
in the early 1960's is when she
was trying to please Max Roach.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:53.760
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: As an actor or
actress tries to please a director?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.670
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: And as a wife
often tries to please a husband.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:06.190
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There are
some intimate, very personal bits

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.550
of correspondence between them.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.990
Of course, in the Max Roach
collection we have the things

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:16.050
that Abbey wrote to Max; we
don't necessarily have the things

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.180
that Max wrote to Abbey, although
those may be at the Institute

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.570
for Jazz Studies where the
Abbey Lincoln papers reside.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.590
So are you planning to go
visit IJS to see those papers?

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.890
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Of course.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: See
the other side of the coin?

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.270
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: See the
other side of the coin.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.530
And yes, it's complicated.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.740
But when, you know, to go back
to when I interviewed Max,

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.380
in the middle of this I was
showing him the magazine copy

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.380
of the racial prejudice
in jazz interview.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.070
And it has this picture
of Abbey Lincoln,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.910
who is just glaring at Ira Gitler.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.210
And --

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The jazz critic.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.300
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: The jazz critic.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:04.580 position:56%
And Max looked at that picture and
he laughed and he kind of said, "Oh,

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.790
she was really something."

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.250
You know, "Look at Abbey, ha ha
ha, she was really something."

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.780
So there was this admiration
and sort of nostalgia.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.080
And I interviewed Ira Gitler, too,
I wanted to give him the chance

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.590
to take back everything
that he'd said [Laughs].

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.340
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
So what did Ira say

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.600
or what did you ask
him specifically?

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.340
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: He
didn't take anything back.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.290
I was disappointed that he
didn't take anything back.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.060
But, you know, he knew them.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.890
They had a longer history with him.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.770
And I think one of the things
we need to remember about how

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.660
when things got incendiary
around race in the 1960's,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.690
just as maybe now things
are getting incendiary,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.020
is people will say
these horrible things

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.020 position:56%
about one another in a public event.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.590
You know, but they invited
Ira to their wedding,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.670
which happened afterwards.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:05.170
So they had a longer history with
one another in terms of interacting

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.370
within the, you know, jazz world.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.380
Dan Morgenstern told me
the same thing one time.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.830
He said he was on some panel in
1970 or '71 and he was, like,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.920
the only white person
representing kind of <i>Downbeat</i>.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.480
And there was a whole discussion
about jazz and exploitation.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.030
And, you know, Max was there
and he sort of got called out.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.840
And then Dan said, "Well, when
it was over, Max came up to me

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.600
and said, 'You know,
Dan, it's not personal.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.470
You have to remember
it's not personal.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:44.820
And, you know, can you give me
a ride to the Upper West Side?'"

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.950
And so they got in the car together
and went off and were talking.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:56.490
But they had a longer
relationship than the public event.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.480
And I think that was true
for a number of people.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So if it's
not personal, what is it, really?

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.850
Is it just discourse?

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.150
What is it?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.650
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, now
we're getting into my book.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.400
How I coped with trying to
tell this story and to try

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.670
to develop some kind of
framework for talking

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.040
about hard interracial
conversations was to say

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.320
on one level there's
discourse, there's rhetoric --

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.560
people say all sorts of things.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.180
There's what people say
and then there's practice,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.160
it's what people do.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.030
And then underline it all as
kind of a structural situation,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.590
the economics of the music
business and the long,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:44.210
long duray of structural
racism in the music industry.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:51.810
So yes, the discourse could
get really, really polarized.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.670
And at the same time people went on

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.860
and they had their ongoing
interracial collaborations

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.160
with various people.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.830
You know, think of Archie Shepp.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.420
So Archie Shepp was also somebody
who had a lot of, you know,

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.060
strong discourse around 1965 or so.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.790
There was a certain pressure
on musicians who wanted to show

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:20.050
that they were conscious and
self-determining to not have

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.780
so many white people
in the band, you know?

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.960
There was a certain pressure.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.760
So in the middle of all this
Archie Shepp's got Roswell Rudd

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.490
in the band, and Roswell
with was him the entire time.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:37.600
It was sort of like, okay, I
may be making general statements

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.550
about the nature of race relations,
but Roswell's okay with me.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.560
You know? So I think that
there were a lot of, like,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.630
individual personal
relationships that cut across some

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.860
of the difficult conversations.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.100 position:56%
And I think for the white people who
were part of those conversations,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.980
they learned something;
they got better.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.500
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So when
Max says it's not personal,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.690
but then you see the photograph
of Abbey glaring at Ira,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.180
was it personal for Abbey?

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.690
Or was that just her
being an actress?

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.990
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: No,
she was really --

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.390
you know, it was caught at a moment
that Ira had said something to her

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.570
that really made her mad.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.890
And she did not spend
much time with him.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.990
But she also told me a story of
running into Ira in a bar, like,

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:32.370
20 years later and having
a kind of conversation.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:36.770
I don't think she -- I think
Max sounded more forgiving

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.710
to Ira than Abbey did.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:44.710
But she also met him 20 years
later and they knew one another.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now, we've
been talking about Max Roach a lot

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.800
because that's been the
focus of your time so far.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.100
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.830
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But are
there other collections you are

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.070
particularly interested
in, and what do you hope

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.600
to find in those collections?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.900
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
thanks to you,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.060
you've been showing me these gems
from all sorts of collections.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.600
I feel like I could stay here
for six months, you know?

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I wish you would.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.740
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Okay.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.630
And there's so many
wonderful things.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.060
You were telling me about
Bruce [inaudible]'s collection.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.300
I'm very interested in
the economic picture,

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.050 position:56%
probably where there's a lot of talk
about unfair record deals and stuff.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.810
And it's very difficult to
get hard economic information,

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:32.000
except from musicians
who kept their contracts.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.480
And Max Roach has done this.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.440
And evidently Bruce [inaudible],
there's all sorts of --

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.580
so you can find out what
people got paid, what the terms

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:46.190
of their contracts were so you
have a better idea of, you know,

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.060
the economic picture for
musicians at the time.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.500
So I'm very excited at
looking at those materials.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.310
I'm interested in copyright
issues also.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.190
So I want to make a trip
to the copyright division.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.820
I'm interested in the whole
problem of what was used

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.850 position:56%
as a copyright deposit before 1978
when it had to be a written deposit.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:16.440
And I learned a lot about this
because I was an expert witness

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.280
on the Marvin Gaye side of the
case in the "Blurred Lines" thing,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.930
and it was all about the other
side trying to say that the extent

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:30.640
of the composition was only what
was notated in the lead sheet.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.250
There's a way in which --

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:40.570
so this idea of the popular song
being simply a melody and chords

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.180
and the words, it descends from
the fact that lead sheets became,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.340
you know, the standard copyright
deposit for people who are trying

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.850
to -- often were making
music either orally

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.670
or only partially with notation.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:57.970
So --

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.350
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But what made
those two songs popular was not the

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.030
chords or the melody,
it was the groove.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.380
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Exactly, amen.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And how
do you document the groove?

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.940
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Okay,
here's the thing is --

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:17.280
so there's this idea that,
you know, with copyright,

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.100
if the lead sheet just had
the melody and the chords,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.950
people would say, "Oh, the
rest is just arrangement,"

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.900
as if anything that's played by the
bass drums and piano is generic.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.350
Okay? Here's this whole
idea of what is generic.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:37.420
And I think, "Well, you know,
if grooves are just generic,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.330
how come they change all the time?"

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.800
And you can -- you know,
in the way I teach,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.630 position:56%
you can really almost do a
complete history of different styles

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.570
of music based on the
changes in the grooves.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.340
So somebody was inventing
those together.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.510 position:56%
And if they became popular, then
other people started imitating them,

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.660
and then they became generic.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.240
But creating a groove
is a composition --

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.780
in my view is a compositional act.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.980
And that's what I argued
in the Marvin Gaye case,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.520
is the particular set of
parts that we were going on,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.220
he was playing them all on that
recording, was not something

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.890
that was generic and
was previously seen.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.190
So --

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.490
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But can one
register for copyright a groove?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.860
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: No, as
far as I know you can't.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.460
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: So there's a way

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.790
in which the copyright has not
served this kind of music well.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And you say you
worked on that or you were consulted

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.610
for that case; what
exactly did you do?

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.060
Did you testify?

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.360
And if so, what --

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I did, yes.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.960
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: What
was your point of view?

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.010 position:56%
Is it what you were just suggesting?

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.310
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Right.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.790
I worked -- it was me and another
musicologist named Judith Finell.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.150
And we started out first
by just transcribing

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:57.740
and comparing and finding --

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.140
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By the
way, how did they find you?

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.630
I mean, how did you
get tapped for that?

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.440
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I'm not
sure how they found me.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.450
Somebody told them to call me.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.050
And so I talked to them.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.280
And I had heard the pieces,
and I agreed, you know,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.090
with their side of the case.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.280
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By the
way, what was their side of it?

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.470
You agreed that what?

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.160
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: That
"Blurred Lines" ripped off

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.580
from "Got to Give it Up."

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:22.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Okay.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.180
Does everybody know those songs?

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.480
I mean, those are -- okay.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.210
So I know Marvin Gaye did the
original, who did the copy?

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.750
Who did the second?

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.350
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Robin
Thicke and Pharrell.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There
we go, two big names.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.760
Okay, I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.690
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: But we
shouldn't get delayed on that.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:44.010
So to have the -- to be able to
look at the copyright deposits

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.910
and just get a sense of what
some of the jazz people put

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.610
in for their copyright deposits,
probably some people put

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.520
in more elaborate scores
than others.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:57.330
So I'm interested in the
economic and the legal questions.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:03.380
And then just, you know, you open
these files and you may think

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.220
that some collection might not
have anything relevant to you,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:12.400
and then you start
looking at what's in there

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.230
and you get a new view
of the person.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.940
You know, I feel like I've
gotten a new view of Max Roach

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.240
by looking at these papers.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.330
On the one hand you
feel like you're digging

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:29.060
in somebody's personal materials;
these things were in his house.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:37.970
And so you feel a little bit
like a voyeur in that, you know,

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:43.720
you need to have some care with
how you're looking at this.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:50.100
And it's a treasure to fill in
the kinds of details that you see

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:56.410
from what people saved
and organized.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:59.630
But seeing his handwriting,
you know, it just --

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:05.160
it gives you a very personal feel
of this man engaged in his career.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.710
I mean, he was serious,
very serious.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So when you
write about any of these artists,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.740
any of these musicians,
do you feel an obligation

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.960
or responsibility to their legacy?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:22.190 position:56%
I mean, we know that people have
certain mythologies about Max Roach.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.270
They don't want to hear the
rough edges or the warts.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.320
They don't want to read that stuff.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.110
So I'm wondering, do
you approach this

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.050
as a historian, as a musicologist?

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.390
How do you tell the story,
be true to the story,

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:43.370
but to what extent are you
concerned with the legacy

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.930
of in this case Max
Roach or Charles Mingus?

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.620
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I think
this is really the challenge

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.250
of doing biographies.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:58.720
I haven't done a biography
of a jazz musician.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.430
<i>Freedom Sounds</i> was
not a biography.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:09.090
And part of the reason was is I
wanted to tell a broad history.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:15.040
And I wanted it to not be just
the story of one musician but more

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.400
of a portrait of a kind of
conversation that took place

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.160
across a broader community.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:28.490
And I wrote in that book that I
really fight against the tendency

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:33.170
to make everybody a genius and
say only glowing things about them

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.550
because I don't think that
serves their legacy, actually.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:43.930
Because the nitty gritty of the
story is all the things they had

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.640
to do to be who they are.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.910
And what you see in this Max Roach
archive is the tremendous amount

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.480
of work put into conceptualizing

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.220
and handling business
and conceiving work.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.940
So I want people to understand
what people had to go through.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:07.160
Unfortunately, when the narrative
becomes too much one of genius,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.520
people sit back and sort of think,
"Well, it was just handed to them.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.350
It was preordained, they
were talented and, you know,

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:20.050
in the right place at the right
time and they became legendary."

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:23.130
And I think there's a much
more important story with all

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:29.560
of these musicians about a process
of self-making and that music --

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.210
playing music itself is
an act of self-making.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.040
It takes practice and discipline.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:44.200 position:56%
Organizing a successful
performance career also takes a kind

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:52.810
of discipline and hardiness that is
lost when all people do is focus --

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.240
you know, in some earlier jazz
histories all they did was focus

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.030
on Charlie Parker high on heroin

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.530
or some outrageous thing
Charles Mingus said when he went

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.150
to a restaurant and
intimidated the owner.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.120
And all of those are colorful.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:16.320
You don't want to leave those
details out, but people can really,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.970
you know, make a fetish of
some of the war stories.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And that's
only one part of the story?

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.420
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.080
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And so what
are the other parts of this story,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.510
aside from the struggle
that everybody --

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.850
I mean, everybody struggles
with something,

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.470
especially creative artists.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.020
So what else is there?

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.670
If it's not genius, if it's not
struggle, if it's not pathology,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.740
where does this creativity
come from, do you think?

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.780
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: You'd
like a psychoanalytic --

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:54.880
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, I'd like
some kind of answer or speculation.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.340
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
I feel about people

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:03.790
who are really artistically
creative and especially composers

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.050
in creating new works,
they need to do it.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.820
There's a compulsion to do
it: You're driven to do it;

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.450
you like the process of doing
it; you like the result of it;

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:18.660
and you need to do it to feel okay.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:25.120
And I think what's driving that
interest for somebody, I think,

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.850
varies for musicians to musicians.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:32.780
I think some of the issues are
part of your historical time,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.880
some are about the personal
struggles you're going through.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.890
I mean, in addition to dealing with
your career and practicing and,

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:46.770
you know, everything, people have
personal lives, and families,

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:54.980 position:56%
and cousins, and health problems
that are part of the whole human mix

00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:00.850
that everybody has to contend with.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Indeed.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:07.140
So when you are teaching your
classes -- and I'm guessing --

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.500
first of all, tell us a little bit

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.580
about what specific
courses you do teach

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:21.780
and then what your experience has
been with your students as far

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.810
as what they want to learn,
or what they expect to learn,

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.390
or what their mythologies might be.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.150
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I've done
two large lectures courses.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:36.840
One is called Jazz Freedom in
Culture and the other is called

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.260
from R&amp;B to Neo Soul ,which is
more about R&amp;B and popular music.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:48.100
And they have counted for
general education at Harvard.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.860
And so they tend to
be the kind of classes

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.670
where I get a couple
hundred students in them

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.810
or a hundred students in them.

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.550
And I've taught some version of
these courses throughout my career.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:04.200
And what I learn in teaching it --
I never do it the same way twice

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.520
because I feel like your
challenge is to communicate

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.390
with the students in front of you.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:14.290
And their viewpoints
on stuff have changed.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:18.540
They come with different
preexisting narratives

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.790
about jazz or about Motown.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.760
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Can you give
some examples of these narratives?

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.500
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, the genius
narrative in jazz and we start

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.270
with Louis Armstrong and we
want to hear all the geniuses;

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:37.040
we're not interested in people

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.610
that we don't already
know are important, okay?

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:43.070
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So
the great man approach.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.880
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: There is
a kind of great man kind

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.180
of thing that people have.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.630 position:56%
And then they think they
understand about the politics of it.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.610
They think, "Well, there was
the Civil Rights Movement

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:58.690
and there was black power, and
nothing has happened since."

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:03.110
Okay, this has changed since
Black Lives Matter emerged

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.770
into the spotlight
a couple years ago.

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:11.380
And I found as the
students got younger,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.470
they had a very sanitized
vision of the history

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.290
of the Civil Rights
Movement that, I don't know,

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:24.700
they got watching a
documentary or something.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:31.250
And, you know, I try to show
them documents and things, too,

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.180
and materials that I know will
give them a more nuanced figured.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.680
Because the part I
couldn't stand was when --

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.570
there's such a romance
about black power,

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.000
which is incredibly important.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.300
But I make an argument in my book

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.630
that self-determination is people
wanted whether they supported

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:55.100 position:56%
Malcolm X or Martin Luther King --
everybody wanted self-determination.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:01.240
And I quote Bernice Reagon about,
look, marching non-violently

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:10.310
in your town was an act of war in
the South in 1960 or 1961 or 1962.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:15.800
So I try to show the commitment
and the bravery, you know,

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:21.310
from different regions
of the movement in there

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.610
and not have them just say --

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.140
because you find some
of the students come in

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.770 position:56%
and they're only interested in black
power is everything else is some

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.070
kind of compromise.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:35.780
And I don't think that's a
full story, and I want them

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:41.460
to have the tools to, you
know, think about that.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.740
And, you know, I do a similar
thing in terms of talking

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.800
about popular music and I try
to give them as much information

00:40:53.780 --> 00:41:01.060
as is available to me for them
to think about the importance

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.130
of popular music --
who identifies with it.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:09.330
You know, there's always the issues
of appropriation, exploitation,

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:20.730
what are ethical relationships to
black music if you aren't black.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:30.800
And the other thing I say is, you
know, this music is something.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.130
When I say I teach a popular course
to [inaudible] oh, popular music.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.130
That must just be an
easy A for everybody.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:42.820
And I really feel like the
issues raised by the history

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.130
of African-American music in terms
of American race relations are

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:52.340
as deep and complex and profound
as you could teach in any course.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:57.780 position:56%
And I try to get my students to feel
more comfortable talking about it,

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.510
writing about it, reading about it.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.340
And some people are resistant and
some people totally embrace it.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:12.170
And I just use myself as a
lightning rod for ambivalence.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.950
Sometimes I go, "Look, I'm the
white Quincy Jones professor

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.250
of African-American music.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.420
You can ask me any question
you want about that."

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:24.360
And so we get into, you
know, everybody talks

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.430
about their own relationship
to these things.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.040
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And we
are in just a moment or two --

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.550
we're going to give you a chance

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.790
to ask any question
you want about that.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:39.860
But I'd like to ask a kind of
naive question, sort of open-ended.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:44.650
Can you talk a little bit about --

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:49.520 position:56%
because I know your study has not
just been in jazz and popular music,

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.630
you have a deep and abiding
interest in African music.

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.930
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, I do.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.270
And in fact, I'm finishing
a book right now

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.090
about a musician from Mali.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.300
You know, I'm tried as
an ethnomusicologist.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.880
And I really wanted to
do a project in Africa.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.270
First of all, if you love
jazz, it's very easy to fall

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.260
in love with music from Mali.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:15.740 position:56%
You like instrumental improvisation,
socially engaged topics?

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.710
Mali is fantastic.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:24.000 position:56%
But also, I could see my students
being curious about the relationship

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.050
to what it means to identify
within African diaspora

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.990
and the complexity of
what that history is.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:38.390
And so I felt like I wanted
to know at least one music

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.670
on the African content
from that point of view.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.160
And so I've spent time in Mali.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.880
The musician I'm writing
about is a guy named Neba Solo

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:53.820
who plays a pentatonic balafon.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.660
He's Senufo, and his music is
really, really interesting.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:03.060 position:56%
I sort of -- to my jazz fans I say
he's kind of like the Charlie Parker

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.130
and the John Coltrane
of the Senufo balafon.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.870 position:56%
He took it and he had an imagination

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:14.900
for modernizing the village
tradition that he was raised with.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.260
And it's amazing.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, this leads
to my naive question, which is:

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:27.380
What do you really feel is African
about African-American music?

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:32.750
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
this is a long question,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:36.300
and people have answered
it in all sorts of way.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:42.290
But I approach it by trying
to look at the history

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:47.020
of the slave trade here
and where people came from.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:52.340
There's been this fluorescence of
work on the 18th and 19th century

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.390
in African-American history that
I think has been really important.

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:58.730
And one of the things that
it's shown is that one

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:04.120
of the early layers
of where people came

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:09.360
from was what was then called
Senegambia or Senegal/Mali area.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.960
And people in New Orleans,

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.550
there were balafons,
the wooden xylophones.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:20.940
And other parts of the continent
then later were from Congo Angola.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.750
So I want to look deeply
historically about it.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:30.140
And one of the bees in my bonnet
when I talk about African music is

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:35.510
that you cannot -- you know,
sometimes I say to my students,

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.820
"Well, you're not going to
be leaving this course saying

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.250
that the African part of the
music is the rhythm only."

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.550
Okay?

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.850
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
That's the cliche.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.260
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: This
music has melody.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.440
The drum parts have melody.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.970 position:56%
In fact, you can't play these
complex polyrhythms unless the drums

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.750
are tuned to different pitch levels
because they would all blend.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:03.440 position:56%
And there's a Nigerian music
theorist named [inaudible] who talks

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.780
about mellow rhythm
as being the shape

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.970
of the drum parts and
the drum ensembles.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.510
And, you know, some
of the early recording

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:18.680
of drum ensembles didn't include
the people who were singing, okay?

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.110 position:56%
So you get this idea that people
just played drums alone all the time

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:27.120
when most of the time there's
singing and often a ritual purpose.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.240
And then there are
instruments in Mali

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.280
that have harmony,
pentatonic harmony.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.970
The Mande jeli tradition has
heptatonic seven-note scale

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.770 position:56%
and they have harmonies and tunings.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:54.060
The Zimbabwe mbiras have
fantastic tuning and compositional,

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.820
you know, harmony qualities to it.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.400
So I want people to understand
the music is just like --

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.350
it's comprised of all
the musical variables

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:09.810
that include melody,
rhythm, harmony, timbre.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:15.360
And in many African musics, since
people speak tone languages,

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:21.040
you can literally play words
in an instrumental fashion.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.870
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So when you
listen to popular music today

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:28.880
or jazz for that matter or
anything, can you identify

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.190
from listening what is
the African element?

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:34.490
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I often put

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:38.960
up on the board Olly Wilson's
<i>Heterogeneous Sound Ideal</i>

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.750
that he wrote I believe
in the '80s, early '90s.

00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.090
And he had this wonderful
point of view of trying

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.740
to identify what things were

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.360
in common throughout
African diasporic music.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.500
And part of it had to do with --

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.030
I won't be able to
recall his language --

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.860
about the nature of grooves,
about call and response,

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.240
about a preference for a dense
texture and different timbres --

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:08.580
not a homogeneous timbre
but heterogeneous timbre --

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.230
layers of riffs and
repeating elements

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.650
at different architectonic levels.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:21.400
You know? And I love
teaching Count Basie that way.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.150
You think it's just a riff, but,
you know, let me play "Volcano"

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.450
and show you how these are
organized and layered together.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.950
So one of the things -- I really
feel strongly about this --

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:38.680
is repetition is not a bad word.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:45.980
So I tend to rely on this call and
response, multilayered ensemble.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.160
And these interacting lines can
be rhythmic, they can be melodic.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.340
And you hear it all over
-- you know, so grooves.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.940
Grooves are really
important in this.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.050
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Indeed in
life, actually, not just in music.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.980
Now's the time when we can open it

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.930
up for any questions
that you might have.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.400
And Mike has a microphone
that he can wander.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:15.500
And I think David has a
question up towards the front.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:21.110
&gt;&gt; Very interested to know in
regards to the recording made

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:27.490
for Nat Hentoff's Candid
label, how was --

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.370
how were the funds raised for that?

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.580
Who paid for that recording?

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.150
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: I would have
to go back into my interview

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:40.010
with Nat Hentoff on that,
but somebody who is a friend

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.440
of Nat Hentoff funded
him for that year.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.390
And it was somebody who had the
money, but I don't know who it was.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.360
I have it in my notes.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.180
I'd have to read it.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.480
But that's a good question.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:57.400
But Nat talked about
it as, you know, "Look,

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.740
I was really lucky this guy
let me do whatever I wanted."

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.700
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Nat was
not the owner of Candid,

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:06.540
he was the A&amp;R person
for that period of time.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.840
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes, yes.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.140
Do you know who the owner was?

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.540
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I do, but his
name has slipped out of my head.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:16.380
I have it on my desk,
strangely enough.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.680
James?

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mentioned when you
were talking about Max Roach --

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:25.080
this goes back to the African music
thing -- you mentioned Olatunji.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:31.050
And he seems like -- to somebody
like myself who doesn't know a lot

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:35.260
about African music, he seems
like this kind of towering figure

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:39.120
for the United States and its
relationship to African music,

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.950
as if this "Drums of
Passion" album was put out

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:45.490
and then suddenly everyone knew
about African music somehow

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:50.690
by this one record, and that
was sort of a catalyst for jazz,

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.940
and popular music, and Bob
Dylan to mention him in songs,

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.240
and all that sort of thing.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.670
And I was wondering if you
could just say a little bit

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:06.640 position:56%
about Olatunji's influence on
American popular music at that time?

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:12.600 position:56%
And also, if for someone like myself
who's basically otherwise ignorant

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.020
of this situation, if there
were other African performers

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.790
who were making that
kind of influence

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:21.530
that maybe don't have
the name recognition now?

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.630
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, it's
interesting because Olatunji,

00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:29.880
that record "Drums of
Passion", you know, went huge.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:34.330
But there was a community
of people that were involved

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:38.060
in either African or
Afro-Cuban music.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:45.260
And Max Roach and Charlie
Parker talk about going back

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.450
into the '40s there was an
African Academy of something

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.710 position:56%
that Dizzy Gillespie where they went

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:57.060
and they heard people were playing
Latin music of various kinds.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:03.790
You get Art Blakey in the early
1950's working with Sabu Martinez,

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:07.600 position:56%
and clearly some Afro-Cuban
musicians were involved in Santeria.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:12.300
So he does "Orgy in Rhythm".

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.450
There's this piece
called "Dinga" which is --

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:20.120
you know, really includes
a chant to Elegua in it.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.060
Candido Camero.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.360
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Camero.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Camero.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.200
I always get that wrong, Randy
Weston talked about Montego Joe.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:38.760 position:56%
There was a whole community around
this that were exchanging the ideas.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:43.080
And, you know, look at the
percussion section on Uhuru Afrika,

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:48.840
and then "Freedom Now" had this
contingent of Latin players

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.040
on the "Freedom Now Suite."

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.550
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And
did we mention Chano Pozo?

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.170
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh,
we forgot Chano Pozo.

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:55.470
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
With Dizzy Gillespie.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:59.330
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Unforgivable with
Chano Pozo was huge in the '40s

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:03.540
with "Cubana Be, Cubana Bop."

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:09.790
Machito did a number of things
with -- you know, that crossed --

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.120
you know so there was interest
among musicians in all this.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.000 position:56%
And The Pleiadian was really popular
in the '50s, and jazz people used

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.030
to go to that, you know,
and listen to it, too.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:26.300
So people were listening
to each other earlier

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.130
than one might anticipate.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:30.430
Because I remember when I started
the research in this, I thought,

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:35.830 position:56%
well, the kind of on the ground line
that most people were saying was,

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.720
"Oh yeah, the African
stuff came in the '60s."

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.840
And that's really wrong.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:47.020
And Randy Weston talked about how
in the Brooklyn he grew up in,

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:52.060
there were a lot of Garveyites, you
know, and people from the Caribbean

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.370
who were deeply involved
in many of these things.

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.520
And then Robin Kelly gave
me this amazing thing from,

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.180
like, 1958, Adurahman.

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.510
I'm not going to get
it quite correctly.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:11.580 position:56%
But there was, like, a little
African cultural center in Brooklyn.

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: There was also
a bassist named Ahmed Abdul-Malik --

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.110
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.410
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: --

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:19.990
who had played with Monk and he
had played with a number of others.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.350
And yeah, there's all
kinds of things happening.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:27.390
I guess one follow-up
to that question is

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:33.520
to what extent were
these integrated fully

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:37.880
versus just exoticizing what
people were already doing?

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:43.660
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: You know, this
stuff becomes a judgment call.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:49.480
Because, you know, often
Babatunde Olatunji got critiqued

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.000
in Nigeria for, you know, not
really knowing the tradition

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.940
to the level he should have in
order to be performing this stuff.

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.940
So he went back to
Nigeria and his ancestors

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.050
and relatives gave
him a very hard time

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:12.210
because people are very fussy
about their own culture.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:19.740
And, of course, you had an
American audience where, you know,

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.840
white people have long been
fascinated with things African

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.100
and exotic and wild rhythms.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:31.760
So the way in which it was marketed
seemed to feed right into that.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.410 position:56%
And so you get people -- but you get
people in the '60s who are trying

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:45.360
to seriously study Africa --
Youruba culture, Mande culture --

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.070
to really know about religion.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:55.990 position:56%
And you get cultural nationalism
and people are really trying to look

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:58.870 position:56%
at a basis for an African socialism.

00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:08.970
They're looking at Julius
Nyerere, the Us Organization,

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:13.400
Maulana Karenga, who then
develops then Kwanzaa.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:18.390
And they're really, you know,
trying to make some serious study

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:24.300
of not only African music but
the culture, and religion,

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:28.310
and values that they
saw underlying it.

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.730
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And, of course,

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:32.360
in the culture it's
more than just Africa.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:36.740 position:56%
I mean, we can see an analog with
fascination with India, for example.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.010
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Oh,
yeah, the other.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.310
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: The other.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.750
Okay. Who else has a question?

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.710
There you go.

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank both of you.

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:52.630 position:56%
You kind of started with the comment
several times to the question

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:56.510
of appropriateness across
race and appropriation.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:00.360 position:56%
You've been in this for a while now.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.770
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: A long time.

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:07.040
&gt;&gt; How has both the ways
you have been confronted

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.600
about being a white person
dealing with this and the ways

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.100
that you have developed your
rationale and response to that,

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:17.770
how has that changed over time?

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:19.070
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well,
it's interesting

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:23.040
because if you had asked me
when I was in graduate school --

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:26.560
if you said to me I was going
to end up at Harvard University

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.260
as the Quincy Jones professor,
I would have just laughed.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.900
I thought, okay, I
was good in school,

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.300
so should be able to
get some kind of job.

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:41.650
But the surprise has been --

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.910
I decided that I wanted
to work on jazz.

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:47.560
And I knew from having
been in the jazz world

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.290
and having African-American
mentors and friends --

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:56.030 position:56%
and I'd like to mention that Richard
Davis was extremely important to me

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.220
at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.920
I learned a lot from Richard Davis.

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.870
I learned a lot from working
with Don Byron in the 1980's.

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:08.680
And we were always
talking about these issues.

00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.670
So there was no way when I went to
graduate school that I was going

00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:14.280
to shove this issue under the rug.

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.080
I knew it needed to be dealt with.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.360
And so I tried to -- I chose
ethnomusicology because I wanted

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.310
to do something from
musician's point of view.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:27.850
So my first book is
about the rhythm section

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:29.430
from the musician's point of view.

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.900
And I interviewed all these
rhythm section players,

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.200
which was really fun.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.040
And I took drum lessons for a year

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:40.650 position:56%
because that was the only instrument
I felt like I was totally lost

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.180
and I needed to understand more.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.480
And I love doing this.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.920
And people had the most
amazing things to say.

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:52.640
And I had a good time, you
know, trying to craft things

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:59.510
that I felt honored
their point of view.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:06.670
Mostly when I came into the field
of ethnomusicology as a professor

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.830
in the early 1990's,

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.430
my African-American colleagues were
glad I was saying what I was saying

00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:21.020 position:56%
because it didn't have to be just
them bringing up race over and over.

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.040
And they were more supportive to me

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:28.470
than I would have thought
they should have been.

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:32.440
I gave a talk -- then I started
to, you know, call out --

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.360
in some of my work, I have called

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:38.720
out certain problems
of white liberalism.

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.150
Okay? So I wrote an article
that was called "The Problem

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:43.280
With White Hipness"
that was in <i>The Journal</i>

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.990
<i>of the American Musicological
Society</i> in about 1995.

00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:53.750 position:56%
And when I was preparing that piece,
I presented it at a conference.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.590
And I presented it and
the first person to jump

00:59:56.590 --> 01:00:00.120
up was Portia Maultsby
from Indiana University,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.920
an African-American scholar
of African-American music

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.450
who is now retired from
Indiana University.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:10.750
And I thought, like, well,

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:15.020
I'm either in trouble
or -- I wasn't sure.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.320 position:56%
I thought I was probably in trouble.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.800
And she got up and she said,

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.630
"Everything she said
was true" [Laughs].

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.020
Kind of because I was calling --

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:28.440
so I felt like people had some
appreciation for what I was trying

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.860 position:56%
to do and felt that I was a voice
in the field and that I consistently

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:35.980
within the field advocated
for opening the doors

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.790
for more scholarship on
African-American music

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:45.350
and more African-American graduate
students then becoming professors.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:52.390
Students, I -- before I was hired
at Harvard, they asked me to come

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:59.680 position:56%
and be a visiting professor in 1999.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:04.750
And I came and I was in the middle
of writing <i>Freedom Sounds</i>.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:09.690
And so I did a little seminar
with our students on jazz

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:11.790
and the Civil Rights Movement.

01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:15.430
And it was a predominantly
African-American class.

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:21.340
And we just had the most lively
conversation, which included one

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.450
of the students coming to me, "What
are you doing as a white person,

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:29.170
you know, teaching this?"

01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:35.260
You know? And I remember writing
on the board, "Black power --

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.710
what is it, how are
you going to get it?"

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.220
And really having a
discussion about it.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.870
And we had lively conversations.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:51.220 position:56%
And any time in a class where I feel
like the students get to know me,

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:54.550
I feel like we can try
to find common ground.

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:57.790
But that doesn't mean
everybody's happy.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:01.210
So I gave a talk one other time,
I happened to be on a panel

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:04.350
that had all white people on it and
I was talking about black music.

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:13.860
And an African-American scholar who
I didn't know at the time got up

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:18.630
and started saying, I don't know --
and I was talking about Miles Davis

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.460
and John Coltrane,
"You didn't mention

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.920
that they were African-American."

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.220
You know? I thought I was speaking
to an audience that, you know --

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.730
and kind of went off on me.

01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.880
And so I said, "Well, I'm sorry."

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.660
I've always taken a
humble thing, like,

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.440
I'm sorry I didn't
meet your expectations.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.620
And the next thing I
knew, Melanie Burnham

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.090
from Indiana University was
standing up and saying, "Well,

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:44.170
we appreciate what she does."

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:48.360
You know? So I've had both things.

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.530
You know? So I think it's a
completely normal reaction

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.040
to be totally suspicious.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.150
And lately my student -- you know,

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:01.690
so the last time I taught my
R&amp;B [inaudible] soul class,

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.210
I started out my first
lecture saying, you know,

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.930
"Some of you might be
wondering how I got

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:09.090
to be the Quincy Jones professor
of African-American music."

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:13.080
And I explained I was hired by an
African-American Studies Department

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.990
that included a lot
of African-Americans.

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:23.140 position:56%
And I said, "But nevertheless, at
this point in time it's feeling kind

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.670 position:56%
of awkward being up here
performing white authority [Laughs].

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:30.530
Being the white talking head."

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:35.680
And I said -- in this opening thing
I said, "Well, I want to assure

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.730
that I'm not Rachel Dole is all."

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.550
Okay? I don't remember,
you know, okay,

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.150
she's the one -- and
they cracked up.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:44.250
You know, she was the one
who pretended to be black

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:45.730
and claimed she was black.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:51.260
And I said, "I know I'm white and
that's a particular positionality."

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.890
And I think all of us -- and I try

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.280
to take account of
that positionality.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.860
And we'll have conversations
based on that.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.640
And, you know, I went over some.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.420
I think some people still, you
know, would rather have it taught

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.230
by an African-American faculty
member at this point in time.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.970
And I certainly think,
"Well, I'm not that far

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:20.390
from retirement kind of."

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.460 position:56%
But I also want my students to think

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.740
that we need all points
of view on this.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:34.030
And I think African-American
music infuses our entire culture.

01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:37.780
And when studied properly,

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.640 position:56%
I think it gives you an incredible
ethics lesson on the history of race

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.930
in America on issues of things
people say in stupid ways

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:55.590
about dancing, and partying,
and their stereotypes.

01:04:55.590 --> 01:05:00.600
And things come up in our
conversations in the sections

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.120
of this course in which people
put each other on the spot.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:10.250
And that spot of being put on the
spot and accounting for your point

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:13.490 position:56%
of view, I think, helps people grow.

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:15.570
It's not a thing to be avoided.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:21.390
I feel like I'm so happy that
I've been confronted on all sorts

01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:22.780
of things because I feel

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.170
like studying this stuff
has, you know, enriched me.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:31.580
It's made me a better person
by sort of suddenly going, "Oh,

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.280
I didn't think of it that way.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.430
And the next time this happens
I will think of it that way."

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.420
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: That's --
well, we have time for one more.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.200
Go ahead.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:51.370
&gt;&gt; Yes. You mentioned Max
Roach and jazz messenger.

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:56.590 position:56%
But anyway, you know, we as a
people are well familiar with drums.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.960
You know? We used to have --

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.170
in Africa ancestors had what
they called the talking drum,

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:06.470
communicating.

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:07.770
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Yes.

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:17.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we was, you know,
from Art Blakey, he went to Africa

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.820
and he stayed over there for
quite a while to learn some

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.610
of the rhythm of the ancestors.

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:25.910
So [inaudible].

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:30.870
&gt;&gt; Ingrid Monson: Well, I actually
wrote about Art Blakey and his trip

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:36.990
to Ghana, which was in about 1947.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:40.710
And he claimed in his
interviews that he didn't go

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:43.550
to study the drums, but I can't
believe he didn't play the drums

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:44.860
while he [inaudible].

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.320
And he said he was
interested in religion.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.630
But I think saying
that he was interested

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:54.680 position:56%
in religion was another way to say
he was also interested in the drums.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.090
And so I was fascinated
with Art Blakey.

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:07.840
I was fascinated that in 1953 he
did a record with Sabu Martinez,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.350
and he called it "Message
from Kenya."

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:15.980
And it was right at the time of
the Mau Mau stuff going on in Kenya

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.940
where the British were
killing people

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:26.690
and suppressing Mau Mau
resistance to colonial rule.

01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:34.930
Right at the time of the
independence of Ghana in 1957,

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:39.320
he does, what is it,
"Orgy in Rhythm."

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.680
It was, like, right at the time.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.550
And the independence of
Ghana was widely covered

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.920
in African-American
newspapers at the time.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:56.710
So I really viewed Art Blakey as
being really, really, you know,

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:59.600
ahead of in terms of thinking
about the role of the drum

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.960
and the many things
you could do with it.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.130 position:56%
So then I was baffled later in 1970,
he gives an interview and he says,

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.470
"Our music has nothing
to do with Africa."

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:12.220 position:56%
And I asked Randy Weston about that.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:16.740
And Randy kind of said,
"It's in the music.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.610
Don't pay any attention
to what he said about it.

01:08:20.610 --> 01:08:23.500
You can hear it in the music."

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.420
So yeah, I think people were
deeply interested in trying

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.900
to learn as much as they could.

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:33.020
And it was harder to do that then.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:36.040
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Did we
have any last questions?

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.390
If not, I want to close
