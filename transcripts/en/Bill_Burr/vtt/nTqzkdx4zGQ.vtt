1
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.590
Like a boss

2
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.971
<v 0>you know,</v>

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.600
maybe some of you have those traditional lists where you can't wear white after

5
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.500
Labor Day.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.280
Well tell it to that whore that was on that thing last night. That fucking, uh,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.680
doesn't show videos anymore. Um,

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.340
I am of course talking about the, uh, the MTV music awards, which, uh,

9
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:33.930
I gotta be honest with you. I didn't even know that they were on, I had no idea.

10
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.350
My wife, uh, knew and she put them on.

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.260
And um, I remember one point they was in the background, they were showing the,

12
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.860
the old MTV logo and it was changing all colors and stuff. And I just,

13
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.260
I always get sad when I see it. Like, what happened?

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.320
What happened and where the fuck did they get off?

15
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.140
And I know I'm 1000000th person to say this,

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:59.490
but where the fuck did they get off? Why do they have a video?

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.060
Um, music awards when they don't show any music videos,

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.970
you know what I mean to, why do I have a, I don't know, to,

19
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.520
what do I host a fucking show about not being a con?

20
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.000
It would be just as hypocritical. Right? By the way,

21
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.100
could that chick be trying any fucking harder?

22
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.430
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.340
<v 0>good Lord. We get it.</v>

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.700
Those dumb ass outfits,

25
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.380
you know every fucking outfit looking like he going to go fuck captain Kirk.

26
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.120
It's so funny. I go back and look,

27
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:50.900
look at some of the truly shocking shit that people did way back. I thought,

28
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:55.460
you know, fucking freaked me out a long time ago was Marilyn Manson.

29
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:59.150
The first time that guy came out and he sang the beautiful people and he was,

30
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.340
I don't know what the fuck he was wearing. It was something,

31
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.850
I think it was that thing that women wore back in the day when they tried to

32
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.700
make their waists really small. Is that a corset?

33
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.540
He had that in like his fucking awful ass hanging out

34
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.400
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

35
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.820
<v 0>and he had like these contact lenses that made them look like a husky.</v>

36
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.330
<v 0>That was just like, what the fuck is that? You know,</v>

38
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.140
running around out there like jail bait with the fucking tongue hanging out and

39
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:41.160
now you'll legal and

40
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.610
<v 1>that's what it's about. A number that I taught you that</v>

41
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.790
<v 0>I was in the other room. Right. And uh, you know,</v>

42
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.260
my wife has some family in town,

43
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:56.180
so she and some of the ladies were in there watching it. And uh,

44
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.420
so the fucking, uh, Captain Kirk's one night stand there.

45
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.970
What the fuck is in there? I want to keep saying lady Gaga. I know.

46
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.720
It's not that it's not Taylor swift. It's two out of three though.

47
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.690
Um, Miley Cyrus, Miley Cyrus.

48
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.360
So she's in there singing this fucking song over and over again about how she

49
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.370
doesn't give a fuck at [inaudible].

50
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.820
<v 2>Yeah, please.</v>

51
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.200
<v 0>I felt bad for her. You know what I mean? Cause you know,</v>

52
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.750
with the music game it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.751
Popular for awhile and then it just fucking starts to go down and then maybe you

54
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:48.190
get one more hit and then you fucking finished.

55
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.980
And then for the rest of your life you got to sing those songs.

56
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.980
Say guys just saw, yeah, the piano mad. Say Guys saw tonight.

57
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.770
What do you think Billy Joel drink so much.

58
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.910
He's got to sing the same fucking 20 songs for 40 years.

59
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.023
<v 2>This is</v>

60
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.150
[inaudible]

61
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.150
<v 0>the fact that that man is still standing is a testament to his inner strength in</v>

62
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:32.390
this poor woman,

63
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.610
Miley Cyrus is going to have to sing about how she doesn't give a fuck when

64
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.820
she's in her fifties and sixties. You know what I mean?

65
00:04:40.821 --> 00:04:45.080
And she's painted herself into a corner wearing those star trek outfits.

66
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.520
I didn't rush. No, she hasn't. Gee, if I was her manager, I say, listen,

67
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.770
at some point you got to put your tongue away and put some God damn clothes on.

68
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.500
Or, uh, you know, I'm,

69
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.830
I'm gonna leave right around when you're about 32 33 cause I'm not going to

70
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:07.690
watch this fucking train wreck. She's going to be 60 years old going, yes,

71
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:11.600
smoke weed. I don't give a fuck. Right.

72
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.840
Fucking jelly rolls hanging out of that fucking outfit. Um,

73
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.020
<v 3>let us not forget the time you wanted to post a photo of your delicious corn</v>

74
00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:26.510
dinner. Do you remember what we told you then, Milan,

75
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.350

76
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.810
10 we told you to blow your corn dinner or geniuses.
