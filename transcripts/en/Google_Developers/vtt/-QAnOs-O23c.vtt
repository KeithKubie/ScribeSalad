00:00:01.164 --> 00:00:03.330
SPEAKER 1: I'm Amrit Sanjeev
for the Developer Show.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.455
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:07.320
news from Google.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.550
The final API 28 Emulator image
for Wear OS is now available.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.960
Highlights of API 28 include
a new notification stream,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.859
App Standby Buckets, and more.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.900
Take a look at the post
linked in the description

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.800
below for the details
and to get started.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.760
Access to traditional apps with
secure LDAP from cloud identity

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.410
is now generally available.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.690
Lots of details and link to
get started are on the post.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.870
The Associate Cloud
Engineer certification

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.540
helps organizations
identify individuals

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.250
who can demonstrate
a solid working

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.160
knowledge of Google Cloud
products and technologies.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.290
And it's now
available in German.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.330
To learn more about the
certification and to get

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.460
started, check out the post.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.170
We recently collaborated
with Microchip

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.470
on the AVR-IoT WG
development board.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.810
It is the first 8-bit
microcontroller development

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.150
board connected to the
Google Cloud platform.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.980
It will help lower
the barrier to entry

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.440
to develop IoT solutions across
cost, security, and float

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.600
connectivity.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
Details and a photo of
the board are on the post.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.280
In Firebase
Performance Monitoring,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.620
you can now dig deeper into an
individual session of a trace.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.040
This will allow you to see
attributes and events that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.200
happened leading to
a performance issue.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.330
Head over to the post for
the three new categories

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.280
of information and
some screenshots.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.400
Also in Firebase is a redesign
notification dashboard

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.820
which supports much more
sophisticated and powerful

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.260
notification campaigns.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.060
More details and
screenshots are in the post.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.332

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.474
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:38.230
OK?

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.330
Good?
