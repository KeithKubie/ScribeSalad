00:00:20.372 --> 00:00:22.580
J. KIM VANDIVER: We're
waiting for people to come in.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.496
And what are the important
concepts this week?

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:27.270
There's only the one lecture,
and the lecture yesterday

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.180
was pretty dense in concepts.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.290
Let's build a quick list here.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.130
Who's got the first offering?

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.371
AUDIENCE: Rotational
dynamics of rigid bodies.

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.620
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK, that
was a general overall topic,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.095
so how about a concept though.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:49.350
AUDIENCE: The mass
moment of inertia matrix.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.630
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK, yep,
we introduced the concept

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.984
of the mass moment
of inertia matrix.

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.150
And I'll give it a context,
so you can, for example,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.310
write H as I times omega.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.930
So we introduced that,
didn't get very far with it.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.468
Another one from yesterday?

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.926
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure if this fits

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:12.960
but talking about
how the body can

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.210
be rotating around the point
opposite the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.251
J. KIM VANDIVER: Ah yeah.

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:21.170
Yep So we talked about rotation.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.850
The subject yesterday was
really rigid body rotation

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:47.420
about fixed point
on or off the body.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.550
So here's our axis of rotation.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.800
Call it A. And it's spinning
about that point at some omega.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
But that point A could
be over here too.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.100
And then the whole
body is just going,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.150
so an example of
rigid body rotation

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.830
about a point not on the body
would be something doing that.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.670
OK, something else.

00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:32.996
AUDIENCE: The angler
velocity [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:33.870
J. KIM VANDIVER: Yes.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:44.990
Yeah, what does it means when
H and omega may not align?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.660
What's that mean?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.215
So we got into that
a bit yesterday.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.880
And anything else
that struck you?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.560
OK, well that's a good start.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.920
Let's just work with that.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.900
Now I will do that second.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.700
We're going to come
work a little bit,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.950
talking about this
system in those contexts.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.220
Before I do that, I
want to-- the staff

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.360
decided we hadn't done something
in lecture yet very carefully

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.430
so we wanted to do it once
carefully within recitation.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.050
And that's a methodical way
of doing free body diagrams.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.770
So we have a system, two
masses, springs, dashpots.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.940
In the last class,
there were a few people

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.820
who didn't know really what we
meant by k's and c's and how

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.360
they work.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
So I will give you
a quick definition.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.420
So here we have a spring.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.090
And these are called linear
springs, so Hooke's law.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.420
If you cause that
spring to move,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.220
and I'll call it here the
plus x direction-- you grab it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.530
and you pull on it-- you
have to apply a force.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.560
So the force to pull that
spring is positive kx

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.589
in the same direction as x.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.960
But if that spring's
attached to a mass what

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.790
direction is the force that
the spring applies on the mass?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.910
So I've given you a hint here.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.000
It pulls back, right?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.200
Because this is
Newton's third law.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.860
So we are doing
free body diagrams,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
and we're concerned with
forces on the rigid bodies.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.390
So, this spring, if
this mass went that way,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.240
the spring would pull this way.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.930
And we indicated the direction
with an arrow and its value

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.220
as a kx.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.120
Dashpots are similar.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.400
Except dashpots are
activated by velocity.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.940
So this is a linear
dashpot, such that it

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.830
has a dashpot constant c.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.000
And if I give this a
positive value of velocity,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.966
the force required to pull
that dashpot is cx dot.

00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:16.310
It's linearly proportional.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.160
Velocity and the force that
if it were attached to a mass

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.180
that the dashpot
puts on the mass

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.790
would be opposite
direction but same value,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.450
cx dot, but is
resisting the motion.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.490
OK.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.100
So I'm going to just
give you general method

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.430
for doing free body diagrams.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.220
And the reason we
choose this problem is

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.150
there's two bodies,
and depending on which

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.210
is doing what, this
intermediate spring in here

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.185
particularly can push
or pull on either body

00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:52.170
and having a method so you
don't mess up the signs

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.100
is what this is all about.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.680
So let's just start by
building a free body

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.770
diagram of mass one.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.920
And the assignment I'm going
to give you to work on,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.730
just seat work
here for a minute,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.780
is only consider
the springs for now.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.800
We'll just deal
with the springs.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.500
So assume the system is moving.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.700
You have to do free
body diagrams of it.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.830
Put the spring forces on
the mass in your free body

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.330
diagrams.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.880
So spend a minute or so.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.340
Talk to your neighbors after
you get a little ways along

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.890
with it.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.330
And I'm going to
add-- there's also

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.510
on this whole system external
force F1, external force F2.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.320
That's your excitation.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.550
But don't worry
about that for now.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.830
Just figure out the spring
forces, and I'll be quiet.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.180
I missed a step, my apologies.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.610
We should do
something else first.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.400
The very first step is to
assign the coordinates.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.410
Let's all agree on the
coordinate system here.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.685
So the question really
is the first thing

00:07:09.685 --> 00:07:12.060
you have to do is you have to
decide how many independent

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.000
coordinates you need to
completely describe the motion.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.500
So how many coordinates
do you think

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.320
are needed for this problem?

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.410
I see a one.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.770
AUDIENCE: I was just--

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.560
J. KIM VANDIVER:
That's a second one.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120
Anybody else have a suggestion?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.784
So where would you put the one?

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:31.780
AUDIENCE: The x term.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.556
J. KIM VANDIVER: And measuring
the displacement of mass one?

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:37.180
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.150
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.460
And is that all we need?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.529
Anybody have a further--

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, there's a
displacement at mass two.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.486
J. KIM VANDIVER: And
it's independence, right?

00:07:47.486 --> 00:07:49.270
They can move-- how
many coordinates now

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.450
do you think you need?

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.990
Uh oh.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.200
She changed her mind to two.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.040
And I've got them labeled
up here for you already.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.495
So it's going to take two.

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:00.120
And one of the ways
you can test if you

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.590
have the right number, if you
think it's one, assign it.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.000
Freeze it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.660
Is there still
independent movement

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.780
of a part of the system?

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.140
If there is, you have yet
another degree of freedom.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.780
If we freeze both x1
and x2, and can anything

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.680
move in the system?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.180
Nope.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.640
So we've got it nailed down.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.310
All right.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.730
But where do you measure?

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.420
There is something else
you have to determine.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.270
And that is, where
do you make zero?

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.610
You also have to know that.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.049
So where is x is
0 in your picture?

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.860
We'll just talk about
both of them, x1 and x2.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.730
How would you pick the 0 point?

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.682
Christina?

00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:45.182
AUDIENCE: Probably
when the spring's

00:08:45.182 --> 00:08:48.659
at equilibrium so when it's not
exerting force. [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:50.950
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK, she says
when there's not exerting

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.033
force in either direction.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:54.815
I would call that the
static equilibrium position.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.270
There is a conceptual
problem with that.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.550
We'll assume that that
will work if you've

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.990
set the system up
so that there's

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.280
no forces in the springs.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.460
But you know, if I move
this wall in a little bit

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.910
and let it reach
static equilibrium,

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.940
it has a static
equilibrium position.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.210
All the springs
have forces in them.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.810
Now, you pre-compress them.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.894
So there's kind
of a problem-- you

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.810
could run into a conceptual
problem with that.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.130
It will still work.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.760
Picking a static
equilibrium position

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.331
is a good thing to do usually.

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:29.830
OK.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.340
There are other positions.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.740
For example, this system,
it's a simpler system, just

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.620
an ordinary little mass spring.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.870
But where do you make zero
when you pick your coordinate?

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.870
AUDIENCE: In this case,
you could zero it out

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.555
at the rest length of the
spring plus the length

00:09:52.555 --> 00:09:54.930
of this spring as a result
of the force of gravity.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.430
J. KIM VANDIVER:
So right now you're

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.290
seeing the static
equilibrium position.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.750
The spring has tension in it,
the weight of the mass, right?

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.120
So you could either
make x right here.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.564
Or the other obvious
choice would be?

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:07.980
AUDIENCE: Where
you're holding it.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.656
AUDIENCE: You're holding it.

00:10:10.656 --> 00:10:12.280
J. KIM VANDIVER: I
heard a couple voice

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.155
but I couldn't
hear what you said.

00:10:13.155 --> 00:10:14.730
AUDIENCE: Where
you're holding it?

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.440
J. KIM VANDIVER: Well,
yeah, but it turns out

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.899
that actually is
a terrible choice.

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:20.440
Because then you
have to get involved

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.729
with the length of the spring.

00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:23.270
And the length of
the spring actually

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.870
really doesn't enter into
the equation in motion

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.230
unless you're really
silly about where

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.976
you pick the measure from.

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:32.850
Static equilibrium is
good, but the other one

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.800
is the zero spring
force position

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.150
is the other natural one to do.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.560
So at zero spring force, that's
no extension of the spring.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.400
Because this is preloaded when
you do this, and have to figure

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.250
out what that does to you.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.860
OK.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.093
Again, static equilibrium has
some real advantages here,

00:10:52.093 --> 00:10:53.426
but we'll talk about that later.

00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:54.120
Yeah?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.526
AUDIENCE: So why does
zero spring force

00:10:56.526 --> 00:10:57.847
work there but not--

00:10:57.847 --> 00:11:00.430
J. KIM VANDIVER: I'm just saying
there are actually situations

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.320
where there is no zero force.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.860
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.930
J. KIM VANDIVER: And you have a
conception-- if you hadn't ever

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.300
thought of that before, that
could give you pause when

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.090
you go to solve the problem.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.210
The springs are preloaded.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.380
Are your equations
of motion valid?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.880
So you preloaded
this a little bit,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.302
squeezed it in, this system
has natural frequencies, right?

00:11:29.302 --> 00:11:30.260
Do you agree with that?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.400
It's very similar to this
system except it's just now--

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.500
it doesn't happen to
have a third spring

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.627
and have gravity involved.

00:11:38.627 --> 00:11:40.460
But this system has two
natural frequencies,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.660
that one and one that's
a little harder for me

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.440
to do but that one.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.730
So if I've preloaded
this a little bit,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:57.000
squeezed it in some, would the
natural frequencies change?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.800
Yes-- how many think yes?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.550
Get your hands up.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.050
Come on.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.310
You're gamblers.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.590
How many think yes?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.560
How many think no?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.790
How many just don't want
to raise their hand?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.670
[LAUGHS] Like you.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.460
OK.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.980
The natural frequency
doesn't change.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.060
It turns out to
preload doesn't matter

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.350
in a linear system like this.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.360
So there's some nuances in here.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.810
A simple system like this
has some little traps in it.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.590
It will take them time to
learn your way through.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.760
But let's keep it simple.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.292
No preload, the static
equilibrium position,

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:36.640
draw the free body diagram
for mass one, springs only.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.542
Only deal with the springs.

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.500
Take a couple minutes
and talk to your neighbor

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.180
if you need to.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.620
OK, so I won't come look
at each of your things.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.020
I want to have different
groups kind of-- they

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.440
should take one force at a time.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.480
So you guys, give me a force
on this mass, due to a spring.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.094
Give me a spring force and
tell me what direction it's in.

00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:02.864
AUDIENCE: I guess
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:04.780
J. KIM VANDIVER: So tell
me which spring we're

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.868
talking about.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.850
AUDIENCE: So
[? I didn't hear. ?] So is this

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.140
being impressed, like
are these springs?

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.840
J. KIM VANDIVER: No, this is
static equilibrium position.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.090
But now if you give it initial
[INAUDIBLE] and let go,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.900
it's going to sit
there and do something.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.950
We're trying to derive
the equations of motion.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.170
And to do so, we have to start
with a free body diagram.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.990
So it's moving, and
there are forces

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.400
on it caused by
springs and by dashpots

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.684
and by the external forces.

00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:30.100
So right now, we're going to
be free body diagram but only

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.050
the components
through the spring.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.900
Springs.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.870
So tell me what happens.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:42.150
What does that spring--
how does this spring appear

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.661
on that free body diagram.

00:13:44.661 --> 00:13:47.487
AUDIENCE: [? I have an idea. ?]
[INAUDIBLE] it's air force

00:13:47.487 --> 00:13:49.380
is 11 [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.976
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK, force of.

00:13:50.976 --> 00:13:52.760
AUDIENCE: Force of
the spring on the--

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.988
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Which direction?

00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:58.429
AUDIENCE: Left. [LAUGHS] I don't
understand how you know which--

00:13:58.429 --> 00:13:59.970
J. KIM VANDIVER:
OK, well that's kind

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.178
of the point of the exercise.

00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:04.020
And I expect many of you to
have some confusion about what

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.420
direction to go because you
don't have a standard method

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.580
by which you approach this.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.664
AUDIENCE: So both springs
and cause of force

00:14:11.664 --> 00:14:14.580
goes in the direction
of the displacement.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.140
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK, so what's
the displacement, though?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.184
This system has two
possible displacements.

00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:21.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.487
We're assuming m1 is going in
the positive x1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.487 --> 00:14:27.320
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.560
So if you said if you
move it a positive x1,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.360
then you will get
a spring force.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.679
Spring one does what?

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.470
AUDIENCE: It would
oppose the [? spring. ?]

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.790
J. KIM VANDIVER: Opposes,
and what's it value?

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.764
AUDIENCE: k1x.

00:14:39.764 --> 00:14:40.680
J. KIM VANDIVER: k1x1.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.130
So that's what a
motion x1 causes--

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.980
that's a result with spring one.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.920
What's the result of spring
two if you have motion x1?

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.970
AUDIENCE: Same.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.803
There's going to be
compression force that's

00:14:58.803 --> 00:15:00.660
also opposing displacement.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.390
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Right, because it's

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.848
trying to squeeze
that spring down,

00:15:02.848 --> 00:15:04.130
and it's pushing back, right?

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:11.000
But you're also going to
get a spring k2x1, right?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.230
Now are there any
other forces that

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.820
result from the motion of
that body in the springs?

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.882
Just spring forces now.

00:15:18.882 --> 00:15:20.340
AUDIENCE: From that
body by itself?

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.350
J. KIM VANDIVER: Yeah,
that body by itself.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.970
No.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.520
But is that all
the spring forces?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.600
No.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.552
So now what if you
let body two move?

00:15:31.552 --> 00:15:34.010
And now I'm going to give you
a little rubric, a little way

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.718
to go about this.

00:15:34.718 --> 00:15:36.610
We start by assigning
our coordinates.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:58.830
Then you specify positive x1, x1
dot, x2, x2 dot, one at a time.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:16.040
And from that, you deduce
the direction of love

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.080
the forces, of the
resulting forces.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.740
OK.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.590
So if what we've done
there is consistent

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.970
with it, a positive value of
x1, spring one pulls back k1x1,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.650
spring two pushes
back k1x1, then

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.710
that's the end of
spring forces due to x1.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.390
So now just let's say, OK,
let x1 be 0 for a moment.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.240
And now let there
be a positive x2.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.670
Does that cause any
spring force on mass one?

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:53.982
What do you think?

00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:57.250
AUDIENCE: We're going to
pull mass one [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.350
J. KIM VANDIVER: That
one-- a positive x2

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.379
puts tension in the spring and
it pulls it in that direction.

00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:03.795
So now you're going
to get a k2x2.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.500
Any other spring forces
caused by motion of two?

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.810
It's the only connecting spring.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.350
So those are the spring
forces on mass one.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.770
Now let's move on
to dashpot forces.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.859
And you do exactly
the same thing.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.920
Assume a positive
value of x1 dot.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.630
What does it cause
in dashpot forces?

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:39.150
What's the first dashpot do
when you pull positive x1 dot

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.050
in that direction?

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.956
Resist or not?

00:17:42.956 --> 00:17:44.210
AUDIENCE: Resist.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.200
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Dashpots resist.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.960
So it's going to be in the minus
direction and a value-- how

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.480
big?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.260
AUDIENCE: c1 and [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.750
J. KIM VANDIVER: So now you
get dashpot forces, c1x1 dot.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.166
And how about the c2 dashpot?

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:03.150
AUDIENCE: Same thing.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:10.370
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Same thing. c2x1 dot.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.980
OK.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.270
And that's the only
dashpot forces caused

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.320
by a velocity of mass one.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.346
So now let that be 0 and cause
velocity at the other places

00:18:22.346 --> 00:18:23.720
and find out if
anything happens.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.110
So now let x2 dot be positive.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.816
What do we put on
free body diagram?

00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:33.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.900
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Going which direction?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.940
Positive, and what value?

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.205
AUDIENCE: c2x2 dot.

00:18:39.205 --> 00:18:40.570
J. KIM VANDIVER: All right.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.450
And is our free body
diagram complete?

00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:46.940
AUDIENCE: mg.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.440
J. KIM VANDIVER: Oh, yeah.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.444
And?

00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:51.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:51.716 --> 00:18:53.736
J. KIM VANDIVER: Yeah, and?

00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:56.634
AUDIENCE: The forces,
the external forces.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.250
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Now it's complete.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.540
All the forces in
the system, it's

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.020
constrained in this direction.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.490
So we just know N equals mg.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.654
There's no motion allowed,
so we get no equation

00:19:11.654 --> 00:19:12.820
of motion in that direction.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.300
We're going to get one equation
of motion for this mass

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.950
and one more equation of
motion for the second.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.450
The number of
equation of motions

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.750
equal the number of
independent coordinates.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.040
And we found two
independent coordinates.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.010
We get two equations of motion.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.920
So take this and write
down the equation of motion

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.340
for mass one.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:36.910
Sort it out.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.932
Yeah, Betsy?

00:19:37.932 --> 00:19:40.342
AUDIENCE: So I'm really
confused by why c2 [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:40.342 --> 00:19:43.234
in that direction,
because so [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:43.234 --> 00:19:45.644
They oppose like the
springs that [? felt ?]

00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:48.117
[? the closest ?] [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:48.950
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.480
So let's see if we
can do something here.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.320
So, this is second mass.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.665
This is the first mass.

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:02.540
Actually, here's the
wall and the first mass.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.880
So x1 is in that direction.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.410
If I pull that way, the
spring pulls back on the mass.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.160
That's obvious to you, right?

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.520
And on the other side,
if this is mass one now

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.560
and you have a second
spring over here,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.240
a second mass over here and
a spring in between them,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.410
if you put a positive
motion of mass one,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.170
this spring pushes back.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.940
So that counts for the
minus direction of k2x1.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.060
Then if the second mass moves
in that direction-- here,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.590
you move it.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.340
You're the second mass.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.140
Is there tension in this?

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.370
Am I pulling back to
resist you are or not?

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.630
What is this spring
doing to my hand?

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.379
It's pulling that
way on it, k2x2.

00:20:49.379 --> 00:20:49.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:53.907 --> 00:20:54.740
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.720
So that's our free body diagram.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.260
Write right out an equation
of motion for that system.

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.235
I'll give you a little reminder.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.910
That's how you ought
to begin, right?

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.955
And if you're done, do the
same thing for the second mass

00:21:41.955 --> 00:21:43.875
while the others are
working on the first one.

00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:46.720
Draw a free body
diagram of mass two

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.530
and write down the
equation of motion.

00:21:55.151 --> 00:21:57.060
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
that be x2 dot?

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.185
J. KIM VANDIVER: Which one?

00:21:58.185 --> 00:21:59.980
AUDIENCE: The bottom
left, c2x2 dot.

00:22:04.011 --> 00:22:06.010
J. KIM VANDIVER: All
right, so let's build this.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.560
I'm just going to
talk through it

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.050
rather than have you
help me build this.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.760
The sum of the
external forces is

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.760
what all of the external forces
and only the external forces

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.450
should show up on that diagram.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.830
The mass times
the accelerations,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.454
the sum of the external forces--
so every arrow on that diagram

00:22:31.454 --> 00:22:33.840
ought to appear over
here in the direction

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.280
of whichever this equation is.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.450
So this is the
equation that has to do

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.230
with the motion of mass one.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.800
And I look over here,
and I see, OK, I'm

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.970
just going to go top to
bottom, minus k1x1 minus k2x1--

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.370
and the minuses are
coming from the directions

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:58.050
of the arrows-- minus c1x1 dot.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:12.350
And then I have plus k2x2
plus c2x2 dot plus F1.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.474
AUDIENCE: And a minus c1x1.

00:23:13.474 --> 00:23:14.377
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:14.377 --> 00:23:15.710
J. KIM VANDIVER: Did I miss one?

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.520
Oh, I missed the c-- I
missed this guy, right?

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.490
Minus c2x1 dot.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.590
OK.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.720
So the arrows tell me the signs.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.280
And all the forces are there.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.020
They just all add up
over here on this side.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.440
And I've gone ahead
and drawn what

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.600
I think is the right
thing for mass two.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.380
But you do the same system.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.210
You go to mass two and
you say, OK, positive

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.997
deflection of mass one.

00:23:47.997 --> 00:23:49.580
What is the spring
force that results?

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.310
Well, it pushes on it,
positive velocity of mass one.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.510
This dashpot pushes on it.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.620
Positive deflection of mass
two-- two springs push back.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.970
Positive velocity of mass
two-- one dashpot resists.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.990
And you have an external force.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.110
And you could write
this one down.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.250
You just add up
all those forces.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.130
And now you have
a second equation,

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:19.380
m2x2 double dot equals
a you add it up.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.250
OK.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.930
So I want to do one other thing.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.430
I'm going to ask you a question,
get you to raise your hand.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.810
I want everybody to try
to raise their hands, OK?

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.580
Assume that I had written
out that second equation.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.080
Actually, let me
take one more step.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.410
Normally what we
would do is to rewrite

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.090
this in sort of a standard
form is to move all the motion

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.970
variables to one side and all
the actual exciting forces

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:46.600
to the other.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:54.300
And so we'd say,
m1x1 double dot plus,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.080
and then normally you put
in the x dot terms next.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:16.810
So we have a c1 plus c2 x1
dot minus c2x2 dot plus-- now

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:29.170
I get my k terms-- k1 plus
k2 x1 minus k2x2 equals F1.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.370
And that's kind of
standard form now.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.957
I get a second equation
from the second one

00:25:34.957 --> 00:25:36.040
that would look like that.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:41.170
Now once you get it in
this sort of standard form,

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:45.550
can you remember how, if you've
even ever had linear algebra,

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.975
write this in matrix form?

00:25:51.052 --> 00:25:52.950
AUDIENCE: It would
be [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.580
J. KIM VANDIVER:
So how many of you

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.080
feel comfortable that you could
just sit down and write this

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.040
out in matrix form?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:58.890
Go on.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.860
And how many of you think it
might be a bit of a challenge?

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.232
OK.

00:26:04.232 --> 00:26:05.940
How many of you would
like me to show you

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.476
what it looks like in matrix
form and give you the answer?

00:26:08.476 --> 00:26:09.100
So most of you.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.660
OK, I'll take the
time to do that.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.830
Actually, did I
write it out already?

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.100
Ooh, look at that.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.510
Bing!

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.436
Ding, ding, ding!

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.300
All you need to know in
this course about vectors

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:38.090
and matrices is how to multiply
a vector times a matrix.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.040
So here's an
acceleration vector.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.730
Here's the mass matrix.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.820
And you take these two
elements, my two fingers here,

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.680
and multiplying by those--
you go like this to that.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:57.330
So x1 double dot times m1 double
dot gives you this term, right?

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.115
And you get no m2x2 double
dot, because there's

00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:04.930
a 0 in the matrix in
that second position.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.200
So you get no x2
double dot term.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.110
And that's correct.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.750
Same thing with the--
here's the x2, x1.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.060
Here's this damping matrix.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.750
This is the stiffness matrix.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.930
And so if you just
did these multiplies,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.110
you'd get back two equations,
the ones we just derived.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.260
So you need to know how
to do this kind of thing

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:31.030
because we write that
h equals I omega.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.090
And our omega has three
components, omega x, omega y,

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.180
and omega z.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.320
And you need to be able
to do that manipulation.

00:27:40.522 --> 00:27:42.480
All right, we've got a
little bit of time left.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.780
I wanted to do one
little exercise that

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.420
had to do more with
this sort of thing,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.290
to kind of reinforce a
bit what we did yesterday.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.620
And that would be-- so any
final questions about this?

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.346
Yeah?

00:27:56.346 --> 00:27:58.626
AUDIENCE: So setting
that up looks OK.

00:27:58.626 --> 00:27:59.540
But solving it.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.456
J. KIM VANDIVER: Oh, solving it?

00:28:02.456 --> 00:28:04.330
I used to teach-- I
taught for about 20 years

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:05.860
a course called
Mechanical Vibration.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.460
I just don't have time
to teach it anymore.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.850
And that's what you do in there.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.660
Oh, in 803 you do
a little bit of it.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.680
So this system has two
degrees of freedom.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.700
It has two natural frequencies,
two mode shapes to go with it.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.850
So the system vibrates.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.950
And it's not real
hard to solve, but you

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:27.910
would assume for
initially, if you

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:29.570
want to know
natural frequencies,

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.510
you set the forces to 0.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.170
You set the damping
to 0 initially.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.600
And you just assume a
solution of the form

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:51.850
that x1 of t and x2 of t equals
some unknown constants, cosine

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:52.760
omega t.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.130
Just plug it in.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.340
You just plug that in.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.200
You'll end up with an
algebraic equation.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.372
And the algebraic equation
actually has eigenvalues.

00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:04.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.090
J. KIM VANDIVER: And you
find the two eigenvalues,

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.260
and they're the two
natural frequencies.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.760
All right.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.170
I want to do something
with angular stuff.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.130
So here's my system
that we were playing

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.210
with at the beginning of class.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.130
And in this form, it's
nice and balanced.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.790
So this is just to
reinforce a couple things

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.540
that I was just beginning
to teach you yesterday.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.120
This is a rigid body.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.440
It's rotating.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.430
I attach to it a rotating frame.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.720
At a in the x
direction is y and z.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.390
So y's into the board.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:51.130
And that frame rotates
with my system.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.640
And the rotation rate
of this system is omega,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.090
and it's k in the
rotating system, which

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.550
happens to line up with big
K with the stationary system.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.100
But this is my omega vector.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:09.300
Here is 0, 0 omega.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.910
This is the z component
of the rotation.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:20.820
Now, let's first
start with this.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.960
What is P1, [? an 0, ?]
the linear momentum

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:30.970
of that mass in the system?

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.910
And you've done this
probably a lot of times.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.630
So what direction's it in?

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.852
Momentum is mv, right?

00:30:38.852 --> 00:30:40.310
So what's the
velocity of the mass?

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:45.580
AUDIENCE: It's rotating.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.748
J. KIM VANDIVER: It's caused
by rotation and only rotation.

00:30:48.748 --> 00:30:51.120
AUDIENCE: So it could be
the [? c hat ?] direction.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.620
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.135
J. KIM VANDIVER: No, P,
just P. Linear momentum.

00:30:54.135 --> 00:30:56.551
AUDIENCE: That P itself--
linear because it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:59.076 --> 00:31:01.200
J. KIM VANDIVER: And it's
got to [? an 0, ?] right?

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.410
I mean, reference
to the 0 frame.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:09.230
But it can use unit
vectors in the A frame.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.150
So what's v1?

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.470
AUDIENCE: j hat.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.200
J. KIM VANDIVER: j
hat, and how big?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.587
AUDIENCE: Omega.

00:31:17.587 --> 00:31:19.420
J. KIM VANDIVER: I hear
an omega times what?

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:29.040
So this is system-- I'm
going to call this position,

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.080
this is x1z1.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.350
This coordinate is x1z1.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.820
So if I give you
that information,

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.832
what's the velocity
of that point?

00:31:36.832 --> 00:31:37.796
AUDIENCE: Omega x.

00:31:37.796 --> 00:31:38.760
AUDIENCE: x.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.146
J. KIM VANDIVER: Omega x1--

00:31:42.146 --> 00:31:43.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, j hat.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.048
J. KIM VANDIVER: j hat.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.719
It's into the board, the way
it's spinning into the board.

00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:59.260
Yeah, ought to be
in the j direction.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.570
Yeah, it ought to be
an r omega, and it

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.650
has an m associated with it.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:05.150
What's P2?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.640
AUDIENCE: In the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.140
AUDIENCE: Negative [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.275
J. KIM VANDIVER: It's coming
out of the board at you.

00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:16.146
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:19.122
Negative m2 omega xj.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.050
J. KIM VANDIVER: Right?

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.190
OK.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.910
And those little j's-- the
j hats are in the rotating

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.570
coordinate system
where I want them.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.430
So what's H1?

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:47.110
It's r1 with respect to what?

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.880
So you can't do angular
momentum without picking a--?

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.010
You've got to pick the point.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.390
So this is why we choose the
coordinates on the reference

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.550
frame that we're going to use
to give us some information

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.177
that we want.

00:33:01.177 --> 00:33:03.010
I want to know the
torques about this point.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.750
So I'm going to put my A here.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.610
I could have put it any place,
as long as the axis of rotation

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.860
passed through it.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:20.510
So this one is r1 with
respect to A cross P1.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:24.055
So what is r1 in this system?

00:33:24.055 --> 00:33:24.596
AUDIENCE: x1.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.040
J. KIM VANDIVER: x1i--

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.740
AUDIENCE: Plus z--

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:41.040
J. KIM VANDIVER: 1k
cross with m1 omega x1 j.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.595
All right?

00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:44.640
Let's work that one out.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.990
So we have an i times a j.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:34:01.540
And so I get an m1x1
squared omega k.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.420
And then I do this
term times that.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:09.969
I get a k cross j minus i.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:21.665
And I get m1x1z1 omega i hat.

00:34:21.665 --> 00:34:22.165
All right.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:32.679
Technically this is my
little h, this is little h2.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:42.279
And if I let m1 equal m2 here,
my total h for this system--

00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:47.022
AUDIENCE: Isn't that just--

00:34:47.022 --> 00:34:48.022
J. KIM VANDIVER: Pardon?

00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:50.293
AUDIENCE: This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:50.918
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:50.918 --> 00:34:51.892
AUDIENCE: The second minus--

00:34:51.892 --> 00:34:53.360
AUDIENCE: The second
minus is still h1.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.235
J. KIM VANDIVER: Oh,
whoops, how'd I do that?

00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:57.350
Yeah, I hadn't
moved on to h2 yet.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.580
Sorry about that.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.620
This is still h1.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.900
OK.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.820
And it's that.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.230
So what's h2?

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.052
How's it differ?

00:35:09.052 --> 00:35:10.010
Just kind of look here.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.360
It only differs in one respect.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.360
AUDIENCE: Negative sign?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.510
J. KIM VANDIVER: Yeah, you get
a minus-- a negative x here

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:23.400
when you go to carry
out the multiplication.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.560
So now the i cross
j term gives you a--

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.100
AUDIENCE: But isn't the P2
also have a negative under it.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.640
J. KIM VANDIVER: Yeah,
you're absolutely right.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.800
So you get-- you had
to put a minus x here.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.250
And you have to
multiply by this one.

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.870
So the i, j term, you have
a minus times a minus.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.010
i times j is a positive k.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:56.090
You end up with m2x1 squared
omega k, the same direction

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.240
of each component.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.642
Then what happens here?

00:35:58.642 --> 00:36:00.350
AUDIENCE: Comes from
a minus [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.590
J. KIM VANDIVER: OK.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:16.060
And so the second term, the i
term, is opposite direction.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.297
And if m1 equals m2 and you
added these two together,

00:36:18.297 --> 00:36:19.880
what happened to
those last two terms?

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.454
They cancel, right?

00:36:24.454 --> 00:36:27.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.230
OK, so if this is true,
the sum of these two,

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:40.710
H, with respect to A, is
just 2mx1 squared omega k.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.970
All right.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:49.380
So if you took-- in
the first system,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.890
if these two weren't equal
and they didn't cancel out,

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.640
if you go through
here and take dh dt,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.240
you take the time
derivative of these terms,

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.600
then you get an omega dot k.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.610
And over here you get
an omega dot term.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.640
And then you get a
di dt term, all that.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.310
But you will end up
with values of dh dt

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:14.805
that are not in the k direction.

00:37:14.805 --> 00:37:15.550
You agree?

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.640
For sure.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.350
And those are associated
with the real torques

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.170
in the system that happen.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:30.120
When this is true, that
difficult term out here

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.790
cancels out.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:34.540
And you're left only
with the k term.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.870
And when you take this time
derivative, you only get dh dt.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:41.920
You get a theta
dot or omega dot.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:48.160
And that says the torque
is in what direction when

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.880
you get just this for h?

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.680
What is the direction of dh dt?

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.680
It's still in k.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.620
So the torque is
aligned with the spin.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.830
h is aligned with the spin.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.720
They're all aligned.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.990
And the system is actually
beautifully balanced.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:11.660
You don't feel any torques
around where you're holding it

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:19.340
down here at A. But if I took
one of these off, kind of back

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.410
to that one arm system,
it's terribly unbalanced.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:31.870
So the moral of
the story here is

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.960
if I don't want to have
these unwanted torques,

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.560
what can you say
about the desired mass

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.355
distribution in the system?

00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:41.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:45.000
J. KIM VANDIVER: I hear
a vote for symmetry.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.310
And that's the general rule.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.870
If your masses are
distributed symmetrically

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:58.219
about the axis of spin,
no off axis torques.

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.219
AUDIENCE: And it's
[INAUDIBLE] mass [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:01.802
J. KIM VANDIVER:
Yeah, it's symmetric.

00:39:01.802 --> 00:39:03.910
Symmetry means they better
be the same size too,

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.070
not just in the same place.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.190
If one's twice as big
as the other, no go.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.420
If I put a second mass
on one of those arms,

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.360
the system is back
to being unbalanced.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:21.810
So any time this H vector,
the total H of the system,

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:26.110
is not lined up with
the spin, the system

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.780
has an asymmetry in it.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.106
And the system will require
additional torques just

00:39:36.106 --> 00:39:37.730
to hold it in place
when it's spinning.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.000
So when you have these
additional torques that

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.670
come from being a
symmetric, the system

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:53.450
is said to be
dynamically imbalanced.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.880
So if you pick up a stone, a
big stone, in your car wheel

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.160
or block hunk of mud or ice
that's frozen on the rim,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.280
you're going down the
road, what's it feel like?

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.910
You ever had an unbalanced
tire on your car?

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.760
Boy, where have you guys lived?

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.400
An unbalanced tire on a car,
you're going down the road.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.140
You know?

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.200
Right?

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.540
That's what this is all about.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.423
You have a case of imbalance.

00:40:24.549 --> 00:40:25.590
How are we doing on time?

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.730
A couple more minutes.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.240
So imbalance comes from
having angular momentum that's

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.777
not pointed in same direction
as-- angular momentum not

00:40:35.777 --> 00:40:37.860
pointed in the same direction
as the angle of spin

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.710
is evidence of unbalance.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:44.650
And you can calculate how bad
the unbalance is by doing dh dt

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.150
and actually finding out how
much torque is being applied

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.210
to the system that ordinarily
the bearings wouldn't

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:52.790
have to resist.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.810
But this thing has
overturning torques

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:58.990
that are trying to make it
wobble back and forth on you.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:04.766
So one last exercise,
which is actually

00:41:04.766 --> 00:41:06.810
a quite important point.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:12.330
If I moved A up here right
on the line between these two

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:17.780
things-- so this is A. And
now this is x, and this is z.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.950
The coordinates of
this point become what?

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.090
x1 and--

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.850
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.310
J. KIM VANDIVER: 0.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.760
And all these
equations still apply.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.060
So if I just move my coordinate
system so the x's are the same,

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.850
z's go to 0.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.740
What do you end
up with for terms?

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.440
What happens to this thing?

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.320
That goes to 0.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.270
It goes away.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:49.060
And you only get this term, and
so by simply moving A to here,

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.780
my angular momentum vector
now lines up with the spin.

00:41:55.708 --> 00:41:56.970
Kind of weird.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.660
Does the imbalance still exist?

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.751
Will your car still be
doing this down the road

00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:05.250
just because you
chose to look at it

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:08.430
from a different point of view?

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.930
Yeah.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:11.960
I mean, the car's still unhappy.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.109
So there's kind of
inconsistency here, sort of.

00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.900
What's the problem?

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:25.730
Or maybe not a
problem, but you choose

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.900
to put A when you're
computing angular momentum.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.990
You can choose where you
put this point to give you

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.780
the information you're after.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.190
And in this case, if I
were designing this system

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:42.160
and I wanted to know the bending
moment in these bars sticking

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.580
down here, I put A
here because it'll

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.590
give you the torques with
respect to this point.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.370
These torques down
here still exist.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.790
If you put your point at which
you compute angular momentum up

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.110
here, you won't be
able to find them.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.470
You can't compute it because
you've reduced the moment

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:03.980
arm to 0, this moment arm, and
you just won't get that torque.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.580
OK.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.770
All right, I've run out of time.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.031
But there'll be more
on this subject.
