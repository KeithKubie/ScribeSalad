00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.560
- Thank you so much,
everybody, for coming.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.130
Four o'clock, it cracks
me up that we can all

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.490
hang out at four o'clock and
get deep into some scholarship

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.240
and journalism.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.400
But, before I before I
get into my presentation,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.650
I want to thank Judy for this
really gracious introduction.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.120
I want to think Dean Cohen
for bringing together us

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.475
50 or so scholars.

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:28.350
It's really an honor.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.670
And it's been incredible,
for 10 days, to be together.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.690
I also want to acknowledge
the incredible staff here

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.620
at Radcliffe.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.930
Rebecca Haley, Meg Rotzel--

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.480
who has put together the
exhibition afterwards,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.010
that I hope you will all join.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.750
And we'll talk a bit about it.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.960
And I'm not sure if she's
here, Melanie Cammett, who

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.740
has been an advisor
of mine for some time

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.714
when I was at Brown University,
and she's still a mentor to me

00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:55.630
in the Kennedy School.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.620
So I'm really grateful
that she's here.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.160
And also Carol Hills, who is
a producer-- senior producer

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.080
and host-- at The
World at Public Radio.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.040
We've never met.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.780
We've been corresponding
for five years,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.815
I've been on the
show a dozen times.

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:08.690
Thank you for coming.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.124
But really, the people I want
to thank aren't here today.

00:01:13.124 --> 00:01:15.290
And these are the cartoonists
I'll be talking about.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.154
Because, at the
end of the day, I

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:19.070
can come here and have
a Radcliffe fellowship,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.236
and share all of their work.

00:01:20.236 --> 00:01:22.130
But so many of my
friends and colleagues

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.400
are in Cairo, in Beirut--

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.120
maybe they can't get a visa.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.640
Maybe they're limited in
their travel because of funds,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.410
or other reasons.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.900
So really, I'm grateful for
the opportunity to be here.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.840
But it's really a tribute
to them and their ingenuity.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.160
So, without further
ado, my guiding

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.980
question-- my big question--
is why is there an Arab comics

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.720
moment now, in 2017, but
really, the past decade?

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.880
In this current
contemporary context,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.140
why are comics so important
in a new, emerging Arab visual

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.240
culture?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll get to that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.749
But first, I want to
start with a question

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.890
that many of my fellow Fellows--

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.410
as this dorky turn of the
phrase we keep using--

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.580
have asked me about, which is,
what's going on in Cairo today?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.310
I think that's what
all of these really

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.590
fascinating new colleagues
at Harvard have asked me.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.960
What is going on in Cairo?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.000
So, the way I'm
going to answer that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.710
is through comics, obviously.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.920
So, this first one is by
an artist named Shennawy.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.350
He's in his 30s,
he's a founder of

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.310
this incredible comic collective
I'll be talking about today.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.250
But this first image
is, for those of you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.620
might have visited Cairo,
pretty recognizable--

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.680
the skyline, the
highway, the alleys.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.390
But the key is what
it says on top.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.260
You asked me, what's
Cairo like these days?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.020
Here's the answer--
the translation.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.030
Cairo, 60 years from
now, nothing has changed.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.520
And I think that's--

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.410
the comic goes on
to be this very kind

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.210
of tongue in cheek
graphic narrative

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.460
about the comic artists--

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.260
60 years, and how
they're decrepit and old,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.580
but they're still drawing.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.650
But I think this is
a very powerful idea

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.900
to think about, in terms
of a country that's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.300
had four regimes in five years,
and drastic political change.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.850
And at the end of the day, it's
a city of 22 million people.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.340
It's very difficult for a
city that large to change.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.530
So, Cairo 60 years from now--

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.110
it's basically what
we're left with today.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.440
But that's just one
comic and one perspective

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.240
on how Cairo looks today.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.680
This is another--

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.530
Cairo of the imagination,
of the melancholia,

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.760
of the pharaonic imaginary,
the cosmopolitan imaginary.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.010
The kind of Cairo you might
have seen in glossy magazines,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.700
travel magazines.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.760
And this is by a Lebanese
graphic artist, Lamia Ziade.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.210
And I think in this
image, we could

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.120
start to see just how
cinematic comics can be.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.610
And they can sort of create
imaginary or unworldly worlds.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.800
But they can also
produce very real worlds.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.850
This is a comic by a very
introverted graphic artist

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.000
named Mohammed Wahba
Shennawy-- different

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.920
than the first Shennawy.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.000
And he has this
incredible lens that--

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.380
I mean, look how detailed.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.250
If any of you have
visited Cairo,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.160
you can imagine being
stuck in this traffic.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.890
You can imagine waiting four
hours to get to the restaurant,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.560
you're trying to
get to for dinner.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.580
This is the Nile.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.946
This is the Cairo Tower.

00:04:27.946 --> 00:04:29.820
This is about 10 minutes
from where I've been

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.760
living for the past five years.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.030
And this kind of freakishly
detailed cityscape

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.910
captures the intense urbanism
and movement of Cairo

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.290
in a way that--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.360
I think-- only a comic can do.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.570
Obviously it's just a frame.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.800
But I'm giving you a
taste of everything.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.470
Or, the totally simplified--
the stick figure.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.360
This is by Islam Gawish.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.170
He's an ultra-viral web creator.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.820
He has, last I checked, 12 or 13
million followers on Facebook.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.510
And he's known for these
sardonic stick figures.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.430
And if you can imagine
this massive city,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.570
this is how he sees one
street's chaos in the midst of--

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.370
whether it's protest
or revolution.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.440
And in spite of it
being so simple,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.710
the details are incredible.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.550
He's walking over a dead body.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.530
There's people being
beat up on one side.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.070
On the other side
is further chaos.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.870
And the stick figure,
perhaps like the artist

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.410
himself, just kind of strolls
along like, what can you do?

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.870
Now, just as a brief
aside, and gesturing

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.280
towards what Judy
was saying, Gawish

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.340
spent a night in prison in
2016 for his barb against--

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.080
allegedly-- Abdel
Fattah el-Sisi,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.200
the military president.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.547
But you never know.

00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:45.130
And this is one of
the great mysteries

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.380
of an autocratic state--
why he landed in prison.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.710
But we'll get more
to that later.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.470
And so, what's
going on in Cairo?

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.480
Well, they're laughing
at us, is another answer

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.800
to that question.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.980
This is by the
artist Doaa Eladl.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.830
She's perhaps the most
prominent female cartoonist

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.460
in the country, which is no
small feat, considering--

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.460
even in the American context
or European context--

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.280
is a very patriarchal,
male-dominated field.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.500
And she has
distinguished herself

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.330
as an award-winning cartoonist.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.300
But also, you know, very bold.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.650
She's gotten death threats
from political Islamists,

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.260
she's been sued, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.940
So, what I like to
say is that, in terms

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.700
of the political moment we're
experiencing in America,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.070
I mean, the Egyptian
cartoonists get it.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.930
They've seen this movie before.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.640
They've drawn their
Sisi's, and they're

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.320
Mubarak's, and their
Morsi's, and everybody.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.540
And this is just
more great material.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.780
So, they're laughing at us.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.300
But I would also
maybe use comics

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.340
to explain to you, more broadly,
the political situation.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.570
So, we like to think of Egypt
as in this pharaonic world.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.090
That, obviously, is quite
an imagined identity.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.470
And I'm not here to tell you--

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.172
I'm sure we have incredible
ancient historians among us who

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.880
could tell us that
it's not a direct line

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.755
between the pharaohs.

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:07.640
But it's an important part of
Egyptian national identity.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.620
And I think this is a
really brilliant, you know,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.960
way to explain the
political scene that

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.610
far surpasses any
op-ed or research

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.300
article that I could write.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.370
And perhaps one
that even brushes--

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.344
you know, obviously this is
quite making fun of the police

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:25.510
and making fun of authority.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.510
But I want to show you one
that even maybe pushes further

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.830
against those red lines.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.380
And this is a
scathing indictment

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.700
of the Egyptian state.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.160
This is a family
covered in blood.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.690
And it says, the
souvenir portrait

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.510
of the great Egyptian family.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.360
A cartoonist named Andeel, who's
about 32, he posted this days--

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.630
not months, not weeks,
not years-- days

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.230
after the military coup that
upended Egyptian democracy

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.540
in July 2013.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.220
So much of the
country was singing

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.910
with the national chorus of
a great military savior who's

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.840
overcome political Islamists
or the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.960
It was only a cartoonist--
only a cartoonist

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.180
could serve as an ombudsman in
this visually aggressive way.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.770
And say, look,
you're all smiling.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.530
But really, we have
blood on our hands,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.680
and our faces, and et cetera.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.790
So, again, this is
again moving towards

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.760
the political red lines, which
I'll talk about a bit later.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.920
But the point I really
want to make here

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.170
is that cartoonists are
often this kind of canary

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.060
in the coal mine moment.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.960
And while now, 2016,
2017, many cartoonists

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.070
have come out against Abdel
Fattah El-sisi, the president--

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.756
former general.

00:08:40.756 --> 00:08:42.130
We have cartoonists
who are doing

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.870
it day three, four of the coup.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.880
Which is pretty outrageous.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.790
And it's not without push-back.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.890
This is a Facebook
meme that, I think,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.370
sums up the state of digital
surveillance or technology

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.610
in Egypt.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.350
Which is this great--

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.600
this great contradiction
that social media

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.130
has opened up whole worlds.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.130
Any cartoonist or
person with Photoshop

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.920
can create an incredibly
powerful image

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.380
with a stinging
political relevance.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.480
However, with that,
comes surveillance,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.840
and lack of privacy, and
activists and journalists

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.610
being monitored.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.090
This started in May, in earnest,
that the Egyptian government

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.680
blocked 150 website, including
the website where Andeel

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.360
draws for, MadaMasr, a
leading independent news

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.940
resource in Egypt.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.320
It's now over 400, including
websites like the Human Rights

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.410
Watch Arabic Edition,
a number of news--

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.360
even financial news sites--

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.455
of course, Al Jazeera,
which has been demonized.

00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:45.830
I'm not going to
get too detailed

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.010
into this particular
spectrum of censorship.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.350
I just wanted to say,
this is not an easy place

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.110
to be a cartoonist, and
particularly in this emerging

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.460
digital role.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.300
At the same time, print
is really important.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.380
And there is a cohort of really
talented and incredibly funny--

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.410
I think-- cartoonists who
work daily in newspapers.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.530
Like Anwar, who's drawn
this, that I think really

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.520
captures the ambiguousness
of censorship in Egypt.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.100
Because it's not like
one might imagine--

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.200
a man in a suit, and
a tie, and a red pen,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.910
crossing out cartoons.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.910
It's more of a crafty
cartoonist at the corner.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.730
And maybe certain people
are unhappy with his work.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.080
Maybe he'll get away.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.280
Maybe he'll be coerced.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.840
Maybe he'll have to
leave the country.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.750
It's a very ambiguous fear.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.750
And I think it's
particularly interesting

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.850
that private newspapers,
like the one that's

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.260
publishing his work, are
willing to go that extra length

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:47.190
and produce cartoons that
are incredibly bold--

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.440
in their visual language
obviously, and also

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.170
in their political message.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.310
But these red lines are, as I
say, enforced very haphazardly.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.990
So, that's going to
be one of the topics

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.360
I'll be continuing to raise.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.652
So, here they are.

00:11:03.652 --> 00:11:04.860
Let me introduce them to you.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.380
These are some of the
so-called mad cartoonists,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.750
as I've titled today's talk.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.587
And these are just
the handful of them.

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:13.170
Some of their works
I just showed you.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.110
Others, I didn't have such
beautiful photographs of,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.580
so I didn't include.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.500
These are by, by the
way, Benedict Evans.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.710
He's an incredibly talented
portrait photographer

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.000
who I worked with in Cairo.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.850
These mad cartoonists of
Cairo are using their pens

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.670
to redraw the lines
of acceptable speech.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.920
And they often face resistance.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.430
So, why do I call them mad?

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.590
Well, yesterday I had
the honor of sitting

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.860
through Art Spiegelman-- one of
the most talented comic artists

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.710
of the past generation--
speak, and he

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.840
spoke about how
deeply influenced

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.920
he was by Harvey
Kurtzman's Mad Magazine.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.450
So, I feel like, OK, I
had a good title, now.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.370
So, there's three reasons
why I like to call

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:55.720
these the mad cartoonists.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.309
First of all, they're
mad at the status quo.

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:03.850
I mean, as you look at many of
the more politically-inflected

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.190
cartoons, they're
incredibly bold,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.820
and there's no holds barred.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.400
Second, they are- although
not directly influenced by Mad

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.390
Magazine--

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.250
are influenced maybe
by the generation

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.660
after the original Mad.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.540
So they're part of
this comic collectives

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.320
that are quite raunchy, and
outrageous, and experimental.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.290
So I do think they fit into
this kind of Mad Magazine

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.040
genre of alternative comics.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.310
And for those of us who are more
analytical or science-minded,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.080
I'll define all my definitions
when I get a little further.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.740
But yes, these are quite
bold comic artists.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.320
And they're mad
at the status quo.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.670
And they're defiantly,
you know, they're

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.917
mad to be so defiantly
flouting of taboos.

00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:50.500
And I think that's
the thing, is you'd

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.590
have to be mad to be a
cartoonist in this environment.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.990
And yet, I've met
dozens of them.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.020
And they're incredibly creative.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.110
If they hit a roadblock,
they will work around it

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.820
and find a way to draw Sisi,
or find a way to mock whomever.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.460
And they're really this
avant-garde network

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.830
of artists working in Cairo.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.980
But, as all talk about
a bit later, they're

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.156
part of a bigger
constellation of artists

00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:19.030
throughout the Middle
East, and North Africa,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.460
and increasingly connected
to colleagues in America

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.480
in Europe and Asia.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:32.000
Now, the most kind of clear
expression of alternative

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.730
comics, as we'll call
them-- comics for adults--

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.580
is this magazine called Tok Tok.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.580
Now, this is the first
image I showed you, as well,

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.470
of Cairo 60 years from now.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.740
So, Tok Tok is a horizontal
collective of artists.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:50.150
They, serendipitously,
launch their somewhat

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.710
quarterly periodical two weeks
before the 2011 uprising.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.170
So, it begins to
show the parallel

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.650
of how art and politics
work in tandem,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.450
if not directly connected.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.920
And they're deeply linked to
Egyptian art institutions,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.860
to regional institutions.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.600
And I want to say, above
all-- and I've just

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.260
said all this heady stuff
about how they fight red lines,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.410
and are persistently
audacious-- but they actually

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.370
have a lot of fun.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.190
They host great openings,
they host great get-togethers.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.520
This is really a
creative insurgency.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.690
And it's a lot of fun to
research and be a part of.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.000
And here's some more images
of Cairo that, I think,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.090
began to capture what
this city of 22 million

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.180
has to offer in
terms of daily life,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.510
the minutia, the corners,
the alleys, where

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.370
you would leave your trash
out for the garbage men.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.420
And this is why Tok
Tok is so unique.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.850
Cairo is a very
class-based city,

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.900
Egypt's a very
class-based society.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.330
These are liminal spaces.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.880
These are not spaces
that get foregrounded

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.910
in daily newspapers.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:02.270
So, for someone to be drawing
comics that really spotlights

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.630
what it is to live in
a lower to middle class

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.060
neighborhood of
urban parts of Cairo

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.560
is also a very
political statement.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.120
Now, the name Tok Tok--
which you can see here,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.470
for Arabic readers--

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.180
it's a three-wheeled rickshaw.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.940
So, the urban
sensibility is deeply

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.310
embedded into the publication.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.050
They're kind of like
really cheap taxis,

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.700
only available in,
what in Cairo is

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.520
called the popular
neighborhoods, which is,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.140
in fact, the poorer
neighborhoods.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.590
So, I think the
common thread here--

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.510
and when I'm talking about
how things work in parallel--

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.230
how sort of the revolution
happened and these comics

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.070
started--

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.560
this is on the eve
of the 2013 coup.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.900
And they put out this
issue that, as I say,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.340
foregrounds this
urban sensibility.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.460
So, it's, again, I want to
start raising these questions.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.910
So, this is the piece that--

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.210
I hope you can join at
the exhibition later--

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.655
I'll be showing, by an
artist named Shennawy.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.550
I think it has it has an
incredible rhythm for us

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.200
comic scholars here.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.910
The lighting is really special--

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.130
the way he's used
different shades and hues

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.040
to capture Cairo's
light pollution.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.380
It's also a very
every-man's story.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.160
This gentleman up here,
he's a car parker--

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.140
he's a valet.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.690
And each issue, he kind
of experiences some kind

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.090
of absurd circumstances.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.410
And I'm going to end the
talk with the most absurd.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.440
But in this one, he finds
a young Chinese girl

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.770
in an alley in Cairo, and
decides to take her home.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.152
But you kind of see Cairo
through this young girl's eyes.

00:16:38.152 --> 00:16:39.610
She's maybe never
been in the city.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.985
She doesn't know
why she's there.

00:16:40.985 --> 00:16:43.890
And you just get these
glimpses of urban life.

00:16:47.547 --> 00:16:50.130
But the thing that seems to be
the undertone of everything I'm

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.830
saying, is just how difficult
it is to be a comic artist

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.820
today in Egypt.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.560
And I wanted to
draw your attention

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.660
to some of the kind of
pro-government rah-rah,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.550
pro-Sisi hysteria, to show you
just how powerful the works

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.380
that I've just previewed are.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.170
This is how the pro-state
official newspapers

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.099
show President Sisi-- driving,
literally, the ship of state

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.650
through the Suez
Canal, very handsome.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.760
Here, he's on the cover
of a children's magazine--

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.500
kind of grinning.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.760
I like that they've added
some friendly faces there.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.710
Versus this image, which
was posted on Facebook

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.010
by a 20-something year-old
military conscript

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.990
named Amr Nohan.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.760
Amr Nohan is now
serving in prison

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.080
for posting this on Facebook.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.760
This appeared in the
newspaper, of Sisi

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.320
sitting on a journalist's head.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.710
These are some of the more
bold critiques of him.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.840
Sisi on the psychiatric couch.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.340
Or an incredible Facebook
meme of the Mickey Mouse.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.470
I wanted to show you
this slide to make

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.800
sure it's clear that these
mad cartoonists are outliers.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.000
And since Sisi took power,
ostensibly in 2013, and then

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.170
through an election in
2014, the comic discourse

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.730
has shifted considerably--

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.860
day-to-day sometimes.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.920
If there's a terror attack,
if there's an election,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.920
the rules of the game might
change for a short period,

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.840
or in earnest.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.530
But Andeel-- this cartoonist who
drew Sisi playing with action

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.190
figures, and kind of totally a
rambunctious approach to this

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.900
president--

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.180
he told me this.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.420
Quote, "I don't want my work
to only be interesting because

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.500
of dictatorship.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.450
Because this, again,
is giving dictatorship

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.060
so much size and importance.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.890
I hate when people
see cartoonists

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.020
as exotic, the expression of
freedom fighters in the Middle

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.480
East."

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.970
So I always want to
bring in that kind of--

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.300
his dismissiveness, or his
natural approach to this.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.990
To show that, although this
looks like a very intense

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.100
political act--

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.100
many of these cartoons-- they're
kind of just day to day life.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.240
I mean, people have chosen
their career to be cartoonists.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.980
And at the same time, the
stakes could not be higher.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.440
Just this week--
it's very tragic,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.200
and it's hard to
even think about.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.670
That the lawyer-- a human rights
advocate, a lawyer in Cairo--

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.800
who works on forced
disappearances.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.300
Which is, there's
tens of thousands

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.400
of people in Egyptian prisons.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.850
We don't know why-- probably
for political affiliations

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.290
that are unsavory.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.930
The lawyer working on
forced disappearances

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.580
was forcibly disappeared.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.750
His name's Abdel
Moneim Metwally Hegazi.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.880
And I think this
point of absurdity

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.440
is where the comic
artists come in.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.810
I mean, it's very
difficult to make

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:48.250
a joke about something that is
that real, or that visceral.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.880
But, in fact, that's
exactly the job of artists--

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.500
I think-- in this context,
and Facebook posters.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.370
I threw this one in of
Sisi as George Costanza.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.990
Because I think this is,
you know, online discourse

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:10.450
or, in the context of print,
is an incredibly powerful way

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.110
to attack a regime that's
disappearing thousands

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.740
of people.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.830
And Egypt is, last I
checked, the third worst

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.559
trailer of journalists in the
world-- after China and Turkey.

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.850
Now, cartoonists are not
always considered journalists,

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:28.160
but many are members of
the journalist syndicate.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.850
There's innumerable
risks facing them.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.370
So, what are the red lines?

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.240
And there's no really direct
answer to this question.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.140
Because, as I say, they
shift from period to period.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.440
I've done extensive research
on Mubarak's red lines

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.410
from 1981 to 2011, and how that
shifted during a military junta

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.770
period, then during
Morsi, then during Sisi,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.190
and then, how even each
year of Sisi can change.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.840
But broadly speaking,
punching up or punching down,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.330
two things we thought about
in the American context.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.900
Punching up, in this context,
being insulting the president--

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.550
which is illegal--

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.290
Insulting the parliament,
the judiciary, the military,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.360
a number of other
state institutions.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.280
But, as I mentioned
before, it is all very

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.420
haphazardly enforced.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.370
So its all part of the game.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.152
And I just wanted
to-- this slide

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:28.610
was also my
opportunity to tell you

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.330
a little bit about my approach.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.480
Because I'm approaching
this as a journalist.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.480
I'm not a scholar of comics,
I'm not a political scientist.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.370
So, I like to tell
people's stories.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.620
I like to profile them.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.510
I like to think
about why they're

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.300
making these choices, the
audiences they're reaching.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.900
But I'm also not
an anthropologist.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.580
So I don't go sit in cafes
and do reception analysis.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.110
I don't do content analysis.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.270
I don't do any of
these one techniques.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.110
I'm trying to bring it all
together in stories that share,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.040
I think, these incredibly
brave people's works.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.640
So I conduct my research
at late night street cafes,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.820
on university campuses,
secondhand bookstalls,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.090
newspaper offices, museums,
antique shops, galleries,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.090
salons, book launches,
festivals, workshops,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.580
conferences,
symposiums, openings,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.260
and quite crucially, closings.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.430
Because when a place closes
here, we think it's-- oh,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.530
the exhibition's closed for
after a month of showing.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.900
But there's been
many cases in Egypt

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.740
where institutions have been
closed down, where publications

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.840
have been closed down.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.380
The key point-- and this is
something that's emerged from

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.940
five years of my writing--

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.130
is that all of this censorship,
all of this pressure,

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.690
all of this stress, I think
it actually empowers artists.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.100
And it is very
counter-intuitive.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.010
And it's not necessarily
make-sense on paper,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.410
but you hear this
in Andeel's voice,

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.500
about how he thinks he's
bigger than dictatorship.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.750
You see this in the
persistent defiance--

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.870
and I'll get into the
deep history shortly.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.950
I think all of these things
together make cartoonists

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.160
more committed to the cause.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.440
So-- and I just
wanted to mention,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.060
the risks are incredibly real.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.760
This is a Palestinian
cartoonist who was gunned down.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.130
And I put '88--

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.000
I apologize, '87 in London.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.810
And the case is
still unresolved.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.700
But it's also part of a
century-long tradition.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.230
And it shows just
what's at stake.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.860
I wanted to make
that clear to you,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.590
who aren't working
in this field,

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.760
or aren't thinking about the
political aspects of comics

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.890
obsessively, like me and
a couple of my friends

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.710
who are here.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.550
You know, why is it that regimes
are threatened by cartoons?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.950
Why are interest groups
calling in death threats?

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:55.430
Why are Islamist groups bringing
lawsuits against cartoonists?

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.200
The fact is, that
all those people

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.420
are thinking about how
to coerce cartoonists

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.730
into changing their
perspective, means

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.969
that we as a general
audience, and readership,

00:24:03.969 --> 00:24:06.260
and interested people, we
should be thinking about what

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.040
cartoonists are doing also.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.450
So, this is a quick note
on my Herculean feat.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.092
I'm Superman, but the villain
is much bigger than me.

00:24:17.092 --> 00:24:18.800
And I'm trying to take
all of these ideas

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.530
and write a book about them
while I'm here at Radcliffe.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:24.930
So that's going to be difficult.
But, as I've described,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.020
I have a pretty good
idea of my argument

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.500
and my approach about how all
these difficulties, in fact,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:36.974
galvanized cartoonists to make
their craft even stronger.

00:24:36.974 --> 00:24:38.390
But since I'm a
journalist, I come

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.870
across all of these weird
characters and personalities.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.750
And it's not just a
straight-up history,

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.392
although that's what
I'm very excited about.

00:24:48.392 --> 00:24:49.850
But since no one's
actually written

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.082
the history of Arab comics--

00:24:52.082 --> 00:24:54.290
although there's been bits
and pieces along the way--

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.980
I'm sort of forced to
almost survey that history.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.880
So let me first give you a
taste of my secret weapon.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.320
And then I'll give you a
little bit of that history.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.580
So my secret weapon
is my archive.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.950
And I have hundreds of old
magazines from the 20s and 30s,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.720
all the way through
today, and books.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.610
So this is my desk
over the weekend,

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.310
trying to write this talk.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.940
You know, this is a
Mickey Mouse magazine

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.770
in support of
Gamal Abdel Nasser,

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.900
the great nationalist
leader of Egypt.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.820
This is Mickey Mouse
making fun of Yemen.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.940
This is a rip off of
TinTin from the 60s.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.940
These are magazines from
the teens and the 20s

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.190
that have really
early caricatures.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.410
So-- and this is me digging
through stacks of those.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.360
It's a terrible photo.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.200
But I just want to
give you a sense of--

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.080
just I have access
to book dealers

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.930
who have these archives.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:52.870
And Egypt's a difficult
place to work in libraries,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.220
and to get official permission.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.890
So I've actually created my own
archive out of antique shops.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.800
Although I didn't buy this,
because it was $10,000.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.230
But it was an original
cartoon banner

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.880
from the 20s that was used
in a political demonstration.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.250
These are bookstalls
that I peel through,

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.130
and digital archives,
galleries, graffiti--

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.432
these are all sort of
sites of my research.

00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:19.390
And part of it's trying
to tie it all together.

00:26:21.954 --> 00:26:23.870
But the thing I also
wanted to share with you,

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:27.170
because we are at the
Radcliffe Institute,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.450
is Little Lulu in Arabic.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.020
Because for those of
you who don't know,

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.670
Radcliffe has this incredible
librarian collection.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:40.050
Among it are the full
papers of the artist,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:43.830
Marge Buell, of Little Lulu.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.840
And funny enough, you
know, she was born in 1935.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.090
By 1965- 66,
translated into Arabic.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.220
So, again, Art
Spiegelman, yesterday,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.300
said that he learned
feminism from Little Lulu.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.216
So, I don't know if
that's a bit of a stretch.

00:27:01.216 --> 00:27:03.100
But I think many of
us learned feminism

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.850
from another character--

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.050
who Jill Lepore so brilliantly
about-- the Secret History

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.270
of Wonder Woman.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.640
Now, I've learned that
Wonder Woman barely

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.380
appeared in Arabic.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.170
I don't know why.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.844
Maybe it's political, maybe
it's just an accident, maybe--

00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:19.510
it's one of those
weird things that Lulu

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.490
is super popular
in Arabic, but you

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.970
can't find other random
characters in translation.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.630
So I just wanted to acknowledge
also that, you know,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.790
much of the Wonder
Woman's story was written

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.421
and happened here in Cambridge,
here on Brattle Street.

00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:37.170
So it's cool to be a
part of that history,

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.920
and also to be writing my
own secret history of comics.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.075
So what does children's comics
have to do with my research?

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:48.450
I'm still figuring out exactly
how it fits into the book.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.000
But you have this
medium that's always

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.830
been childish and immature in
the context of the Arab world.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.500
And it's only in the
last decade or so

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.800
that comics are really
coming out for adults.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.280
And in fact, there's new comics
for kids like this adventure

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.670
story that's kind of
sci-fi, neo-pharaonic

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.400
that is obviously very informed
by some of these children's

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.510
comics.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.120
So, as I said, because no one's
really written this history,

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.990
I'm just going to give you a
quick one-two of the history

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.600
of Arab comics--
or, why Disney has

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.720
been teaching young Egyptians
to smoke hookah since 1963.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.480
I also want to
recognize a mentor

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.630
of mine, Elliott Colla, who's
a previous Radcliffe Fellow.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.660
I showed him this slide
recently-- he's at Georgetown--

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.240
and he pointed out
that this is a hookah.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.090
This is well-known.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.030
This is just for hashish.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.060
What was this-- why was this
on the cover of a children's

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.500
magazine?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.970
I don't know.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.380
This is part of the--

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.380
I've acquired all of
this incredible material.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.020
A couple academic articles have
been written about this topic,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.990
but I don't know who the
artist of this is, this cover.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.150
Many of the covers
are not acknowledged.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.990
So, yeah.

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:06.730
I'm really here to think
about this secret history.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.050
But I buried the lead for you,
because I'm a bad journalist.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:15.880
The first cartoonist in
the Arab world was a Jew.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.160
This is the work of Yaqub Sanu.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.300
He was working in the late
19th century in Cairo.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.520
He was an
anti-imperialist crusader

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.400
and anti-government crusader.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.750
Spoke more languages than I
could probably count, and ended

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.630
up having to flee
to France because

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.220
of his anti-government
cartoons in the 1880s.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.957
But he still would
smuggle these.

00:29:39.957 --> 00:29:42.040
This is the head of Egypt
at the time, the Ottoman

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.480
leader, the hadith.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.640
He was skewering him,
drawing him as a pharaoh.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.130
So it's this really rich
tradition that I really--

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.200
I like to show that--
we want to make

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.230
sure people know this wasn't
born out of the Arab Spring.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.750
There's a really rich,
indigenous comic culture

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.510
that permeates all
aspects of print media.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.960
And he was hugely influential.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.490
He also wrote the first plays
in amiyah, an Egyptian dialect.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.900
So, he published a huge
amount of satirical magazines

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.740
and publications.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.040
And by the 20s and
30s, there's a lot

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.150
of humor magazines in Egypt.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:24.680
And this is a political poster
that obviously uses caricature.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.830
And some scholars are
working on this right now.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.700
And they're exploring these
brief, historical moments.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.370
And it's terrific
scholarship, in terms

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.410
of using comics
and visual culture

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.440
to explain the 20s
and 30s in Egypt

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.830
in a broader, post-Ottoman way.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.070
But very few people
have thought about how

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:48.390
Tom and Jerry came to Egypt.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.260
Now, this is from a very early
children's magazine in Arabic--

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.680
started in 1952.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.810
Which is also an
important year for Cairo.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.400
1952 is when the Free
Officers Movement--

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.960
a group of young
military officers--

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.150
overthrew the
monarch, and started

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.740
the new Egyptian republic.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.620
So it's also very interesting
that, although not directly

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.487
related, that in this
moment of political change,

00:31:14.487 --> 00:31:16.320
you would want to have
a children's magazine

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.450
to explain what is the ethos.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:21.300
What should young children
be thinking about morally?

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.760
What should they know
about, politically?

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.910
And of course, the artists
just stole the best characters

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.610
from the US.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.230
As an aside, this was always
Yasser Arafat's favorite comic,

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.830
Tom and Jerry, because
the mouse always won.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.810
So-- and then, as I said,
you know, Mickey Mouse

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.790
has also been a part
of Egyptian culture.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.340
This is already,
you know, 75 years.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.040
And I think it's fascinating,
because we might think

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.980
of Disney characters as
symbols of capitalism,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.790
or cultural imperialism,
or what have you.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.430
But really, Mickey has
been fully integrated

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.740
into Egyptian culture.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.730
These are all local covers
of the Disney affiliate

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.030
in the Arab world, which was
based in Cairo from the 60s.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.270
And, I mean, very
pharaonic, this

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.951
is a kind of joke about the
Persian Gulf, or the Arab Gulf.

00:32:18.951 --> 00:32:22.722
You know, different
folkways expressed.

00:32:22.722 --> 00:32:24.680
Now you have that image
of him smoking a hookah

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.970
to add to that.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.920
But yeah, very
interested in how he

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.204
became a very local character.

00:32:30.204 --> 00:32:31.620
You see Mickey
Mouse, now, painted

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.935
on pre-schools and elementary
schools throughout Cairo.

00:32:36.935 --> 00:32:39.060
I wish I had more time to
get into the deep history

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.630
right now.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.640
I'm going to take us
way far in the future.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.970
But I just wanted to show you,
so, there is this rich history

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.500
of children's comics.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.240
And then it's taken up by
artists for adults and comics

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.230
for adults, starting in
the 80s and 90s in Beirut.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.930
But, in terms of the mad
cartoonists of Cairo,

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:05.070
I want to bring us
up to 2007 and 2008,

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.830
when an artist called
Magdy El Shafee, who

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.190
was drawing for a prominent
opposition newspaper,

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.160
tried his hand at
drawing a graphic novel.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.630
And this is the first
graphic novel in Egypt.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.312
I mean, it's a
very big deal when

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:19.770
you think about,
this was happening

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.110
in America in the 60s and 70s.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.750
And this is an
entirely new medium.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.410
It's written in really
rich, dirty slang.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.030
There's quite a
bit of obscenities.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.950
And I guess, none of
us should be surprised

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.570
that all the copies of
this publication, Metro,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.070
were confiscated
upon its release.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:42.360
It wasn't widely circulated
in Arabic until about three

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.800
or four years ago--

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.770
and is available in translation,
if you'd like to read it.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.440
It's a searing indictment
of the Mubarak regime.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.210
This is drawn in the
last several years

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.180
of Mubarak's 31-year rule.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.390
It's about the impunity
with which thugs operate,

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.630
with which businessman
control a kind

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.880
of crony capitalist system.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.770
And this young
protagonist, who's

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.949
in his 30s or 20s, a
computer programmer,

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.236
is driven to the brink.

00:34:12.236 --> 00:34:14.610
So I'm just going to read,
for you, the first line of it.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.080
Because I think it's
incredibly powerful.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.780
Today, I decided to rob a bank.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.810
I don't remember when
I became so angry.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.440
All I know is that everyone
was always going one way,

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.150
and I was going the other.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.679
All I had on my
side was my brain.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.880
So now my brain has a plan,
and I'm going to make it work.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.389
And this gentlemen goes on
to use his computer skills

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.010
to rob a bank--

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.710
kind of secretly,
through wire transfers.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.060
And of course, this is
the idea of him being mad,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.159
you know, really angry
at the status quo.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:52.479
But I was reading The New York
Times a couple of weeks ago.

00:34:52.479 --> 00:34:54.020
There was an article
about, you know,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.620
subsidized cooking gas being--

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.390
removing subsidies
from cooking gas

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.550
and removing subsidies
that are really

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.420
crunching a lot of Egyptians--
millions of Egyptians.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.270
And there is a quote from
a woman in The Times,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.040
"we don't know what to do.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.619
Do they want us to rob a bank?"

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.160
I thought that was
pretty impressive,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.220
that this graphic novel--
a decade later-- is still

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.900
kind of almost predictive
in these issues.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.550
But what I'm actually
talking about

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.130
is not just about the
mad cartoonists of Cairo.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.880
Its a regional phenomenon.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:33.460
And Tunisia, Morocco,
and Lebanon--

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.920
which has been a
primary site of comics--

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.690
have had an outpouring of
creative interventions.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.250
And I know here, I'm mixing
together cartoonists,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.394
and comic artists, and
graphic narratives,

00:35:44.394 --> 00:35:45.310
and graphic novelists.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.215
I promised that I would
define all these for you.

00:35:48.215 --> 00:35:49.090
But I'm not going to.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:50.860
I'm just going to
say, all these people

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.390
are working on hybrid forms.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.970
These magazines will
have one frame comics,

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:58.440
they'll have strips, they'll
have postcard-style drawings.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.870
They're a total mishmash of
all sorts of graphic forms.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:04.667
So I think it's
interesting to start

00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:06.250
thinking beyond those
labels, in terms

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.620
of what these really
beautiful productions are.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.010
And these are about,
I think, 17 issues

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.790
of this Lebanese
comic zine since 2007.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.790
The Tunisian version is just
emerging in the past two years

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.750
or so.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.300
And I think what's
noteworthy, is these

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.130
are all done by collectives.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.840
These aren't individuals.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840
These are kind of the
anti-hierarchical, anti-regime,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.820
in their make-up, even.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.020
And, in a very similar
way, to kind of Raw,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.460
and Zap, and even Mad Magazine,
these are groups of artists.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.180
These aren't just
one single person

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.100
that makes these
publications come together.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.760
So, is it political
escapism, though?

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.410
Are comics just
a way to run away

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.740
from the problems of the day?

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:58.820
And after all, I've told
you about the lawyer who

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.030
works on disappearance
is being disappeared,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.020
that tens of
thousands in prison.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.180
I mean, is Cairo just so bleak?

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.560
Is it so disturbing?

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.460
I mean, what can cartoonists do
that us and other professional

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.060
fields can't?

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.600
So the one thing I've noticed
totally unique to Cairo--

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.684
and, I mean, OK.

00:37:17.684 --> 00:37:19.100
Totally unique is
an exaggeration.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:24.430
But the defining characteristic
of Egyptian comics

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.190
is something that is--

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.980
can only be said is black humor.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.680
The mobilization
of gallows humor,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.660
literally in the
aftermath of an attack--

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:39.100
literally while the smoke is
rising from a terror attack--

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.380
cartoonists are
willing to make a joke.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.210
And this is something
I don't think--

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:45.950
I think it's illegal in
France to probably say this,

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.630
je suis kouachi, the
killers of Charlie Hebdo.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.910
I think no one in America
would have the gall

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.540
to post this or publish this
in the immediate aftermath

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.170
of an attack.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.560
But here we are, one
month later in Cairo,

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.570
after the heinous
Charlie Hebdo attack

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.510
in Paris of January 2015.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.370
And Egyptian
cartoonists are really--

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.801
they're well-versed in dealing
with blasphemy laws and terror

00:38:09.801 --> 00:38:10.300
attacks.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:15.100
And they're willing to come out
and make a joke straight away.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.620
And I think this goes back
to the red lines idea.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.720
Because in America
we have red lines

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.160
that we don't
always think about,

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.743
because they're not
legally enshrined.

00:38:22.743 --> 00:38:25.690
But it would be considered
in very bad taste

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.740
to make jokes
about 9/11 on 9/11.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.370
Whereas here, we have
a pretty bold joke

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.130
about ISIS that
came out not long

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.510
after ISIS had been founded.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.130
And, "pardon me, chief... has
my head rolled through here?"

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.190
And this is the--

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.430
this is the ISIS-- it
just says ISIS Daesh.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.170
And this just says barbershop.

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.170
It's like, you know,
what's going on here?

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.470
And this is but one
example of many,

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:59.730
that walk that fine line of
bad taste or irreverence.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.090
And this is how to survive
a chemical warfare attack,

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.320
by a Jordanian cartoonist.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.945
So it's not singular to
Egypt, but it is definitely--

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:09.570
Egypt's the center
of this black humor.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.490
And in Jordan, you
know, this is how

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.010
you survive a chemical attack.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.950
And, you know, but you might end
up like this anyway, even if--

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.770
Now, this came out right
when the Obama administration

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.230
was grappling with how
to reply or respond

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.710
to the Assad regime's alleged
use of chemical weapons

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.910
in Syria.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.200
Is pretty bold.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.710
I don't-- there were no American
cartoonists making jokes about

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.930
unconventional warfare
in this moment.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:36.600
And here's one that
I often think about,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.690
because it's an incredible
bravado to publish this.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.950
"Sir, just pay for
the parking spot

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.190
before you explode the car.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.190
Best wishes for Ramada."

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.900
This is in a major newspaper
with the circulation

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.620
of hundreds of thousands.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:00.860
And this came out days after
the targeted assassination

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.810
and an explosion--

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.430
a car explosion-- of the
prosecutor general of Egypt--

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.580
you know, the attorney
general was killed.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.530
The highest level terror attack,
in terms of an assassination,

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.230
in Egyptian history,
since Sadat's killing.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.870
And this is what cartoonists
are saying the next day.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.910
So what's going on here?

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.880
This is basically
one of the questions

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.780
I want to work on this year.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.600
Where does black humor fit
into the tricks of the trade

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.220
of cartoonists in Egypt?

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.730
But the primary
thing I want to say,

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.490
is that it's a way to
symbolically attack--

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.800
and even level the playing
field with terrorists,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.880
who have their own assorted
weapons and means of coercion.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.950
But cartoonists retain
their power to punch back,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:54.590
and to make fun
of craven killers.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.270
And of course, it's not just
unique to making fun of ISIS.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:02.090
It's also making fun of
the government itself,

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.110
and how they reply to
these terror attacks.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.330
And this one is--

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.470
"another explosion?

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:10.670
OK then, prepare a
nationalistic song-- pronto!"

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:15.270
This, again, appeared
in this major newspaper.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.600
I think this is in light of
the really heinous church

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.350
attacks that have
become a really

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:23.700
disturbing trend in Cairo--

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.270
not in Cairo, primarily,
in the outskirts of Cairo

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:28.410
and across Egypt.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.000
But, yeah.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.860
This is how this
cartoonist responded.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.900
So, I'm going to close with
the same artist I began with,

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.940
Shennawy--

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.917
back to his car parker.

00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:42.000
And now I just realized
we have a car parker here.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.040
So, I guess for those who
are not familiar with Cairo,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.850
terrible traffic.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.060
And you often give someone a
buck or two to park your car--

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.640
not unlike any other city.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.420
So this car parker is a
recurring character, as I said,

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.050
in every issue of this zine.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.752
And so, we have
these cars kind of--

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:02.460
we've got these really
nice pickup trucks

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.650
and SUVs coming into Cairo.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.820
And our car parker
friend is all ready.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:10.630
He's parking them, he's is doing
everything, he's doing his job.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.450
He's hoping for a big tip.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:17.880
Except it's the founder
of ISIS, al-Baghdadi.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.200
And ISIS has come to town.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.610
It's not normal SUVs.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:25.590
And it ends with our car
parker being beheaded.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:26.520
Is it gory?

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.720
Is it distasteful?

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.430
Is it absurd?

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:34.680
Or is this how we can get back
at ISIS and regain our dignity,

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.870
or regain our--

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.250
what we have that's different
than these societies?

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.080
I don't know.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.090
This all emerges from my
research and my interviews

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.440
with these artists.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:52.380
But I just think they're
pretty mad for doing it.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.960
And I'm really honored to be
sharing their work with you

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.600
today.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.740
So, thank you.
