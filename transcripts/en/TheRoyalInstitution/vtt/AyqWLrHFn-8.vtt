00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.040
Let me show a very simple example just to
remind you of a geometry

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.220
which is not the geometry of Euclid.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.429
In which the proposition that every triangle
is 180 degrees simply does not hold.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.230
And it's a familiar and an easy geometry which
we know all the time.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.870
Imagine this balloon to be a sphere. I will
work on part of it only.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.370
It will be rather spherical.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.830
If I draw a small triangle.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.680
I think you will believe that nearby, if I
look at it closely, it is very near a flat

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680
surface,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.800
and my propositions will not be much different,
if I work on the flat surface.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.030
But if I draw a large triangle.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.030
A line like that.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.969
And let me draw a nice right angle here.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.809
It's a good right angle.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.600
And a nice right angle here,
that's a good right angle.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.409
Then if I continue with straight lines, of
course on the flat plane

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.760
I never meet, but here I make a splendid triangle.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.339
Well, I submit, if they're 90 degrees here
pretty close,

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.510
and 90 degrees here pretty close, I've used
up the 180,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.960
there must be something to assign to that
triangle.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.390
Of course you know very well the theorems
of Euclid

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.840
simply do not apply in the non-Euclidean geometry
of a sphere.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.350
And what determines whether they apply or
not, how closely they are approximated,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.610
is one thing, and one thing alone, namely,
is the triangle large or small?

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.659
And when I say large or small I say with respect
to what?

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.649
And of course the answer is quite clear, large
or small with respect to the sphere.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.530
If they are tiny triangles as we draw triangles
compared to the great globe of the Earth,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.119
then Euclidean geometry works.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.050
If they are huge triangles, like the triangles
made on the sphere

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.469
by the lines of longitude and latitude, then
Euclidean geometry is no longer true.
