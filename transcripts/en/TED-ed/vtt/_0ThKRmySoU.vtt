00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:15.548
Good evening!

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:16.830
What's the matter?

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.142
Are you afraid of vampires?

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.259
He he, no need to worry,

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:23.100
I'm not staying for dinner.

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:24.125
(Laughter)

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.227
I'm here to guide you
through a brief history of vampires,

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.784
illustrating how our image has changed

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:33.068
from a shambling corpse

00:00:33.092 --> 00:00:36.277
to the dapper gentleman
you see before you.

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:39.951
Vampires are nearly as old as you humans.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.135
Stories about us, revenants,

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.644
appear in cultures extending
as far back as prehistoric times.

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:49.640
But we weren't called vampires back then

00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:54.706
and most of us did not look the way
we imagine vampires today.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.564
Ha, far from it!

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:59.234
For example, the Mesopotamian Lamashtu

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:03.729
was a creature with the head of a lion
and the body of the donkey,

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:05.302
and the ancient Greek striges

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:09.780
were simply described
as bloodthirsty birds.

00:01:09.804 --> 00:01:11.813
Others were even stranger.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:15.891
The Philippine manananggal
would sever her upper torso

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:19.617
and sprout huge, bat-like wings to fly.

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:23.435
The Malaysian penanggalan
was a flying female head

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:25.477
with dangling entrails.

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:26.673
(Laughter)

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:29.183
And the Australian Yara-ma-yha-who

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:32.010
was a little red guy with a big head,

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:33.316
a large mouth,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.920
and bloodsuckers on his hands and feet.

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:40.176
Oh, and let's not forget
the Caribbean's soucouyant,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109
the West African obayifo,

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.653
and the Mexican Tlahuelpuchi.

00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:45.690
(Laughter)

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:47.450
Charming, aren't they?

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.621
Though they may look vastly different,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:54.655
all of these beings have
one common characteristic:

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.037
They sustain themselves by consuming
the life force of a living creature.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.219
This shared trait
is what defines a vampire --

00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.393
all the other attributes
change with the tides.

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:11.051
So, how do we arrive

00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:14.390
at the reanimated fellow
you see before you?

00:02:14.414 --> 00:02:18.776
Our modern ideal emerges
in 18th-century Eastern Europe.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.422
With the dramatic increase
of vampire superstitions,

00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.560
stories of bloodsucking, shadowy creatures

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:29.970
become nightly bedside terrors.

00:02:29.994 --> 00:02:31.364
And popular folklore,

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:33.861
like the moroi among the Romani people

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:35.612
and the lugat in Albania,

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:39.524
provide the most common
vampire traits known today,

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:42.080
such as vampires being undead

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:45.587
and nocturnal and shape-shifting.

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:48.464
You see, Eastern Europe
in the 18th century

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:51.889
was a pretty grim place

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:57.171
with many deaths occurring
from unknown diseases and plagues.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:02.311
Without medical explanations,
people searched for supernatural causes

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:07.926
and found what looked like evidence
in the corpses of the victims.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.755
When villagers dug up bodies

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.756
to discern the cause
of the mysterious deaths,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.221
they would often find the cadavers

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:17.894
looking very much alive --

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:20.394
longer hair and fingernails,

00:03:20.418 --> 00:03:21.864
bloated bellies,

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:25.561
and blood at the corners of mouths.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.586
(Laughter)

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.095
Clearly, these people
were not really dead.

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.318
Heh, they were vampires!

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.152
And they had been leaving their graves

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:36.822
to feast on the living.

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:38.438
(Grunt)

00:03:38.462 --> 00:03:41.302
The terrified villagers
would quickly enact

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.849
a ritual to kill the undead.

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:45.906
The practices varied across the region,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.767
but usually included beheadings,

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.683
burnings, and staking
the body to the coffin

00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:54.742
to prevent it from getting up.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:55.780
(Laughter)

00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:58.223
Grizzly stuff!

00:03:58.247 --> 00:04:03.324
But what the villagers interpreted
as unholy reanimation

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:07.186
were actually normal symptoms of death.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.643
When a body decomposes,
the skin dehydrates,

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.394
causing the hair
and fingernails to extend.

00:04:14.418 --> 00:04:16.940
Bacteria in the stomach creates gases

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:18.548
that fill the belly,

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:22.136
which force out blood
and matter through the mouth.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.051
Unfortunately, this science
was not yet known,

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:28.691
so the villagers kept digging.

00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:32.560
In fact, so many bodies were dug up

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:34.266
that the Empress of Austria

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.477
sent her physician around
to disprove the vampire stories,

00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:43.791
and she even established a law
prohibiting grave tampering.

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:47.507
Still, even after the vampire
hunts had died down,

00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:52.225
the stories of legends survived
in local superstition.

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.473
This led to works of literature,
such as Polidori's "The Vampyre,"

00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:58.638
the Gothic novel "Carmilla,"

00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:03.611
and, most famously,
Bram Stoker's "Dracula."

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:06.697
Although Stoker incorporated
historical material,

00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:09.917
like Elizabeth BÃ¡thory's
virgin blood baths

00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:13.439
and the brutal executions of Vlad Dracul,

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:15.723
it was these local myths

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:18.975
that inspired the main
elements of his story:

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.231
the Transylvanian setting,

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:23.831
using garlic to defend oneself,

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:26.550
and the staking of the heart.

00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:30.562
While these attributes
are certainly familiar to us,

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:35.896
elements he invented himself
have also lasted over the years:

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.668
fear of crucifixes,

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:39.733
weakness in sunlight,

00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:43.895
and the vampire's inability
to see their reflection.

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.680
By inventing new traits,

00:05:45.704 --> 00:05:49.869
Stoker perfectly enacted
the age-old tradition

00:05:49.893 --> 00:05:54.356
of elaborating upon and expanding
the myth of vampires.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.476
As we saw, maybe you met my relatives,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.151
a huge of variety of creatures
stalked the night before Dracula,

00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:07.600
and many more will continue
to creep through our nightmares.

00:06:07.624 --> 00:06:12.628
Yet, so long as they subsist
off a living being's life force,

00:06:12.652 --> 00:06:15.265
they are part of my tribe.

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.706
Even sparkling vampires can be included.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.909
After all, it's the continued storytelling
and reimagining of the vampire legend

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.834
that allows us to truly live

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:29.389
forever.

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:30.842
(Ominous laughter)
