lot of people are probably familiar with
 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.690
lot of people are probably familiar with
now the challenge of this is that we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
now the challenge of this is that we
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.510
now the challenge of this is that we
didn't set up a structure for how we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
didn't set up a structure for how we
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.120
didn't set up a structure for how we
were going to figure out when and where

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
were going to figure out when and where
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730
were going to figure out when and where
it was appropriate to outsource and then

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
it was appropriate to outsource and then
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.620
it was appropriate to outsource and then
what were the rules and regulations

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
what were the rules and regulations
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630
what were the rules and regulations
under which they would operate and so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
under which they would operate and so
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.970
under which they would operate and so
we've been getting in many ways the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
we've been getting in many ways the
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.950
we've been getting in many ways the
worst of both worlds we haven't

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960
worst of both worlds we haven't
 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.870

smart client you haven't had enough

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
smart client you haven't had enough
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.940

market fluidity and then the flipside is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
market fluidity and then the flipside is
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770
market fluidity and then the flipside is
the legal structures have been very

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
the legal structures have been very
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.510
the legal structures have been very
absent and so you've had this sort of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
absent and so you've had this sort of
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.840
absent and so you've had this sort of
vacuum in terms of not only which laws

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
vacuum in terms of not only which laws
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.560
vacuum in terms of not only which laws
should apply but also a lack of will to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570
should apply but also a lack of will to
 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.660
should apply but also a lack of will to
apply them and so the result is that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
apply them and so the result is that
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.020
apply them and so the result is that

couldn't have done it without them but
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.570
couldn't have done it without them but
they've also been part of some of the
