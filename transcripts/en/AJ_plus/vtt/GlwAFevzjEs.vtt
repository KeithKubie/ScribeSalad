00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
All applicants for naturalization, please raise your right hands and repeat ...

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.200
These are a few of the United States’ 20 million naturalized citizens.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.820
They make up about half of the nation’s immigrant population.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.560
And the Trump administration’s laser focus on curbing immigration of all kinds

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.040
has put these Americans in the spotlight.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.440
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency is currently staffing up a new office

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.880
aimed at stripping naturalization from people who they say have cheated the process.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.800
In short: It’s a denaturalization task force.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.480
While the denaturalizations ramped up under the Obama administration, I don't think the average immigrant felt

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.880
any kind of fear because most people believe they weren't going to be a target of a denaturalization

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.640
application. There are also some changes coming to immigration law that will alter decades of practice.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.920
It’s much more enforcement- oriented.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.840
The denaturalization statute should not be used as a political tool to keep everyone

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.920
who becomes naturalized basically on their knees with their mouth shut

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.120
and as long as they obey and go along, then they'll be OK.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.960
The country’s immigrants could face unexpected consequences,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.480
including one high-profile naturalized citizen you wouldn’t have guessed.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.880
Hey fam, I’m Imaeyen. And you should subscribe to this channel right now, because this Sunday

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.440
we’re taking a close look at how not all citizenships are created equal,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.680
and the  one thing you should know if you’re facing denaturalization.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.940
Don’t come to our country illegally. Come

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.640
like other people do. Come legally.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.920
Anti-immigration rhetoric has been a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.700
part of Donald Trump’s political playbook even before he moved into the White House.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.840
But now the president’s agenda,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.040
which often has focused on

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.880
illegal immigration, is looking at those

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.140
who’ve already been naturalized

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.400
and those who seek to be.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.280
In a yet to be formally announced but expected proposal,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.480
the Trump administration wants to make it more difficult for legal immigrants

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.720
– aka those who did it the “right way” –  to become citizens.  People like this:

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.760
I wanted to become a citizen because there’s more opportunities here than there is in El Salvador.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:18.400
I am excited to be an American citizen so I can go and explore around the world.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.000
Trump’s plan, which is the brainchild of senior advisor Stephen Miller, wouldn’t need congressional approval

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And it would make it harder for legal immigrants to gain citizenship if they

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.600
– or anyone in their household – had ever used some types of public welfare programs.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.360
We’re talking about things like food stamps, Obamacare and even children’s health insurance.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.480
This is in addition to that June 2018 announcement by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, where it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.440
said it would double down on efforts to find fraudulent naturalization and revoke it.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.680
Philip Smith has been an immigration lawyer for 20 years, and he’s seen a large

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.420
increase in the number of immigration applications coming across his desk.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.420
It's busy.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.880
I'm getting questions from naturalized citizens. “Is this going to affect me?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.920
Are they going to try to take away my citizenship?"

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.040
There's more of a confrontational nature to the immigration applications.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.600
Smith says there are ebbs and flows in immigration enforcement, but this current climate is a distinct one.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.000
If you have an office, a government office whose job it is to take away people's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.040
citizenship, then it's only natural to expect that they're going to be looking to take away people's citizenship.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:44.400
I don't think we can ever be sure the government or any government official is acting in good faith.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.640
Now, before you begin skewering or praising Trump and his administration for their immigration policy, know this.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.850
It's Obama's administration that began

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.720
operation Janus, a program that existed

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.200
to ID people who may have committed

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.320
immigration fraud. So the same man that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.240
said  ... "We don't simply welcome new arrivals, we are born of immigrants.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.400
That is who we are."

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.560
… is the same person responsible for an uptick in denaturalizations,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.800
according to Alaska-based immigration lawyer Margaret Stock.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.440
The Obama administration took a lot of interest in them, and they were doing a lot more denaturalizations

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.440
than the prior administrations had done. Under the Trump administration, the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.400
process for applying for immigration benefits has become more technical, more legalistic,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.760
more adversarial, and people are more likely to have to resort to court action

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.640
in order to get their immigration benefits.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.880
So it’s not just felonies that can trap you in the intricate maze that is the nation’s immigration system.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.160
It has become increasingly technical and difficult to apply for citizenship. The forms used to be user- friendly.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.560
The forms used to be forms that the average person could understand. And that's not the case today.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.760
It has questions that most lawyers don't understand.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.960
Take a look at this naturalization form. It has 18 parts and dozens of questions.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.560
Things like: “Were your parents married before your 18th birthday?”

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.760
and the total number of children you have, including those who are missing or deceased.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.320
Then there’s this one: “Have you ever committed, assisted in committing

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.240
or attempted to commit a crime for which you were not arrested?”

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.400
hat covers your whole entire life. So you could presumably be

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.080
denaturalized some day if you answered that question “no.”

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.280
What they're trying to do is give themselves an excuse for taking away your citizenship decades later.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.040
Critics worry a question like that can be true for all of us, for nearly anything, like speeding.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.520
They say everyone would have to answer “yes” to that question,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.760
which would affect their chances of acquiring citizenship.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.360
In a very important Supreme Court decision you may have missed last year, the government argued it

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.680
has the right to revoke citizenship even for a seemingly inconsequential lie.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.320
The Obama administration took a denaturalization case all the way to the high court.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.880
The ruling came down in June 2017, which is months after Obama left office.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.240
The case basically teetered on one of the questions on that form we showed you earlier.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.840
Did a woman knowingly give false or misleading information while applying for any immigration benefit?

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.840
Here’s the tale.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.840
The government tried to revoke the citizenship of a Bosnian

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.840
woman who lied on her naturalization application.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.480
Diana Maslenjak  said that when her family fled sectarian violence in the 1990s,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.680
her husband had stayed in Serbia to avoid serving in the Bosnian Serb army.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.800
U.S. officials later learned that wasn’t true. Not only did the husband join his

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.069
family when they returned to Bosnia, but

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.539
he also served in the army. That detail was enough for immigration officials to seek to

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.380
seek to strip his wife's citizenship.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.120
The Supreme Court was quite stunned and startled that any misrepresentation would

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.120
lead to you losing your citizenship.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.960
The court said they shouldn't be taking away people's citizenship for some

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.200
immaterial falsehood that was on the application.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.880
The outcome of that case is very important, because it has helped set the table

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.360
for what’s happening now with the Trump administration.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.480
Stock says Trump’s team is using the Obama administration’s rationale to help push its agenda ahead.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.840
And the thing about denaturalization proceedings is that, unlike in a criminal case, you’re not entitled

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.000
to a lawyer if you’re unable to afford one. There’s also no statute of limitations.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.360
All these rules and this tension surrounding denaturalization of immigrants is so old.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.520
Let me show you. Mike, hit them with a tempo change.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.160
When Theodore Roosevelt signed the Naturalization Act of 1906 into law,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
it created a mechanism for denaturalizing citizens. It also federalized the naturalization

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
process for the very first time.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.240
The act was a revised version of an earlier law that required immigrants to learn

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.920
English in order to become naturalized citizens.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.080
Programming note: Unlike some other nations, the United States doesn’t actually have an official language.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.000
The law said you could lose your citizenship if you lacked “good moral character,” --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.720
that's a quote -- committed fraud, or if you were racially ineligible.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.880
Subsequent laws expanded the offenses, and at one point,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.680
women who married non-citizens could lose their citizenship status.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.680
But according to Smith, there’s another, more overlooked immigration law he says is draconian

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.320
and has become a political tool against people who the government didn’t see as loyal.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.040
We're dealing with the outcome of 1996 and that law to this day.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.520
And that was not something that Donald Trump did. That was something that Bill Clinton did.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.640
In terms of limiting immigration law, it's used every single day, thousands of times.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.360
President Bill Clinton signed the 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.600
in the aftermath of the deadly Oklahoma City bombing.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.280
It broadens the grounds for deporting immigrants. It also became the first law to approve fast-track deportations

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.240
– something that’s now widely used.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:00.520
After 9/11, where the government became more aggressive and began looking at the denaturalization

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:07.480
process as a potential counterterrorism tool, we've slowly seen an expansion of those cases.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.760
He says the result is the creation of two different classes of citizenship,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.120
because the law protects natural-born citizens in a way it doesn’t for naturalized citizens.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:28.720
It sends a chilling message to naturalized citizens that they are, in fact, not equal

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:40.600
If they were to engage in what is otherwise constitutionally protected activities such as

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:50.280
freedom of speech and religion, if the government were to interpret their activities as disloyal or threatening,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:56.680
then a government official could attempt to take away their citizenship.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.400
Both Smith and Stock say they have to be very thorough when going through clients’ histories.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.560
So while the Statue of Liberty may say, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.880
masses yearning to breathe free,” what it doesn’t say is whether you’ll be able to retain your citizenship,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.680
or that it'll be equal if you do.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.240
All of this emphasis could bring scrutiny to someone like Melania Trump,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.440
whose immigration history is a little murky.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.840
If Melania Trump, we're not the first lady, she would be the kind of immigrant who would be

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.440
worried about the current denaturalization proceeding.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.040
It appears she may not have been fully truthful with the government on past visa applications,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.480
possibly on her green card application. And if she had some misrepresentation in the past

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.440
and it wasn't disclosed to the government and connection with their naturalization application,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.360
then the government could go ahead now and take away her citizenship.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.920
Both of the lawyers we spoke with say it’s unlikely the government would pursue denaturalization

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.640
for something like lying about your weight or something similarly small.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.800
Stock says the government doesn’t even have the resources to go

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.560
after all the people it’s seeking. But she’s still already seeing an impact.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.360
Naturalization applications from service members have plummeted.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.280
They dropped 65% after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis directed additional background checks for

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.160
non-citizen troops in October 2017. The one thing Smith says you should know

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.200
is that if the government is looking to denaturalize you,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.080
it’s up to them to prove their case. They hold the burden of proof, not you.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.560
It should not be easy to take away someone's citizenship, because

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:36.160
if it were, then the individual would always have to be looking over their shoulder.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:42.760
They could never be comfortable or feel safe and secure and a complete and full member of our society.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.760
So it should be a difficult process.
