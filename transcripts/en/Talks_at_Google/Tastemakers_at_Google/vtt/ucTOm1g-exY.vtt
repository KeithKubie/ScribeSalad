&gt;&gt;Farzad: Hi everybody we're going to get
started.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.939
Thanks so much for coming out.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.959
&gt;&gt;Will Abramson: We should have brought note
cards

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:07.970
&gt;&gt;Farzad: My name's Farzad.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm with the Tastemakers team.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.250
This is Kavon, and –
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Tastemakers team as well.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.620
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Yeah, let's just jump right into
it.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.910
You guys all know why you're here.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.500
In three years the San Francisco-based Yours
Truly has become one of the hottest music

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.210
video brands on the web.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.949
Their mission, to discover and document, celebrate
and interrogate, capture and catapult those

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.990
artists who without question demand our affection.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.149
In three short years they've produced nearly
300 videos.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.550
Built a number of high-profile partnerships.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.929
And in the process have worked with some of
the hottest artists in indie music today.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.079
Just a few right here.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.450
ARA Music, Best Coast, Camera Obscura, Dam
Funk, Emma, Freddy Gibbs, Grimes, Holly Miranda,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.870
In Love, John Vanderslice, Kurt Vile, Local

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.049
Washed Out, Yellow Wolf and Zola Jesus.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.150
So that just leaves off Quincy Jones, and
the XX and you got the entire alphabet there.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.200
&gt;&gt;Will: They're in collaboration together.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.799
[Laughter]
Kavon: So today we are honored to be in conversation

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.750
with Will Abramson.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.979
We'll discuss his background.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.310
What makes Yours Truly, truly theirs.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.310
How they've grown.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.049
The obstacles they've faced.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.770
What they're cooking up and what's in store
for the future.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.400
Plus a little later we'll be hanging out with
Chris Chu who you just saw in that video.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.439
Of The Morning Benders, now Pop ETC. which
you'll also learn about later.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.630
The Hangout will be live from Brooklyn.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.320
We do ask that you stay until the end of the
video.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.369
We're gonna have two camcorders back there
and we don't want your head popping up.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.090
We tried to make… we're gonna make this
part of the Tastemakers series.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.869
So many of you were here for our first talk
for Steven Allen.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.140
This is The Morning Benders and Yours Truly.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.670
And then we'll also be doing 'One On One Design'
with Yves Behar.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.640
So without further ado please welcome to Google
Will Abramson.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.530
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Alright, well we thought a fitting

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.210
introduction for anyone who hasn't seen your
videos is a quick reel.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.530
This is from the series 'In My Room' that
you guys do with MTV.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.960
Let's check it out.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.820
&gt;&gt; Man: It's not for an event really.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820
It's not for money.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.710
It's not for like, there's no proper show.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.190
It's just; you're just playing your songs
again.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.190
[Guitar Music]
It's stripped down.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.541
There's just a group of people sitting around
you and you're playing your songs.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.541
[Guitar music gets louder]
&gt;&gt;Male singer: [singing] Put your dreams away

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.541
for now.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:45.250
I won't see you for some time.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.530
I am lost in my mind.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.110
I get lost in my mind.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.370
Mama once told me.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.590
You're already home when you feel love.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.950
I am lost in my mind.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.790
I get lost in my mind.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.180
&gt;&gt;Multiple singers: [singing] Whoo hooo hooo
hooo

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.790
Whoo hoooooooooo
Whoo hoo hoo hoo

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.630
&gt;&gt;Man: Those are always the shows that you
remember the most.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.620
You know, because you get like a genuine audience
reaction.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.590
Like you can play on a huge stage and you
can you know have great sound and every ones

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.590
into it.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.910
But then you walk backstage and you never
see those people.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.240
You don't get any like –
&gt;&gt;Woman: I think it's also more fun –

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240
&gt;&gt;Man: feedback.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.590
&gt;&gt;Woman: because you just don't you're not
afraid.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.540
[Guitar riff]
&gt;&gt;Woman: And so I'm just gonna go for it and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.670
I'm not nervous at all [giggles]
&gt;&gt;Man: Yeah.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.570
[Single guitar playing]
&gt;&gt;Multiple singers: [singing] I left first.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:55.230
&gt;&gt;Female singer: [singing] Because I knew
that this was cursed.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.370
No I never want to see you again.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:11.330
Left you hopeless high and dry yeah
&gt;&gt;Multiple singers: [singing] I moved on.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.000
&gt;&gt;Female singer: [singing] Because I thought
that I was strong.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.830
I was thinking about myself.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.960
&gt;&gt;Male: Not having it amplified kind of feels
like less official.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.830
So you can just kind I have fun—
&gt;&gt;Female: Yeah, totally.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.830
&gt;&gt;Male: you know.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.540
Like if it's not amplified all of the sudden,
like everything that happens is just—

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.550
&gt;&gt;Female singer: [singing in the background]
happening right now.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.460
[Guitar with background singing]
Which makes like playing the songs.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.760
You know like every time can be its own different
thing.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:57.320
You know it doesn't have to be played the
way that it supposedly played which is cool.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.940
&gt;&gt;Kavon: All right Will, where were you born
and raised and what did creativity meet you

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.570
growing up?

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.650
&gt;&gt;Will: I was born in New Hampshire but I
grew up in Cupertino.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.740
I come from a very musical stock.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.460
Both my grandmothers, one of which is sitting
right here played piano, my grandma played

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460
recorder.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.750
My dad would sing Beach Boys songs for me
in the bathtub when I was a baby.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.840
And on weekends my mom was cleaning the house,
she would play Frank Sinatra and George Gershwin

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.750
songs throughout the family stereo, pausing
only to make sure that I would slow dance

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.540
with her at least once a weekend.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.650
When I was in fourth grade, I saw my very
first show at the Shrine Amphitheater.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.460
It was my Dad's and I favorite band at the
time our R.E.M.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.460
And in sixth grade I proclaimed to my parents
that oasis was the second coming of the Beatles.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.461
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: By seventh grade I realized that they

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:45.110
weren't the second coming of anything.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: It was then that on family trips to

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.900
San Francisco my parents would drop me off
at Amoeba with the brownbag lunch so I could

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.680
spend the whole day looking for records.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.561
Senior year of high school, the same year
that I, my friends and I won a battle of the

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.190
bands for this rap group we were in called
All About Backflips.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: My future co-founder and best friend

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.480
and I Bob started a music magazine called
'Paper Airplane'.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.760
And it was also that same year that I realized
that you could actually study music industry

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.639
in school.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.460
And I think, I realized that I wanted to be
in the music business when I was grounded

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.270
on Halloween, my dad took me to see the movie
almost famous.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.780
And there's that really nerdy guy who hangs
out with rock stars and it was sort of then

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.550
that I realized that he wasn't nerdy at all,
he was the coolest dude I'd ever seen.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.110
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: And that's what I wanted to do.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.160
So creativity for me as a kid was really just
about pursuing whatever felt right.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.460
Like I was always journaling a lot
And when I discovered hip-hop I immediately

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.420
just started writing in the style that I was
listening to.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.960
I was never really musically inclined.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.580
Like I can read music and play piano but I
really just always approached music as a collector.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.800
You know I think it's just something that
has always spoken to me.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.540
And it was there from when I was a kid and
I can't imagine my life without it really.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.540
&gt;&gt;Farzad: so wait.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.540
Two things in there.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.610
One, as in the preparation for this interview
you didn't tell me about that hip-hop group.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.880
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Farzad: 'Cause you knew I would've found

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880
that.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
Uh—
&gt;&gt;Will: It's pretty embarrassing.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.140
&gt;&gt;Farzad: But secondly, you mentioned pursuing
a career in music.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.690
You found out about school and so, yeah, so
at what point did you make the decision to

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.390
go down to USC and then—
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah so—

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.390
&gt;&gt;Farzad: pursue the whole music thing?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.020
&gt;&gt;Will: When I was in high school, when I
graduated I went to Chico State which had

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.260
a really great music industry program.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.410
But there were aspects of that program that
I like.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.150
For example they had their own record label.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.180
They had a great college radio station.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.500
But it wasn't in one of the hubs for the music
industry which is New York and LA.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.710
So I applied to the music industry program.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.960
The Bachelor of Science in music industry
and got in.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.150
And so I moved to LA.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.870
In the first summer I got there before I went
to school I was interning at Universal.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.320
And so I interned from one o'clock until 7
PM in the afternoon.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.580
And before that to pay for my apartment I
was working at Coffee Bean from five in the

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.580
morning until noon.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.340
So I had that whole summer to sort of like
get ready for this transition I was making

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.449
to go to USC.

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:20.280
And USC was really, I kind of cut my teeth
just doing internships.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.710
And I became the hip-hop music director at
our radio station.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.830
It was there that I first interviewed an artist
for the first time.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.960
I had MeRs come on my show.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.889
And I also interviewed Atmosphere who in high
school was like my favorite rapper.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:39.209
And I'll never forget the feeling of just
being in the presence of someone that you

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:41.659
have such respect for and reverence for.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.300
And that nervous feeling you get, much the
same way as sitting out in front of an audience

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.290
of people that you don't know.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: But that same feeling that I had then

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.810
has transferred over to every single interview
I've ever done.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:09:00.319
And that feeling that I get when meeting someone
that you really love and have invested your

00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:03.850
emotions into is still so exciting to me.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.360
And I just kept chasing that throughout college
and then in my professional life when I graduated.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.029
Actually before I graduated I got an internship
at Yahoo music.

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:16.260
And then when I graduated I became a full-time
employee there.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.019
And founded the indie music department there.

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:26.430
And just tried to figure out how to fit interviewing
artists and being around artists into pretty

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.149
much every aspect of my job.

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:29.149
Wherever I could.

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:33.790
Cuz I just thought, I wanted to develop that
skill but I also just found it so exciting

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.899
and rewarding to.

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:38.209
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Let's talk about one of the first
endeavors you did.

00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:40.439
When you were working at imeem –
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:41.860
&gt;&gt;Farzad: at Yahoo I suppose.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.259
And that wasn't interview series called "Keys
to the city".

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:45.470
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.100
&gt;&gt; Will: Sure yeah so imeem was a streaming
music service.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.269
And I got there pretty early on when they
were still figuring out the strategy, their

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:54.959
content strategy.

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:59.449
And I have a lot of leeway to come up with
programs and launch programs that I thought

00:09:59.449 --> 00:10:01.690
would help market the brand in different ways.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.140
And so one of the sites main constituencies
whose hip-hop.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.040
So I started a documentary series called "Keys
to the city" where I would go to all these

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.089
various locales to document the local hip-hop
scenes and have rappers take me around their

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:16.089
hometowns.

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:17.089
The first one we did was in Philly.

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:21.199
It was The Roots and Diplo who participated
in that one.

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:27.940
And then, we went to Seattle to do a documentary
series about all the Seattle MC's who really,

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.649
it's like a really strong scene up there but
they haven't been able to launch any national

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:33.649
stars.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:34.800
But when you go there it's like this big fraternity.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.480
And the "Keys to the City" series was really
eye-opening because we were traveling on our

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.800
own dimes to do this.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.240
It didn't have any support from imeem.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.339
It was just stuff that myself and Bob would
do.

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:48.779
My partner Bob would do on the weekends.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:49.939
And so we flew ourselves to LA.

00:10:49.939 --> 00:10:54.230
We flew ourselves to Seattle and all over
the place to do this series cuz we thought

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.899
that these stories needed to be told.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:59.249
And this is my first experience with video
production at all.

00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:04.470
I mean we rent, we borrowed Bob's cousin's
kind of like crappy camera to go do this stuff.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.191
And we just went and tried it.

00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:11.240
And I think a lot of the skills that I acquired
from being an interviewer and being a producer

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.630
came from this trial and error that we were
getting in this "Keys to the city" series.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.319
We ended up getting some great acts.

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:22.309
Like we interviewed The Game and Compton around
LA.

00:11:22.309 --> 00:11:30.269
And Nate went up to Canada to do a piece on
Kardinal Offishall who's a really big Canadian

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:31.269
rapper.

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:35.209
They took him around Toronto for a couple
of days and he came back with some great stuff

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:36.209
from there.

00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:42.220
And it was also at imeem that I met both Nate
and Caleb who round out our founding crew

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.939
at Yours Truly.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:45.519
Nate was actually if you go to the next slide.

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:54.509
Nate was producing and shooting take away
shows which are basically kind of the grandfathers

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:59.249
of performance videos online and—
Farzad: So the difference isn't on "Keys to

00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:00.689
the city" was just interview strictly?

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:04.639
&gt;&gt;Will: it was interviews and just kind of
more in-depth documentary.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:08.029
So like, the funny thing is that not a lot
of that content is online.

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:11.100
Because it was all uploaded to imeem which
no longer exists.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.309
So you can't really go back and watch a lot
of the "Keys to the city" stuff.

00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:17.949
But we did stuff on Raphael Saadiq in Oakland.

00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:22.529
A bunch of great videos that I think are hopefully
on a hard drive somewhere.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:24.080
But they're definitely not online.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.660
&gt;&gt;Farzad: This is, 'The Take Away Show', started
about 2006.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.319
And that's from the blog called La Blogotheque.

00:12:30.319 --> 00:12:32.420
I'm sure you guys are familiar with them.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.589
They sort of had a network of bloggers and
you and Nate I guess both were.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.339
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah so Nate.

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:42.449
I didn't know Nate, but he was shooting take
away shows.

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:46.470
And he connected with the mission of the take
away shows and reached out to the founder

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.470
Chryde.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.679
And he was the San Francisco arm of the take
away shows.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:53.269
And I found Chryde separately just from being
a huge music fan.

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:58.050
And when Chryde came to San Francisco for
Noise Pop in 2007, he introduced me to Nate.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.750
He's like, you know one of the dudes from
the take away show lives here.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.869
And so immediately upon meeting Nate, he and
I started working on stuff together.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.809
We started producing videos that ended up
on imeem.

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:14.149
And producing take away shows like this Leaky
Lee take away show we shot on a beautiful

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:16.899
blustery San Francisco day.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:21.040
And it was also at that time that I met Caleb,
one of those like music industry schmooze

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.929
fest kind of things.

00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:28.170
And Caleb and I actually connected over our
mutual admiration for The Walkman, the band

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.180
The Walkman.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:34.819
And we actually just had the chance to shoot
The Walkman after years of kind of like waiting

00:13:34.819 --> 00:13:37.450
and hoping that we would get a chance to work
with them.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.279
&gt;&gt;Farzad: just on this past tour when they
were here.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.279
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, Yeah.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.279
Just on this past tour.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:43.850
They came for the 10 year anniversary show.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:49.699
So they came by studio Different Fur which
is on 19th and Valencia.

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:53.839
It's actually where we shot the very first
George Truly video with Waves.

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:59.230
And I think when he was doing the video, he
thought that he was shooting a take away show.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.230
And, surprise.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.560
This is a Yours Truly video.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kavon: so, I mean I feel like we've already

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:06.759
gotten uses of the story.

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:09.100
But kind of like what was missing in the music
industry?

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.769
Or what was missing in your view that kind
of you know birthed Yours Truly?

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:17.220
I mean I feel like we've heard a little bit
of adhesive, but put it together for us.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:23.610
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, I think you know we took a hard
look at the music landscape of the time.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.600
We saw these different verticals.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.499
There is a sales and subscription, there's
news and criticism, there's music discovery

00:14:30.499 --> 00:14:34.790
which the thousands of music blogs that we
read every day and there's music is lifestyle.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.040
And one of our biggest challenges was figuring
out how could we differentiate ourselves in

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.970
this already overcrowded space.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.320
What can we do to compel users to come to
Yours Truly instead of any of these other

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.699
music brands that they trusted every day.

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:52.089
And so in figuring out that value proposition,
one of the things that is just as important

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:56.149
to figuring out who you are is to figure out
what you're not.

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:59.769
And so we knew that you know if you wanted
a record review you go to Pitchfork.

00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:02.399
If you wanted to watch music video, you go
to YouTube.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.699
If you wanted to listen to an MP3, you go
to HypeMachine.

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:10.189
But if you wanted to learn more about an artist
beyond their MP3 or watching their music video.

00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:14.351
If you wanted to get to know them as people,
or to watch them create their craft you know

00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:16.301
firsthand like you were sitting right there.

00:15:16.301 --> 00:15:19.130
There really wasn't much out there for you.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.949
And so instead of you know trying to compete
with all these brands up here, we decided

00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:27.639
that if we were going to win we had to invent
our own game.

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:33.129
And so we use what skills we had which was
talented filmmakers, passionate journalists

00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:39.889
and we created a format to put the artists
that we loved in the best light possible.

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:44.029
And so what the take away shows we were doing,
was they were putting artists into their format

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:48.490
which was the take away show which to me is
still the most revolutionary format out there.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:54.299
But we decided that we wanted to adapt per
artist and give them whatever situation fit

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:55.829
them best.

00:15:55.829 --> 00:16:00.240
And from a brand perspective, it was really
just about focusing on what we thought we

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.429
could do really well and iterating on that
process and innovating within those confines.

00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:09.971
And so it's really just kind of a choice between
do you want to be McDonald's or do you want

00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:11.220
to be In and Out Burger?

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.970
McDonald's has something for everyone.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.480
You know they got chicken nuggets, and those
suck and the Big Macs suck too.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.670
But when you go to In and Out Burger and you
know that there's three things on the menu

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.809
and everything is good.

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:25.100
You know exactly what you're getting and you
get it every single time.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.949
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Nice, alright so –
&gt;&gt;Farzad: So, you're not inspired –

00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:28.949
&gt;&gt;Farzad and Kavon: by McDonald's.

00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:29.949
&gt;&gt;Will: I'm not inspired by McDonald's.

00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:30.949
&gt;&gt;Farzad: That's a good segue.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:35.689
&gt;&gt;Will: Although apparently when I was a baby
my nickname was William "the refrigerator"

00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:36.689
Perry.

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:39.679
They called me "The Fridge", and apparently
I could put down like three cheeseburgers

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:40.679
as a two-year-old.

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:43.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kavon: So I think that people love, I mean

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.429
I definitely do and maybe I'm just gonna latch
on to like making this a question.

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:48.429
Like what are you inspired by?

00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:52.639
I mean I feel like I watch some your videos
and I have such a distinct Yours Truly take

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.639
on this.

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:57.619
Like you've almost created your own genre
or your own way of approaching music.

00:16:57.619 --> 00:17:00.730
What do you guys look for in inspiration right?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.420
What inspires you guys or you know sent you
on this path.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.569
&gt;&gt;Will: Sure, I think you know there are four
of us that do Yours Truly and each of us have

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.380
different points of inspiration.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.439
And it's a combination of those four people
who come from very different backgrounds with

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.709
very different sets of tastes that make Yours
Truly what it is.

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:23.049
But we also agreed on a few things about the
brand.

00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:26.419
You know, we agreed on a few things we wanted
the brand to stand for.

00:17:26.419 --> 00:17:30.090
But in terms of inspiration, I get it from
a couple of things.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.559
Wax Poetics magazine is one of my all-time
favorite magazines.

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:37.860
It's incredibly well done, well researched.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.740
It's basically about soul music and Latin
music and African-American culture throughout

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.740
the years.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.370
Their photo of the guy with the pink sunglasses
is taken by Jason Nocito who's the principal

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.630
photographer at The Fader magazine.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:58.180
The bicycle is by William Eggleston who's
largely considered to be the father of color

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.180
photography.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:04.870
Aaron Rose is kind of your Renaissance man.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.650
He the curator of 'The Beautiful Losers'.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:13.090
And just he really straddles the line between
commercial and fine art.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:18.070
There's also Geoff McFetridge on there which,
his hand has touched so many major brands.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.210
Pepsi, Nike, New York times you name it.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.090
Jay-Z is kind of the king of the brand extension
in my opinion.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:30.470
You know Jay-Z may not sell the most records,
but he's by far the most well respected artist.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.220
And he's been able to take the equity in his
brand and apply it to so many different areas

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.820
which is truly amazing I think.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:45.330
So, and then, the black-and-white image you
see is a film by Bruce Weber on the saxophone

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.700
player Chad Baker.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.889
And that film you know shot on 16mm black-and-white
is just such an amazing portrait of that artist.

00:18:52.889 --> 00:18:57.000
It's completely unflinching and a brave portrait
of him.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.100
And ultimately what we wanted to do was set
out to tell stories.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.990
And what the thing in common that all of these
things have is that these are all brands that

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.460
do a great job of presenting stories in the
most honest and direct way possible.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.850
At the very base of it, you know these are
inspiration points.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.529
These are influences of ours.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.890
But at the end of the day it's really the
music.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.940
I mean there is no better feeling than finding
a new artist.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.130
Like I get no bigger rush that when Caleb
sends me a band that I've never heard of.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.750
Or when I find a band on the blog or on MySpace
or Band Camp that I've never heard of.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.080
And it's like you start listening and it's
really good in then you're like "Oh God please

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.390
stay good, please stay good."

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.519
And then it keeps being good and then—
[Laughter]

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:42.850
&gt;&gt;Will: and then the songs over and you're
like, "Oh My God, if this band has one more

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.210
good song it's over."

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: so like it's really just the music.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.760
And there is so much that, there is no shortage
of inspiration out there.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.980
You know every day, or at least every week
I try to make sure to find one band that blows

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980
me away.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:00.980
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Thank you Internet.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.130
&gt;&gt;Will: yeah, thank you Internet.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.910
&gt;&gt;Farzad: So discovery is a big part of Yours
Truly.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.590
But also can you tell us about sort of the
visual and philosophical concepts behind the

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.590
brand.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.590
In particular the logo.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.590
&gt;&gt;Will: Sure.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.590
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Which is absolutely beautiful by
the way.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.590
It's –
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.590
&gt;&gt;Kavon: It's very distinctive.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:23.330
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, we spent about six months every
weekend and most weekend nights at Bob's house

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.020
trying to figure out how to present this logo.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:32.080
And Bob who's the designer of this logo is
our creative director and he's a graphic designer

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.080
by trade.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.950
And so a lot of our graphical influences come
from his vision.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:42.000
And basically what we decided on was we wanted
to think about what Yours Truly really was

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.399
at its core.

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:46.190
And ultimately what we're doing is we're shadowing
artists.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.440
We're following them around.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.440
We're capturing their stories, but ultimately
we're watching them.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.040
We're standing behind them.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.040
We're shadowing them.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:00.419
And so, this idea of T shadowing the Y comes
from that philosophy that we are there to

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:04.990
you know discover and document, capture and
catapult and ultimately shadow these artists

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.460
that we admire.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.559
And deserve to be covered by us.

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:12.630
&gt;&gt;Farzad: When you started to get this thing
off the ground, before anybody really knows

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.630
who you are.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.080
I mean how do you actually gain access to
artists?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.120
&gt;&gt;Will: We booked it through a publicist that
I knew named Daniel Gill who represents a

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.179
lot of great bands.

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:23.620
And Waves was in San Francisco.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.899
This was really you know right before he started
to get some, started to get some traction.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:32.309
I think a lot of it has to do with getting
onto bands early.

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:35.429
You know getting involved in their careers
early on before they blow up.

00:21:35.429 --> 00:21:38.390
And there's a lot of evidence of that with
Yours Truly.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:43.120
And it's like artists before they get big
are just more flexible, easier to work with,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.690
have more time.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.200
But one of the biggest things was the fact
that we were in San Francisco.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.690
So, you know bands have a lot to do in LA.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.120
They have a lot to do in New York.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.490
But often times they are just hanging out
in San Francisco because there's really no,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.130
there really was no media outlet.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.309
Like Yours Truly in San Francisco.

00:22:00.309 --> 00:22:05.630
So we were able to get access to bands based
on my relationships and Caleb's relationships

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.780
with label people, with publicist.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.919
With managers and with bands.

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:14.610
But ultimately it was just the quality of
the work we were able to show them early on.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.460
You know we shot that first Waves video and
the band loved it.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.920
I was able to get it on Gorilla Versus Bear
and Fader and Stereo Gum and Pitchfork right

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920
from the outset.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.900
So right away we were building a case study
for what Yours Truly could be and what the

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.940
benefits for you a band would be for doing
Yours Truly.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.909
And I think this slide is actually meant to
talk about the brand of Yours Truly.

00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:43.130
And I kind of want to do that for a sec if
I can.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.240
So everything about Yours Truly begins and
ends with the name.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.409
"Yours Truly".

00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:49.790
Which is a way to sign a letter.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.769
And a lot of our core values come from this
act of letter writing.

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:57.919
So "Yours Truly" stands for careful curation.

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.600
Because you're not just gonna write a letter
to anyone.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.550
If you're gonna put the time and effort into
writing some a letter you have to make sure

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.799
that that person is going to reciprocate or
they're really worth the time and effort you're

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:09.799
willing to put in.

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:12.490
So we think about that every time we choose
bands.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.580
"Yours Truly" stands for high quality but
handcrafted.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.280
If you're gonna write a letter, then you're
gonna do your best to you know give your best

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280
penmanship.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.960
Even though mine is always terrible.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.110
[Laughter]
But you're gonna do your best to make it look

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.110
good.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.320
But at the same time, like if you mess up
or something that's just part of the fact

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320
that there's a human writing it.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.250
And so we want people to see that Yours Truly
is made by real people who really care about

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.490
what they are doing.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:44.460
And lastly, when you write a letter you want
to be proud to sign the letter and then give

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.260
that letter to someone.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.260
This is yours.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.639
Truly.

00:23:49.639 --> 00:23:52.549
And so we think about that every time we make
a video.

00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:55.390
You know this is kind of a little gift for
the bands.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.690
It gives them another reason to go out and
get people to fall in love with them.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.490
It's a gift to fans, to get to see another
side of an artist that they didn't get to

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.490
see.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.519
Or to discover an artist they never knew existed.

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:07.620
Or to hear an artist speak for the first time.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.950
And for us, the gift is that we get to spend
this time with these musicians that we a lot

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:19.299
of times have crushes on or love and adore
or just are really passionate about.

00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:23.410
&gt;&gt;Farzad: I think the next thing we want to
talk about is sort of what is your model for

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.620
marketing and distribution?

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.620
On the web.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.639
&gt;&gt;Kavon: I mean you guys don't have ads on
your website.

00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:30.639
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:24:30.639 --> 00:24:33.600
&gt;&gt;Kavon: You don't have mass marketing campaigns.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.060
You know, I mean, everyone here works at Google,
so we know that revenue, you don't need revenue

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.060
right away.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.799
But kinda like what is your plan.

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.799
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:47.370
So I sort of equate the Yours Truly business
model to two cross-sections of a house.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.139
The outside of the house is the beautiful
facade, the architecture, the big open windows,

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:53.840
the fresh coat of paint.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.389
And that's the Yours Truly brand.

00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:57.669
That's what we've been really developing this
whole time.

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:02.629
So whether you see it on our website on our
Facebook our Twitter our Tumbler or you watch

00:25:02.629 --> 00:25:07.620
it on our channel on Pitchfork TV or you see
Yours Truly videos on any of the blogs that

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.929
we push out to.

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:10.950
Or our partnership with MTV.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:16.210
This the strength in the brand that's been
able to get us these integrated partnerships

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:23.510
with brands like MTV, Pitchfork, Odyssey which
is a local speaker company.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.159
We've also done stuff with Levis and Urban
Outfitters.

00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:30.620
And so it's this strength in the brand that's
been able to give us these opportunities to

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.710
make partnerships where our brand and their
brand are getting married for short period

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.149
of time to do these series.

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:42.080
And that feeds the other side of the house
which is Yours Truly's services.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:49.990
Where we offer production services to brands,
to media companies like Pandora or MTV or

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:58.720
beer brands or companies like Levis, like
Chevy, W hotels, Braun, Aces.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.250
Any number of these companies that see the
work that Yours Truly does in its public facing

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.250
side.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.981
And, you know, attached themselves to that
work and then realized that we would be a

00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:12.190
great fit for a series that they're producing
for their own purposes.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:18.889
So it's sort of this hybrid model of we are
a public facing brand and an editorial brand.

00:26:18.889 --> 00:26:23.029
But we're also a production company offering
production services.

00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:27.510
And it's a cool reciprocation because you
know just last week someone from an agency

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.600
reached out and they said you know, "I really
like the way Yours Truly videos look I want

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.750
to do a series on several artists for a beer
brand that I'm working on."

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:41.700
And so in that case, we offer our producers
and directors to go execute whatever campaigns

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.309
that they're trying to do.

00:26:43.309 --> 00:26:47.330
And that's a good way for us to make money
so that we can continue to do all the free

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.169
editorial stuff that we really want to do.

00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:51.169
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Yeah.

00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:53.779
And so tell us about how the web has like
played into that right?

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:56.970
I mean you guys are a blog, or started as
a blog right?

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.970
And so—
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.059
&gt;&gt;Kavon: what is the web allow you to do?

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:03.620
And like kind of compare yourself to maybe
even a traditional record company right?

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.690
What are you guys using?

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.360
How are you using technology to replace certain
aspects of it?

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.440
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the decisions
were made early on.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.679
And this has a lot to do with the fact that
we decided not have advertising was that if

00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:20.120
you want to sell advertising, you have to
drive traffic to your site.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.390
But what we wanted to do was to create a push
model where instead we would focus on the

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.070
content and getting the content out to as
many places as possible.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.019
Rather than trying to suck people back to
our site.

00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:38.039
So as soon as we release a video, we're encouraging
all the blogs who are fans of this band to

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:40.600
post our video and to link back to our site.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.049
So that's to help drive home the brand equity.

00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:46.500
But also to just expand the reach of our content
itself.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.629
Because we've always been about the content.

00:27:48.629 --> 00:27:50.620
The content creation process.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.080
So, we always have had this push model where
we are leveraging all the assets that are

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.480
created in the process.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.940
So there's the video, there's the audio of
the session that will upload to Soundcloud

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.600
that will route through our Facebook or our
Twitter

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.169
And in an effort to get more likes, or get
people to re-tweet.

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:11.190
We do contests for tickets and giveaways and
stuff like that.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.049
And basically it's just about leveraging the
assets that are created while were shooting

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:16.049
the band.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:19.440
So while were shooting bands, we're taking
instagram photos and posting those posting

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.059
that to Facebook.

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:26.080
And really it's kind of a different way than
a lot of bands approach.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.970
Sorry not bands, a lot of websites approach
building a brand.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.620
But for us it's worked.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:38.090
It's gotten us to be featured and in conversations
on all these sites that are outside of our

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.090
network.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.980
And to get people to you know, maybe if they
see it the first time they'll just watched

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.980
the video.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.360
But maybe if they keep seeing content on these
other sites that they already go to and they

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.740
keep seeing this link to Yours Truly, they'll
end up coming back and realizing that we have

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.499
this huge catalog of bands that we've been
shooting.

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:56.730
Pieces that we've collected over the years.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.529
That's kind of how we've done it.

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.799
&gt;&gt;Kavon: You guys have done a great job.

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:00.799
&gt;&gt;Will: Thanks bud.

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:01.920
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Love that graphic back there.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.340
&gt;&gt;Farzad: So before we get into more of how
you guys are using the web and actually South

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.159
By Southwest where on one and the musicians
and then the interactive side sort of came

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:13.460
together, met in the middle and you guys were
actually out there together for a day or two.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.460
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.960
&gt;&gt;Farzad: We want to watch something brand-new
from you guys.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.280
This is actually, I think it's sort of premiered
on YouTube music.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.169
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Farzad: That's where I first saw it.

00:29:22.169 --> 00:29:25.919
Jacob McPherson from the YouTube team threw
this up on the web a couple days ago where

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.929
you guys were featured on the music page.

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:29.380
So let's check it out.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.120
This is a really cool video.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.440
&gt;&gt;Lee Fields: Oh, man I feel good today.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.100
Had to get that out, you know.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.500
You got a laugh inside you sometimes.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.500
A lot of people don't know.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.799
But my, I live by the rules of if you keep
a laugh on the inside it'll hurt you later.

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:49.330
So if you got a laugh, laugh I don't, let
it go.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.179
Don't hold it down.

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:56.500
I believe laughter is a good remedy.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.899
I'm not a doctor; don't claim to be a doctor.

00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:00.220
I'll let the doctors be Doctors and lawyers
be lawyers, politicians be the politicians.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.749
I'm a singer, that's what I do.

00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:52.679
Trying to clear my mind.

00:30:52.679 --> 00:30:53.679
I saw you eyeing me.

00:30:53.679 --> 00:30:54.679
It was plain to see.

00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:55.679
Said I was a married man.

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:56.679
Said you were 23.

00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:57.679
Don't make me do wrong.

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.679

&gt;&gt;Lee Fields: We were just hanging out.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.240
Didn't mean a thing.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.990
But when I start walking out, something came
over me.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.860
Never felt so guilty.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.070

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.409

&gt;&gt;Lee Fields: Came along.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.500
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Very cool
[Applause]

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.500
&gt;&gt;Will: I had just made him breakfast in our
kitchen right before he did that.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.500
And we had chickens in the backyard of the
house.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.500
And so, he was, he wouldn't shut up about
the fact that we had fresh eggs.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.990
"I haven't had fresh eggs since 1973 and they
don't taste the same."

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:35.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Will: But when he did that scream, that

00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.100
like animals scream, I swear the house was
like reverberating.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.420
It was insane.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.900
It was really fun
&gt;&gt;Farzad: So that was something you guys filmed

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.900
in Austin?

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.900
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:49.150
So we were up out there from Monday to Monday
this year.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:54.480
So one of our official showcases which the
white poster right there.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.510
That was during interactive, so it was the
last night of interactive.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.820
And Caleb produces all of our events.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.360
So he put together this event and then another
event in partnership with Gorilla Versus Bear.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.630
That's the poster on the right.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.020
So that was at the Hype Machine hotel.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.140
They have different bloggers curate different
shows.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:17.710
And so we did those two official showcases
and then the poster with the state of Texas

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.290
on it is a poster for our 'In My Room' series.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.390
Which is in partnership with MTV.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.120
And then there's just some stills there.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.470
&gt;&gt;Kavon: You guys were really busy.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.450
&gt;&gt;Will: We were very busy yeah.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.950
It was a lot of fun, but we shot 10 different
bands and we had those shows.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.880
It took a lot of, bunch of meetings.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.340
And just catch up with people in the music
business that you only know over e-mail over

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.340
the phone.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.840
It's like so that what you look like in person.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.140
So there was a lot of that that goes on to.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.350
But it was tons of fun.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:48.550
And that was the first piece that we released
from our South By Southwest section.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.180
That Lee Fields video.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.830
&gt;&gt;Kavon: So your label, 'Love Letters Inc.'

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.830
&gt;&gt;Will: Mmm hmm.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.580
&gt;&gt;Kavon: you know it really kind of, you guys
are in on.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.870
In business terms you're like vertically integrated
right.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.700
Kind of going end to end.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.800
Can you give us kind of a sense of your plan
is in that sense.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.760
I mean are you guys, like gonna be the first
people to go from a blog to a full blown record

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.760
label.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760
&gt;&gt;Will: We wouldn't be the first no.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.570
There's plenty of—
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Yeah, there's a lot of people.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.290
&gt;&gt;Will: there's plenty of examples of that
actually.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.370
One of the best examples is a blog out of
the UK called Transparent Blog.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.450
And they released the first Washed Out single
and a bunch of other ones.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.690
And now one of the guys has an imprint on,
Domino Records.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:32.960
But our idea with Love Letter Inc. was really
just to; it's kind of a brand extension of

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.960
Yours Truly.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.180
It's really based on our love for physical
objects.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.180
Just like letters.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.610
We love to be able to hold something.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.740
So we wanted to be able to give our fans something
that they could hold.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.560
Something that we could design.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.220
Something that we could be involved in from
start to finish.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.230
So when bands are coming through San Francisco
to do Yours Truly sessions.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:57.160
They're playing songs they've written for
an album of theirs or an EP of theirs.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.300
Or something that they've done themselves.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.760
But in order to keep innovating, in order
to keep you know doing something new with

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.370
our format we wanted to get involved earlier
on in the process.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.250
So in the songwriting process.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.170
Or in the recording process.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:16.260
And we wanted to offer our fans and fans of
these bands better insight into what that

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.260
process was like.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.320
What does it take to make a record?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.860
So the first record that we ended up doing
was this Big K.R.I.T record.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:29.350
And Big K.R.I.T put out a mix tape that I
listened to and loved and this was before

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:30.400
he got signed at Def Jam.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:33.370
And was kind of like a full-fledged rap star
now.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.960
But I begged his manager to fly out to San
Francisco.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.300
And I was gonna put them in the studio with
this great local R&amp;B band.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.550
So he came to San Francisco, crashed on my
couch for a couple of days and we made this

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.550
EP.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.370
And that became the first Yours Truly release.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.230
And the second one 'How to Dress Well'.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.560
The white background with the image in the
middle.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.550
That was a tribute record of the 'How to Dress
Well'.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:38:00.220
Tom who is managed by Caleb.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.790
One of his best friends died.

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.990
And so what he wanted to do is this EP called
'Just Once'.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:10.550
Where he would do orchestral versions of his
songs that we would release on 10 inch vinyl.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.430
And make available for sale.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:18.230
And the one thing that's unique but is also
common to each of the releases is that they

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.000
each have a charity element to them.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.060
The Big K.R.I.T record, 100% of the proceeds
go to the, go to charity.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:31.430
The Nitro records, and 'How to Dress Well'
record, one dollar of every sale goes to charity.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.940
So what we really wanted to do was create
these physical objects and be involved in

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.260
the record making process.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.030
But also, create something that we could use
to get back to the communities that deserve

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.030
it.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.350
&gt;&gt;Kavon: You know I keep on hearing the word
create with you guys and that's what I love

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.350
about you.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.350
It's like you're always you know.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:48.980
You always, you didn't see that there were
like these behind the scenes videos.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980
So you went and created them right?

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.230
And now it's like you want your vinyl records
right?

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.230
So you're gonna go and create them.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.510
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Kavon: What else do you guys, you know,

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.200
what other project you guys got up your sleeves?

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.520
Like what else is going on with the Yours
Truly.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.150
&gt;&gt;Will: You know were constantly producing
videos.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:08.860
And it's these short either short form documentaries
to performance pieces to these making of pieces.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.790
We're doing EPKs and you know making of album
pieces.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:15.821
We did a live concert DVD of the documentary.

00:39:15.821 --> 00:39:20.450
But really what we're looking forward to this
year is bringing the Yours Truly experience

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:21.790
into the living room.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.990
Which is something that I know YouTube is
focused on too.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.250
As well as Vimeo.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.580
Bringing Yours Truly into the living room.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.840
Improving the Yours Truly site.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.710
Getting Yours Truly on iPads and iPhones.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:38.880
Just improving our distribution model to get
you, into as many eyeballs in as many homes

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.880
as possible.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.500
As well as to continue to produce the same
high-quality content that we have been doing

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.500
all along.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.980
But I'll give you kind of a sneak preview
of one project that I'm excited about.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.990
It's the Stagger Lee project.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:40:00.980
So in 1895 in a St. Louis saloon this pimp
and hustler and notorious character named

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:06.830
Stagger Lee shot Billy Lyon in the back of
the head for trying to steal his Stetson hat.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:12.270
And so this story that happened in the late
1800s as soon as it happened it swept through

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:19.700
the South and it was played and covered by
whorehouse pianist to just pool balladeers.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.830
And passed along before recorded music ever
occurred.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.990
Just as sort of a folktale.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:31.720
And every time whoever sang it would reinterpret
it and Stagger Lee gets scarier and scarier.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.750
And he's just this bad villain like character.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.710
And then when recorded music came around,
the song has since been recorded over 400

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:44.790
times by Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Bo Diddley.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.490
You name it, the Black Keys.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.930
You name it, someone has a version of the
song.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:55.590
And so this character of Stagger Lee, this
badass character has been translated into

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.350
all these different forms of music except
for the one form that I think it really fits

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.770
and that's hip-hop.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:06.530
And so what I wanted to do was to update the
Stagger Lee saga for the 21st century.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:14.040
To basically find two artists who could play
the parts of Stagger Lee and of Billy Lyon.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.220
But before they do that, I wanted them to
steep themselves in the history of blues music.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.950
Which is what created this song.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.350
So the idea is to send Big K.R.I.T.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.420
And Yellow Wolf down to the Mississippi Delta.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:32.310
To have them take a trip to Clarksdale Mississippi
where BB King was born and Robert Johnson

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.340
was born.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.030
And to basically soak up the roots of blues
music and to use that influence to create

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.410
a new version of the Stagger Lee song.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.730
And we would create a documentary about that
journey.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.590
A documentary about the making of that song.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:46.710
Release that song.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.720
Do a music video for that song.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:53.980
And basically what the goal is to bridge the
gap between this American roots and folk music

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.750
that it has influenced not only hip-hop but
R&amp;B and rock 'n roll.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:05.850
And try and bridge the gap between what kids
are listening to today and this great tradition

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:09.030
of American music that is in danger of extinction.

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.120
And I just remember reading the story for
the first time and just thinking this has

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.310
to be told.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.460
And then when I finally heard Big K.R.I.T's
music, I realize that he was the guy who could

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.410
play Stagger Lee because he's from Mississippi.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.740
He's a producer.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.600
His music is so bluesy and soulful and I thought
you're the guy, your Stagger Lee.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:33.500
So we have this idea, and it's really just
something were trying to get made at this

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.500
point.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.330
&gt;&gt;Farzad: That sounds really awesome.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.910
Got a little bit of time left.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:44.410
And I think that means that it's time to jump
on our hangout with Chris who you might've

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.280
heard for a second there.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.420
So I'm just going to move the computer up
so that he can see us all.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.420
Or at least see us up here.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.580
And yeah, let's try to do this.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.290
&gt;&gt;Will: Is he hanging out?

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.000
&gt;&gt;Farzad: hopefully this works.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.650
Chris are you here?

00:42:58.650 --> 00:42:59.930
There he is.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.050
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Hey you guys.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.750
Hey how are you?

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.030
We got Farzad.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.000
&gt;&gt;Kavon: What's up dude, thanks for coming.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.200
[Laughter]
Virtual Reality.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.750
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Seeing the side of your face,
it looks good.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.260
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Awesome.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.220
Chris, thanks so much for taking the time
to be with us.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.680
Of course one of the most celebrated videos
from Yours Truly comes from The Morning Benders'

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.680
"Excuses".

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.610
I think we all pretty much fell for it the
first time we saw it.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:29.610
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Instantaneously.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.910
&gt;&gt;Farzad: I think it's been well, I'll ask
you.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:36.620
What's it been like for the band, what was
it like making the video, what was the reaction

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.620
which guys got?

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:38.980
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: It was great honestly.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.950
Just thinking back to that day is so special.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:48.650
And I think, we've done a lot of sessions
and music videos and stuff like that.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:53.760
And almost 95% of the time we do them we have
no idea how it's gonna turn out and it's just,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.680
you kind of let it go and we just hope for
the best it.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.190
But when we did that session, we just felt
like this is gonna be something special.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.500
We knew it from the moment I think that we
were done that day.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.986
And then we saw the first captures we were
blown away.

00:44:08.986 --> 00:44:09.986
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Awesome.

00:44:09.986 --> 00:44:12.300
And you know what did it do for you guys as
a band?

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.690
I mean like people see music videos but nothing
quite like that.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.100
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.820
I feel like that was one piece of content
above anything else that we've ever done that

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.520
people knew about us.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.180
You know we went on tour all over the world
and by far the most common thing people would

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:38.630
say was you know I love seeing you guys play
that song on the roof.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:39.650
Playing that song on Yours Truly or whatever.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.650
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Yeah
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: People definitely got the word

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.810
out about it spread around which is most powerful
thing you can do.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:44.880
&gt;&gt;Farzad: That's awesome.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.610
Well, we do hope that you guys have plans
to work with Yours Truly in the future.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.210
But not as a morning Benders, it's going to
be as POP ETC.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.800
Can you tell us a little bit about the name
change and what we can expect from the new

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.150
group if you could call it that?

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.150
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Yeah.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:05.730
Well I wrote kind of a detailed explanation
of why we changed the name.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.410
Which I can go into just briefly I guess.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.090
We have time for that?

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.090
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Sure.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.090
Just briefly that's fine totally.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:17.440
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Yeah, I mean we named our band
Morning Benders early on like a lot of bands

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.350
do without thinking about it very much.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:20.970
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris: I mean we thought it was funny or

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.450
whatever and didn't think much about it.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:33.510
But we found out at some point like about
a year and a half or two years down the line

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:39.860
that there's this alternate meaning in the
UK and Europe that "benders" is kind of like

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.960
a slang word or the equivalent of fag or gay
as used in America.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.640
Like kids call somebody "gay" thinking it's
funny.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:53.840
And you know were not like super PC guys or
felt like, you know.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:54.840
It's not like something we would correct someone
on the street and yell at them.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.840
But when it comes to our band and what we
are associated with it just made sense for

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.270
us to not be associated with that.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:05.340
Because it felt like it was giving off this
feeling or this expression that isn't in keeping

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.120
with how we feel and how we lead our lives.

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.120
It just, it became ignorant.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.770
You know kids thought we were making a joke
against gays.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.280
That's just, that's not a joke we would make
you know.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.570
So were POP ETC. now.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.600
And we have a lot of exciting stuff.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.670
&gt;&gt;Will: And killer tunes.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:22.700
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Yeah.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:28.310
If you guys haven't heard the new mix tape
yet, you can download it for free on their

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.560
website popetc.com is that right?.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:31.850
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Yeah.

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.680
&gt;&gt;Farzad: And do you think also the new band
name in some ways is a prelude to the new

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.680
sound?

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:43.210
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah, I was telling Will the other
day that the motivation behind the name change

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:45.310
was well what I just told you.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.640
But it definitely aligned itself with this
creative changes well.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.550
We have a whole different set of stuff.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:58.260
And we've always told all our fans that we
want to change, were not creatively satisfied

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.260
by staying in the same place.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.770
So I know people get their hopes up and they
want to hear Big Echo 2 again or whatever.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.470
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris: but we just can't.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.970
I think there's a lot of bands do do that
over and over again.

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:14.950
They make five or six albums that sound generally
the same.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:18.700
Which is great for some people, but for us
it's not how we want to do it.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:23.510
So yet we have this great mix tape out.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.180
And we got a full album coming after that.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.090
And hopefully some cool videos and stuff as
well.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.400
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Very exciting.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.170
So, do you know, do you guys actually have
a release date for that yet?

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.790
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: We don't have an exact release
date.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:36.820
But it'll be sometime over the summer like
early summer.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.100
It's a very summery album, so we wanted to
align with that.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.100
&gt;&gt;Farzad: OK.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.720
And hopefully coming back to play a hometown
show if I could call it that.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.720
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Oh yeah.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:45.720
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Sometime soon?

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.720
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: of course.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.540
Yes it's definitely a hometown show.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.850
We still consider ourselves Bay Area kids.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.350
And we talked a lot about how we're gonna
and end up back there.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:58.440
So next time hopefully I'll be in the room
with you we all at Google can hang out.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.990
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Hey, that would be awesome.

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.200
&gt;&gt;Farzad: You're welcome any time.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.200
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Yep.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.200
Chris, do you wanna actually.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200
Chris do you have like 10 minutes?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.560
Or do you have like 6 minutes?

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.560
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Yeah.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.790
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Cuz we might open up to questions.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:13.940
And we can have you and will respond to people's
thoughts and questions interrogations.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.510
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Sure.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.920
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Do we have a microphone?

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.920
&gt;&gt;Chris Chu: Hanging out.

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.920
&gt;&gt;Kavon: Alright cool yeah, hangout.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.310
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kavon: that was a marketing plug.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.900
We paid him to say that.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:27.650
Do we have a microphone or no?

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:28.770
That thing work?

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:33.220
Perfect, does anybody have any questions or
Yours Truly or Chris Chu.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:34.220
Lisa.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.220
&gt;&gt;Lisa: I was just wondering—
&gt;&gt;Kavon: You wanna give

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.220
&gt;&gt;Farzad: We'll just repeat the question.

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.220
&gt;&gt;Kavon: OK.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:45.740
&gt;&gt;Lisa: How much work, how much time and effort
go into drafting each videos?

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.160
&gt;&gt;Will: Wow.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.050
Well there is a sort of like three different
phases of it.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:54.090
There is the booking of the band which is
finding the bands first of all which takes

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:55.090
a lot of work.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.050
I have Google reader of about 300 different
blogs that I read every day.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:04.300
I probably say the same is true for Caleb
and Nate but probably 300 different blogs.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.390
There's the finding of the band.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.880
Then there's the booking of the band which
is a bunch of e-mails back and forth with

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.220
their publicist or their manager, just figuring
out where we're gonna do with how we;re gonna

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.220
do it.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.350
Then figuring out how it's gonna get recorded.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:22.180
And then there's the actual day of the shoot
which is usually just a few hours.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:26.270
And then there's the post production process
which is handled by Nate or Bob who are editing

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.270
the video.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.710
And that's really the most time intensive
process.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:38.380
So if I had to put like an hour on each video
I would say like 16 hours what do you think

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.380
Nate?

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.230
16 to 24 hours maybe.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.090
I mean it depends on the content too.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.980
Like if we're doing a documentary or even
a short documentary that's really narrative

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:47.980
in nature.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.380
Then that takes much longer to edit than like
a performance piece would.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:56.240
But like I said it's these, it's this whole
kind of start to finish process that.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.470
It takes a while but it's gratifying.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.890
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Do you find that the quality of
artist that you work with actually helps that

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:02.890
process.

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:06.000
I mean like when I look at the Morning Benders
video and I see this performance like it looks

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
effortless.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.310
But I can imagine it was an easy thing to
get in a room full of people—

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.360
&gt;&gt;Will: Well that's all Chris.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.360
&gt;&gt;Farzad: multiple drummers.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.660
&gt;&gt;Will: I mean, that was Chris's, this is
like his.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.100
I sort of see it as like your swan song for
San Francisco.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.400
Like a going away present.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.280
You like those are all your friends, and I
remember we were just hanging out.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.930
Like I knew you just from being at Different
Fur.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:30.440
And it was sort of like Yours Truly was just
getting started and you guys were enough finishing

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.890
a new album and you are playing me the mixes.

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:36.270
And you were like, "I have this idea that
I want to do this piece and invite all these

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:37.270
people."

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.020
And it was an honor for you to have us do
it.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:44.210
And I think that the fact that it came out
that way is just, we kind of met in the middle

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.950
and just got it done that day.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.680
And the stars aligned and all that stuff.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.830
But yeah I do think it has something to do
with the quality of the artists.

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:57.580
And like I was saying earlier, we think about
people that really kind of deserve the attention

00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:58.580
and deserve our effort.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.540
Because it is a lot of work to put into a
band.

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:06.170
And so we kind of take this less is more approach
where we'd rather shoot way less stuff and

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:12.850
have it be way better than just be constantly
producing content just because we have to.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:16.000
If we had a bigger team than I think you know
we might be able to do that.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.510
But at the same time, we like just you know
making each thing we do very special and putting

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.490
our all into it.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:25.650
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Awesome.

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:28.120
Unfortunately, we're actually running out
of time.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120
&gt;&gt;Will: Really, that was it?

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.120
&gt;&gt;Farzad: so I'm gonna have to call today.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Farzad: thank you so much everybody for

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:35.070
coming out, Chris thank you
[Applause]

00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.840
&gt;&gt;Farzad: Catch you later man.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.620
&gt;&gt;Will: Later Chris, see ya.
