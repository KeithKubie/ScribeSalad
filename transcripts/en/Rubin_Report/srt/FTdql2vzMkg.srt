1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,500
what I will say about Madonna,
the gays are going to kill me.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,750
I saw her one time and it
wasn't great. New York, uh,

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,020
confessions, confessions on the dance
floor. It wasn't, it was in DNA. Oh,

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,440
that's the one. Yeah. That was
the whole dance album. Right.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,180
We know confessions was the dance.
Okay. So that day was like in 2012,

7
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:26,210
I think I was on Mtma when I went to
the, you went, that's where it was. Okay.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,400
I paid a lot of money for those tickets.

9
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,610
We were at Madison Square
Garden somewhere out in Jersey.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,490
I was way up there in the rafters
and I was just like, yeah, yeah,

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,110
I'll wait until I'll wait until they're
at the Farewell Vegas tour where she

12
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:41,980
finally does all the things
that people want to hear.
Right, right. Well, age wise,

13
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,990
she's, she's getting there. Yeah.
But you know, she keeps it together.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,560
She keeps it together. She does.
She does. All right. Let's, uh,

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,400
let's talk a little bit about,

16
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:53,790
I've heard Candace talk about how most
black people actually are conservatives,

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,670
but they sort of don't know it or they
can't accept it because of the way the

18
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:00,380
media has treated black people.

19
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:05,130
That the default position is you must be
a democrat. Yeah. Do you sense that? Um,

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,670
I sense that and to get into that,

21
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:12,540
you really have to understand how
deeply entrenched this idea, um,

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,900
that black people have to be Democrats
is, and, and I said this a little bit, uh,

23
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,290
on the vice thing that I did,

24
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,150
we have black celebrities,
entertainers,

25
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,080
ball players,

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,350
athletes from the top of
the charts to the ants.

27
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,800
The thought with 10,000 followers.

28
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,100
These are all people that are
pushing leftists. You know,

29
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:38,000
they're pushing leftist
tactics and black people.

30
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,330
We more so than I think other races,

31
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:45,680
we look for representation and media
and we look for representation and pop

32
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:49,460
culture. And these are our heroes. These
are the people that we want to be like.

33
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,080
And that's one of the reasons why this
idea that we have to be on the left is so

34
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:58,610
firmly entrenched. So why do you think
that is? Looking for it sort of elsewhere,

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,220
do you think that has something to do
with the black family and some of the

36
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,820
stuff that Larry elder would talk about?
It has everything to do with,

37
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,220
with Larry elders talking
about Larry Odor will tell you,

38
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:10,970
and I'm pretty sure he did that,
the number one to kick the shit out of me.

39
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,140
That's what woke me up.

40
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,150
But Larry elder will tell you that the
number one problem in the black community

41
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:20,960
is, is black popping it.
Listen to this, right? That we
don't have men in the homes.

42
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:24,560
And so when there's not a man in the home,
when there's not a man to,

43
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,590
to raise that young man in the home,
they look to athletes, ballplayers,

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,110
the Colin Kaepernick's, whoever.
And so when Colin Kaepernick,

45
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,110
just to give an example,
if some kid's hero, right?

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,790
And he sees Colin Kaepernick taking
a knee for black lives matter,

47
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,610
and that's where he's
getting his politics from,

48
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,260
because that kid doesn't know who I am.

49
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,360
They could certainly doesn't
know who Larry elder is.

50
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,110
And the fact that that kid is not gonna
know who Larry Elder is. It's a shame.

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,200
You know what I mean?
And so that's the message that we get.

52
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,760
Even though black people do tend to
be a little bit more conservative,

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,710
just in terms of if you,
for example,

54
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,820
said that black people need fathers in
the home and we need to stop having kids

55
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,120
out of wedlock and we need to start doing
all of these things that will elevate

56
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:12,640
ourselves. You're a racist
white supremacist, I would say.

57
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,650
I would say everyone regardless of race,

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,990
should have those things to
the best of your ability.

59
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,580
Not to say it can't happen otherwise.

60
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,650
You just said you were
raised by your mother.

61
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,820
I want to do turned out
pretty good course. There are
those outlier cases. Yeah.

62
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,860
But at the same time I was,

63
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,430
I went to the military for five
years and so the military taught me,

64
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,970
the military gave me a male influence.
Um, multiple male influences.

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,970
The military taught me how to be a man.
The military taught me discipline.

66
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,650
The military taught me courage in
the military taught me self control.

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,110
The military taught me reliance,

68
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,670
all of the things that a father
is supposed to teach you.

69
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,890
And so now me as a,
as a gay black man saying these things,

70
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,070
you know, if you're a white
person, you know, you're
white supremacist or whatever,

71
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,370
but I'm sorry about that, you know? Yeah.
I'm, I'm the COO and I'm the uncle Tom,

72
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,204
I'm whatever.

73
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,410
And there is this very huge movement of
like very far left gay black men who it

74
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:13,240
seems like they have these large online
platforms and it seems like their entire

75
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:18,241
goal in life is to just tear down straight
black men or tear down the idea of

76
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:23,611
masculinity or tear down the idea that
our boys need men in the homes to teach

77
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,110
them how to be men.
So they want to tear that down.

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,980
And when I look at their platforms and
I look at the things that they say,

79
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,821
and sometimes they get,

80
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,510
they come after me and I ignore it
because none of those people are my enemy.

81
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,930
There is nobody that is out there that's
a public figure that looks like me.

82
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,870
That is not my enemy. That is my,
these people are not my enemy.

83
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,330
But when I look at the
platform that they have, I say,

84
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,460
you have so many people listening to you.

85
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,340
Why are you always preaching
divisiveness and hatred?

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,330
Why did you trying to tear down black men?
We should be lifting each other up.

87
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,270
We should be empowering each other because
you know our community meets. Yeah,

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,730
well it seems to me that mostly, and
it's not just with say those black men,

89
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:07,060
but anyone that buys in
to the far left ideology,

90
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,500
they want conformity and they, there
is some sort of, as I say all the time,

91
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,180
Peter Boghossian,
he's been on the show many times,

92
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,540
calls this postmodern ideology a secular
religion and they don't want a PA state

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,910
and they especially don't want to pass
states that look like you. That's crazy.

94
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,910
I've never,
I've never really heard that.

95
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,940
I mean I've talked about that
idea and some of my lectures,

96
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,760
but I've never heard it say quite
like that because this is my thing.

97
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,890
And one of the best things that happened
for me over the past year is that if

98
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm a religion and I found God,
because I will tell you,

99
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:42,400
and you probably know there and I don't
know, I don't know what your religion is,

100
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,840
but for me there's a lot of people
that are running after Twitter,

101
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:50,710
followers and fans and Instagram followers
and fame and money and all this other

102
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,720
stuff and not,

103
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:56,440
there's not an amount of Twitter followers
or fame or any of that stuff that is

104
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,330
going to fill that hole
that you're looking to fill.

105
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,860
And your Twitter followers don't fill.

106
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,460
The existential void lays out
what you're telling me do not.

107
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,450
The black hole of existence is not
filled by Instagram. Line is nodding.

108
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:12,810
You've got like 10 times my following.
And when,

109
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:15,570
when things started taking
off a little bit last year,

110
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,670
like when when my life started getting
bigger and in some other ways I had to

111
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,810
make things smaller. Um, and so
I made my circle smaller and,

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,060
and I tried to get close with
my husband and my best friends,

113
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:31,380
but I also found God. And it is you not
religious before, were you not, were you,

114
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:34,350
were you specifically not a believer
before? No, not at, not at all.

115
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:38,970
I was raised in the church
African Methodist Episcopal.
Um, so the AME church,

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,290
like I was there and when you're young
and black in the church churches a full,

117
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,400
like an all day event,

118
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,550
I'm there at 10:00 AM per Sunday school
and then you do the service and then

119
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,150
it's two 30 dinner. You're like, again,
not out of there until after dark.

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,220
But I think that in my first 11 years in
the city when I was kind of doing some

121
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,980
of the don't ask, don't tell
activism and trying to find my path,

122
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,920
I was looking for fulfillment in all
of those things that I told you before.

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,700
And when I started getting those things,

124
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,860
I realized that not that it wasn't enough,

125
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,750
but there needs to be
something else to ground me.

126
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,320
And one of the biggest things that the,

127
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,330
the Super Far left tells young gay
people is that God is your enemy and

128
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,500
Christians are your enemy.

129
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,180
And Evangelical Christians want to
put you in conversion campaigns.

130
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,220
Just all of this crazy stuff to separate
them from relation so that this far

131
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:34,940
left ideology becomes their religion.
And I,

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,300
I say that, you know, God is
a gift in my life right now.

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,040
And I say that and I'm not embarrassed
by that anymore and I don't feel like

134
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,130
that's something that I should be ashamed
to talk about even as a, as a gay man.

135
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,840
Somebody described me on Twitter when I,
and I think it's funny, and they said,

136
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,850
I'm former military leftist
turn right wing Bible thumping,

137
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,220
Trump tarred. And I thought
that that lot words, I,

138
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,430
it was hysterical.
I showed that to my husband.

139
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:06,970
We both cackled I don't hear
you Bible thumping. No, I mean,

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,860
I'm not a Trump tart and I,
you know, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Right wing Trump tart.

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,590
I don't Bible thump.
I just, I talked that,

142
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,591
I talk about religion in my life and
how it's grounded me and how it's become

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,750
just a really powerful guiding fours and
it is fulfilling and it is grounding in

144
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:30,760
a way that, let me tell you something. As
a young gay man, like, like all the sex,

145
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,840
all the partying, all that stuff.
Like I did it all and there's,

146
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,630
there's nothing in that in for me.

147
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,640
It is becoming grounded
in religion and God. Yeah.

148
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,820
Do you think a lot of gay people have
like an extra struggle when it comes to

149
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,120
sort of be existential questions?
Cause I know I definitely did like that.

150
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,400
You are something that society tells
you at least, you know. How old are you?

151
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,530
Huh? How old are you? Am I allowed
to ask how old you, I'll be back.

152
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,280
I just get to the one question that I can,

153
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,860
I'm in my thirties

154
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,890
during your thirties wow. Wow. Yeah.
Yeah. All right. So that's how it is.

155
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,520
Well I as an elder, I am 42
years. Okay. So you know,

156
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:11,100
when I was in say high school and college,
you know,

157
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:14,910
this is way before gay marriage, you
know, during don't ask, don't tell. And I,

158
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:18,670
I never really saw sort
of a functional future. I,

159
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,630
it's not that I saw dysfunction future,
I just saw no future. I was just like,

160
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,780
I'm now and I'm just going to keep
living now. Something like that. Um,

161
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,270
but I do think for a lot of gay people
that causes like this weird, uh,

162
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,540
belief schism or something like that.

163
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,490
So it's interesting to hear
that just in the last year,

164
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,580
you've come back to some of this stuff.
And I think a lot of people have,

165
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,060
by the way,

166
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,010
I think they are in, in, in, I want them
to, and it's like, so we, we told the,

167
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:44,791
I guess I don't,

168
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,670
I don't want to say right wingers anymore
because I guess I'm a right winger now,

169
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,400
but they always say that,
you know,

170
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,550
you can't call gay lifestyle
because it's my sexual orientation.

171
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,540
It's a lifestyle. But there are elements
of it that are very lifestyle oriented.

172
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,660
The, the party lifestyle, the circuit
party culture, the gay culture,

173
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,750
like all of that other stuff.
Um,

174
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,360
I don't like any of that stuff.
Yeah.

175
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,720
I like the golden girls who
doesn't like the golden girls,

176
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,730
like gay enough for me.
You know what I mean?

177
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,950
I watched three hours of the golden girls
on a Sunday morning. I'm very happy.

178
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,040
The cool thing right now is that people
like you and people like me can reach

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,800
these young people and they can see
something that is outside of all of that

180
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,280
messiness. And I come to it is
not somebody that judges it.

181
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,330
But if somebody that did it all now,
I never did drugs. That was never,

182
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,520
I was never a druggie.
I don't even like smoking weed.

183
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,550
They say that people that are um,
better,

184
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,280
a little neurotic and I'm a
little neurotic. They say we,

185
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,470
it doesn't go well with us and
it doesn't go well with me.

186
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,560
So I never did the drugs.
Yeah,

187
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,330
you haven't found the right end that good,
but I get it.

188
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,260
You're a conservative now.

189
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,710
Yeah. No, it's not even that because
some of them, and it's really funny,

190
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:51,380
I'm like to the right of some
people on marijuana legalization,

191
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:55,050
but that's a whole nother issue.
We can go there, but yeah, good.

192
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,800
But I did all the partying.

193
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,390
I did all of the circuit parties and I
traveled and kissing boys and having lots

194
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,040
of sex.
It's like I did all that.

195
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,250
And I fundamentally know
that there's nothing there.

196
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,260
And I think that the problem with
reaching these kids right now is that I am

197
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:12,970
like,

198
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,970
it feels lonely because it really does
feel like I'm one of maybe three or four

199
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:22,130
people that like have these large
platforms and obviously you as well,

200
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,150
but they see people that are like,
you know,

201
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:29,300
they see the drag queens and the Hollywood
celebrities and all that other stuff.

202
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,010
I just really want these kids to see
that they can have a more grounded life.

203
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,060
And not that I'm trying to be anybody's
role model in a way because I'm like,

204
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,550
my thing is I did all the mess.
So you don't have,

205
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,170
yeah, I, I feel there even
though I didn't do the math.

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,780
I mean I did do my own mess in
a way. Yeah. Like, and I did,

207
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,230
I did do the drugs and I didn't do all
that, but I wasn't really into the scene,

208
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:52,710
let's say. But I do feel that too. I'm
not trying to be anyone's role model.

209
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,570
All a hundred. You are setting up for
failure. Yeah. And I, I lived through,

210
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,500
if anything, I would say I lived
through shit to get to where I am.

211
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,870
So that hopefully the next,

212
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,600
that that gay kid that's 18 doesn't have
to do it. You know what I mean? Yeah.

213
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,040
We're living right.
Cause everyone's got shit right.

214
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,600
And the people that came before me live
through far more than that. So yeah.

215
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,080
But there's an interesting parallel here
with the way Hollywood treats all of

216
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,660
this. Because you mentioned something
about, or just a moment ago,

217
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,040
you mentioned how,
uh,

218
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,780
the black culture puts more emphasis
on Hollywood and these figures and

219
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,690
everything. And I was thinking like,
even just in the Oscars last year,

220
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,740
that Black Panther who was nominated
for an Oscar, now I've seen every,

221
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,380
so I think we're going to have a
little difference here because I,

222
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,120
I've seen every marvel movie I just saw,
I end game a couple of days ago. Uh,

223
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,900
this one's going to make me
go see it at this weekend.

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,080
I don't want to say
anything right now, but, um,

225
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,080
but I've seen every one of the movies. I
love superhero movies. I Love Star Wars,

226
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,110
love all that stuff. Black Panther was
a very average movie there. There was,

227
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:55,090
in my opinion,
there was nothing racist.

228
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,340
Same for same racist what? Guess
what? Mary Oliver, you said it too,

229
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,790
but he's a self hating black guys.
Like you just can't win here button.

230
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,450
But my point is, but it was within
the scheme of superhero movies,

231
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,660
none of them get nominated
for anything and that's fine.

232
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,450
But it was very average in my opinion.

233
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,120
It was just a very average movie and it
got nominated for all these things and I

234
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,680
saw the media was like, ah, see
Black Panther. Got It. Like,

235
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,300
like it was some major wins that would
somehow make people more equal or feel,

236
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,580
or now we can look at the numbers
and go this many black films,

237
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,830
this and this many white friends is,
and I was like,

238
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,990
it just seems to me that the aim is just
so off of where you should go for the

239
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:38,040
prize. The real prize. And I agree
with you on that. First of all,

240
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,990
I love Black Panther. I really
do. Like I'm a, I'm a huge fan.

241
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,270
I thought it was perfectly fine, but
you got an Oscar Award winning nominated

242
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,740
to make a really good point in minority
communities and specifically the two

243
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:56,090
groups that I'm a part of,
blacks and, and, and gay people.

244
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,390
We always look for representation in
the media as some sort of barometer of

245
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,940
progress. And that's a trap. It's a huge,

246
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,670
it's a big triangle.
Chinese people do it. Yeah.

247
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,510
Because they're focused on making money.

248
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:15,530
And when I tell him and I'm all about it,
and when I go give these lectures,

249
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:20,531
and I told people that the biggest way
for any group of people to achieve any

250
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,450
kind of power is financially.

251
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,870
It is not through the Oscar nominations.

252
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:31,160
And that stuff is great and
it's amazing, but it's, it's,

253
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,080
it's kind of like these are,

254
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,070
these are false idols because Black
Panther is great for visual representation

255
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,870
and it's great that all
those people on the stage,

256
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,490
and I personally think this amazing movie,

257
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,110
but what that does for the young black
kid that's struggling in the high school

258
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:49,680
that I went to right now, not
much. Not much. Right. Um,

259
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,900
and we do it as gays and
lesbians as well. If, you know,

260
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:57,010
if somebody comes out and look
at the, look at the, the, the,

261
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,810
the Buddha judge thing
right now. Um, yeah,

262
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,340
look at how people in this
is somebody that is, I mean,

263
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,620
I'm not a Buddhist rotator at all,
but I, it seems to me, you know, I,

264
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,321
I see the game,

265
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:12,590
I see what's going on and I see the way
that he picked a fight with pence to,

266
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:16,070
to ingratiate themselves to the far left
though. He's like, I get it, I see it.

267
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,320
But just the idea that any power
comes from media representation,

268
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,540
it's,
it's false hope.

269
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,720
And it also separates the people
from what should be the end goal.

270
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,380
Because I think that empowerment for any
of our communities only comes through

271
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:37,820
entrepreneurship. Look at this, look at
that. That is your name. On that sign,

272
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,500
you are an entrepreneur.

273
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,870
And if somebody had given me the message
about entrepreneurship when I was 17,

274
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,660
18, 1920, God knows where I'd be by now.

275
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,920
And one of the biggest things that
I've gotten out of out of become a

276
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:55,460
conservative and kind of moving
over to the right is the fact that

277
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:59,930
entrepreneurship and capitalism
is not a bad thing in my,

278
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:03,260
both of our communities need more of it,
but especially my black community,

279
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,500
we need more entrepreneurship.
We need more job creators.

280
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,390
We need to stop looking for
representation in the media to, to,

281
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,450
to elevate ourselves,
to make us feel good about ourselves.

282
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,450
So when you see then the Democrats, so
just in the last couple of weeks, yeah,

283
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,760
there's now this debate suddenly
about reparations and I,

284
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,200
I saw the video of Senator Elizabeth
Warren talking about reparations and she's

285
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,890
going to commission a panel about
reparations. And my first thought,

286
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,920
the first thing that just popped into
my head as I was watching it was,

287
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,210
holy shit,

288
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,600
Candice did it.

289
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,940
You know what I mean? Like
whatever anyone thinks it, Candice,

290
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,950
she created enough of a crack in that
layer that that caused black people to

291
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,880
either be completely afraid of saying
they're conservatives are just,

292
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,090
just say that they're not Democrats. Yeah,
yeah. That now the Democrats are like,

293
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,190
Oh shit, what do we got left?
Here's money. Could you take,

294
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,930
yeah, I bet some money in the
words of the Great Candice Owens,

295
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,340
fear in handouts is what they have
to offer black people the cycle.

296
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,770
And it is no mistake,
first of all,

297
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,180
that Donald Trump got more
African American votes in
the two previous Republican

298
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,640
nominees combined.
That is just the fat.

299
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,850
And it is no mistake that you know what,
you know,

300
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,850
people say a lot about the Brexit
movement and they say it's not real.

301
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,541
It's not that.

302
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,130
And what I tell people is that you're
going to see Republicans make a bigger

303
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,340
play for the black vote than
you had ever seen before.

304
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,020
I think in the history of this country.

305
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,910
And it's not going to come
through fear and handouts.

306
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,910
It's going to come from talking to the
people that are the real job creators in

307
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:39,560
the real entrepreneurs and saying that
these policies will help you create.

308
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,830
And the fact that reparations is even
a conversation right now among the

309
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:50,250
Democrats means that they're scared.
Um, I, I just did a video for,

310
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,850
for turning point about reparations
and not to spoil any of that,

311
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,060
but none other than Bayard Rustin who
is one of the architects of the march on

312
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,151
Washington,

313
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:04,560
a huge civil rights leader who by
the way was black and gay in the 60s.

314
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,980
They interviewed Bayard Rustin about
reparations in 1969 and he said,

315
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:14,310
it's, he said, this idea is ridiculous.
And the quote is something like,

316
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,100
if my great, great grandfather, you know,

317
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,800
picked cotton than
reparations are owed to him,

318
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,080
but he's dead and nobody owes me anything,

319
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,480
but this is how they're going
to try to buy the black vote.

320
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,120
It's also just a crazy way of
dividing this. Yes. Each other.

321
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,510
I was at a cousin's wedding on my
husband's side this past weekend and,

322
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,290
uh,
was with a young guy who's 21,

323
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,990
22 and he was telling me about how
woke it is in college. Now this,

324
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,280
this is a kid who grew up, his mother
died when he was very young. He grew up,

325
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:48,020
he had no money, bunch
of different homes, uh,

326
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,500
all sorts of crazy history.

327
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:54,501
In the family and it's like the idea
that this kid has privileged because he's

328
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:58,140
white and we're going to take from him.
I mean that's in essence,

329
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:01,050
that's what he was saying here, like it
wasn't specifically about reparations,

330
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:06,051
but just this idea that this kid is
somehow guilty or somehow privilege just

331
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,560
because of the skin color,

332
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,660
having nothing to do with
everything he's lived through.

333
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,960
But that's what they're pushing
on everybody. I mean, you know,

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,260
that's what they're pushing
and, and there's not a lot
of pushback to that idea.

335
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:21,261
And I just feel that there's a correction
going on right now and there was a

336
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,320
correction because you're seeing a lot
more conservatives that are younger and

337
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:29,180
Brown or in whatever. And there's a really
different movement right now. And the,

338
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,970
the, the leftist it, it's like, I
call it the intersectionality coal.

339
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,620
The intersectionality Colt will eat itself
because there's all these things that

340
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,960
you cannot see on the left right now.
And there's somebody who,

341
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm not going to name, but this is this
person. It has a platform as a feminist,

342
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:47,790
right? And this is a male feminist
and I'm like, great, you know,

343
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,720
do what you gotta do.

344
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,170
But don't call me Trans phobic for
defending women's sports or women's spaces

345
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,800
or,
or lesbians who are now,

346
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:03,480
who now feel pressured into having
relationships with transgender women. Um,

347
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:07,290
when, when you call yourself a feminist
and you're not standing up for,

348
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,500
for lesbians, and I standing up for
women in that way, I, I, you know,

349
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,920
you can call me whatever you want to
call me, but I'm, I'm always going to,

350
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:18,090
to stand up for, for lesbians to stand up
for women in that way. But like I said,

351
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,040
the intersectionality coat, there
are things that they can't say. Um,

352
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,480
there are things that they can't say
about radical Islam. You know, when,

353
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,300
when they run into a gay
bar and kill 49 of us,

354
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,740
and then they can't say that you got
Jonathan Capehart running around talking

355
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:35,160
about, oh, this guy was a closeted gay in
this guy was this, and this guy was that.

356
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,920
And I'm like, that is completely
ridiculous and not true.

357
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,360
And we know that that's not true now,

358
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,760
but the intersectionality Colt will
eat itself because there it is.

359
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,650
It is becoming to the point where there
are too many things that they can't say.

360
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,710
So people like you and I have
to say the things that they can.

361
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,360
Is that doubly tough then
for you as a gay black man?

362
00:20:54,361 --> 00:20:59,010
Because the culture, if we're talking
about black culture and gay culture,

363
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:02,350
there's so much humor richness there.
Political, incorrect, yes. Yeah.

364
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,810
All of these things. So for someone
like you to be fed these, these ideas,

365
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,450
you've obviously rejected now.
Yeah.

366
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,940
But to be fed these ideas that would
stop you from joking the way you want a

367
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:15,510
joke or saying something politically
incorrect. The rest of it, it's like,

368
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,570
like I remember going when I would go to
gay bars and they would be like a drag

369
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:21,270
queen now I, so I again,
I was never into it.

370
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,790
I thought drag queens were all bad comics.

371
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,280
Like they all struck me as just
hack comics. That being said,

372
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,900
they would say a ton of
politically incorrect shit.
They would mock gay people.

373
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:33,810
They, I mean they would mock everybody.
That was the point. Yeah. We're now,

374
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:35,850
it's like, I don't know, I don't
know what's going on in the,

375
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:38,760
in the drag queen world these days.
But it's like,

376
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:42,900
I'm guessing it's gotten pretty bad cause
they're probably really afraid to say

377
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,510
anything.
Yeah,

378
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,930
you'd be irreverent. I mean I, I think
that right now, I mean I, I'd love drag.

379
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,630
I ru Paul's drag race. I'm like,
I'm all about it. You know, my,

380
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,800
my husband and I are big fans.

381
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,020
I voted for the, in the last last
night vote voted for Gary Johnson,

382
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:58,410
but I used to live in West Hollywood so
I had to go over there to, to vote. Yeah.

383
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:00,640
I was standing behind
Ru Paul at the voters.

384
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,210
Wow. Not In drag. And you
want to talk about like,

385
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,680
and you want to talk about how crazy
the left is. Let's talk about Ru Paul.

386
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,200
Let's talk about the crazy blue chairs.

387
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,620
Crazies on the LGBT left
coming after Paul. Like the,

388
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,680
forgive me for being gay. Mvaa
you come from mother, you,

389
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,000
you say that Ru Paul is transphobic or
she doesn't represent gays. And whatever.

390
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,360
Well, what was it that she said? Was
this about a year and a half ago?

391
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,730
This is about a year and a half ago.

392
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:35,170
Like ru Paul did an interview where
she says she doesn't, we're Paul. Hey,

393
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,930
because we'll pause. A man,
Rupaul said he doesn't believe,

394
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,810
and in transgender women in drag,

395
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:44,320
because drag is supposed to be a male's
elevated and comedic idea of what a

396
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:49,180
woman is. And so they came after Ron Paul
for that. They came after there was a,

397
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm a segment on drag race called a
sheet shemale girl. You got shemale.

398
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,740
You know what I mean? And so they kept,
the blue techs came after Rupaul for that.

399
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,840
And so it's really funny when I look at
the Ru Paul situation and we'll look at

400
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:04,670
somebody who has done more for,

401
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:09,520
for LGBT culture than maybe anybody
walking on this earth right now.

402
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,910
And the fact that people are attacking
him after everything that he's done tells

403
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:19,120
me that these people are insane,
tells me that there's not enough.

404
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,010
And if there's one thing that I wouldn't
[inaudible] I don't know if this is a

405
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:24,960
critique because I,

406
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:28,600
I love Ru Paul and by all accounts I
hear people say that Rw is amazing.

407
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,940
It's not like real kind of bend the
bending the knee a little bit. Oh,

408
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,700
he apologized. We're bending
the knee a little bit. Um, um,

409
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,780
so people coming for him and I want to
get to a point where we are not bending

410
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:44,040
the knee to the mob anymore. Yeah.
They came after Ellen degenerate.

411
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,200
What lesbian on this planet has done
more for freaking gay and lesbian

412
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:55,001
visibility in an Ellen degenerate came
after Ellen just because she sat down

413
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:00,430
with a Kevin Hart and Hart having the
conversation with Kevin Hart and they came

414
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,140
for Ellen.
And so this is what I say,

415
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,740
if they're coming for ru
Paul and Ellen degenerate,

416
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,720
they'll come for you and me so die.
So I will never been the knee. I was,

417
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:12,290
um,

418
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,270
we were supposed to have
an LGBT conservative panel
at the LGBT center in New

419
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,990
York City. Um, and when, you
know, people found out about it,

420
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:25,310
where you've got excommunicated from the
center because we were all racist and

421
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,070
all white and transphobic
and all of that other stuff.

422
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,760
And so I will never apologize
for things that I say.

423
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,740
I don't try to offend people,

424
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,490
but you're certainly not going to control
my tongue and I'm not going to bend

425
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:38,630
the knee to these people.

426
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,100
And I'm really glad that Ellen didn't and
I hope Rupaul never does again because

427
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,670
these are two people that have done more
for this community that anybody in the

428
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:51,600
planet, certainly not some blue check
mark that writes for some blog. Right,

429
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,190
right.

430
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,730
But we create this reverse or this
perverse I should say incentive structure

431
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,540
where it's like there's a lot of
value for those blue checkers.

432
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,790
We go after them cause it's like,
oh you can wound one of the heroes,

433
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,580
even if they were the ones that
paved the road for you. Wow.

434
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:07,350
If you can build your
castle on their blood car,

435
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,570
Cardi B says they do anything for cloud
cloud chasers. That's all they're doing.

436
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,620
And the fundamental
critique that I have with,

437
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:20,210
with a lot of these people that the
cloud chasers is that the platforms are

438
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:23,390
always built on destruction.
It's canceled culture.

439
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,790
So everything is always built on.

440
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,800
If I build a platform of of let's say
like a hundred thousand two hundred

441
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,160
thousand three hundred thousand and my
platform is completely built on tearing

442
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:34,994
people down,

443
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,180
like I'm going to go up to Dave Ruben
because he's got 10 times my following and

444
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:41,000
he said something I don't like,
so maybe I'll get some attention for,

445
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:45,020
for tearing him down. You
know what I mean? So if your
platform is built on that,

446
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,000
then you always have to look for new
things to be offended by new people to

447
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,550
destroy new cloud to chase.

448
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,680
And I don't think that it goes
anywhere, you know? So it's also sad,

449
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,330
right? It's like it's deeply sad. I mean,

450
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:02,960
I see this with this crew going after
me all the time and I just ignore it,

451
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,150
but it's like the idea that you're
waking up in the morning and go,

452
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,990
what did Ruben say today so I can
get some clicks? It's like, man,

453
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:12,290
there's so many things going on in the
world that the Fed and it's like I'm not

454
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,260
perfect and I've made mistakes
in this very room on this show.

455
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,830
But it's like if you're waking up going,
this is the guy we got to go after. I,

456
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,350
I adore value than it says about me. It
does. And I, and I feel sorry, I just,

457
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:28,730
I feel sorry for their life because I
just, there's nowhere to go from that.

458
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,970
And I would like to use
these opportunities that
I'm getting right now too.

459
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,520
I want to engage people,
but I also want to empower people.

460
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,600
I want to empower my people
is much crap as owns gets.

461
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:47,460
And Man, she gets the a level
that I couldn't even dream of.

462
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,760
She is a true believer.

463
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,280
She is really out here
trying to empower people.

464
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:58,110
She is really out here trying
to wake people up. And I um,

465
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,160
I saw Bernay Brown special, I think
our name is Renee brown on Netflix.

466
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,670
So she uses apparently enormously
huge motivational speaker,

467
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,510
but I'd never heard of, um, so she just
got, um, promoted to be on Netflix.

468
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:13,830
So I decided to watch a little bit of,
of the um, special and she said that,

469
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,230
and I think she, I think this
is a Theodore Roosevelt quote,

470
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,440
she said that don't worry about critiques
that come from people who are not in

471
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,030
the field,
who are not in the battle,

472
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:28,140
who are not putting themselves out there
in some way and trying to affect change

473
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:31,140
in some way.
And now that I've saw,

474
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,080
I've seen that that's how
I try to live my life.

475
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,180
And because you can't
take all these critiques,

476
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:40,960
there's a point where you can get 90%
of love from people and we'll follow

477
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,460
because sometimes in the than a, hey,
you know, I was really doing stand up.

478
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,250
I always remember I could be killing
like 300 people laughing hysterically.

479
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,240
If there's one guy look at his phone, it's
like, that's the guy I'm looking at it.

480
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,250
That's it. There's a guy that was
asleep in my lecture last night.

481
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,990
Did you call it out? I did. I said,
I didn't call him up directly,

482
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,120
but I was like giving my speech
and I was like, you know, and,

483
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:04,630
and I think that everybody needs to have
conversations. Even that guy is funny.

484
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,250
He wake up. He did. He
did. All right, good. Uh,

485
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,850
I'm sorry we didn't do
more of this earlier,

486
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:11,910
but tell me a little bit just about
your service having nothing to do with,

487
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,280
with all of this stuff.
Only in that, yeah,

488
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,050
just, you know, my service in general,

489
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:20,190
I think that when I look
back at the military service,

490
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:23,490
what I regret is that,
you know,

491
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:26,940
people come up to you when
you're a veteran and they
thank you for your service.

492
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,820
And like people call me a hero
and all that other stuff in it.

493
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:35,270
I'm always uneasy by that because I
didn't do anything particularly heroic.

494
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,460
I was a young kid. Um, just,

495
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:41,310
just trying to make it from
one day to the next. I mean,

496
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,930
I was doing things that I believed in,

497
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,370
but when I look at some of these kids
that are serving right now and they're the

498
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,190
same age, I was, you
know, 1920, 21 years old,

499
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,930
it's so much for a young
person to take on. But for me,

500
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,840
when I look back at it
and it just, it, you know,

501
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:01,890
I lost weight and it gave me
discipline and it gave me kind of that,

502
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,710
that strong male influence
that was missing in my life.

503
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,540
And when I talk about my service,

504
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:11,280
it's not so much the day to day of what
I did because it was really, you know,

505
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:15,900
I did one tour in Kuwait, I did one
tour in Iraq right after the invasion.

506
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,320
Um, you connect those dots, you
can get to that age question. Yeah,

507
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,270
yeah. [inaudible] it, yeah.
Connect the dots. It's okay.

508
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,080
Um, but when I look back
to that, we were just,

509
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:32,190
I was just trying to do the best that I
could and everybody that I served with,

510
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,550
we were just trying to do our best.
And I,

511
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,180
the people that are serving the military,

512
00:29:36,181 --> 00:29:40,850
they are heroes from like from the guy
who captured a Sama Bin, Ladin indies,

513
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,350
these great men that you see these
books from and all that stuff.

514
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,640
But just the people that
give up three, four, five,

515
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:52,870
sometimes 20 and 25 years of their
life to be of service in some way.

516
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,770
Like there is a very
heroic element to that.

517
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,500
And I think that with me and my service,

518
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,510
I talk about it a lot and I talk about
loving America because it has given me so

519
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:05,351
much.

520
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:10,270
Just that service has just put me onto
a path that just sitting here with you

521
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:14,710
right now and coming back from being
with Candice and going to events in the

522
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,390
White House, like what were
black kid from Akron, Ohio could,

523
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:23,770
could see that vision for himself in
the military put me on the path to doing

524
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,560
all of these things.
So I don't look at myself as heroic,

525
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,530
but I look at all the people that are
serving now as as heroic. It's to me it's,

526
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,360
it's very strange. I feel like I'm
not giving you an answer, but no, no.

527
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,430
It's very hard to reconcile who I am now
with who I was then and to see that as

528
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,670
anything other than a scared
kid doing the best he could,

529
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,350
if that makes sense. It does make sense
and that feels like a nice ending. Yeah.

530
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,680
How do you feel about that? I think
that's a great ending. Absolutely.

531
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,300
I don't know what I'm doing later,

532
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,490
but there would be something if we just
showed up at the Abbey in West Holly.

533
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,080
Oh my God. Can we find some other
banded deplorable. Oh my goodness.

534
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,620
We should, we should make it happen.
We should, we should make the,

535
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,740
the conservative gay meet up or something
like that. I should make it happen.

536
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,450
Classical liberal. Oh, that's
right. Classical liberal.
