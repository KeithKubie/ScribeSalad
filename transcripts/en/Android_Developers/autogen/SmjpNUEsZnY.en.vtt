00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.150
sort of the heart of each of the list
looks to be about right I know the small

issues for the orientation but is it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
issues for the orientation but is it
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.250
issues for the orientation but is it
something that can be controlled or do I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260
something that can be controlled or do I
 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.920
something that can be controlled or do I
need to Ok Go you can break this nothing

I can do yeah a little over it's a
 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.870
I can do yeah a little over it's a
completely unnatural yeah it's for the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880
completely unnatural yeah it's for the
 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.800
completely unnatural yeah it's for the
detail view soon yeah and basically when

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810
detail view soon yeah and basically when
 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.110
detail view soon yeah and basically when
you get into the detail view it plays

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
you get into the detail view it plays
 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.850
you get into the detail view it plays
back the sound and show you this kind of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860
back the sound and show you this kind of
 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.159
back the sound and show you this kind of
progress bar and then touching the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169
progress bar and then touching the
 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.010
progress bar and then touching the
screen i believe touch and swipe it a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020
screen i believe touch and swipe it a
 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.520

those gestures basically replays it and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510
those gestures basically replays it and
 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.060
those gestures basically replays it and
it's not a hundred percent discoverable

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070
it's not a hundred percent discoverable
 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.100
it's not a hundred percent discoverable
right and you know when i looked at this

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110
right and you know when i looked at this
 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.860
right and you know when i looked at this
last week before we were able to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870
last week before we were able to
 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.210
last week before we were able to
actually talk about it and we ran out of

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220
actually talk about it and we ran out of
 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.219
actually talk about it and we ran out of
time I didn't notice a bunch of things

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229
time I didn't notice a bunch of things
 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.020
time I didn't notice a bunch of things
here just you know it just in terms of

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030
here just you know it just in terms of
 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.600
here just you know it just in terms of
basic usability obviously you know on a

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610
basic usability obviously you know on a
 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.280
basic usability obviously you know on a
tablet the line lengths are really long

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290
tablet the line lengths are really long
 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.870
tablet the line lengths are really long
the font sizes are small which we

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880
the font sizes are small which we
 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.050
the font sizes are small which we
alluded to but things like you know

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060
alluded to but things like you know
 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.730
alluded to but things like you know
basic things like raising the volume of

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
basic things like raising the volume of
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.320
basic things like raising the volume of
the sound right i mean i actually found

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330
the sound right i mean i actually found
 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.990
the sound right i mean i actually found
that it was barely impala mostly

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000
that it was barely impala mostly
 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.779
that it was barely impala mostly
impossible to actually hear the sound

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789
impossible to actually hear the sound
 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.670
impossible to actually hear the sound
and so you may want to try to amplify it

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680
and so you may want to try to amplify it
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.190
and so you may want to try to amplify it
so that it's you know at a default

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200
so that it's you know at a default
 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.219
so that it's you know at a default
volume default system volume you can

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229
volume default system volume you can
 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.960
volume default system volume you can
actually hear what you're you know what

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970
actually hear what you're you know what
 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.600
actually hear what you're you know what
it is the other thing is there's a lot

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
it is the other thing is there's a lot
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.279
it is the other thing is there's a lot
of opportunity for visuals and i know

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289
of opportunity for visuals and i know
 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.190
of opportunity for visuals and i know
that like sound is I mean you can't

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200
that like sound is I mean you can't
 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.050
that like sound is I mean you can't
visualize sound then you know it's not

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060
visualize sound then you know it's not
 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.550
visualize sound then you know it's not
the easiest thing to do you know show

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560
the easiest thing to do you know show
 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.500
the easiest thing to do you know show
that the waveforms or not but it may be

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510
that the waveforms or not but it may be
 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.540
that the waveforms or not but it may be
something that that you can add maybe

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550
something that that you can add maybe
 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.700
something that that you can add maybe
like you know if there's a pulse like

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710
like you know if there's a pulse like
 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.180
like you know if there's a pulse like
boom boom maybe you can sort of like

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190
boom boom maybe you can sort of like
 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.230
boom boom maybe you can sort of like
illustrate that somehow using the graph

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
illustrate that somehow using the graph
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.120
illustrate that somehow using the graph
right right maybe like show on a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130
right right maybe like show on a
 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.940
right right maybe like show on a
timeline not exactly the exact waveform

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950
timeline not exactly the exact waveform
 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.040
timeline not exactly the exact waveform
but kind of like beats like circles

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050
but kind of like beats like circles
 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.650
but kind of like beats like circles
indicating here's where it beat is and i

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660
indicating here's where it beat is and i
 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.350
indicating here's where it beat is and i
would even on a tablet especially put

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360
would even on a tablet especially put
 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.980
would even on a tablet especially put
this on the the listing the listing of

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990
this on the the listing the listing of
 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.020
this on the the listing the listing of
all the sounds just so that you can

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
all the sounds just so that you can
 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.270
all the sounds just so that you can
really easily scan things so if I'm a

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280
really easily scan things so if I'm a
 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.570
really easily scan things so if I'm a
doctor right and I'm

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580
doctor right and I'm
 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.360
doctor right and I'm
cheering and again I am NOT a doctor so

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370
cheering and again I am NOT a doctor so
 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.950
cheering and again I am NOT a doctor so
I know he was talking about in your

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960
I know he was talking about in your
 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.779
I know he was talking about in your
other yeah imagine like fred is having

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789
other yeah imagine like fred is having
 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.490
other yeah imagine like fred is having
some sort of you know issue and you know

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500
some sort of you know issue and you know
 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.510
some sort of you know issue and you know
I his heart rate or whatever it is you

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
I his heart rate or whatever it is you
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.219
I his heart rate or whatever it is you
know I can roughly sense oh there's like

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229
know I can roughly sense oh there's like
 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.749
know I can roughly sense oh there's like
three beats happening and their

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759
three beats happening and their
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.790
three beats happening and their
irregular and so be really good to be

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800
irregular and so be really good to be
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.589
irregular and so be really good to be
able to just scan that list very easily

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599
able to just scan that list very easily
 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.510
able to just scan that list very easily
and see hey where are those three beats

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520
and see hey where are those three beats
 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.369
and see hey where are those three beats
I'm saying here that's the one that I

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379
I'm saying here that's the one that I
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.839
I'm saying here that's the one that I
want and then go into that and hear the

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849
want and then go into that and hear the
 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.490
want and then go into that and hear the
audio that's a great idea I think the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500
audio that's a great idea I think the
 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.959
audio that's a great idea I think the
visualization is really important

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:28.969
visualization is really important
 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.450
visualization is really important

was on the sound detail screen like when

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:18.620
was on the sound detail screen like when
 

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.620
was on the sound detail screen like when
you get into the detail screen you saw

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:20.630
you get into the detail screen you saw
 

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.300
you get into the detail screen you saw
that there is like there is an action

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.310
that there is like there is an action
 

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.550
that there is like there is an action
bar with no title and then there are two

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560
bar with no title and then there are two
 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.820
bar with no title and then there are two
fake titles or titles underneath the

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:27.830
fake titles or titles underneath the
 

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.830
fake titles or titles underneath the
action bar I just want to know to

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840
action bar I just want to know to
 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.629

everybody that the action bar actually

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639
everybody that the action bar actually
 

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:33.180
everybody that the action bar actually
supports both the title and a subtitle

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:33.190
supports both the title and a subtitle
 

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.790
supports both the title and a subtitle
so and since the the length of the text

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800
so and since the the length of the text
 

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.890
so and since the the length of the text
wasn't that long it seems you could

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:38.900
wasn't that long it seems you could
 

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.769
wasn't that long it seems you could
probably represent you know the title of

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:41.779
probably represent you know the title of
 

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:43.450
probably represent you know the title of
the screen in the action bar itself so

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:43.460
the screen in the action bar itself so
 

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.450
the screen in the action bar itself so
you have the the sound name at the top

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:46.460
you have the the sound name at the top
 

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.579
you have the the sound name at the top
as a title and then under that you have

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:48.589
as a title and then under that you have
 

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:49.930
as a title and then under that you have
the subtitle which I think was kind of

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940
the subtitle which I think was kind of
 

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.900
the subtitle which I think was kind of
like a category or kind of a further

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:51.910
like a category or kind of a further
 

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.970

that's very true and so similar along
 

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.640

directly to Facebook so again it'll be
 

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.730

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.040
facebook that yeah we basically need to
find because we need to push the images

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.050
find because we need to push the images
 

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.040
find because we need to push the images
on some server so we can if you want to

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.050
on some server so we can if you want to
 

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.690

you need to send you you are in right
 

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.350
you need to send you you are in right
but they need so you basically you

but they need so you basically you
 

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.329
but they need so you basically you
basically just have to attach in your

00:16:28.329 --> 00:16:28.339
basically just have to attach in your
 

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:30.280
basically just have to attach in your
action when you fire off action send

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:30.290
action when you fire off action send
 

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.560
action when you fire off action send
right you basically have to have a

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:32.570
right you basically have to have a
 

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.680
right you basically have to have a
content provider I believe that allows

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:35.690
content provider I believe that allows
 

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.040
content provider I believe that allows
the the app like Google+ or Facebook to

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.050
the the app like Google+ or Facebook to
 

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.470
the the app like Google+ or Facebook to
access your image then that app will

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480
access your image then that app will
 

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.420
access your image then that app will
take care of uploading it to the server

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.430
take care of uploading it to the server
 

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.220
take care of uploading it to the server
and doing whatever it needs to so

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.230
and doing whatever it needs to so
 

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.260
and doing whatever it needs to so
basically you only have to have a local

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:47.270
basically you only have to have a local
 

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.870
basically you only have to have a local
copy of that PNG and then the app that

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880
copy of that PNG and then the app that
 

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.840
copy of that PNG and then the app that
actually does the sending will take it

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:52.850
actually does the sending will take it
 

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.100
actually does the sending will take it
from get it from your app using a

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.110
from get it from your app using a
 

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.750
from get it from your app using a
content provider and then upload it to

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:55.760
content provider and then upload it to
 

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.579
content provider and then upload it to
their service okay I didn't know that

00:16:57.579 --> 00:16:57.589
their service okay I didn't know that
 

00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:59.860
their service okay I didn't know that
that I thought I need to okay I'll check

00:16:59.860 --> 00:16:59.870
that I thought I need to okay I'll check
 

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.600
that I thought I need to okay I'll check
it out but I think I thought even for

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.610
it out but I think I thought even for
 

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.990
it out but I think I thought even for
some so they they uploaded themselves

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000
some so they they uploaded themselves
 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.579
some so they they uploaded themselves
yes I mean okay so you just if you the

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:09.589
yes I mean okay so you just if you the
 

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.140
yes I mean okay so you just if you the
very simplest thing to do obviously if

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.150
very simplest thing to do obviously if
 

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.090
very simplest thing to do obviously if
you're like Google+ right is to just

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:13.100
you're like Google+ right is to just
 

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.069
you're like Google+ right is to just
accept the URL and show a preview of

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079
accept the URL and show a preview of
 

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.750
accept the URL and show a preview of
that URL and if that URL as an image

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760
that URL and if that URL as an image
 

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.939
that URL and if that URL as an image
then it just shows the image but google

00:17:18.939 --> 00:17:18.949
then it just shows the image but google
 

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:21.610
then it just shows the image but google
plus i believe i mean again this is up

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:21.620
plus i believe i mean again this is up
 

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.120
plus i believe i mean again this is up
to the app i'm just thinking of take

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:25.130
to the app i'm just thinking of take
 

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.949
to the app i'm just thinking of take
another one drop box for example dropbox

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959
another one drop box for example dropbox
 

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.230
another one drop box for example dropbox
is definitely a case where if you try to

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240
is definitely a case where if you try to
 

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.400
is definitely a case where if you try to
give them an image they're not gonna

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:30.410
give them an image they're not gonna
 

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.380
give them an image they're not gonna
sore the URL they'll actually take the

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.390
sore the URL they'll actually take the
 

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.000

that's one definite example okay so
 

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.410
that's one definite example okay so
definitely if that's definitely going to

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.420

flexibility that which
which i think is going to be really

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520
which i think is going to be really

particular screen I when I first looked
at it I pay so much attention to the

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.110
at it I pay so much attention to the

times to find it so maybe you can think
 

00:20:57.649 --> 00:20:59.499
times to find it so maybe you can think

next it's a notification agenda I think
 

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.619
next it's a notification agenda I think
is the the next app that we're going to

00:21:58.619 --> 00:21:58.629
is the the next app that we're going to
 

00:21:58.629 --> 00:22:01.739
is the the next app that we're going to
take a look at so I'm going to exit out

00:22:33.879 --> 00:22:35.549
much as as far as i can tell but it's
sort of claim to fame its uniqueness

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559
sort of claim to fame its uniqueness

now one of my pieces of feedback here is

00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919
now one of my pieces of feedback here is
 

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:58.320
now one of my pieces of feedback here is
that this touch target is way too small

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.330
that this touch target is way too small
 

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:00.389
that this touch target is way too small
it impossible to press so I'm going to

00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:00.399
it impossible to press so I'm going to
 

00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:03.479
it impossible to press so I'm going to
try and use the very smallest part of my

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:03.489
try and use the very smallest part of my
 

00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:06.180
try and use the very smallest part of my
pinky and you see it's now added that

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.190
pinky and you see it's now added that
 

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.830
pinky and you see it's now added that
note to my notification tray and then

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840
note to my notification tray and then
 

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.899
note to my notification tray and then
you can toggle that and then we'll be at

00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:09.909
you can toggle that and then we'll be at
 

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:11.549
you can toggle that and then we'll be at
it well that's a touch target that is a

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559
it well that's a touch target that is a
 

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.979
it well that's a touch target that is a
touch tonight one thing I was impossible

00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:13.989
touch tonight one thing I was impossible
 

00:23:13.989 --> 00:23:15.749
touch tonight one thing I was impossible
to touch touch target but a touch target

00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:15.759
to touch touch target but a touch target
 

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:17.549
to touch touch target but a touch target
nonetheless can make a note on that so I

00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:17.559
nonetheless can make a note on that so I
 

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:21.190
nonetheless can make a note on that so I
actually had a Google+ post on the

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200
actually had a Google+ post on the
 

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.039
actually had a Google+ post on the
exact problem a while ago maybe like

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:24.049
exact problem a while ago maybe like
 

00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:25.389
exact problem a while ago maybe like
several months ago I remember this yeah

00:23:25.389 --> 00:23:25.399
several months ago I remember this yeah
 

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:27.669
several months ago I remember this yeah
it was about touch delegates basically

00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679
it was about touch delegates basically
 

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:29.590
it was about touch delegates basically
the idea is that any time you have a

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600
the idea is that any time you have a
 

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.560
the idea is that any time you have a
list item with inner targets like that

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:32.570
list item with inner targets like that
 

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.750
list item with inner targets like that
tiny little either you want to make sure

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760
tiny little either you want to make sure
 

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.299
tiny little either you want to make sure
that your touch zones are simple and

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:37.309
that your touch zones are simple and
 

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.610
that your touch zones are simple and
like as big as possible so in this case

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:39.620
like as big as possible so in this case
 

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.799
like as big as possible so in this case
and I'm just a very summarize briefly

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:41.809
and I'm just a very summarize briefly
 

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:43.600
and I'm just a very summarize briefly
summarize what's the problem in this

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:43.610
summarize what's the problem in this
 

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.580
summarize what's the problem in this
case basically if you touch above or

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:45.590
case basically if you touch above or
 

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.279
case basically if you touch above or
below that that I you end up touching

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:48.289
below that that I you end up touching
 

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:49.960
below that that I you end up touching
the list item so you want to do is you

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:49.970
the list item so you want to do is you
 

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.000
the list item so you want to do is you
want to kind of simplify the zone so

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.010
want to kind of simplify the zone so
 

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.889
want to kind of simplify the zone so
that the left side of the list item is

00:23:53.889 --> 00:23:53.899
that the left side of the list item is
 

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:57.039
that the left side of the list item is
basically the the list item itself and

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:57.049
basically the the list item itself and
 

00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:59.799
basically the the list item itself and
the right side at least 48 dips and

00:23:59.799 --> 00:23:59.809
the right side at least 48 dips and
 

00:23:59.809 --> 00:24:01.210
the right side at least 48 dips and
width and the full height of that list

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:01.220
width and the full height of that list
 

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.169
width and the full height of that list
item is that secondary target I'm pretty

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:05.179
item is that secondary target I'm pretty
 

00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:06.460
item is that secondary target I'm pretty
much a zero percent chance that

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:06.470
much a zero percent chance that
 

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.350
much a zero percent chance that
someone's going to try and hit the list

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360
someone's going to try and hit the list
 

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.149
someone's going to try and hit the list
item just above go to the right hand

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159
item just above go to the right hand
 

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:12.850
item just above go to the right hand
side of that uh-huh and in case you

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:12.860
side of that uh-huh and in case you
 

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.639
side of that uh-huh and in case you
can't make your view the full height of

00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:15.649
can't make your view the full height of
 

00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:16.840
can't make your view the full height of
the list item you can use something

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:16.850
the list item you can use something
 

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.490
the list item you can use something
called the touch delegate to basically

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:18.500
called the touch delegate to basically
 

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.759
called the touch delegate to basically
say you know when you touch the this

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:21.769
say you know when you touch the this
 

00:24:21.769 --> 00:24:23.950
say you know when you touch the this
location on the parent view then

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960
location on the parent view then
 

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.990
location on the parent view then
actually send that touch to the

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000
actually send that touch to the
 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.360
actually send that touch to the
secondary view so it's just a secondary

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:28.370
secondary view so it's just a secondary
 

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.310
secondary view so it's just a secondary
way of doing that yeah it's a really

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320
way of doing that yeah it's a really
 

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.990
way of doing that yeah it's a really
good example of when this is the right

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000
good example of when this is the right
 

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.580
good example of when this is the right
approach because this this looks good

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:33.590
approach because this this looks good
 

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.470
approach because this this looks good
here having the before I I don't think

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480
here having the before I I don't think
 

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.269
here having the before I I don't think
you'd really want that to take up the

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279
you'd really want that to take up the
 

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.950
you'd really want that to take up the
full listeners it would kind of be

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960
full listeners it would kind of be
 

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.240
full listeners it would kind of be
cramped and I would hit the one below

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:40.250
cramped and I would hit the one below
 

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.250
cramped and I would hit the one below
and above it's having it inside i think

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.260
and above it's having it inside i think
 

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.200
and above it's having it inside i think
is the right approach but yeah you

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:44.210
is the right approach but yeah you
 

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.310
is the right approach but yeah you
definitely want to make sure that that's

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320
definitely want to make sure that that's
 

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.230
definitely want to make sure that that's
touchable because otherwise you do what

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240
touchable because otherwise you do what
 

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.610
touchable because otherwise you do what
I just did there we just click it then

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:48.620
I just did there we just click it then
 

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.600
I just did there we just click it then
it right now says unless if you click so

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:52.610
it right now says unless if you click so
 

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.909
it right now says unless if you click so
this is this is the no whew if so just

00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919
this is this is the no whew if so just
 

00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:56.740
this is this is the no whew if so just
to finish off sort of the details

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:56.750
to finish off sort of the details
 

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.899
to finish off sort of the details
they've got a viewpager effect here so

00:24:58.899 --> 00:24:58.909
they've got a viewpager effect here so
 

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:00.370
they've got a viewpager effect here so
that you can click across and choose

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380
that you can click across and choose
 

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.560
that you can click across and choose
your icon and go back and edit the note

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:02.570
your icon and go back and edit the note
 

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.990
your icon and go back and edit the note
so that's that's all nice overall you I

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000
so that's that's all nice overall you I
 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.450
so that's that's all nice overall you I
look and feel is reasonable you've got

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:07.460
look and feel is reasonable you've got
 

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.509
look and feel is reasonable you've got
this sort of action bar like effect up

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:10.519
this sort of action bar like effect up
 

00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:12.519
this sort of action bar like effect up
the topic no that's an actual action bar

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:12.529
the topic no that's an actual action bar
 

00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:15.879
the topic no that's an actual action bar
but it looks like one it's not it's not

00:25:15.879 --> 00:25:15.889
but it looks like one it's not it's not
 

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.030
but it looks like one it's not it's not
really an action bar

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.040
really an action bar
 

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.340
really an action bar
that's a crime side won nearly xanax

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:19.350
that's a crime side won nearly xanax
 

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.650
that's a crime side won nearly xanax
like one so to a certain degree that's

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:21.660
like one so to a certain degree that's
 

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.300
like one so to a certain degree that's
that's a reasonable approach but I think

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.310
that's a reasonable approach but I think
 

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.950
that's a reasonable approach but I think
room it's got some more detailed

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960
room it's got some more detailed
 

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.770
room it's got some more detailed
comments yeah so yeah maybe you want to

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:27.780
comments yeah so yeah maybe you want to
 

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.030
comments yeah so yeah maybe you want to
you want to kick off that that's the

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.040
you want to kick off that that's the
 

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.950
you want to kick off that that's the
functionality right its notes him and

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960
functionality right its notes him and
 

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.320
functionality right its notes him and
they persist in the notification train

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:33.330
they persist in the notification train
 

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.540
they persist in the notification train
so the I mean a lot of the comments that

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:35.550
so the I mean a lot of the comments that
 

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.130
so the I mean a lot of the comments that
I had were around the action bar so the

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140
I had were around the action bar so the
 

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.750
I had were around the action bar so the
first the first issue is that you have

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760
first the first issue is that you have
 

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.020
first the first issue is that you have
this up icon and the top left but it's

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.030
this up icon and the top left but it's
 

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.360
this up icon and the top left but it's
it's really it shows the home

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:44.370
it's really it shows the home
 

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.870
it's really it shows the home
iconography and the up iconography so

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880
iconography and the up iconography so
 

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.570
iconography and the up iconography so
that's a little confusing so basically

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580
that's a little confusing so basically
 

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.760
that's a little confusing so basically
you never want something that's both

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:52.770
you never want something that's both
 

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.500
you never want something that's both
home and up but it really should be

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:54.510
home and up but it really should be
 

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.570
home and up but it really should be
either home or up and generally should

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580
either home or up and generally should
 

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.280
either home or up and generally should
prefer up since that's kind of the

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:58.290
prefer up since that's kind of the
 

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.250
prefer up since that's kind of the
formalized pattern and so for up you

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260
formalized pattern and so for up you
 

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.230
formalized pattern and so for up you
basically just show your app icon and

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240
basically just show your app icon and
 

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.760
basically just show your app icon and
it's a it's a way to introduce branding

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:04.770
it's a it's a way to introduce branding
 

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.310
it's a it's a way to introduce branding
into the app and kind of the little left

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320
into the app and kind of the little left
 

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.580
into the app and kind of the little left
carrot the other issue is that on the

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:10.590
carrot the other issue is that on the
 

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.580
carrot the other issue is that on the
and the home screen yeah that top left

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:13.590
and the home screen yeah that top left
 

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.070
and the home screen yeah that top left
area is actually the overflow yeah let's

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080
area is actually the overflow yeah let's
 

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.510
area is actually the overflow yeah let's
so let's go back to the to the phone

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520
so let's go back to the to the phone
 

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.430
so let's go back to the to the phone
land and we can see this quite quite

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440
land and we can see this quite quite
 

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.380
land and we can see this quite quite
clearly here so we've got this sort of

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:21.390
clearly here so we've got this sort of
 

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.880
clearly here so we've got this sort of
traditional action bar with the the

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:22.890
traditional action bar with the the
 

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.230
traditional action bar with the the
actions over here on the right with a

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240
actions over here on the right with a
 

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.810
actions over here on the right with a
refreshin and create new and I just want

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:26.820
refreshin and create new and I just want
 

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.670
refreshin and create new and I just want
to point out that the create new icon

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:28.680
to point out that the create new icon
 

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.170
to point out that the create new icon
over here is actually looks a lot like

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:30.180
over here is actually looks a lot like
 

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.420
over here is actually looks a lot like
an edit icon now you may want to

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.430
an edit icon now you may want to
 

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.770
an edit icon now you may want to
consider replacing that with sort of the

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:33.780
consider replacing that with sort of the
 

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.680
consider replacing that with sort of the
thin plus symbol jepang is more than the

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:36.690
thin plus symbol jepang is more than the
 

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.870
thin plus symbol jepang is more than the

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880
style and what Romans referring to over
 

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.900
style and what Romans referring to over
here is is the app icon so I think to go

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:41.910
here is is the app icon so I think to go
 

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.100
here is is the app icon so I think to go
back to what you were saying before this

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:43.110
back to what you were saying before this
 

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.050
back to what you were saying before this
this is this should be consistent right

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:45.060
this is this should be consistent right
 

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.520
this is this should be consistent right
there should always be that icon and

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:46.530
there should always be that icon and
 

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.130
there should always be that icon and
they need it with the back up carrot or

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140
they need it with the back up carrot or
 

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.870
they need it with the back up carrot or
not I mean it doesn't necessarily have

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880
not I mean it doesn't necessarily have
 

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.970
not I mean it doesn't necessarily have
to be that icon it should be some sort

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980
to be that icon it should be some sort
 

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.850
to be that icon it should be some sort
of iconography or a logo or nothing at

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860
of iconography or a logo or nothing at
 

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.620
of iconography or a logo or nothing at

that's kind of deprecated you should no
 

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.900
that's kind of deprecated you should no
longer use done okay so um but so here's

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:05.910
longer use done okay so um but so here's
 

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.880
longer use done okay so um but so here's
the really interesting thing is that so

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:07.890
the really interesting thing is that so
 

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.220
the really interesting thing is that so
as an Android user I think what we all

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:10.230
as an Android user I think what we all
 

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.290
as an Android user I think what we all
expect is that if you hit something with

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:12.300
expect is that if you hit something with
 

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.580
expect is that if you hit something with
a drop down on this side is going to be

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:13.590

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:44.470
overflow menu here it means that it
 

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:46.529
overflow menu here it means that it
either completely undiscoverable or

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:46.539
either completely undiscoverable or
 

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:49.440
either completely undiscoverable or
completely unintuitive so it's fine to

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:49.450
completely unintuitive so it's fine to
 

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.610
completely unintuitive so it's fine to
have these things but they should

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:50.620
have these things but they should
 

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.340
have these things but they should
totally be on the Nova flow menus over

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:53.350
totally be on the Nova flow menus over
 

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.649
totally be on the Nova flow menus over
here on the far right hand so having the

00:27:55.649 --> 00:27:55.659
here on the far right hand so having the
 

00:27:55.659 --> 00:27:57.509
here on the far right hand so having the
consistency would be pretty important

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519
consistency would be pretty important
 

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:59.340
consistency would be pretty important
yeah users so for these sorts of things

00:27:59.340 --> 00:27:59.350
yeah users so for these sorts of things
 

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:01.830
yeah users so for these sorts of things
is like this is no user is ever going to

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840
is like this is no user is ever going to
 

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.480
is like this is no user is ever going to
expect this and where they when they are

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:03.490
expect this and where they when they are
 

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:04.590
expect this and where they when they are
looking for settings are going to be

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600
looking for settings are going to be
 

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.119
looking for settings are going to be
expecting them over on this side so

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:06.129
expecting them over on this side so
 

00:28:06.129 --> 00:28:08.789
expecting them over on this side so
that's it's kind of a must fix straight

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799
that's it's kind of a must fix straight
 

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:14.039
that's it's kind of a must fix straight
away get on it I so two more slow

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:14.049
away get on it I so two more slow
 

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:16.259
away get on it I so two more slow
actually one more general thing is when

00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:16.269
actually one more general thing is when
 

00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:18.180
actually one more general thing is when
you get into the the edit or the detail

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:18.190
you get into the the edit or the detail
 

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.409
you get into the the edit or the detail
of you um there are one two three four

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:22.419
of you um there are one two three four
 

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:24.570
of you um there are one two three four
different ways in which you can accept

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:24.580
different ways in which you can accept
 

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.499
different ways in which you can accept
or cancel basically if you if you press

00:28:28.499 --> 00:28:28.509
or cancel basically if you if you press
 

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:31.350
or cancel basically if you if you press
back it cancels if you press up it also

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360
back it cancels if you press up it also
 

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.269
back it cancels if you press up it also
cancels if you press the X it also

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279
cancels if you press the X it also
 

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.759
cancels if you press the X it also
cancels the only way to actually save is

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:35.769
cancels the only way to actually save is
 

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:38.460
cancels the only way to actually save is
to press the check box interest so what

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:38.470
to press the check box interest so what
 

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.720
to press the check box interest so what
you should do is you should simplify

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:39.730
you should do is you should simplify
 

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.720
you should do is you should simplify
this so in general you don't want users

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:42.730
this so in general you don't want users
 

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.970
this so in general you don't want users
to lose progress right so if i just

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:44.980
to lose progress right so if i just
 

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.230
to lose progress right so if i just
typed out and i know this is for a

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240
typed out and i know this is for a
 

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.490
typed out and i know this is for a
notification so it's probably a very

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:47.500
notification so it's probably a very
 

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.350
notification so it's probably a very
short note but if i just typed out

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360
short note but if i just typed out
 

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.789
short note but if i just typed out
something fairly important like a phone

00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799
something fairly important like a phone
 

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:52.350
something fairly important like a phone
number or an ID or something that i have

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360
number or an ID or something that i have
 

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.539
number or an ID or something that i have
to remember pressing back should not

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:54.549
to remember pressing back should not
 

00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:56.940
to remember pressing back should not
just cancel it it should probably save

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:56.950
just cancel it it should probably save
 

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.740
just cancel it it should probably save
it and just automatically assume that

00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:58.750
it and just automatically assume that
 

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.970
it and just automatically assume that
the user meant press ok or you know if

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:02.980
the user meant press ok or you know if
 

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.799
the user meant press ok or you know if
you absolutely have to then show the

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:04.809
you absolutely have to then show the
 

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.180
you absolutely have to then show the
dialog saying actually do you want to

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:06.190
dialog saying actually do you want to
 

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.129
dialog saying actually do you want to
save or not but what it does now is is

00:29:08.129 --> 00:29:08.139
save or not but what it does now is is
 

00:29:08.139 --> 00:29:10.259
save or not but what it does now is is
dan correct behavior i think is that you

00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:10.269
dan correct behavior i think is that you
 

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:11.490
dan correct behavior i think is that you
know it actually just discards right

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:11.500
know it actually just discards right
 

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.259
know it actually just discards right
well i think the first option you

00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:13.269
well i think the first option you
 

00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:14.759
well i think the first option you
mentioned is the preferred way in an

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:14.769
mentioned is the preferred way in an
 

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:16.740
mentioned is the preferred way in an
opinion ya like like a gmail behavior

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:16.750
opinion ya like like a gmail behavior
 

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.779
opinion ya like like a gmail behavior
right when you're composing a net and

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:18.789
right when you're composing a net and
 

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:20.639
right when you're composing a net and
email when you press back it

00:29:20.639 --> 00:29:20.649
email when you press back it
 

00:29:20.649 --> 00:29:22.690
email when you press back it
automatically saves your

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.700
automatically saves your
 

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.110
automatically saves your
email message in progress into draft

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120
email message in progress into draft
 

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.340
email message in progress into draft
Pacific's I think it kind of implies I

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.350
Pacific's I think it kind of implies I
 

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.750
Pacific's I think it kind of implies I
don't know how it works behind the

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760
don't know how it works behind the
 

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.490
don't know how it works behind the
scenes but it implies that if you know

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:30.500
scenes but it implies that if you know
 

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.080
scenes but it implies that if you know
if I'm typing away something detailed

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.090
if I'm typing away something detailed
 

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.580
if I'm typing away something detailed
here and then I get an incoming phone

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:33.590
here and then I get an incoming phone
 

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.140
here and then I get an incoming phone
call and then that comes I'd rather do

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:35.150
call and then that comes I'd rather do
 

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:36.640
call and then that comes I'd rather do
something else and the app gets killed

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:36.650
something else and the app gets killed
 

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.500
something else and the app gets killed
sometime in the background you know I'm

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:38.510
sometime in the background you know I'm
 

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.940
sometime in the background you know I'm
not convinced here that when i started

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:39.950
not convinced here that when i started
 

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.500
not convinced here that when i started
up it's going to be saved that's right

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:41.510
up it's going to be saved that's right
 

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.990
up it's going to be saved that's right
and I think you know you make a good

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000
and I think you know you make a good
 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.150
and I think you know you make a good
point as three ways to not save your

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.160
point as three ways to not save your
 

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.040
point as three ways to not save your
information and only one way to save it

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.050
information and only one way to save it
 

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.380
information and only one way to save it
kind of implies that not saving your

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:50.390
kind of implies that not saving your
 

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.970
kind of implies that not saving your
information is is more important than

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:51.980
information is is more important than
 

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.470
information is is more important than
saving it now can't think of any

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480
saving it now can't think of any
 

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.840
saving it now can't think of any
situations with that slightly case now

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:55.850
situations with that slightly case now
 

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.940
situations with that slightly case now
so you want to switch that priority

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:57.950
so you want to switch that priority
 

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.510
so you want to switch that priority

something along the lines not even need

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.180
something along the lines not even need
 

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.660
something along the lines not even need
to have an X button it's but yeah just a

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:07.670
to have an X button it's but yeah just a
 

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.280
to have an X button it's but yeah just a
tick and you press that in it and it

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:09.290
tick and you press that in it and it
 

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.930
tick and you press that in it and it
goes back and there's a way to do that

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940
goes back and there's a way to do that
 

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.910
goes back and there's a way to do that
with the action bar exam so we invite

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:12.920
with the action bar exam so we invite
 

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.860
with the action bar exam so we invite

there's a way to sell it yeah I'm happy
with this edit yeah so so the top left

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.290
with this edit yeah so so the top left
 

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.780
with this edit yeah so so the top left
and in some of our apps we actually have

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:22.790
and in some of our apps we actually have
 

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.470
and in some of our apps we actually have
the top left as a checkbox and done and

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480
the top left as a checkbox and done and
 

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.200
the top left as a checkbox and done and
you can you can't do that using like by

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.210
you can you can't do that using like by
 

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.540
you can you can't do that using like by
just simply saying I'll do that you have

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:31.550
just simply saying I'll do that you have
 

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:34.960
just simply saying I'll do that you have
to provide I think a custom view and but

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:34.970
to provide I think a custom view and but
 

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.610
to provide I think a custom view and but
it's easier to probably grab it from the

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:36.620
it's easier to probably grab it from the
 

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.140
it's easier to probably grab it from the
open source project in and do it but

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.150
open source project in and do it but
 

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.250
open source project in and do it but
basically the top left you don't even

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.260
basically the top left you don't even
 

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.230
basically the top left you don't even
need the icon at or an UP button it

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240
need the icon at or an UP button it
 

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.780
need the icon at or an UP button it
could just be done checkbox done yes and

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:43.790
could just be done checkbox done yes and
 

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.190
could just be done checkbox done yes and
in the top right having something like

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200
in the top right having something like
 

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.530
in the top right having something like
this card with your text I scarred yeah

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:47.540
this card with your text I scarred yeah
 

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.060
this card with your text I scarred yeah
and then that's a nice effect because I

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.070
and then that's a nice effect because I
 

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.160
and then that's a nice effect because I
need to be basically saying like this is

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.170
need to be basically saying like this is
 

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.870
need to be basically saying like this is
just a temporary modal scenario where

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880
just a temporary modal scenario where
 

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.070
just a temporary modal scenario where
you want to do something and then just

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080
you want to do something and then just
 

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.960

to interact with that particular screen
right yeah basically if I've gone to the

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.130
right yeah basically if I've gone to the
 

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.380
right yeah basically if I've gone to the
screen I've already made the conscious

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:02.390
screen I've already made the conscious
 

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.150

decision to save something so that
 

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.610
decision to save something so that
should be the default kind of the

default expectations that the user

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240
default expectations that the user
 

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.340
default expectations that the user
actually wants to save with their

actually wants to save with their
writing right so you have to make the

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:10.910
writing right so you have to make the
 

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.130
writing right so you have to make the
assumption that the user would have to

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:12.140
assumption that the user would have to
 

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.380
assumption that the user would have to
consciously cancel it yet and you cancel

significance yeah that there would be a

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:17.190
significance yeah that there would be a
 

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.739

great suggestion especially you know on
 

00:32:18.749 --> 00:32:22.099
great suggestion especially you know on
the tablet which used to be running high

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:22.109
the tablet which used to be running high
 

00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:24.080

when i first tested it on a tablet you

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.090
when i first tested it on a tablet you
 

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.789
when i first tested it on a tablet you
know imagine again what you're looking

00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799
know imagine again what you're looking
 

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:28.220
know imagine again what you're looking
at here is an expanded screen you have a

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:28.230
at here is an expanded screen you have a
 

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.639
at here is an expanded screen you have a
lot of white space and this developer

00:32:30.639 --> 00:32:30.649
lot of white space and this developer
 

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:33.889
lot of white space and this developer
you produce should look into increasing

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899
you produce should look into increasing
 

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:35.419
you produce should look into increasing
the side margins a little bit to make it

00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:35.429
the side margins a little bit to make it
 

00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:37.879
the side margins a little bit to make it
look visually nice and I'm sure Roman

00:32:37.879 --> 00:32:37.889
look visually nice and I'm sure Roman
 

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.830
look visually nice and I'm sure Roman
has more for sure yeah i mean the

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840
has more for sure yeah i mean the
 

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.359
has more for sure yeah i mean the
padding for sure can of worms the

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:44.369
padding for sure can of worms the
 

00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:45.859
padding for sure can of worms the
padding for sure something you could do

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:45.869
padding for sure something you could do
 

00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:47.930
padding for sure something you could do
with the the titles as I think we

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940
with the the titles as I think we
 

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.190
with the the titles as I think we
mention this in the Hangout office hours

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200
mention this in the Hangout office hours
 

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.470
mention this in the Hangout office hours
but a neat thing to do is just I use the

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480
but a neat thing to do is just I use the
 

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.180
but a neat thing to do is just I use the
list separator text view style as the

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.190
list separator text view style as the
 

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.909
list separator text view style as the
heading and then completely remove

00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919
heading and then completely remove
 

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:58.909
heading and then completely remove
completely remove the background on the

00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919
completely remove the background on the
 

00:32:58.919 --> 00:33:00.979
completely remove the background on the
text fields themselves so the text field

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:00.989
text fields themselves so the text field
 

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:02.779
text fields themselves so the text field
effectively becomes just an open area

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:02.789
effectively becomes just an open area
 

00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:05.659
effectively becomes just an open area
like inviting you to type content and

00:33:05.659 --> 00:33:05.669
like inviting you to type content and
 

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:07.340
like inviting you to type content and
then you apply the kind of the border to

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.350
then you apply the kind of the border to
 

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.810
then you apply the kind of the border to
indicate the different regions on the

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.820
indicate the different regions on the
 

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.200
indicate the different regions on the
headers not on the text field nice so

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.210
headers not on the text field nice so
 

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.999
headers not on the text field nice so
yeah so overall I think it's definitely

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:14.009
yeah so overall I think it's definitely
 

00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:17.299
yeah so overall I think it's definitely
not good potential it is kind of a very

00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:17.309
not good potential it is kind of a very
 

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:20.389
not good potential it is kind of a very
simple idea but if it's kind of a good

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399
simple idea but if it's kind of a good
 

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:21.600
simple idea but if it's kind of a good
way of being able to put things in

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:21.610
way of being able to put things in
 

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.789
way of being able to put things in
which is visible what 11 little bit of

00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799
which is visible what 11 little bit of
 

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:25.020
which is visible what 11 little bit of
feedback but I did have in terms of

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.030
feedback but I did have in terms of
 

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:27.120
feedback but I did have in terms of
functionality is that I thought it would

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.130
functionality is that I thought it would
 

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.049
functionality is that I thought it would
be nice once you've got these

00:33:28.049 --> 00:33:28.059
be nice once you've got these
 

00:33:28.059 --> 00:33:30.900
be nice once you've got these
notifications here to be able to dismiss

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:30.910
notifications here to be able to dismiss
 

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.549
notifications here to be able to dismiss
these so these aren't dismissible as you

00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559
these so these aren't dismissible as you
 

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:33.539
these so these aren't dismissible as you
can see by the fact that they're

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:33.549
can see by the fact that they're
 

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:36.120
can see by the fact that they're
bouncing back but if I could dismiss

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.130
bouncing back but if I could dismiss
 

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.010
bouncing back but if I could dismiss
this and then it would just toggle that

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.020
this and then it would just toggle that
 

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.750
this and then it would just toggle that
visibility flow mini and I think that

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760
visibility flow mini and I think that
 

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.030
visibility flow mini and I think that
would be kind of a neat thing because I

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.040
would be kind of a neat thing because I
 

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.060
would be kind of a neat thing because I
could see this would be a much more

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.070
could see this would be a much more
 

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.280
could see this would be a much more
convenient shopping list app for me and

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.290
convenient shopping list app for me and
 

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.200
convenient shopping list app for me and

exactly gangs swipe and I'd love to

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.070
exactly gangs swipe and I'd love to
 

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.410
exactly gangs swipe and I'd love to
navigate through an app or any of that

time consuming to keep the little box

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.100
time consuming to keep the little box
 

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.130
time consuming to keep the little box
it's just bang bang bang bang bang so

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:56.140
it's just bang bang bang bang bang so
 

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.659
it's just bang bang bang bang bang so
that to me would actually make this

00:33:57.659 --> 00:33:57.669
that to me would actually make this
 

00:33:57.669 --> 00:34:00.360
that to me would actually make this
really I think you can specify in the

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:00.370
really I think you can specify in the
 

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.640
really I think you can specify in the
notifications framework a dismiss intent

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:02.650
notifications framework a dismiss intent
 

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.710
notifications framework a dismiss intent
so that when it gets dismissed you can

get is two back buttons so that kind of

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:44.190

back button yes you don't need to all

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:47.910
back button yes you don't need to all
 

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.100
back button yes you don't need to all
right what I would suggest here is

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.110
right what I would suggest here is
 

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.660
right what I would suggest here is
actually really simple as just turn that

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:50.670
actually really simple as just turn that
 

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.940
actually really simple as just turn that
into it into a tick into an exception

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:52.950
into it into a tick into an exception
 

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.250
into it into a tick into an exception
and then you kind of got exactly the

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260
and then you kind of got exactly the
 

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.510
and then you kind of got exactly the
same functionality as you're doing now

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520
same functionality as you're doing now
 

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.880
same functionality as you're doing now
but it's a little more obvious to me

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:58.890
but it's a little more obvious to me
 

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.800
but it's a little more obvious to me
yeah but this has been you know the

difference between and we when we first
 

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.660
difference between and we when we first
introduced up people were like that's

it's for sure different we have been a

kind of the key and the other thing i
would like to point out is that not only

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:11.900
would like to point out is that not only
 

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.380
would like to point out is that not only

yeah you know what you don't have actual

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.180
yeah you know what you don't have actual
 

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.969
yeah you know what you don't have actual
back button that's not pretty you also

have an actual back button that's next

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:48.109
have an actual back button that's next
 

00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:50.589
have an actual back button that's next
to the hard back buttons yes all right

00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599
to the hard back buttons yes all right
 

00:39:50.599 --> 00:39:55.150

so this goes along the same life line

00:39:58.359 --> 00:39:58.369
so this goes along the same life line
 

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:01.089
so this goes along the same life line
too confusing iconography so up here

00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:01.099

don't know that you guys are going to
see what that is but it's instead of the

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880
see what that is but it's instead of the
 

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.059
see what that is but it's instead of the
app icon and it's got a tiny little left

00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:10.069
app icon and it's got a tiny little left
 

00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:12.819
app icon and it's got a tiny little left
triangle next to it and so that looks

00:40:12.819 --> 00:40:12.829
triangle next to it and so that looks
 

00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:15.729
triangle next to it and so that looks
like it should be up right yeah but it

00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:15.739
like it should be up right yeah but it
 

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:17.979
like it should be up right yeah but it
isn't it's it's collapse which actually

00:40:17.979 --> 00:40:17.989
isn't it's it's collapse which actually
 

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:20.380
isn't it's it's collapse which actually
makes more sense in this context as to

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:20.390
makes more sense in this context as to
 

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.589
makes more sense in this context as to
what it is but that was totally fake to

sort of display that kind of an arm so
 

00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:34.359
sort of display that kind of an arm so
the the closest pattern to this I'd say

00:40:34.359 --> 00:40:34.369
the the closest pattern to this I'd say
 

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.039
the the closest pattern to this I'd say
is is something that we see more on

how to deal with fragments specifically
on portrait and landscape but you know

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800
on portrait and landscape but you know
 

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.020
on portrait and landscape but you know
making sure that you have the same

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.030
making sure that you have the same
 

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.300
making sure that you have the same
functionality across both and in this

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:54.310
functionality across both and in this
 

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.890
functionality across both and in this
case you don't have two fragments you

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:55.900
case you don't have two fragments you
 

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.840
case you don't have two fragments you
really just have a kind of alternative

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:57.850
really just have a kind of alternative
 

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.570
really just have a kind of alternative
navigation along the left side and so I

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:00.580
navigation along the left side and so I
 

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.150
navigation along the left side and so I
don't think that you know it makes too

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160
don't think that you know it makes too
 

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.060
don't think that you know it makes too
much sense to have this you may be able

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.070
much sense to have this you may be able
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.100
much sense to have this you may be able
to do the same exact thing by offering

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:08.110
to do the same exact thing by offering
 

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.500
to do the same exact thing by offering
kind of left and right swipe or or even

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:10.510
kind of left and right swipe or or even
 

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.750
kind of left and right swipe or or even
a drop down in the action bar but if you

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760
a drop down in the action bar but if you
 

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.240
a drop down in the action bar but if you
absolutely positively have to stick with

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.250
absolutely positively have to stick with
 

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.740
absolutely positively have to stick with
something like this what I would make

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:16.750
something like this what I would make
 

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.080
something like this what I would make
sure to do is follow the kind of that

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.090
sure to do is follow the kind of that
 

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:21.690
sure to do is follow the kind of that
pattern on tablet basically the idea is

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:21.700
pattern on tablet basically the idea is
 

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.820
pattern on tablet basically the idea is
that that up button is always up if you

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:23.830
that that up button is always up if you
 

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.660
that that up button is always up if you
press it if you press it and that left

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:27.670
press it if you press it and that left
 

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.180
press it if you press it and that left
pane is not visible then it shows the

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:30.190
pane is not visible then it shows the
 

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.920
pane is not visible then it shows the
left pane it should probably slide in to

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:31.930
left pane it should probably slide in to
 

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.160
left pane it should probably slide in to
indicate kind of best yeah but then when

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:35.170
indicate kind of best yeah but then when
 

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.420
indicate kind of best yeah but then when
if you press it again it shouldn't

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:36.430
if you press it again it shouldn't
 

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.670
if you press it again it shouldn't
collapse it you should basically just be

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680
collapse it you should basically just be
 

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.230
collapse it you should basically just be
going up the hierarchy not kind of

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240
going up the hierarchy not kind of
 

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.460
going up the hierarchy not kind of
toggle expired between yeah so that's

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:44.470
toggle expired between yeah so that's
 

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.080
toggle expired between yeah so that's
one thing I recommend but again I think

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.090
one thing I recommend but again I think
 

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.060
one thing I recommend but again I think
the basic recommendation here is I think

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.070
the basic recommendation here is I think
 

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.100
the basic recommendation here is I think
not to use this kind of side pane first

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:50.110
not to use this kind of side pane first
 

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.290
not to use this kind of side pane first
of all on a phone and portrait it limits

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:52.300
of all on a phone and portrait it limits
 

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.360
of all on a phone and portrait it limits
your horizontal space which is general

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:54.370
your horizontal space which is general
 

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:55.920
your horizontal space which is general
not a good thing to do I think they're

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:55.930
not a good thing to do I think they're
 

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.320
not a good thing to do I think they're
just other ways to do this that you the

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.330
just other ways to do this that you the
 

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.700
just other ways to do this that you the
same result how does it look in that

00:41:59.700 --> 00:41:59.710
same result how does it look in that
 

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.100
same result how does it look in that
scheme quickly I was going to say as

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:02.110
scheme quickly I was going to say as
 

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.140
scheme quickly I was going to say as
well along the same lines that up you

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.150
well along the same lines that up you
 

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.250
well along the same lines that up you
know an alternative to that is to

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:05.260
know an alternative to that is to
 

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.920
know an alternative to that is to
basically have thee that's it makes a

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:07.930
basically have thee that's it makes a
 

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:09.330
basically have thee that's it makes a
little bit more sense in in landscape

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:09.340
little bit more sense in in landscape
 

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.590
little bit more sense in in landscape
having that calm down yeah because you

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:10.600
having that calm down yeah because you
 

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.170
having that calm down yeah because you
got the extra horizon-- win but one

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:13.180
got the extra horizon-- win but one
 

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.250
got the extra horizon-- win but one
thing which you might want to consider

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:14.260
thing which you might want to consider
 

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.110
thing which you might want to consider
as an alternative is to use sort of the

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:16.120
as an alternative is to use sort of the
 

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.240
as an alternative is to use sort of the
more standard action bar navigation very

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.250
more standard action bar navigation very
 

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.640
more standard action bar navigation very
similar to what gmail does we have a

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:20.650
similar to what gmail does we have a
 

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.430
similar to what gmail does we have a
drop down here which lets you select a

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440
drop down here which lets you select a
 

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.590
drop down here which lets you select a
witch of the books that you want to have

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:25.600
witch of the books that you want to have
 

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.270
witch of the books that you want to have
so gmail does this really well with

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280
so gmail does this really well with
 

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.950
so gmail does this really well with
labels and with accounts so that's

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960
labels and with accounts so that's
 

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.770
labels and with accounts so that's
probably the approach that I think

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780
probably the approach that I think
 

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.330
probably the approach that I think
another comment here just generally the

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:33.340
another comment here just generally the
 

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.970
another comment here just generally the
the COG here implies settings what it

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:35.980
the COG here implies settings what it
 

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.980
the COG here implies settings what it
kind of really is is the ability to

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:37.990
kind of really is is the ability to
 

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.860
kind of really is is the ability to
either add a new book or modify the

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:40.870
either add a new book or modify the
 

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.130
either add a new book or modify the
existing ones that's not entirely in yo

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:44.140
existing ones that's not entirely in yo
 

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.780
existing ones that's not entirely in yo
to me the way that works and I'd

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:45.790
to me the way that works and I'd
 

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.550
to me the way that works and I'd
consider sort of simplifying this so the

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:47.560
consider sort of simplifying this so the
 

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.730
consider sort of simplifying this so the
COG becomes a plus

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:48.740
COG becomes a plus
 

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.470
COG becomes a plus
and all you do there is create a new

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480
and all you do there is create a new
 

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.540
and all you do there is create a new
book and that should probably be an

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:52.550
book and that should probably be an
 

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.800
book and that should probably be an
action or something along those lines

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:53.810
action or something along those lines
 

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.510
action or something along those lines
and then edit could have to be a

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520
and then edit could have to be a
 

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.390
and then edit could have to be a
settings menu thing so I already wrote

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400
settings menu thing so I already wrote
 

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.620
settings menu thing so I already wrote
to too much detail that but just

00:42:59.620 --> 00:42:59.630
to too much detail that but just
 

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.970
to too much detail that but just
generally speaking I think it's a little

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:00.980
generally speaking I think it's a little
 

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.950
generally speaking I think it's a little
bit more confusing the last bit is that

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960
bit more confusing the last bit is that
 

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.290
bit more confusing the last bit is that
there's a legacy menu button there there

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:05.300
there's a legacy menu button there there
 

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.480
there's a legacy menu button there there
is sustained by dry ice cream truck

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:07.490
is sustained by dry ice cream truck
 

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.850
is sustained by dry ice cream truck
gambia so actually yeah it does stuff

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:09.860
gambia so actually yeah it does stuff
 

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.350
gambia so actually yeah it does stuff
which means it's not technically a

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:11.360
which means it's not technically a
 

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.290
which means it's not technically a
bottom of shame Rohach is good but yeah

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:14.300
bottom of shame Rohach is good but yeah
 

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.510
bottom of shame Rohach is good but yeah
you want to you can really easily change

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520
you want to you can really easily change
 

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.920
you want to you can really easily change
this into an overflow menu again the

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:17.930
this into an overflow menu again the
 

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.720
this into an overflow menu again the
same functionality so I wouldn't do that

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:19.730
same functionality so I wouldn't do that
 

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.080
same functionality so I wouldn't do that
I didn't like that got some nice

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:23.090
I didn't like that got some nice
 

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.020
I didn't like that got some nice
drag-and-drop action here so yeah there

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.030
drag-and-drop action here so yeah there
 

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.160
drag-and-drop action here so yeah there
they've actually got a thumbnail here

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:27.170
they've actually got a thumbnail here
 

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.740
they've actually got a thumbnail here
and you can drag it onto the tube into

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:29.750
and you can drag it onto the tube into
 

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.900
and you can drag it onto the tube into
the latest cool interestingly the other

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:31.910
the latest cool interestingly the other
 

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.290
the latest cool interestingly the other
bin graphics look a little grainy like

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:35.300
bin graphics look a little grainy like
 

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.359
bin graphics look a little grainy like
it's too it's too small it's just being

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:37.369
it's too it's too small it's just being
 

00:43:37.369 --> 00:43:41.530
it's too it's too small it's just being
pulled up yeah i'm guessing it's been

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:41.540
pulled up yeah i'm guessing it's been
 

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.060
pulled up yeah i'm guessing it's been
borrowed from somewhere in the the

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.070
borrowed from somewhere in the the
 

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.490
borrowed from somewhere in the the
framework and there's just no hdpi or

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:45.500
framework and there's just no hdpi or
 

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.970
framework and there's just no hdpi or
xhdpi assets for it so again I think

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:48.980
xhdpi assets for it so again I think
 

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.680
xhdpi assets for it so again I think
about maybe in fact it's just a rounded

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:50.690
about maybe in fact it's just a rounded
 

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.240
about maybe in fact it's just a rounded
rectangle with an icon in it so you may

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.250
rectangle with an icon in it so you may
 

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.490
rectangle with an icon in it so you may
be able to do something using a durable

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:54.500
be able to do something using a durable
 

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.040
be able to do something using a durable
i shaped horrible to cheaper in a

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:57.050
i shaped horrible to cheaper in a
 

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.390
i shaped horrible to cheaper in a
scalable way okay any other comments on

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400
scalable way okay any other comments on
 

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.849
scalable way okay any other comments on
that one that covers it i think that the

00:44:03.849 --> 00:44:03.859
that one that covers it i think that the
 

00:44:03.859 --> 00:44:05.349
that one that covers it i think that the
one really cool thing is i mean the

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359
one really cool thing is i mean the
 

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:07.240
