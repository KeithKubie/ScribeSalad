00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:10.329
Why does salt dissolve in water but oil doesn't?

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:12.124
Well, in a word, chemistry,

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:14.328
but that's not very satisfying, is it?

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:17.442
Well, the reason salt dissolves and oil does not

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.152
comes down to the two big reasons

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.348
why anything happens at all:

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:22.281
energetics

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.489
and entropy.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.322
Energetics deals primarily

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:28.203
with the attractive forces between things.

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:31.155
When we look at oil or salt in water,

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:34.152
we focus on the forces between particles

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:36.779
on a very, very, very small scale,

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:38.180
the molecular level.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.898
To give you a sense of this scale,

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:41.599
in one glass of water,

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:43.110
there are more molecules

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.816
than known stars in the universe.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.448
Now, all of these molecules are in constant motion,

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.460
moving, vibrating, and rotating.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.774
What prevents almost all of those molecules

00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:56.858
from just flying out of the glass

00:00:56.858 --> 00:01:00.270
are the attractive interactions between molecules.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.230
The strength of the interactions

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.482
between water, itself, and other substances

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:07.733
is what we mean when we say energetics.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.874
You can think of the water molecules engaging

00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:11.419
in a constant dance,

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:13.047
sort of like a square dance

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:16.501
where they constantly and randomly exchange partners.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:19.185
Put simply, the ability for substances

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.676
to interact with water,

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:22.298
balanced with how they disrupt

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.881
how water interacts with itself,

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.230
plays an important role in explaining

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.899
why certain things mix well into water

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.649
and others don't.

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:33.912
Entropy basically describes

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:36.631
the way things and energy can be arranged

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.503
based on random motion.

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:41.200
For example, think of the air in a room.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.062
Imagine all the different possible arrangements

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.650
in space for the trillions of particles

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.131
that make up the air.

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:49.167
Some of those arrangments

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.163
might have all the oxygen molecules over here

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.814
and all the nitrogen molecules over there,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.855
separated.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.230
But far more of the possible arrangements

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
have those molecules mixed up with one another.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.481
So, entropy favors mixing.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.334
Energetics deals with attractive forces.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.417
And so, if attractive forces are present,

00:02:08.417 --> 00:02:10.321
the probability of some arrangements

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.500
can be enhanced,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.780
the ones where things are attracted to each other.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.294
So, it is always the balance of these two things

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:18.871
that determines what happens.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.285
On the molecular level,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.664
water is comprised of water molecules,

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:25.829
made up of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.497
As liquid water, these molecules are engaged

00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:30.831
in a constant and random square dance

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:34.386
that is called the hydrogen bonding network.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.771
Entropy favors keeping

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.018
the square dance going at all times.

00:02:38.018 --> 00:02:39.314
There are always more ways

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:41.142
that all the water molecules can arrange

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:42.349
in a square dance,

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.790
as compared to if the water molecules

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.421
did a line dance.

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.781
So, the square dance constantly goes on.

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:50.750
So, what happens when you put salt in the water?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.748
Well, on the molecular level,

00:02:52.748 --> 00:02:55.584
salt is actually made up of two different ions,

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:57.838
chlorine and sodium,

00:02:57.838 --> 00:03:00.082
that are organized like a brick wall.

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:01.502
They show up to the dance

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.386
as a big group in formation

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:05.040
and sit on the side at first,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.431
shy and a bit reluctant to break apart

00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:10.272
into individual ions to join the dance.

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:12.456
But secretly, those shy dancers

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:15.009
just want someone to ask them to join.

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.233
So, when a water randomly bumps into one of them

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:20.817
and pulls them into the dance away from their group,

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:21.983
they go.

00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:23.362
And once they go into the dance,

00:03:23.362 --> 00:03:24.948
they don't come back out.

00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:27.352
And in fact, the addition of the salt ions

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.412
adds more possible dance positions

00:03:29.412 --> 00:03:30.790
in the square dance,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.973
so it is favored for them to stay dancing with water.

00:03:35.156 --> 00:03:37.119
Now, let's take oil.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:39.800
With oil, the molecules are sort of interested

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.887
in dancing with water,

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.138
so entropy favors them joining the dance.

00:03:43.138 --> 00:03:45.193
The problem is that oil molecules

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:47.471
are wearing gigantic ballgowns,

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.040
and they're way bigger than water molecules.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.474
So, when an oil molecule gets pulled in,

00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:55.299
their size is really disruptive to the dance

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.919
and the random exchange of partners

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.622
that the waters engage in,

00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:00.329
a very important part of the dance.

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.885
In addition, they are not great dancers.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:04.805
The water molecules try to engage

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:06.464
the oil molecules in the dance,

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:08.890
but they just keep bumping into their dresses

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.550
and taking up all the room on the dance floor.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.723
There are way more ways the waters can dance

00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:15.765
when the oil gets off the floor,

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:18.214
so the waters squeeze out the oil,

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:20.803
pushing it back to the bench with the others.

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.887
Pretty soon, when a large number of oils

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:24.971
have been squeezed over to the side,

00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.280
they band together to commiserate

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.455
about how unfair the waters are being

00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.408
and stick together as a group.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:32.746
So, it is this combination

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:35.082
of the interactions between molecules

00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:37.472
and the configurations available to them

00:04:37.472 --> 00:04:38.890
when they're moving randomly

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.216
that dictates whether they mix.

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:43.637
In other words, water and oil don't mix

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:47.217
because they just don't make great dance partners.
