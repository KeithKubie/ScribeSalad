00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.160
This is an Air Force Hush House.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.120
Yet, despite its name, it's anything but quiet.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.660
Noise is a big problem.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.540
Your ears can’t take it.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.220
You can feel it in your chest.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.120
Here in the Hush House, aerospace propulsion technicians like Michael Smith have the important job of testing jet engines.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.680
It's their responsibility to make sure these massive machines won't malfunction or explode mid-flight.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.120
We’re testing the F1-19. It’s for the F22 RAPTOR.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.660
The F22 RAPTOR is a beast of a jet.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.300
It's capable of flying twice the speed of sound, pulling close to 9GS of force,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.560
and flying vertically 60,000 feet in the air.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.560
The United States has always been strong in
military aircraft and this is one of the best.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.440
They have pushed the state of the art as far as
engines go. They have fantastic afterburners

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.720
and they have really high inlet turbine
temperatures which adds to their power greatly.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.180
The F1-10 engines are feats of mechanical engineering and it's crucial to know that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.860
they're working properly before they're loaded into a plane.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.020
If the Hush House didn’t exist, the only
way they would be able to test the engine

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.780
is in the jet and that’s very dangerous,
because that’s causing damage to aircraft

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.780
if something goes wrong.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
If something goes wrong here, it’s
contained. It's in a building.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.560
We can put it out with a fire suppression,
it doesn’t damage aircraft or other personnel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380
and it’s a lot safer.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.920
US Air Force Hush Houses are specifically designed to withstand these extreme forces.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.780
The Hush House is a concrete structure with thick walls and thick glass windows.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.180
They're constructed such that they are acoustically treated so that they contain the noise,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.880
and constructed strong enough to contain an engine that has blown up.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.880
There’s so much energy stored in all the parts that are moving

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.980
that if something goes wrong with it, people are
in the area and it suddenly blows up

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.920
that sends parts all over the place.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.660
Even if it doesn't blow up, technicians need to be really careful around the engines they're testing.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.000
You see the big flame coming out the back—that’s after burn.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.240
It’s when the fuel is lighting in the exhaust
to give it that nice blue color.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.380
A nice color, but a scorching temperature — about 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.130
Working in the Hush House means being around extreme conditions like this everyday.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.740
The process of testing jet engines may be dangerous now, but as time goes on, this process will likely change in many ways.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.560
One aspect in the future of jet engine testing will be new fuels coming in.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.000
Biodegradables and hydrogen and these are
completely different from the usual jet fuel

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080
and we’ll see what it takes to handle them.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.100
For now though, Michael Smith is happy with the work he's doing on these engines with these fuels.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.060
We're putting these engines in jets and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.980
being an airman to me is
 about keeping the safety of others.
