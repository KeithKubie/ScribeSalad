00:00:00.174 --> 00:00:03.091
(electronic music)

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.303
(cheering)

00:00:16.303 --> 00:00:17.347
- Street Meat!

00:00:17.347 --> 00:00:19.255
- Squat Sauce!

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:22.995
- Street Meat, time to
become a gentleman once more.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:25.207
- To what do I owe the honor?

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:27.910
- Well it's our annual time to be together

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.486
and watch the game of football.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.773
- Oh what a delight.

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:33.771
(cheering)

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:37.119
- Gettin back to basics,
dude, with a little football.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:40.558
Let's play some actual sports that require

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:42.303
actual athleticism.

00:00:42.303 --> 00:00:44.875
- Yeah, dude, basketball, (blowing)

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:45.765
Golf?

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:46.940
- Boring.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.270
- I got ESPN3, and I've
been watching like sports

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.319
from countries around the world.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.676
And they're just superior, you know?

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:56.443
- Yeah, what's your
favorite foreign sport?

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:58.830
- Oh far and away it's gazelle charging.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.041
- Gazelle charging?

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:03.178
- Yeah, no it's this East African sport

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:07.345
where a man places a whole
bloody lion's head on his chest,

00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.245
and whoever scares the gazelle the most,

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.550
you know, that's the winner.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.880
- I was in Indonesia a few years ago,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.173
they had pot fights.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:18.132
- Pot fights?

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:22.633
- Pot fights, as best I could
tell, it was like boxing,

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.592
with big pots.
(bell ringing)

00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:27.033
- That's not at all like boxing.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:27.979
- [Squat Sauce] Dude.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.022
- [Street Meat] So they
beat each other with like,

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.218
spaghetti pots?

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:32.491
- Yeah, a bunch.

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.321
- That sounds like fucking murder.

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.532
- [Squat Sauce] They go

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:37.692
"Pot!

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:38.957
"Pot!"

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:39.950
- [Street Meat] They speak English?

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.720
- They speak the word pot a lot.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.288
- Have you ever seen wounding before?

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:44.303
- Wounding?

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:45.271
- Yeah, wounding?

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.101
- I've seen people get wounded?

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.567
- Wounding is this great sport
with like sharpened sticks,

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:51.737
it's a Canadian sport.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:54.497
- See those motherfuckers smile a bunch,

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:55.571
then all of a sudden,
- Yeah.

00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:56.715
- they bring out the pointy sticks.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.966
- [Street Meat] They
would just take sticks

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.718
and fucking sharpen them.

00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:02.718
They'd smear mud in their eyes

00:02:02.718 --> 00:02:04.085
so their vision was blurred

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:06.152
and then you just stab and
as soon as you get blood

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:07.353
on your stick your team wins.

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:08.799
- You ever see people head wrestle?

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.350
- I don't think that's a thing.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.702
- With head wrestling, there's
so many different tactics

00:02:12.702 --> 00:02:13.962
that people use.

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:17.214
Like there's Hammerhead,
which you just supposed to hit

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:18.850
people until they fall over.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.127
Then there's the Mountain,

00:02:21.127 --> 00:02:23.645
and you just push and
push and push and push

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:26.974
until you eventually
like, erode your enemy.

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:29.364
- My thing is, any rare sport.

00:02:29.364 --> 00:02:31.266
Cause I think of soccer as a rare sport.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.160
- [Squat Sauce] Well there's
a whole other element to it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.567
that we don't get here in America.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:39.041
- Dude, fucking, American
sports can suck my ballsack.

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:40.245
- Yeah.

00:02:40.245 --> 00:02:41.106
- They can.

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:45.273
They have a cordial invitation
to taste the savory flavors

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.475
of my ballsack.

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.024
- Sha bam!

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:53.182
Gooooooooal!

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.398
- Stop!
- Gooooooooal!

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:05.049
- Stop!
- Gooooooooal!

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.132
- Stop it!
- Gooooooooal!

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.277
- Now I'm impressed.

00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.824
- Okay, thank you.
- It became impressive.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:12.905
- That's all I wanted.

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:14.474
- The point wasn't enough.

00:03:14.474 --> 00:03:15.931
(whistle blowing)

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.505
- Yeah, bro, what are you up to later?

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:19.992
- I'm going to a Chargers' game.

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:21.242
- Yeah!
- Sweet!

00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:25.608
