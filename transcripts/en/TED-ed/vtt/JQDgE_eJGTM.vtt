00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.397
Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour.

00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:04.429
I'm Logan Smalley,

00:00:04.453 --> 00:00:05.454
I'm Bedirhan Cinar,

00:00:05.478 --> 00:00:06.645
I'm Jordan Reeves,

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:07.803
and I'm Stephanie Lo.

00:00:07.827 --> 00:00:09.563
We represent the TED-Ed team.

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:12.436
We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.474
about the lessons
that surround each video,

00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:16.664
how you can customize or flip
your own lesson,

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:18.697
and how you can measure
the lesson's effect

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:20.013
on your class or the world.

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:21.440
Towards the end of the tour,

00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:23.189
we'll reveal one more major feature

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:25.785
that directly affects
every person viewing this video.

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:27.873
Let's get started with the home page.

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.314
On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos,

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.429
each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.204
that's visualized
by a professional animator.

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:42.295
You can nominate educators and animators

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.379
in the "Get Involved" section of the site.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.399
The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.622
Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.490
and based on their own curiosity.

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:55.906
And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.577
to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.805
Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.846
These lessons don't replace good teaching,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.737
but they can be supplementary resources

00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:08.766
for students and teachers
around the world.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.897
Let's look at this one,

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:12.690
created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK.

00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:15.287
When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play;

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:16.798
the video will continue to play

00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:19.454
as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:20.857
In the "Quick Quiz" section,

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.646
you'll find multiple-choice questions

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.938
that check for basic
comprehension of the video.

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:27.448
You get real-time feedback on your answers

00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:30.085
and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint.

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:33.688
You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section.

00:01:33.712 --> 00:01:35.461
And in the "Dig Deeper" section,

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:38.531
you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.155
You can complete the lessons anonymously,

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.377
but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.275
Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed,

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.083
and you'll find answers you've saved

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.540
to lessons that you've already
started or completed.

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:53.752
And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website:

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.074
flipping a lesson.

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:59.384
Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections.

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:02.210
You can edit the title
as it relates to your class.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.001
You can use the "Let's Begin" section

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.425
to provide instructions
or context for the lesson.

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:10.413
You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question.

00:02:10.437 --> 00:02:11.841
In the "Think" section,

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.061
you can add your own
open-answer questions.

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:15.657
And in the "Dig Deeper" section,

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.498
you can use the resources provided
or add your own.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:20.948
When you finish flipping a lesson,

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:23.138
it'll publish to a new and unique URL.

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:24.663
And because the link is unique,

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:27.553
it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with.

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:29.537
You can use it to measure participation

00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:32.250
and accuracy of any individual
student's answers.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.162
So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video,

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.787
We've got one more major feature
to tell you about.

00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:40.081
Using the TED-Ed platform,

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:42.317
you can flip any video from YouTube.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:47.467
That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk,

00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:51.583
but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube,

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:55.187
including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip.

00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:57.057
And through flipping these lessons,

00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:00.171
together we'll create
a free and remarkable library

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:02.230
of lessons worth sharing.
