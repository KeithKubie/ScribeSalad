disgust sensitive they can't stand their
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.540
disgust sensitive they can't stand their
own bodies and so for example then they

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
own bodies and so for example then they
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.130
own bodies and so for example then they
start being able to look at their bodies

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
start being able to look at their bodies
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.779
start being able to look at their bodies
properly and so what they do instead of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

the ability to do that they only can see
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720
the ability to do that they only can see
parts of their body and then they can't

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
parts of their body and then they can't
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670
parts of their body and then they can't
tell the difference between a part

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
tell the difference between a part
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590
tell the difference between a part
that's healthy and well shaped and a fat

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
that's healthy and well shaped and a fat
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540
that's healthy and well shaped and a fat
part and so anything that's that's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
part and so anything that's that's
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.970
part and so anything that's that's
that's what would you call AB dubious

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980
that's what would you call AB dubious
 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.590
that's what would you call AB dubious
anything that's hard to measure becomes

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
anything that's hard to measure becomes
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660

maybe about this big and thin yes
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950
maybe about this big and thin yes
obviously and so I was trying to work

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
obviously and so I was trying to work
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779
obviously and so I was trying to work
with her on her body perception disorder

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

tell they look the same to me and so I
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.340
tell they look the same to me and so I
said okay this is what we're going to do

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
said okay this is what we're going to do
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380

I let her do it I said you take a pencil

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
I let her do it I said you take a pencil
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630
I let her do it I said you take a pencil
and I'll sit on a piece of paper and you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
and I'll sit on a piece of paper and you
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240
and I'll sit on a piece of paper and you
just trace my thigh okay and then you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
just trace my thigh okay and then you
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.649
just trace my thigh okay and then you
can put that piece of paper underneath

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
can put that piece of paper underneath
 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450
can put that piece of paper underneath
your thigh and trace it and then you can

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
your thigh and trace it and then you can
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.249
your thigh and trace it and then you can
look at the difference well so I had her

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
look at the difference well so I had her
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.749
look at the difference well so I had her
do that and she looked at the two pieces

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
do that and she looked at the two pieces
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.300
do that and she looked at the two pieces
of paper and she couldn't believe it she

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
of paper and she couldn't believe it she
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940
of paper and she couldn't believe it she
could not believe that that was actually

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
could not believe that that was actually
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830
could not believe that that was actually
the case because her perception had

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
the case because her perception had
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870
the case because her perception had
become so disordered that it was

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
become so disordered that it was
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.210
become so disordered that it was
impossible for her to see the real shape

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
impossible for her to see the real shape
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160
impossible for her to see the real shape
of her body and we would go outside and

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170
of her body and we would go outside and
 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200
of her body and we would go outside and
I would ask her you know is that person

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
I would ask her you know is that person
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179
I would ask her you know is that person
thin is that person fat and with other

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
thin is that person fat and with other
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.830
thin is that person fat and with other
people she could tell but with her own

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
people she could tell but with her own
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.280
people she could tell but with her own
body

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
body
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109
body
not a chance she couldn't see it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
not a chance she couldn't see it
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480
not a chance she couldn't see it
properly at all and so there's a real

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
properly at all and so there's a real
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550
properly at all and so there's a real
obsession with purity among women who

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
obsession with purity among women who
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.289
obsession with purity among women who
have anorexia no they'd like to starve

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
have anorexia no they'd like to starve
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.060
have anorexia no they'd like to starve
themselves right down to the bone

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
themselves right down to the bone
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160
themselves right down to the bone
because the bone is sort of pure and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
because the bone is sort of pure and
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.410
because the bone is sort of pure and
white and there's no excess tissue on it

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
white and there's no excess tissue on it
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660
white and there's no excess tissue on it
and so anorexia also looks like a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
and so anorexia also looks like a
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.760
and so anorexia also looks like a
disease of disgust so it's very very

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
disease of disgust so it's very very
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.010
disease of disgust so it's very very
difficult to she thought in very

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
difficult to she thought in very
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.510
difficult to she thought in very
black-and-white terms one of the things

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
black-and-white terms one of the things
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.910
black-and-white terms one of the things
I had her do at one point was said she

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
I had her do at one point was said she
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.880
I had her do at one point was said she

20 of those songs and rate them on a
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000
20 of those songs and rate them on a
scale from one to ten and she couldn't

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.390
