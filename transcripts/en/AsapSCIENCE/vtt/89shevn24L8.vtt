00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.230
Whether it’s from an awful breakup or a
traumatic life event, some memories can haunt

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.809
us for our entire lives. But, what if there
was a way that you could completely forget

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.730
these all together? Can science erase your
bad memories?

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.199
Memory is an incredibly complex process; while
scientists used to believe it was like a filing

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.089
cabinet and particular memories were stored
in different sections of the brain, we now

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.849
know this is incorrect. In fact, each memory
is a brain wide process. If you end up remembering

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.939
this video, it’s because the cells in your
brain are being triggered and fired, building

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.270
new connections and links and literally rewiring
the circuitry of your mind. And this change

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.070
is partially facilitated by proteins in the
brain.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.300
So what if the proteins aren’t available?
Simply put, memories can’t be made. Seriously

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.940
- scientists have tested this by giving animals
drugs that prevent these proteins from forming.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.170
As a result the animals have no recollection
of the things that took place shortly after

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.580
the drug was taken.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.760
From this research, scientists actually found
a way to target long term memories for deletion.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.920
You see, every single time you remember a
memory, your brain is once again firing and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.860
rewiring. In fact, each time you reflect on
a memory, you are literally physically changing

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.250
that memory in your mind. And each time that
memory is altered a little, reflecting your

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.620
current thoughts. Remembering is an act of
creation and imagining, meaning the more you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.750
reflect on old memories, the less accurate
they become.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.360
And scientists have actually quantified this
change. After 9/11, hundreds of people were

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.670
asked about their memories of the dreadful
day. A year later, 37% of the details had

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.280
changed. By 2004, nearly 50% of the details
had changed or gone missing. And because memories

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.540
are formed and rebuilt every time, if you
administer the protein inhibiting drug while

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.420
recalling a memory, the memory can be effectively
removed.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.440
To test this, scientists took lab rats and
played a sound for them, shortly followed

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.950
by an electric shock. After doing this multiple
times, the rats quickly learned that if they

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.460
heard the sound, a shock was soon to follow.
As a result, they would stress up and freeze

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.159
every time they heard it. Months later, these
rats would still respond to the noise; however,

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.630
if they administered the drug first, the rats
would lose the memory of the sound, and simply

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.909
continue on. They had lost their memory of
that specific noise. To be sure the drug wasn’t

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.760
just causing large scale brain damage, scientists
repeated these experiments with multiple tones.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.590
Both sounds would warn for a shock, and eventually
the mice would fear both. But if they administered

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.909
the drug and played only one of the sounds,
the mice would only forget that tone, while

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.189
still remaining fearful of the other.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.349
Over time scientists have discovered specific
drugs to target particular proteins across

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.079
different parts of the brain. So, if you experience
a terrible emotion with a memory, then targeting

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.049
a protein in the emotional regions of the
brain can help to remove that connection alone.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.139
Which could be an amazing tool, especially
for patients suffering from something like

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.329
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But while
these drugs are in the very early stages,

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.239
the question remains; if you were given a
‘forgetting pill’ would you be willing

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.549
to take it?

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.480
