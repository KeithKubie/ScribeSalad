&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay? And similarly, we can do the same thing with Part,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.450
thinking of part of the tree being an attribute, of the tree.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.670
The tree class now has attributes for the left sub tree, the right sub tree, for

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.340
leaves and for parts. The Pile class, will have some kind of emptiness attribute

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.970
associated with it. And we initially, we can say that's maybe a Boolean and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.410
has a value of true or false depending upon whether it's empty.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.170
And we can add all these into the diagram and we'll, we'll see,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.680
now that we've added a second compartment. Below the top compartment which had

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.630
the label the class, the second compartment, has the list of these attributes.
