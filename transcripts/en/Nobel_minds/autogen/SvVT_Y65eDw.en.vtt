convinced me at a very early age that I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500
convinced me at a very early age that I
 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.430
convinced me at a very early age that I
wanted to be a theoretical physicist and

distinguish between what is good and
 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.700
distinguish between what is good and
what is bad and and to be guided in this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
what is bad and and to be guided in this
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.160
what is bad and and to be guided in this
unbelievable wealth of data and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
unbelievable wealth of data and
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.840
unbelievable wealth of data and
information but libraries are just as

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
information but libraries are just as
 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.960
information but libraries are just as
good and it's a great way to learn about

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
good and it's a great way to learn about
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.880
good and it's a great way to learn about
the world and what one knows about the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890
the world and what one knows about the
 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.500
the world and what one knows about the
world it certainly is what attracted me

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
world it certainly is what attracted me
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.440
world it certainly is what attracted me
to science
