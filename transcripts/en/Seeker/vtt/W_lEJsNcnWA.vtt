00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.990
About 95 percent of Americans support organ
donation, but less than half sign up to be

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.980
a donor… what’s up with that?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.990
Hello conscious collection of organs, Jules
here for DNews.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.320
No one knows exactly why people refuse to
be organ donors.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.910
Organ donation is a tricky subject, and super
individual.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.520
According to one study most people gathered
information on organ donation by watching

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.580
scientifically inaccurate shows like Grey’s
Anatomy.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.830
Another study backed up that data, showing
more than half of people learned what they

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.860
know about donation from television, and another
12 percent from their friends; unsurprisingly,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.010
72 percent of people were afraid organ donation.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.390
So, let’s burst this Anatomically Grey bubble
and talk about what actually happens during

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.390
organ donation.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.100
First, if a patient enters a hospital, literally
no one is thinking about whether or not they

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
are an organ donor.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.870
If it’s an emergency, they’re working
to save the person’s life, if not, to try

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.870
and make them healthy again.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.390
And yet, it’s a fact of life that they don’t
always succeed.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.899
If the person does die, only then do they
check if the person was a donor.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:04.899
Only.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:05.899
Then.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.539
Of course, backing up a step, death itself
can be complicated.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.789
Some people connect the presence of a heartbeat
to life, but since 1981, legally, it’s not

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.430
the heartbeat, but brain activity that determines
life or death.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.359
If the brain dies, it’s not coming back.

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.579
Patients who are brain dead, by the way, may
still have basic functions, sometimes assisted

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.340
or completely controlled by machines -- often
the cadaver will be on a ventilator at time

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.659
of death to keep the blood pumping, oxygen
moving, and organs alive.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.979
Sometimes, death is easy to spot: major injury,
blood loss, suffocation, hemorrhage, swelling,

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.759
stroke, and so on -- they all make the diagnosis
of brain death easier, but it’s never taken

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.759
lightly.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.090
Brain death isn’t an accidental or flippant
diagnosis like on tv -- there’s no fancy

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.009
machine with colorful charts monitoring your
brain activity -- instead: doctors (yes, there

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.560
are two) will conduct a “brain death test.”

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.779
According to the American Academy of Neurology
this means checking for reflexes controlled

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:59.779
by the brain stem.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:03.700
They’ll shine a light into the pupil, scratch
the back of the throat, poke to cause minor

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.419
pain, and put water in the ear canal trying
to get eye reactions.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:11.170
If there’s no response they’re disconnected
from the ventilator to see if they have a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.750
“respiratory drive,” or if they want to
breathe.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.049
If they react to none of these, doctors decide
their brain stem isn’t controlling their

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.469
body, and they’re considered brain dead.

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.280
The ventilator is turned back on, and the
family is informed.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.090
The doctors then check donor rolls, and discuss
final wishes with the family.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.709
If the person’s wish is for organ donation,
then they look for organ and tissue matches!

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.930
The heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas,
intestines, skin, bone tissue, corneas, tendons,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.439
ligaments, and blood vessels can all be transplanted
-- that may sound like a lot, but that still

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.120
leaves a lot behind.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.390
The doctors take as much care with deceased
donors as they do with living humans, taking

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.440
the donor to a sterilized operating room like
any other.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.709
An anesthesiologists monitors fluids and body
conditions while surgeons remove organs and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.680
tissues that can be used, inspect them for
any unknown disease or damage.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.060
They then cool them for transport to the donee.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.180
Once the organs are safely removed, the person
is closed like any surgery, the ventilator

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.180
is shut off.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.709
The body is cleaned, hair is washed, and the
body is returned to the family.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.280
Really quickly, there are a lot of myths out
there about this process.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.530
Donors can have an open casket funeral, no
problem, organ donation is performed just

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.450
like any surgery.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.430
Doctors will absolutely work as hard as possible
to save your life if you come in no matter

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.090
how many desirable looking organs you may
have.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.939
And finally, no matter how old you are, your
organs can be helpful.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.450
Organ donation is tough for people.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.109
A breathing, body with a heartbeat is difficult
for many family members to accept as a cadaver,

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.249
and even if you sign up to be a donor, and
die in a way suitable for donation, your family

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.220
can sometimes override that wish.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.999
That said, only 3 in 1000 people die in such
a way that allows for donation.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.069
They have to be generally healthy, without
viral infection, and must die in a hospital

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.069
setting!

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.379
Over 119,000 children, women and men are on
the waiting list for organ donation, and 22

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.950
die each day waiting for a replacement.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.420
Unsurprisingly, lots of people are working
to get more people to donate their organs.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.159
The American Journal of Transplantation published
a study recently detailing how Spain reached

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.069
40 donors per million people.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.209
That’s huge.

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.810
In Australia it’s 18 per million, in it’s
Israel 11, Ecuador 2.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.180
Thanks to efforts in the U.S. we’re pretty
high on the list at 26 per million.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.069
In the end, Spain might be in the lead, but
the winners are the people who are willing

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.349
to give up parts of themselves they no longer
need, and the stories of those who receive

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.130
the life-saving donations.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.759
So why do we even have to match organs in
the first place?

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.750
That’s what one group of researchers thought,
so they figured out how to donate from anyone

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.750
to anyone else.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.160
Amy’s got the story here.
