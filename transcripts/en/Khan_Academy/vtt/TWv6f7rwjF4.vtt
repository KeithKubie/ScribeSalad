00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.750
- If we think about something
like two to the third power,

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.210
we could view this as taking three twos

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.570
and multiplying them together,
so two times two times two,

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.090
or equivalently, we could
say this is the same thing

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.460
as taking a one and then
multiplying it by two three times,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.120
so actually, let's just
go with this definition

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.430
right over here, and this, of course,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.790
is going to be equal to eight.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.050
Now what would, based on
this definition I just did,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.720
what would two to the second power be?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.090
Well, this would be one times two twice,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.790
so one times two times two, which,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.330
of course, would be equal to four.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.820
What would two to the first power be?

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.300
Well, that would be one, and we would

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.920
multiply it by one two, one times two,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.230
which, of course, is equal to two.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.020
Now let's ask ourself
an interesting question.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.420
Based on this definition
of what an exponent is,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.530
what would two to the zeroth power be?

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.720
I encourage you to just think
about that a little bit.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.690
If you were the mathematics community,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.890
how would you define two to the zero power

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.390
so it is consistent with
everything that we just saw.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.930
Well, the way we just talked
about it, we just said

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.800
exponentiation is you start
with a one and you multiply it

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.990
by the base zero times, so
we're not gonna multiply it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.330
by any two, so we're just
gonna be left with a one.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.130
So does this make sense that two

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.390
to the zero power is equal to one?

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.220
Well, let's think about it another way,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.820
and let's do a different base.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.820
That was with two, but
let's say we have three

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.190
and I could say three to
the fourth power, that's

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.550
three times three times three times three

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.979
which is going to be equal to 81,

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.887
and let me just write down that

00:01:50.887 --> 00:01:55.030
this is going to be equal to 81.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.470
If I said three to the third power,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.790
that's three times three
times three which is 27.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.460
Three to the second
power is equal to nine.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.150
Three to the first
power is equal to three.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.360
Do you notice a pattern every time we

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.390
decrease the exponent here by one?

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.690
We want three to the fourth, and now we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.550
go three to the third.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.450
What happened to the value?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.114
Well, going from 81 to 27,
we divided by three, and

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:23.630
that makes sense,
because we're multiplying

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.090
by one less three, so we divide by three

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.900
to go from 81 to 27, we
divide by three again

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.522
if our exponent goes down by one,

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:36.300
and we divide by three again
when we go from nine to three,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.500
divide by three, so based
on this, what do you think

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.350
three to the zero power should be?

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.250
Well, the pattern is every time we

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.290
decrease our exponent by
one, we divide by the base,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.570
and so we should divide by three again

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.120
would be the logic if
we follow that pattern,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.120
and so three divided by
three would get us one again.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.736
So I know it might seem a little
bit counter intuitive that

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:05.760
something to the zeroth power
is going to be equal to one,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.650
but this is how the mathematics
community has defined it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.930
because it actually makes a lot of sense.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.720
Either if you view an
exponent as taking a one

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.170
and multiplying it by the base
the exponent number of times,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.850
so I'm gonna multiply
one by two three times,

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.420
or if you just follow
this pattern, every time

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.720
you decrease the exponent by one, you're

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.960
going to be dividing by the base.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.050
Either of those would get
you to the conclusion that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.860
two to the zero power is one,
or three to the zero power

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.090
is one, or frankly, any number
to the zero power is one.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.090
So if I have any number,
let's say I have some number a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.950
to the zero power, this is
going to be equal to one.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.930
Now I have an interesting
question for you,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.584
and let's just say this is the case

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:53.470
when a does not equal zero.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.850
I'll leave you a little bit of a

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.590
puzzle for you to think about.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.290
What do you think is
zero to the zeroth power?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.090
What should zero to the zero power be?

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.460
And what's interesting
about zero to the zero power

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.350
is you'll get a different
answer if you use this technique

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.890
versus if you use this
technique right over here.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.882
This technique would actually
get you to being one,

00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:21.580
while this technique would
have you divide by zero,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.160
which we don't know how to do.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.420
Anyway, I'll leave you there to ponder

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.370
the mysteries of zero to the zeroth power.
