&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Hello!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.460
I'm John Fenn at the American
Folklife Center, and I'm here

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.980
with musician, percussionist,
composer Jaimeo Brown.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.280
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.580
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: We're going
to talk a little bit

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.260
about the way you've been
incorporating field recordings

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.790
into the kind of work
you've been doing,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.180
stuff you've been
finding in our archives.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.480
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.780
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: But first,
I want to hear kind

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.080
of brief background
of yours in music.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.380
How did you get into
what you're doing?

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.680
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.680
I was blessed to come
from a musical family.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.590
Mother and father both musicians
and educators and did a lot

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.300
of work for the Endowment
for the Arts.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.580
My father, Dartanyan Brown,
my mother, Marcia Miget,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.430
did a lot of traveling in
the '80s with the Endowment

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.720
for the Arts, and I was carrying
equipment while they were

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.310
traveling to different
colleges teaching

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.610
about music and music education.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.330
And I kind of resisted
it as a result

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.310
of the parent factor
there until later on.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.830
And around 16 years old I --

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.770
-- discovered the drums, or
maybe the drums discovered me.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.070
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.710
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: And
I eventually was now

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.880
in the position to
have to catch up.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.590
So after really looking at
musicians like John Coltrane

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980
and some of these who
were my initial heroes,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.590
I started to practice eight
hours a day on the drums

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.330
and eventually moved out from
California to New York City.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.980
Went to William Paterson
University.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.860
It was headed by Rufus
Reid at the time,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.630
incredible bass player
and educator.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
In that period of time, that
was the real education of being

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.730
in the streets of New York
performing and just being

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.370
around that artistic
scene in New York.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.380
And being of the generation
where I was really, you know,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.490
trained to be a musician,
following these traditions

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.320
of jazz and music that was
a bit older, of course.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.460
My generation was also
a generation of hip hop

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.040
and electronic music
and sampled music.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.400
And so it was always a very
natural fit of being able

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.440
to merge music that was very
organic and acoustic with music

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.480
that was more digital.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.110
And so a lot of the music that
I heard, the hip hop artists

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.830
like J Dilla and some of these
producers really just became

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.160
extensions of being able to
create what I was hearing.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.270
And so I eventually discovered
an incredible group called the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.730
Gee's Bend Group.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.940
And they are a group,
or a community really,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.910
so more in Gee's Bend, Alabama.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.010
And this led me on a long path
of really getting into finding,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.090
discovering some of
the oldest sources

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.630
of African American music in the
country and eventually went back

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140
to Rutgers University
to get my masters.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.340
My thesis was on
how the earliest,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.530
some of the early
music of the church,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.140
the Black church
influenced jazz, rock,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.350
contemporary music, so to speak.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.370
And as that journey began,
I wanted to hear more

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.450
of what the earliest music
sounded like, not just the,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.120
not just conceptually
from reading,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.460
but actually hearing it.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.540
And so that led me to, of
course, the Library of Congress,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.100
which of course, led me
to works with Alan Lomax

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.700
and so many other historians
who gave me the opportunity

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.320
to actually really be able
to hear the sound quality,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.280
which is going to change
through generations.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.110
There's certain sounds in --

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.760
-- in the voicing, the
characteristics of the voice

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.060
that you just don't
hear anymore.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.560
So that led me to
the processing.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.690
I really need to, I really
need to capture this sound.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.290
So I started to figure
out how could I take some

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.670
of these samples
and include them

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.080
into composition
and into production.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.500
And so this archive here
has been a huge source

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.320
of inspiration and a huge source
of information and history

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.360
that has informed
what Transcendence is,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.350
which is my group that really
focuses on bringing art,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.270
history, and technology
together.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.380
And so this archive
being here and being able

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.760
to perform here tonight,
it's just a,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.230
it's a big circle completing
and it's just a great, great,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.670
great honor to be here.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.590
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Well, it's
interesting hearing you talk

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.530
about this sort of, the
elements of the sound

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.020
because there's a certain
texture in field records.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.320
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Mm, yes.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.620
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And
we'll get to the ones

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.920
that you sort of hit on.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.220
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.520
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: But I was just
wondering to what extent,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.860
as you're going through
this trove

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.360
of historical recordings and --

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.660
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.960
&gt;&gt; -- in our archives
or elsewhere too.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.260
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.560
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: What's catching
your ear as a composer,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.860
as a percussionist,
as someone that grew

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.160
up with hip hop and jazz?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.460
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Hmm, yes.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.760
Yes.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.060
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: You
know, what's --

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.360
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.660
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: There's some
of that spirituality in some

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.960
of that stuff, but it's like --

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.260
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown:
They're, the, you know,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.560
we live in a digital age now,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.030
and everything is
becoming more micro.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.170
But when you, when I'm going,
you know, when I was going

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.080
through reel to reel --

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.040
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.460
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: -- and hearing
not just the sound of the voices

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.210
but the sound of the actual
first recording instruments

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.510
that were used.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.810
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.610
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: It's going
to give a certain character

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.250
to the music that I
think is very important,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.250
especially when I'm thinking

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.860
about balancing those
two worlds together.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.040
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.520
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: And so those
voices and the sound of the,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.520
the times coming through,
through the accents and,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.200
and you know, just to be able to
actually hear time in this age.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.850
We're only 100 years now where
we're actually able to record --

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.540
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.840
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown:
-- these things.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.250
I think these things
just come out so loudly

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.230
and just give me
ideas for balancing.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.630
You know, a lot, oftentimes
I'm trying to balance that idea

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.310
of future and what is
ancient and what is future.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.490
And some of those sounds
really, really capture that,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.970
that almost ancient
sound in a sense,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.070
being the oldest recordings
that we actually have.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.230
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And
that element of time

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.120
and history is interesting,
too, when you think of when,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.290
something you just said, like
what, Lomax was recording

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.590
on instaneous disks, right?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.890
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.190
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So those recorded

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.490
in the moment, not
easy to copy --

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.790
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yup, yup.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.090
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: -- when
we copy them to tape --

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.390
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah, yup.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.690
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: -- you
know, which is what,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.990
how you might acces them then --

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.290
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yup, yup.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.590
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: -- if
they've not been digitized.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.890
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.190
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: So
there's kind of a theme

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.490
of time and texture that's --

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.790
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Definitely.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.090
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: -- working in
what you're doing with this.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.390
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: One
hundred percent, 100%.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.690
I think that's, that's
I think, largely what,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.880
in this also generation I
think helps balance the speed

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.270
of technology and how
fast that it's moving.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.750
And because of that exponential
growth of technology,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.190
I think that there is part
of me that was really drawn

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.970
to that actual quality,
you know.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.200
There's just real work put into
some of the early recordings

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.560
and how they were actually
recorded in the first place

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.040
and physically how it was done.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.530
And all of that definitely
comes through in the music.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.040
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And you know,
yeah, I mean just thinking

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.260
about some of the
songs that you're,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.590
some of the field
recordings you're dealing

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.970
with that you're turning
into compositions,

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.730
a few of them are work wongs.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.030
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah, yes.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.330
Yes.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.630
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: And so can
you speak a little bit

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.930
about what you are hearing when
you're hearing these work songs?

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.230
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Sure.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.530
Yeah.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.330
Some of these, some of
these work songs were sung.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.270
The Parchman Farm is
a prison in Alabama,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.930
so you're hearing actual
inmates singing work songs

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.890
that they would sing doing
extremely hard manual labor.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.660
And so automatically
you're going

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.710
to get extremely vivid strong
images from this type of,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.530
from the sound of people who
weren't necessarily musicians.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.830
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.610
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: You know,
these are regular people

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.640
who used the music as, almost
as a form of transcendance

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.280
and transcending the
difficulty of life.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.450
And so when you're able to
hear music used in that form,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.190
to me it's extremely refreshing
because a lot of the music

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.740
that we hear nowadays and the
way that our culture functions,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.620
music is often used more
functionally as something just

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.460
for strictly performance.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.890
And so within listening
to these old recordings

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.760
that these prison inmates
singing while they're chopping

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.040
wood or while they're --

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.620
-- or railroad, or
hitting railroads

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.040
or picking cotton or --

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.250
-- or farming for 12 hours a day

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.890
and hearing how music was used
is very, very powerful for me.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.610
And it definitely even
has inspired a lot

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.870
of ideas and compositions.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.870
And also within this idea, too,
we're also exploring, for me,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.880
the African American experience
and how slavery evolved as well,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.530
you know, because the prison
system at one time took

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.940
over for slavery and at a
point there's so much --

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.860
-- so much upheaval
during that time.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.220
And to be able to hear the
sounds of that time is going

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.150
to have very, once
again, loud images just

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.450
by hearing some of these voices.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.550
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: What's
the research process

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.850
that you went through?

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.580
Just again, just thinking
about these three recordings,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.880
or you know, these
three field recordings,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.180
how did you find them?

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.480
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.780
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: How many
did you have to listen to?

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.080
Were you looking
for certain stuff?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.380
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yes.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.680
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Or did you kind of
go in with attention to texture?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.440
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah,
great, great question.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.180
Initially it was let me figure
out how to find anything.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.480
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.780
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: You know, just
because a lot of the material

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.530
of these early work songs
or these early spirituals,

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.300
they're very difficult to find.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.630
I mean I happened to stumble
on a couple things online

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.710
that were more popular, and
then kind of through going

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.580
through the back ends and
figuring out licensing,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.810
publishing, and I
eventually started,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.470
happened to see a phone
number here or email here.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.930
And them I'm calling
an email here and all

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.910
of a sudden it's eventually
leading me back to where,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.920
ultimately where
the source of it is,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.260
which is who owns the
actual material, which --

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.860
-- of course, Library
of Congress here,

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.470
just a lot of those
strains led me, led me here.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.770
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.070
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: And a lot

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.660
of times I'm listening
for maybe a theme --

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.960
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Ok.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.850
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: -- when
I'm composing or producing.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.210
Maybe there's a theme
that I'm listening

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.750
to or maybe there is --

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.870
-- maybe there is a sound
that's connected to --

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.200
-- a certain concept that
has to do with the blues.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.240
Within jazz, the blues
is just a huge root.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.710
And so being able to figure out
where the blues actually came

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.920
from and to hear
how the blues --

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.070
-- how it came, came
about, you know.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.130
You can't really get
that so much from a book.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.080
You have to, there's
so much of a lineage

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.780
that comes just through,
through just sonically.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.080
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Mm-hmm.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.090
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: And so I
was absorbing everything.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.890
And a lot of times, a lot of my
decisions weren't necessarily --

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:43.940
-- oftentimes conceptually
or intellectually based.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.290
They are more feeling
something and being moved

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.060
and then really using
that emotion

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.730
to create the forward momentum
of the composition or the idea.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:01.130
And so, you know, I'm just also
really glad to be able to be

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.330
in a position to help bring more
of that out into the forefront

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.090
because it was very
difficult, once again,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.070
for me to discover
a lot of this.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.970
And so if I can help
show where --

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.580
-- where it comes from
or where it's located

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.440
and to show the power and
strength of it, you know,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.540
that's another goal of what
I'm doing, Transcendance.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.840
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Great.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.140
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.440
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: Well, thank
you, and I hope to see you

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.740
in the reading room again soon.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.040
&gt;&gt; Jaimeo Brown: Yeah!

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.340
Thank you so much!

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.140
&gt;&gt; John Fenn: All right.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:39.140
