00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
It's been proven that
most users dislike

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.440
creating and remembering
passwords to interact

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.090
with your site or app.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.620
Indeed, surveys have shown
that more than half of them

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.050
will walk away if you ask them
to do yet another sign up.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.202
Well, why is this?

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:17.410
One reason might be that
the more times they give out

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.680
personal details, the greater
the risk of them being phished.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.400
Now, the Canadian
government recently

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640
released statistics
on phishing, showing

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.550
that 156 million phishing emails
are sent every single day.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.980
And of those, 16 million will
get through spam filters.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.480
Of those, 8 million are opened.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.310
And believe it or
not, 800,000 of them

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.860
will have their links
actually clicked on.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.740
And of those, 80,000
people will give up

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.400
personal information-- per day.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.470
Now, all of this is
motivation for us

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.810
to provide you with the best
possible technology that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.310
lets your users use
an existing account

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.330
to be able to sign
into your app,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
and to make the API
as easy as possible.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm Laurence Moroney,
and I'm going

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.310
to show you how you can sign
in with Google to your Android

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.280
app.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.720
If you're familiar with
Google Play services,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020
you'll know all about
the Google API clients.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.910
And until Google
Play services 8.3,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.850
signing in with Google meant
connecting to this client

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.540
and handling a
bunch of exceptions

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.280
for things such as account
pickers or app permissions.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.780
Well, it's much easier now.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.300
And with the addition of the new
Google Sign In Options object,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.680
with this, you can specify the
scopes that you want to access.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.140
And in a vast majority of cases,
it's just as simple as this--

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.620
requesting the email scope.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.750
Once you have this
object, you then

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.780
pass it to the Google API
client in the addAPI call.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.160
And then you create an
intent, using it like this.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.660
And when it gets
a result, you just

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.280
simply start an activity for it.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.550
This activity will get a Google
Sign In Result object back.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.280
And from it, you can
extract user details,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.410
such as their email
address or their Google ID.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.957
When they run your
code, they'll see this.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:04.540
When they sign in
with Google, they'll

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.150
be asked for the account
that they want to sign with,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.180
and then they'll be
simply signed in.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.100
It's frictionless.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.919
It's easy.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.900
It's secure.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.160
Most of all, like I said, it's
really easy for you to build.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.340
It's also extensible, and
you can use this technology

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.490
to validate your users
on your back end servers.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.510
That'll be the subject
of my next video.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.070
But until then, check out
the Google Developer site

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.590
for more details on
building applications

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.740
that sign in with Google.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.900
