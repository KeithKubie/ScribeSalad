FINALLY A USE OF MY WRIST I CAN
GET BEHIND!

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL, A SECOND USE OF MY WRIST I
CAN GET BEHIND.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.144 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I'M TOTALLY GETTING ONE.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:11.744 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:12.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M A BLERD.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.814 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT MEANS BLACK NERD, FOR THOSE
OF YOU PLAYING AT HOME.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:22.121 line:91%
AND REMEMBER, "OTHER IN OTHER

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:27.060 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONLY WE CAN CALL EACH OTHER

PRODUCT,
I GET A TINGLY FEELING.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.635 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT NOT THE GOOD KIND IN MY
BATHING SUIT AREA.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.136 line:91%
IT'S LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING I'M
SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER ABOUT APPLE

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:38.037 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S NOT SO PLEASANT.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.076 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; Larry: THIS IS WHY APPLE
FRUSTRATES ME SO MUCH. THEY 

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:00.894 line:91%
FORCE YOU TO GO THROUGH AN
INTERNAL ETHICAL ISSUE BEFORE

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start position:0% line:85%

I MEAN, I LIKE PEOPLE, BUT THESE
PEOPLE ARE SO FAR AWAY

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:13.973 align:start position:0% line:85%
THEY'RE IN CHINA!

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start position:0% line:91%

VERY SECOND!

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.887 align:start position:0% line:85%

YOU KNOW WHAT, APPLE'S JUST A
COMPANY.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.533 line:85%
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET BY.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.968 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M SURE THEY'D FIX A LOT OF
THESE WORKING CONDITIONS IF THEY

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.769 align:start position:0% line:85%
COULD ONLY AFFORD IT.

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:45.438 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS FALL, FROM OCTOBER
THROUGH DECEMBER, APPLE MADE

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:49.575 line:91%
MORE MONEY IN ONE QUARTER THAN
ANY COMPANY HAS EVER MADE IN THE

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.811 align:start position:0% line:85%
HISTORY OF THE EARTH.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.146 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE UP
CANDY CRUSH!

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.886 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALRIGHT?

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.587 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO HELP US SORT THIS
ETHICAL-TECHNOLOGICAL DILEMMA,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE TURN TO "THE NIGHTLY SHOW"
CONTRIBUTOR MIKE YARD.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
MIKE, THANKS FOR BEING ON THE
SHOW.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.097 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THANKS, LAWRENCE.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.398 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO HOW CAN I STILL
ENJOY CANDY CRUSH AND BE

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:12.965 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESPONSIBLE?

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.500 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:19.071 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU GOTTA DO WHAT I DID AND GO
FULL AMISH.

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:25.678 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: COMPLETELY IGNORE

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:26.679 size:81% position:41% line:85%
ALL MODERN DAY TECHNOLOGY?

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.381 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:31.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANY PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY CORRUPTS
YOU.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.352 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPUTERS HAVE CIRCUIT BOARDS
MADE WITH MINERALS.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:41.260 align:start position:0% line:91%
MOST OF THOSE MINERALS COME FROM
SLAVE LABOR IN THE CONGO.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:42.261 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO NO TECHNOLOGY.

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:45.364 line:85%
AND THAT'S HOW WE AMISH DO, BABY

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:47.667 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT SEEMS PRETTY
EXTREME.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.438 line:85%
LIKE NO ONE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:55.875 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEN ENJOY THE BLOOD ON YOUR
HANDS, MY BROTHER

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.176 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MIKE, WE'VE NEVER
FACED ANYTHING LIKE THIS

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.611 line:91%
BEFORE -- I'M SURE ONCE WE PUT
OUR HEADS TOGETHER, WE'LL FIND A

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.012 line:91%
SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
CHANGING YOUR ENTIRE LIFESTYLE

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:03.349 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND RELIGION.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.252 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY IS JUST
MODERN-DAY COTTON.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.853 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE SAME WAY WE'RE IGNORING
HOW THIS STUFF GETS MADE IS THE

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
SAME WAY A NORTHERNER IN THE
1850s WAS FEELING ABOUT A

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:25.304 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:28.941 line:85%

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.324 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I THINK I UNDERSTAND
YOUR POINT.

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:46.759 line:91%
IF THAT'S TRUE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY,
IT MUST BE TRUE ABOUT A LOT OF

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:47.293 align:start position:0% line:85%
OTHER STUFF WE HAVE.

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:48.394 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GO HARD OR GO HOME.

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:49.161 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHY I'M AMISH.

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:54.166 align:start position:0% line:85%
ISH.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.534 align:start position:0% line:85%

CAMERAS WOULD BE STEALING MY

SOUL RIGHT NOW.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.378 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, OKAY.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:06.812 line:91%
&gt;&gt; PLUS, I DON'T BUY INTO THAT
NO-SEX-BEFORE-MARRIAGE (BLEEP).

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.114 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU EVER HAD SEX WITH AN AMISH
GIRL?

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.749 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN --
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH,

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:11.083 align:start position:0% line:85%
MIKE.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:13.019 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
