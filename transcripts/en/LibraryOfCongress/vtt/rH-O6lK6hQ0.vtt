We are going to start
from the start.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.940
Do you know, what is the very
first thing that you need

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.480
in order to write a book?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.830
And it's not pencil,
paper, word processor.

No things that you can touch.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.810
It is something that
comes from here.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.110
What is it?

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.530
And I want a hand, just a hand.

behind this book.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.210
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.510
I wanted to create a book
with a Spanish alphabet.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:15.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.990
I didn't know how to go about it.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.610
So one day, I opened the newspaper,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.510
[foreign language spoken] the
Washington Post by the by the way.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.940
I Found an article.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:41.790
And this article talked about this
amazing animal called olinguito.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.490
Can you repeat that with me?

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.080
&gt;&gt; Olinguito.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.970

&gt;&gt; Lulu Delacre: Fabolos, oliguito.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:00.780
So I read about this animal
and I said, oh, oliguito?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.080
I have my oh [foreign
language spoken].

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.810
But then I needed to find
all the other letters

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.880
from the Spanish alphabet.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.730
[Foreign language spoken] I
needed to find all the animals

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:23.630
or amazing animals and plants
that coexist with the olinguito.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.400
In The Cloud Forest of Ecuador.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.200
That took me a long time, and
before I tell you a little it,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.070
and I read you the book, I want
to tell you a little bit about,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.640
the olinguito and about
The Cloud Forest.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.080
The olinguito is a
small, soft animal.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.630
They say that it has the face of a
teddy bear and the tale of a cat.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.460
It is very, very small.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.170
Actually this is the
exact size, very small.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.380
And it lives in the
cloud forest of Ecuador.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.490
It is nocturnal animal.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.640
Does anybody here know
what nocturnal means?

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.940
What could that mean?

No. [Foreign language spoken]?

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.190

&gt;&gt; Lulu Delacre: A nocturnal animal.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.540
Does it -- does it -- does it
come around during the day?

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.840
&gt;&gt; No.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.140
&gt;&gt; Lulu Delacre: No.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.440
At nighttime?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.740
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.040
&gt;&gt; Lulu Delacre: Yes.

Nocturnal, it comes around at night.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:58.400
But not only is the
olinguito a nocturnal animal,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.620
he lives in the canopy
of the cloud forest.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.610
That means he doesn't come
down from the treetops.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:14.290
And -- and why is it that it took
so long to find this little animal?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.390
Well, it took very,
very long because I have

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.100
to tell you now a little
bit about the cloud forest.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.990
Why do you suppose the cloud
forest is called the cloud forest?

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.510
Why do you suppose --

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.520

It's filled with clouds, clouds and
fog and mist covered the forest.

easy to see an animal this size

when it's all very, very, very dark?

There's no lights at
night in this forest.

see an animal that comes only

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.830
at night in a very dark forest?

You have the right answer,
[Foreign language spoken].

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.510

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.040
I am going to tell you how
is it that that happened.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.230
A group of scientists,
not too far from here --

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.020
actually a group of scientists,
[foreign language spoken]

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:49.170
that worked in the
Smithsonian Institution,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:58.410
they worked for ten years finding
and determining the different --

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.600
different characteristics
of a certain animal

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.290
like the olinguito called
the olingo that comes

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.210
from the same family,
family of the raccoons.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.910
And -- and one day this
scientist find out --

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:24.250
These zoologist found out that
there were some skulls, you know,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.630
the skulls, the bones that
were a little different.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.010
Some skulls that were labeled
olingo's that were different

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.570
and some bones, some
pells, you know the fur,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.850
that was a little different too.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:46.590
And this zoologist began to suspect
that -- that it was mislabeled,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:51.880
that this specimen that he had
been studying in the Museum

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.780
of Natural History
had been mislabeled.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.470
And conducted some very
special testing, DNA testing.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.830
And you know what he found?

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.010
Do you want to know?

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.820
That this was not an olingo.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.220
It was a different animal.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.510
So this scientist gathered a group
of other scientists, friends of his

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:26.510
and they went all the way down
south to the country of Ecuador.

was alive and well in the forest.

and I am going to read you --

develop -- shown in the --

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.150
I went to the forest.

the Andes of Ecuador.

Where the olinguito lives.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.540
And I went there because I
wanted to see with my own eyes,

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:07.550
not only the olinguito, but I
wanted to see the amazing plants

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:12.450
and the amazing animals that
coexist with the olinguito.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.180
I didn't tell you something
very important,

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.440
and that is that in a cloud forest,
not only the cloud forest is known

for -- That's me in
the cloud forest --

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:31.410
for the clouds and mist that cover
every single part of the forest.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.950
We have a lot of plants
and these plants --

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.050 position:56%
Many of these plants are air plants.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.200 position:56%
So you have the clouds and the mist.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.780
You have the fog covering
all over the forest.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:50.250
You also have many
plants that are air plants

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.240
like the bromeliads
that you saw there.

These plants -- this is one of the
characteristics of the cloud forest.

The cloud forest is known to have
a lot of mist, a lot of humidity

that -- that actually nutrients,

it is an olinguito.

Do you know that I stayed four
hours of the night waiting

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:04.440
for the olinguito to arrive,
because I really wanted to see one,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.930
and I was staying in this
lodge in the cloud forest,

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.040
and the manager had promised me
that I would see an olinguito.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.150
And I was staying there
just three nights.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.910

nights to see it.

I said if I don't see it, I am going
to be very, very, very, very sad.

with my camera,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.690

in the beginning.

I wanted to snap a
picture of the olinguito.

nervous that my hands were shaking.

That's why it's kind of fuzzy.

But I'll tell you why is it that the
olinguito is eating those bananas.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:57.390
See, the bananas don't grow at the
altitude where the olinguito lives

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.710
in the cloud forest of Ecuador.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.580
Bananas grow at a lower altitude.

They grow in the jungle,
in the rain forest.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:13.020
So, the manager of his loft, he --
he bunches of bananas to the trees.

Remember I told you the
olinguito doesn't come

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.220

and this is such a special treat
for the olinguito that sure enough

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.290
when it smells the bananas, it
approaches, and there it is.

and real leaves is
actually pick those

is the perfect time to go out
