00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.596
- [Narrator] Spring
has arrived here early.

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:08.596
(serene music)
(wind rustling)

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.160
And that's bad news for the barnacle geese

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.373
that breed in these mountains.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.440
Many nests have failed

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.316
but not this one.

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:29.466
(contemplative music)

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.270
(goslings chirping)

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.873
Three chicks, they're
lucky to have made it.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.120
Forced by the early spring,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.763
the parents rushed their migration.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.943
They arrived exhausted.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.708
The female sat on the eggs for 25 days.

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:56.875
(goslings chirping and squeaking)

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.543
She's lost 30 percent of her body weight.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.850
But for this family the greatest
challenge is still to come.

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.842
(reverberating crashing)

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.180
(goose honking)

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.549
The parents chose to nest
on this 400 foot pinnacle.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.970
(dramatic music)

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.745
It's the only way to avoid predators.

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:29.328
(bird calling)

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.463
Just one problem.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.193
The grass they eat is a
mile away, by the river.

00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:43.040
(honking)

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.253
And barnacle geese can't
feed their young in the nest.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.133
If the chicks don't feed within
36 hours, they'll starve.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.790
(chirping and chittering)

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.373
And these chicks won't be
able to fly for another month.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.210
The parents are living proof.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.077
There is a solution.

00:02:08.077 --> 00:02:09.770
(honking)

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.477
Just not an easy one.

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:16.140
(ominous music)

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.918
Dad leads the way.

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:29.085
(honking)

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.377
But the chicks are
instinctively bonded to mom.

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:47.061
Where she goes, they follow.

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:49.228
(honking)

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.846
(tense music)

00:03:33.202 --> 00:03:35.952
(dramatic music)

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.480
Incredibly it survived.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.040
But it's stunned and
now dangerously exposed.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.220
(raven calling)
(suspenseful music)

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.076
(goose honking)

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.872
(hissing and cawing)

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.937
(goose honking)

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.881
(somber music)

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:44.550
One chick gone.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.359
Now hope rests with the other two.

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:48.377
(chirping)

00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:50.960
(tense music)

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.083
The back of the spire is a shorter drop.

00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.150
(dramatic music)

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.040
But it's much harder to avoid the rocks.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.940
For this chick there will be no escape.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.973
The third and last surviving chick.

00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:56.809
(chirping)
(honking)

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.228
(dramatic music)

00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:04.061
(chirping)

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:05.914
(suspenseful music)

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:09.164
(chirping and honking)

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.278
The snow cushions the
impact but offers no grip.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:48.278
(goose honking)
(gosling chirping)

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:19.971
(hopeful music)

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.160
Only around 50 percent of
chicks hatched on these cliffs

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.453
make it through the first month.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.223
With the seasons
increasingly unpredictable,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.279
fewer chicks will survive.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.862
(gentle music)

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.593
But this chick at least
has defied the odds.

00:07:57.186 --> 00:07:59.353
(honking)
