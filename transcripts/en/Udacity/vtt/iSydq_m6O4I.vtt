00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.392
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that we have a graph that fits the three points we knew were part of the

00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:09.139
ball's path, the next question is what kind of equation fits with this graph?

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.612
Here are a few options for you. Which of these equations do you think might

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:18.312
work? Just a hint. Pick a few points on this parabola, and then check and see if

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:21.313
all three of them satisfy any of these equations.
