00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.450
I always rush those videos at
the end because right when I

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.180
was talking I saw that I was
getting kind of down on the

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.920
YouTube 10 minute limit, but I
just want to make sure that

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.760
you understand what I did.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.720
I used the first few examples--
and essentially

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.100
what they told us-- to figure
out an equation that tells me

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.510
well, if I know the term
t, how do I get

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.810
the t'th term, right?

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.230
Actually, it works here too.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.520
We could write 8 plus
9 t minus 1.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.940
Because here, this is the first
term, so this t minus 1

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.760
term goes to 0, and that's
why we only have 8.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.300
And it works on all of these,
and it makes sense.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.290
Every term is going to be 9 more
than the previous one.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.970
We start at 8, and the reason
why it's t minus 1 instead of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.640
t is because we only start
adding 9 after the first term.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.960
For example, if this was
actually 9, 18, 27, if we just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660
went like that, we could've
just said

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.080
it's 9 times t, right?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.550
That could have been
the formula.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.760
Or we could've said 9 plus
9 times t minus 1.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.840
These would have been
the same thing.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.400
But it started at 8, so that's
why we had to make it a little

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.900
bit more cloogy.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.540
Hopefully that explains it
a little bit better.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.790
Let's do the next problem.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.140
Problem six I will
do in yellow.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.540
They draw a bunch of lines,
so they draw three lines.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.425
One line, two lines, then
we have a third line.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:05.300
OK, so this is s degrees, r
degrees, t degrees, z degrees,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.395
y and x degrees.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.410
Three lines intersect
in a point as shown

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.560
in the figure above.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.620
Which of the following pairs
of angle measures is not

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.620
sufficient for determining
all six angle measures?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.060
Is not, so they're going
to make us go

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.770
through all of them.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.010
Hopefully one of the
early choices.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.070
So choice a, t and z.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.470
So I'm going to do choice
a in this brown color.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.150
So choice a, t and z.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.720
Well first of all, if I know
t, I immediately know z

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.860
because they're opposite
angles, right?

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.590
So I could figure out that.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.490
I could figure out that.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.530
Well if I know either of those,
I could then figure

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.620
out-- let's see, in order to do
anything from here, I need

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.870
to know one of the
other angles.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.110
And this is actually the way you
should think about it. t

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.540
and z only gives us the
relationship between these two

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.790
purple lines, right?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.640
It essentially tells us at what
angle these two purple

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.270
lines intersect.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.450
But it gives us no information
about the angle that this

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.190
yellow line intersects, right?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.390
Think about it, if I welded
these purple lines together, I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.340
could still move this yellow
line around without

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.960
changing t or z.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.800
So there's no way just knowing
t or z I can figure out what

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.000
angle this yellow line is at.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920
And if you did the other
choices, you could try it out.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.340
For example, if I didn't know t
and instead they told me r,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.480
then I would be in business.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.270
If I knew r, for example, then
I could use the fact that s,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.520
r, and z all form one line.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.070
And I could figure out s.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.150
If I knew z, then I
could figure out t

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.050
because they're opposite.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.555
If I know r, I could
figure out s

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:08.610
because they're opposite.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.050
And then if I knew s, I could
figure out y, right?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.150
So z and t alone will not help
you, so our choice is a.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.440
And normally on the SAT when
they give you something where

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.750
you have to kind of try out
every choice they give you,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.150
it's normally going to be one
of the first choices because

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.580
they try to make the questions
as fast as possible.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.090
They don't want you to
waste too much time.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.930
If you ever see yourself wasting
too much time on a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.320
question, you're not necessarily
doing it wrong,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.760
but you may not be doing it
the quickest possible way.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.840
Problem number seven.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.670
The sum of two numbers that
differ by one is t.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.430
So let's call those two
numbers x and y.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.600
We know that the sum of x
plus y is equal to t.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.030
But we also know that the
numbers differ by 1.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.850
And then they say in terms of
t, what is the value of the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.330
greater of the two numbers.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.160
So let's just assume that
x is greater than y.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.330
Let's just write x is
greater than y.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.560
So that means that x minus y is
going to be equal to what?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.610
Well they told us that the
sum of two numbers

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.680
that differ by 1.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.640
So x is actually exactly
1 more than y.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.960
So that when I subtract
y from x I get 1.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.060
So if I want to know the value
of the greater of the two

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.600
numbers-- I defined x, actually,
as the greater of

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.100
the two numbers-- I just have
to solve the system of

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.561
equations for x.

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:47.540
So let's add the
two equations.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.400
x plus x is 2x.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.150
What's y plus negative y?

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.990
Well, they cancel out, right?

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.250
0.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.460
Then what's t plus 1?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.310
Well it's t plus 1.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.930
And now to solve for x, you
get x is equal to-- divide

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.450
both sides by 2 or multiply
by 1/2-- t plus 1 over 2.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.200
And we are done.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.780
And that is choice c.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.030
Next problem.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.800
Problem number eight.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.075
This color is getting
obnoxious.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.660
OK, number of siblings per
student in a preschool class.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.960
So let me draw this chart.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:39.830
So this is number of siblings,
number of students.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.030
The table above shows how many
students in a class of 12

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.630
preschoolers had 0, 1,
2, or 3 siblings.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.880
OK, right, I haven't actually
included the information.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.410
0, 1, 2, 3.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.630
So 3 kids had 0 siblings, 6 kids
had 1 sibling, 2 kids had

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.990
2 siblings, and then 1
kid had 3 siblings.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.280
Later, a new student joined
the class, and the average

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.150
number of siblings per student
became equal to the median

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.110
number of siblings
per student.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.220
How many siblings did the
new student have?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.510
Fascinating.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.320
OK, so let's say the new
student has x siblings.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.310
x siblings is how many
the new student has.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.180
So we don't know where the new
student falls in, but let's

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:49.140
figure out where the average and
the median are before the

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.100
student even joins.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.600
So the median number
of siblings.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.680
The average number of siblings
per student became equal to

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.940
the median number of siblings
per student.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.070
So what is the average number
of siblings per student?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.950
We just add the number of
siblings for all of the

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.620
students, so we should get 12
terms. So we can multiply 3

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:23.070
times 0-- that's essentially 0
plus 0 plus 0-- plus 6 times

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:29.870
1, plus 2 times 2, plus 3
times 1, divided by 12.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.210
This is the current average
of siblings per student.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:38.990
This is 0, so this equals
6 plus 4 plus 3 over

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.310
12, which is what?

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.430
13.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.270
This equals 13/12,
which is 1 1/12.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.900
So before this new student
joins, there's 1 1/12.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.150
This is the average.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.810
That's before the new
student joins.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.350
What's the median?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.887
Let's list out all of the-- let
me do it in another color

00:09:06.887 --> 00:09:11.170
because I'm running out of
space-- so I have a 0, 0, 0,

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.320
there are three students
with 0.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.870
Then you have 6 students
with 1.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.390
Then you have how many
students with 2?

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.230
2, 2.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.850
And then one student with 3.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.060
So there are 12 terms in all,
and what's the middle one?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.160
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.090
So the middle term is 6.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:42.190
So the median before that
student joined is 1, right?

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.820
And the average before that
student joined is a little bit

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.140
over one, it's 1 1/12.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.040
So the only way that you can
bring the average down--

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.780
right, because that's
essentially what we have to

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.130
do, this new student-- to bring
this average down, he

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.020
either has to have 1 sibling
or 0 siblings.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.950
Or 0 siblings.
