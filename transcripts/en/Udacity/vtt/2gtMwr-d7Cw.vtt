00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We know about the angular velocity which we call ω--that's in radians/second

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you know about the period, which we used a big T to describe--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to remind us that it's units of time or seconds.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It turns out there's actually a really wonderful relationship between these two

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and that the period is always just 2π/ω.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For this quiz, I want to start up here--so that means we've lifted our mass up

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
our mass up and we're about to release it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And let's say it'll tell you that this particular combination of spring

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and mass has a period equal to 2 seconds.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want to know after 7.5 seconds, where will the mass be. Select the best answer.
