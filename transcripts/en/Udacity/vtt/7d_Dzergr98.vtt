00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.320
Our fourth principle was a Knowledge Based AI agents match methods to tasks.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.080
At the beginning of this course we covered several very

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.498
powerful problem solving methods like Generate &amp; Test, and

00:00:09.498 --> 00:00:13.470
Means-Ends Analysis. But because they were very powerful and very general,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.820
they also weren't necessarily the best for solving any one problem.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.020
We also covered some more specific problem solving methods like planning

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.000
that addressed a narrower set of problems but addressed those problems very,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.770
very well. We also covered several tasks in this class, like configuration and

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.800
diagnosis and design. These tasks could all be carried out by a variety of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.764
methods. For example, we can imagine doing configuration with Generate &amp; Test or

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:38.600
we generate every possible configuration of a certain plan and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.070
then test to see which one is best. We could also do configuration by

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.010
Problem Reduction where we reduce the problem down into the sub parts and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.820
solve them individually and then compose them into an overall solution.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.170
In this way, knowledge based AI agents match methods to tasks.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.640
In some cases we do the matching, we decide that generate and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.370
test is the best way to address this diagnosis problem. In other cases we might

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.620
design AI agents with their own meta-reasoning such that they themselves can

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.850
decide which method is best for the task that they're facing right now.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.500
Note that this distinction between methods and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.660
tasks is not always necessarily absolute. Methods can spawn different sub tasks,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.920
so for example, if we're doing design by case-based reasoning that spawns new

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700
problems to address. And we might address those new problems,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.660
those new tasks, with analogical reasoning, or with problem reduction. This gets

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.230
back to our meta-reasoning notion of strategy integration. In this way,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.110
knowledge based AI agents match methods to tasks not only at the top level, but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740
also at every level of the task-subtask hierarchy.
