1
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.110
I was talking to a friend of mine and she was telling me that her dad had been

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.520
hospitalized and while her dad was hospitalized a,

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.630
he was in like this,
uh,
like,

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.830
like a care home for older people.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.290
And I'm a guy who has schizophrenia,
will freaked out and tried to eat him.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
Oh God.
While he was there.
Yeah.
And then he said,
fuck this,
get me out of here.

7
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.260
And he wound up dying at home.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.740
We want to dying at home rather than die in the hospital because a guy tried to

9
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:32.310
eat him.

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.310
Imagine like your last days of life are escaping a schizophrenia guy who got out

11
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.150
of his room and tried to eat it.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.090
This is why I work so hard all my life and raised a family and now I'm here.

13
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.300
I mean that started your worst fears to be,
to die away from your loved ones.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
Just around strangers to be back at the first day of high school basically.

15
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.010
But you're old and everyone's old,

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.150
but then someone's trying to kill you and eat you.
We don't,

17
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.240
we don't get rid of people like that quick enough.
Like,
you know,

18
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:01.430
you get rid of bad dogs,
dogs bite people.
You like to put them down,
put them dot.

19
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.330
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's what I should,

20
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.240
I got to tell my mother that because she works with this group called the

21
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:06.691
village,

22
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.950
which creates a network in any given neighborhood where if you're young or

23
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.910
you're old,
you're registered and cost thing and basically,
uh,

24
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.480
this person can live out their,

25
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.900
their final years in their home because they have a network of neighbors who

26
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:22.350
check on them like every couple hours or call me,
here's my cell.

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.930
That's like I have,
I'm having a chest pain.
Okay,
cool.

28
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.330
Let's just get you to the hospital.
Cause it's like at the Va,

29
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.280
I think people deserve to,
you know,

30
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.950
as long as you're not eating people and killing them,

31
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.500
they can die in their homes.
You know?
Yeah.
That's a,

32
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.040
that's a concern that you really don't ever want to address it until it's too

33
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:42.840
late.
Yeah.
The dude,
the concern of when and how do I go?
Yeah.

34
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.321
You know,

35
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:46.290
I mean you have to accept that you're going to go and some people just have a

36
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.090
really hard time with that.
Sure.

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.540
Even deep into their old age when they're decrepit and they can't make it any

38
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:57.080
more,
they just can't handle the fact that it's all going to end.
No,
no,
I mean it.

39
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
That's why you have to live your life to the fullest and not a bite your tongue

40
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.630
and just be yourself because yes,

41
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.730
or just chill the fuck out and wait for the end.
What do you do?

42
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.300
One of the two,
I don't know.
What is the life to the fullest,
right.

43
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
If it's all temporary share anyway,
they absolutely,
I mean there,

44
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.890
there is that point where it's just like,
well,
is there any point to life?

45
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.250
I don't know.
I've gone back and forth the Trussell on this where I'm just like,

46
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.750
Dunkin.
Yeah,
Duncanville.
Fucking send you down a rabbit hole with that man.

47
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.500
I don't know man.
Yeah,
the cosmic

48
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.660
and he'll make some sense out of it too.
He will.

49
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.670
He is the cosmic trickster without a doubt.
I were Bordain speaking Bourdain.

50
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.080
He was the,
he was staying there like,
how would you like to go?

51
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.621
And he was just like,

52
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.740
I just want just one bullet in the back of my skull and I don't see a comment.

53
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.270
Yeah.
But meanwhile he did it himself and dealing with a rope.
Yeah.
It's just,

54
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.600
I was friends with them.
I didn't fuck me up.
Fuck me up.
I wasn't,

55
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.740
and I was a fan of his since the first article came out in the New Yorker that

56
00:02:55.741 --> 00:03:00.190
he wrote,
it fucks you up because you just go,
I wish he called me.
Yeah,
I wish.

57
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:04.840
I mean I would've flown to France.
No,
I wouldn't have,
I it suck it up.

58
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.470
Pussy.
Don't kill yourself in France,
in back to America.

59
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.280
She would have checked in because I mean,
I think it's all about perspective.

60
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.730
There are times where we've all come close to not necessarily putting a gun in.

61
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:16.810
Our mouths were rope around her neck.

62
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.270
But where'd you just feel like there's no point you no,

63
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.900
but someone can just come in.
I say it like coming up in the,

64
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.430
in the crew that I came up with in Chicago,
you know,
Canadian and Hannibal.

65
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.880
Uh,
and,
and,
and people like,
we,

66
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.920
we never let each other get away with shit or it's just like,
yeah,

67
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.010
you're saying that,
but fuck you.
Like you need those people in your life.

68
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.410
I'll never forget.
I went through a horrible breakup and I went,

69
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.660
I was in my apartment for like a week,

70
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.640
only leaving to wait tables and bartending.

71
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.730
And then I finally came to a show and Canadians like,
hey,

72
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.640
look who pushed aside all the clumps used Kleenex,
be with us.

73
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.110
Welcome back you fucking pussy.

74
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.580
And I remember laughing so hard and it all went away.
It all went away.

75
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.180
You just cause you take yourself so seriously and yours are going to get better.

76
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.290
And it's,
I mean,

77
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.340
I just think about despair as this demon that latches onto your back and it's

78
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:08.240
your job to fuck it up,
get it off you.
You know,
what's your thing,
uh,

79
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.040
uh,
destroy,
fight the bitch in you talk earlier.
Yeah.

80
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.930
Yeah.
You're in a bitches.
I usually,
when I'm referring to your inner pitch,

81
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.100
I mean the inner bitch who doesn't want you to work out.
Yes.
Well that's,
that's,

82
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.540
that's the one I relate to the most where it's,

83
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.020
I feel that every time I'm in a class,
every time I'm in something like that,

84
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.350
it's just like something and you're just like,
I just want to sandbag it.

85
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.280
Let me just Sam.
But just this time,
well,
I mean,
everybody has that.
Yeah,

86
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:37.510
I still have it,
but I've got that motherfucker on lockdown.
Good.

87
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.280
Now I own him.
Good.
He's in there though.
He's weak.
You never see.

88
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.340
Oh,
he's always trying to tell you you don't,
you can take the day off.

89
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.340
Maybe your ankle sore.
Maybe.
Maybe you're feeling a little sick,

90
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.360
a little run down,
you know,
just take a,
take a you day.
The dog looks tired.

91
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.130
He doesn't even want to run.
You know,
it's not about you.

92
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.470
You should take care of that dog.
Dog does not want to run.

93
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.980
My Dad said something brilliant on the floor.
My Dad lately,

94
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:02.590
like he's always been like a guy.
No words.
You mentioned,
uh,

95
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.240
like hospice living and stuff.
My Dad used to do hospice and he,
he would just,

96
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.880
he was like,
do I have to talk?
And the guy's like,
no,
you can.

97
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.790
I just mostly want to someone to listen.
He's like,
I can do that and do it.

98
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.600
Sit by dying people and just nod his head and stuff.
And uh,
but he never,

99
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.450
he never talk about it where I'd be like,
Dad,
what are you doing today is like,

100
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.600
Oh,
I'm gonna go hang out with bill.
Like Dad,
why the fuck is bill is this guy,

101
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:26.530
he's dying.
Like,
Dad,
you got to tell me more than this.
So now we're kind of,

102
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.220
he's opening up more,
but long story long,
he was like,
you know,

103
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.380
when you're waking up in the middle of the night and there's that voice in your

104
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:35.550
head that is telling you you're,
you're,
you're,
you're useless and you're,

105
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.380
you haven't done enough with your life and things like that.
He's like,

106
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.220
I don't know if there is a devil,
but if there is,
that's him.
And I was like,
fuck.

107
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.370
And it just blew my mind.
Right.
And it's like,
dad,
you're right.

108
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.770
That voice that tells you to give up that voice that tells you not to,
not,

109
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.130
not to,
you know,
to hate yourself and to,
you know,
don't think you're worthy.
Well,

110
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.750
it's such a weird pattern,
right?

111
00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:59.340
Because it doesn't have any real evolutionary benefit,
but yeah.

112
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.280
What is the benefit of self loathing and,

113
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.840
and just sitting around feeling pity.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There,

114
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.680
there are plenty of people in situations that are going to kick the shit out of

115
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.590
you in life anyway.
Why?
Why do it to yourself?
But yeah.

116
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:16.990
But there's something good about feeling very disappointed in yourself because

117
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
then it makes you work harder and like you recognize or at least try to realize

118
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.480
your potential better and you get more done.
You feel better about yourself.
