Donald Trump is struggling
in the polls lately

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:05.439
because he has low approval
ratings among many key groups.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.974
Like women, minorities,
young people,

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.811
people who wear shoes
when they go to work, and...

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.613
and those who want the president

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.982
to have a basic grasp
of decency and grammar.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.617
Uh, now,
our research has uncovered

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.186
yet another key demographic
that's coming out against Trump.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.322
Who is it?
A) Hoverboard enthusiasts?

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.926
B) The cast of the 1993 action
movie <i>Demolition Man?</i>

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.694
Very specific group.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:31.999
-Or C) Cats?
-(laughter)

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:36.303
-Jimmy. -Cats because his hair
looks like he just murdered one.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.704
-HARDWICK: Yes.
-(laughter)

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:41.508
(applause)

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.212
For the an...

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.347
The answer, of course,
when it's always on this show,

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.349
and it's a question of cats,
the answer is always cats.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:52.219
Uh, let's take a look.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.521
(Trump speaking quietly on TV)

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:59.293
(laughter)

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.329
-(growling)
-(laughter)

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.464
(hissing)

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:08.435
(applause)

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.541
The cat has recognized
the beast!

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.877
-(laughter) -This will surely
turn the Internet against Trump,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.446
-'cause cats are so beloved!
-A pussy always knows

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.415
-a bigger pussy.
-It does, yes.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:25.819
Uh, I do think I know something
he could do to get them back.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.956
â™ª

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.958
HARDWICK:
Classic. Classic.

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.827
-Okay, I'll vote for him!
-Okay!

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:33.927
-Fine!
-Oh, Keyboard Trump!
