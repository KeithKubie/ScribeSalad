00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.840
Soon pumpkin spice lattes will be the only
way to know if Fall has really started.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.009
THANKS, CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:07.830
JUST OFFLOAD ALL THE SEASONS TO CORPORATIONS.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.860
Ugh. (speaking of that I love Summer brought
to you by Shark Week).

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.720
leaf peepers
Lemme lay this on ya…

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.800
Cool weather, pumpkin patches, warm boots,
colorful leaves, corn mazes, apple cider,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800
hayrides.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920
Get ready to lose all of these things.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920
Womp.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
Climate change might be taking away all the
things we love about my favorite season: fall

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040
leaves, cool weather, and pumpkins.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.910
Fall is the harvest season, when summer transitions
into winter and the plants, animals and insects

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.120
get ready to bear down and survive the cold
months of the year.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.239
It's an important transition period, but in
a matter of decades it's become a completely

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.239
different season.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.829
The most visible reminder of the seasons change
is the beautiful fall foliage.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.809
According to a 2005 study in Plant Physiology,
leaf degradation takes place over 18 days;

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.160
but as fall changes, so too do our trees.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.650
IF you're a fan of fall color, climate change
is not your friend; the leaves of some trees

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
(beech, birch and poplar) are ALWAYS brightly
colored, but the reds and yellows are hidden

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.830
under the blanket of chlorophyll green all
year.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.460
Dogwoods, red maples and red oaks create anthocyanins
which give their leaves a bright red color.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.620
The additional sunlight from the drier, warmer
weather can cause the leaves to die sooner

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.890
and dull their colors -- cold snaps is what
makes those reds and yellows pop.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.910
And even ignoring the fall foliage, the warmer
Fall of the future will cause trees leaves

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.540
to stay greener longer and then drop early
shortening how much time we can actually enjoy

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.130
it; plus temperature shifts let more insects
move north, attacking trees that may not have

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.840
been exposed in the past.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.560
Over time, native trees will die as the climate
becomes inhospitable for them; chances are,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.910
seedlings will start to take root further
and further north, moving forests away from

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.240
their previous homes and into more hospitable,
cooler latitudes.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.850
A study in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences found this is already

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.430
happening; hardwood trees have moved 300 feet
northward since 1962.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.940
But even if you don't care about trees or
leaves… you probably like pumpkins!

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.319
This large fruit native to the warmer regions
of the Americas are a very visible indication

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.319
of Autumn.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.510
The problem is, even though they like warmth,
too warm and they'll ripen before the first

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.510
leaf turns.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.489
According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture,
pumpkins grow best when it's 75-85 degrees

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.489
(23-29C).

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.319
Once a pumpkin ripens, the outside hardens
and it's ready to pick; but this year, it

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.490
has been hot; as you probably know.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.330
The heat was on so high, that the pumpkins
ripened and needed to be harvested in mid-August.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.489
In fact, Oregon-based Rogue Ales planted early
in the spring and harvested in the late-summer

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.819
which meant their pumpkin beer was out super
early too.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.709
If this warming trend continues, pumpkins
will become a summer treat, not a Fall staple,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.640
but don't go out of your gourd!

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.689
Fall will still exist, it will just be…
completely different.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.799
It's going to be warmer for longer, throwing
plant cycles out of sync and shifting harvest

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.819
schedules.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.459
According to the 2011 issue of Global Change
Biology, we're already affecting our climate.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.689
What was once stable is now shifting.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.269
The growing season has extended itself two
weeks since 1982; meaning warmer weather for

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.859
longer periods; and a warmer, Fall season
with more extreme precipitation -- sometimes

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:15.959
dry, sometimes wet.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.730
Insects, flowers, animals and organisms of
all shapes and size all rely on the delicate

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.250
timing of spring, summer, fall and winter.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.849
When whole seasons change in matter of just
a few years, some species will adapt and some

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:28.849
go extinct.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.269
In the end, thanks to climate change or global
warming or whatever you want to call it, the

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.750
Fall we have today, is not the Autumn of our
grandparents, and the Fall our grandchildren

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.879
will see won't even resemble the one from
our childhood.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.090
Sidebar: not that it matters for the those
latte lovers, climate change is making coffee

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.519
difficult to grow too, so instead the symbol
of Fall will be fake pumpkin flavoring and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.510
whipped topping in a plastic cup…

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.469
Honestly, some people probably won't even
notice the difference.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.489
What's your favorite season?

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.849
If it's Fall how do these changes make you
feel?

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.620
Also, I know you probably are already, so
battle it out: Autumn or Fall?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.620
Which is better?

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.519
