00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.260
MALE SPEAKER: Greetings.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.676
Today we want to
welcome Brianna Wu, who

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:14.740
is the co-founder and head of
development at Giant Spacekat,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.056
the game studio nearby.

00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:20.340
She is also on a couple
of podcasts at Relay FM--

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.410
Isometric, which is about
the gaming industry,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.360
and Rocket, which I think is
about assorted geekery topics.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.840
So welcome, Brianna.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.270
BRIANNA WU: Thank you so
much for coming today.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.980
All right.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.960
I want to thank Google
for having me today.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.459
And you know,
[? Kose, ?] I know you

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:47.050
were responsible
for getting me here,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.050
so I definitely appreciate that.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660
My name is Briana Wu.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.880
I'm head of development
at Giant Spacekat.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.150
I'm kind of an expert
in the Unreal Engine.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.500
You know, when I
got into this field,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020
like most software
engineers, I did this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.650
because I love engineering,
I love programming,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.420
I love all this geeky stuff.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.980
When I was a child, I
remember, my parents were

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.890
so hesitant to
get me a computer,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.010
because they knew that
the moment they did,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.210
I would just stay
in my room non-stop

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.360
and never leave the house.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.020
So when I find myself,
especially in this last year,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.510
kind of being an unintentional
figure for women in tech,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.910
I just want to
let you know, this

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
isn't why I got into this
field in the first place.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770
That leads to our first slide.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.720
Why do we have to
talk about this?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.070
What I've discovered
along the way

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.350
is that we really don't have a
choice-- women in this field--

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.790
to talk about gender issues.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.450
These things we're going
to be talking about today,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.600
they really make or break the
careers of women in this field.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.460
Sometime I sit there and
listen to my male colleagues

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.220
in the field, and I
watch what they tweet

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.870
and what they talk about.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.539
It really amazes
me just how little

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.720
thought they have to apply to
some of these social things

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.630
that a lot of women engineers
have to talk about and think

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.840
about every single day-- little
things like being talked over

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.580
in meetings, not being
recommended for promotions.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.600
Google itself has done a
lot of really wonderful work

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.050
on unconscious bias.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.830
What I want you to
know is, I would rather

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.790
be up here talking about
anything else today--

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.700
Unreal Engine, implementing
Unreal on Android, OpenGL,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.280
just about anything.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.930
But the only way it's
going to get better for me

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.980
and the other women
that work in this field

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.310
is by talking openly about that.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.490
So this can be a presentation
today-- I'm not Oprah Winfrey,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm a software
engineer, and I'm just

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.750
going to lay it out
on the table for you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.472
in the same way I
would a software bug.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.700
When I made this talk a few
years ago, I was on my way

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.610
down to WWDC, and I kind of
threw it together on a whim.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.470
What really struck
me at the time

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.690
is these issues of gender in
tech had really come to a head.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.390
This was early in 2014.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.250
My friend Julie Ann
Horvath received

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.530
a lot of gender based
harassment at GitHub.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.170
I'm sure you read about that.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.660
There was a founder
that was accused

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.100
in some really horrific ways of
beating up his girlfriend 152

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.300
times on tape.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.830
You have things like
Code Babes coming out.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.300
Google, which I think
speaks to your credit,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.310
now have released your numbers
of diversity in the workforce.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.200
I think it's really worth noting
that when that story came out

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.020
in 2014, I and a lot of people
were like, this isn't so good.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.450
But with you being
open with that number,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.820
you started to see a
trend of other companies

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.330
like Apple bringing that number
out, and it's not any better.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.160
So I think that
speaks to your credit.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.150
And for me, every single
time I give this talk,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.950
it's more and more
frustrating to me

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.079
because there are
these incidents that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.910
break out about
what women in tech

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.959
are facing that make the news.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.740
And every single
time, it just gets

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.390
longer and longer and longer.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.480
It got to the point
where I couldn't even

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.065
update these slides.

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.190
It would just keep going
through it for 10 minutes.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.580
So we're just going to go
through it super quick here.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.710
For me, one of the most
bizarre experiences of my life

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.110
is I prepared this talk before
Gamergate happened to me.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.330
Now, I don't know if
you're aware of what's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.630
happened to me in this year.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.120
I'm up to 165 death threats
in the last 11 months

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.230
in this field.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.810
I have to talk to the
FBI and prosecutors

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.250
this week about
updates in my case

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.040
and trying to get some of
these things prosecuted.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.840
What I've kind of
unintentionally found

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.450
is by speaking out
on these issues,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.425
it's literally put
my life in danger.

00:05:12.425 --> 00:05:14.050
I hope that kind of
communicates to you

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.970
how strongly I feel
about being up here

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.910
talking about this today.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.340
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.230
going to go through nine
things very quickly,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.560
and there's going to
kind of be a negative,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.680
and there's going
to be a positive.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.340
What we're going
to be talking about

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.120
is some unconscious things that
men in this field tend to do.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.510
And before we get
into this, I just

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.180
really want to make this clear.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.410
Google has done some amazing
work on unconscious bias,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.900
and it's really important
to note, these problems,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.610
if you do them, do not
make you a bad person.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.340
I myself have some of the
same unconscious bias myself.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.780
I remember, I was at
Apple two years ago,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.300
and I was sitting
there, and a man

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.870
was trying to sell
me a computer,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.000
and a woman was trying
to sell me a computer.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.800
And I found myself
unconsciously realizing,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.290
I was talking more to the
man about my computer needs,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.070
and I'm a woman in tech figure.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.970
We all have problems with these
kind of unconscious biases.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.090
So I just want you to
know, this is not personal.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.500
This is just talking about a
problem in an objective way.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.780
So the first thing I
would like to talk about

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.720
is, you need to
stop treating sexism

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.210
like it's just another
controversy to discuss.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.590
There is an inevitable
pattern that happens.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:45.220
Two days ago, I wrote a piece
for Polygon praising Kojima's

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.070
team for making women a playable
character in "Metal Gear Solid

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.570
5."

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.600
The game has gotten quite a
bit of sexist controversy.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.340
This is a piece I didn't
think would be controversial,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.970
because I was actually praising
an aspect of the game-- again,

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.200
they had gotten a lot
of feminist criticism.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.800
And what I found to happen
was, although my response was

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.690
a lot more positive
than usual, I

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.950
was inundated with
men talking to me,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.240
emailing me, writing me,
dynamiting into of my house,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.980
doing whatever, wanting
to discuss it with me.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.050
And this is a
really common theme

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.690
when we're talking about
sexism in the workplace.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.140
This is not like talking about
the ending of "Lost" or a TV

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.640
show.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.880
This is not like
trying to talk about,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.200
is a blue dress or a gold dress?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.270
These are deeply, deeply
personal issues for all of us.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.010
And what ends up
happening is sometimes,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.800
when you try to talk about
your lived experiences

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.690
in this field, you'll have male
engineers who come up to you,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.850
and they start talking
about it like it's

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.730
a problem of
implementing a framework.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.350
Like they are
completely objective

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.370
and just trying to
think through it.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.370
What I think they
don't realize in

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.540
that moment is it's a
real unconscious problem,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.540
because what you are
doing is kind of saying,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.460
prove to me that you're right.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.880
And there's an
unconscious message there

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.290
that my lived experiences
are not-- your opinions

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.420
on this trump my own
lived experience.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.310
This is not a very
helpful way to do it.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.010
What you're unconsciously
doing is when I say, look,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.870
I have had x problem of
sexism with x, y, and z,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.929
and you're like,
yeah, prove it to me,

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.730
yeah, well, have you
thought about this,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.390
oh, well, it's just
x, y, or z, you

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.770
are dismissing my life
and the difficult things

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.810
that I've gone through.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.160
What we need you to do is to
start showing basic sensitivity

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.010
instead.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.690
I want to give you an example.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.600
I had a really good,
lifelong friend of mine

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.190
that went through a
divorce a few years ago.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.900
I knew his wife,
I knew his child,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.770
and when my friend was
sitting there talking

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:16.090
to me about his divorce, I
didn't sit there and say, hey,

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.380
but did you really
try to make her happy?

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.600
Were you really present there?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.900
I know you feel like she's
being unreasonable on this,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.400
but I'm sure it was just blah.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.910
That would be unbelievably
obnoxious, right?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.420
But that is what happens
every single time

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.350
that women start talking
about our experiences in tech.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.860
And again, this is
not intentional.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.130
But what men in this
field end up doing

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.230
is telling us that our own
interpretation of our own lives

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.970
is incorrect.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.675
You need to understand, when
we talk about this stuff,

00:09:49.675 --> 00:09:52.010
it is very difficult for us.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.230
It is emotionally risky.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.550
We're trusting you.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.432
That leads us into this.

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:04.700
This is something that
happened back in 2014.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.490
I'm a woman in my 30s, OK?

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.620
If I'm telling you
I get catcalled down

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.610
the street, trust
me, that's something

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.020
that's really happening.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.270
I'm an engineer.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.070
I'm talking about being out
in San Francisco at WWDC

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.680
and getting harassed
constantly on the street.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.340
So I tweet about
this, and I end up

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.580
getting literally
hundreds of responses

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.350
to this telling me that my
interpretation of my own life

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.540
is wrong.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.110
This happens all the
time in technology.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.120
Again, this is very hurtful.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.960
What we need you to do instead
is just stop doing that.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.720
Again, this is every
single day of our lives.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.940
There are some things that you
have to live to experience,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.770
and let me give you an example.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.680
We've talked a lot this
year about police violence

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.310
towards people of color,
particularly black people.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.630
I have the privilege of
being white in our society.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.530
When I get pulled
over by the cops,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.630
I don't have to stress
that the cops are

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.260
going to be violent to me.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.550
A lot of people in this room
today have that same privilege.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:21.210
I can't speak to any number
of experiences in life,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.040
and that is true for all of us.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.500
So when someone is black
and they are telling you

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.230
about their experiences
with law enforcement,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.780
you need to just listen
to it, and understand

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.140
that that lived experience
trumps your own hypotheses

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.640
about the situation.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.330
If someone gay is telling
you about coming out

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.920
to their parents, or
the discrimination they

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.110
faced as a child, you
need to listen to them.

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.500
If someone is transgender
and they are telling you

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.940
about the difficulties
in transitioning,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.420
you need to listen to them.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.270
Even if the opinion were
hypothetically incorrect,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.810
the emotion that that person
is feeling is absolutely true.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.890
I want to tell a very
quick story about this

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.530
related to this point.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:12.620
A few years ago, they were doing
a study on Alzheimer's patients

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.440
who have this phenomena of, when
you put them in assisted living

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.420
care facilities, they wake
up, they're terrified,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.960
they're confused,
they're scared,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.960
they think they should
be home, and they're not.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.280
They're in a strange hospital.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.940
What they would end
up doing is constantly

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.130
leaving this hospital and
going down to the bus stop,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.390
where they would be
waited on for hours.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.530
What this study found out is
that the people in the hospital

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.620
would go down and start yelling
at these poor, elderly people

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.040
that were suffering
from the disease.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.280
What you need to understand
is in that situation,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.880
even if the patients-- if
the facts of the situation

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.870
were not that they were in a
place they weren't supposed

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.800
to be, their terror
was absolutely real.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.510
Their frustration
was absolutely real.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.040
So when these hospital employees
were coming down and yelling

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.830
at them, they didn't
realize that their emotions

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.440
in that situation
were very true.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.130
What you need to do,
again, is start just

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.170
simply respecting those
lived experiences.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.630
These are our lives.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.200
These are our stories.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.340
When you respect our
lived experience,

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.507
you end up respecting
us as individuals.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.940
This really makes me frustrated.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.710
There is a phenomena
when you talk

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.030
about women in tech issues.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.730
I swear, it is like you're in
court, and all of a sudden,

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.730
you end up getting it
flipped, and you end up

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.680
talking about how these
issues affect men.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.240
It is amazing to me just how
instantly the script flips,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.830
and I find the
subject-- if I'm talking

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.240
about the things I face,
the subject instantly

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.220
comes to if it's fair to men.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.080
Let me give you an example.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.960
Yesterday, Apple had
a rather large event.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.060
They were talking about the
iPad Pro, the new Apple TV,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.630
and I was live tweeting
a few thoughts about it.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.070
I couldn't help but note for
the first 30 minutes of it,

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.470
there were barely
any women on stage.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.600
So I tweet something to
the effect of, well, here

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.890
are all Apple's white guys, here
are all Microsoft's white guys,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.530
and now we've got Adobe's
white guys coming on stage.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.890
I'm deluged with tweets
from people saying,

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.690
well, you can't have quotas
for women you can't do this,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.730
how dare you insinuates
that men shouldn't

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.220
be on stage, which is a
really, really, really,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.810
unhelpful response.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.160
I want to talk a little bit
about where that comes from.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.150
You may have heard the word
privilege a little bit lately.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.930
And the truth is,
men in this field

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.640
are kind of blind to
how great you've got it.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.740
I don't think you
understand what

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.220
it's like to go to
an engineering event

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.430
and be the only person
that looks like you there.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.320
I don't think you
understand what

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.770
it's like to go to
a recruiting event

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.850
and have people talk
to your husband,

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.130
assuming he's the engineer,
when he can't even update

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.700
the software on his iPhone.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.730
This entire system has
been built for you,

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.350
for your comfort.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.660
When we start talking about
other people's comfort,

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.840
you're so used to
it working for you

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.400
that just the slightest
bit of upset--

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.260
there's a lot of
defensiveness that

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.604
really happens very quickly
with that, and it's not helpful.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.650
So again, this is not about
you, and I promise you,

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.270
every single woman
engineer in this room

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.090
has heard these opinions
100 times before,

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.400
like a tape on repeat.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.900
With all respect, I
have heard the argument

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.600
against quotas for women in tech
hundreds of times this week.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.280
There is a really,
really beautiful thing

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.690
called the ring theory that
I'd like to talk about.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.180
The idea is how not to say
the wrong thing to someone.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.870
So the idea is,
you are right here

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.880
in the center of the circle when
something goes wrong for you.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.120
Imagine if you have cancer, or
you've just lost your spouse,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.090
or you're going
through a divorce,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.740
or your parents have died, or
you've got 165 death threats

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.990
in a year.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.030
Imagine you were here in
the center of the circle.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.420
This is not a good place to be.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.330
So what the
psychologist figured out

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.770
is, when you were in the center
of the circle-- she had cancer.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.140
She had a colleague
come to her while she

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.750
was in the hospital recovering
from cancer surgery who

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.820
said to her, well, you need
to realize this cancer isn't

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.079
all about you, it's affecting
people in our department.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:08.069
And she thought a lot
about that conversation

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.730
and why that was so obnoxious.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.369
So there's this thing
called the ring theory.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.660
At the center of the
circle-- which again, is not

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.500
a good place to be--
is the aggrieved.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.190
In the outer limits of
the circle might be close

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.579
family members, loved
ones, your spouse.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.349
On the outer circle might be
colleagues, and on the thing

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.420
here might be strangers.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.810
The idea is, comfort flows
in, grievance flows out.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.010
If you're not in the
center of the circle,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:41.480
or in one of these inner rings,
inevitably making it about you

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.300
is unfortunately obnoxious.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.770
What you need to
do is very simple.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.660
Just listen instead.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.380
OK.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.980
This is a really big one.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.230
I want to talk very openly
and honestly about this.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.220
I'm a 38-year-old engineer.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.910
I don't have any
children, and my husband

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.320
and I made the choice to really
hyper focus on our careers.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.990
I had been blind to
this for a long time,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.530
and I was very blind
to this until I

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.210
had women with children
come work for me,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.610
or people on my
staff get pregnant.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.170
In the game industry,
where I work,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:32.070
we talk a lot about
things like death threats,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.940
rape threats, sexual
harassment, women

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.120
getting hit on at conventions.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.070
Something we're
almost silent about

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.260
is the way we treat women
with children in tech.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.020
And this doesn't
personally affect me,

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.210
but I want to tell you
straight up, in my career,

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:58.020
I've seen more women leave over
this issue than anything else.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.030
Someone in a society has
to have the children.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.930
It's not like women made a
choice about this, right?

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.580
And what I think
people don't understand

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.020
is how ridiculously
expensive child care is.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.740
Here in Massachusetts,
do you know

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.270
that having day
care for your child

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.240
is as expensive as
tuition at UMass?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.980
I want you really
to think about that.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.720
Every single year your
child is in day care,

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.380
that costs tuition and fees.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.340
Absolutely.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.380
It's unconscionable.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.150
This is a really big deal.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.330
So what ends up happening when
women have children in tech

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:43.420
is they end up slowly,
suddenly, being shown the door.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.410
Again, I have
unconscious biases, too,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.520
and what I found at first when
my employee with a child--

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.410
she got pregnant, my
co-founder, and I found myself

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.190
wrestling with all these
unconscious biases.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.160
Is Amanda going to be
present at our workplace?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.540
Is she going to be able
to get her job done?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.700
Is she going to start talking
about her kids non-stop, which

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.840
was absolutely wrong
for me to think.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.050
I've thought about that
and I've grown from that.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.640
This is the unconscious
bias a lot of people have.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.480
What you need to know-- and this
is for parents of all genders,

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.660
not just women--
part of respecting

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.020
a parent in the workforce means
respecting their children.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.960
That means if a
parent needs to leave

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.250
at five to go pick
their child up,

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.800
respecting that person
means respecting

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.620
that their family comes first.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.740
This is really,
really important.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.710
This is a really hard one,
and I've run into this a lot

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.480
in Boston.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.160
I can't tell you how
many networking events

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.910
I've been to in a bar, at
night, with a bunch of dudes

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.169
in their 20s, drinking.

00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:00.710
Right here in Boston there was
one of them we went to a while

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.160
back that was right
across the street.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.760
What has happened in the
field of computer science

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.030
and engineering is,
this is a field that

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.910
was built from the ground
up to be by men for men.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.160
I want to stress, this
is unconscious bias.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.670
But what ends up
happening is you

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.930
have a culture of
networking that

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.380
is built to serve men
in the way that you

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.790
like to network, like going
to a bar and having beer.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.610
Let's take that
example, for a minute,

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.290
because I'd for you
to think about it.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.890
Let's say you were an engineer
at Google in your 20s,

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.620
and you choose to go
have a meeting out

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.420
with the guys on
your team at the bar

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.120
next door after you leave.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.390
Let's think about how
that's affecting women.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:57.280
If you're a woman in, say, your
20s, I think you may not know,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.000
that doesn't feel
emotionally very frequently

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.480
like a safe place for you-- a
lot of guys drinking heavily

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.060
and you're the lone woman there.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.490
I can think of three specific
friends that have been sexually

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.960
harassed in that
situation to the point

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.700
that they've been forced
to leave their company,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.440
and HR hasn't helped them.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.690
It's not the best situation.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.670
If you are a woman in
your 30s, maybe you

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.890
have children, how
many moms do you

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.500
know that really want to
go hit a bar at 8 o'clock

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.270
at night when their kids have
to go to school the next day?

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.210
This is one of these situations
where the system has been built

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.010
to work for a very
certain kind of person,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:48.780
and it very unintentionally
excludes a lot of people.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.530
And let's be honest-- networking
is how you make careers.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.270
It makes or breaks it.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.670
This is really important.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.480
So what we need people to
do, what I need everyone

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.870
in this room to do, is to think
about widening your network.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.230
If Google has a networking
meeting or recruitment

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.730
meeting to bring
in engineers, maybe

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.350
don't have them
in a bar at night.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.860
Maybe have a luncheon
here at one o'clock

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.430
like we're having right now.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.250
Maybe do it earlier.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.250
It's not enough to
just simply believe

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.780
that women need to be included.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.870
I'm a software engineer.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.880
If I go write some code for
my game and it doesn't run,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.770
the problem is with my code.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.140
I don't sit there
and go, well, I just

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.640
don't know why it's not working.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.500
We'll just keep compiling
it and that will be that.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.760
The method that we use to
recruit engineers in our field

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.730
is not working.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.800
I've heard from so
many people when

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.250
they tell me, well, we
put a job posting online,

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.070
and no women applied, and
that's just the end of that.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.490
We have made so
many advancements

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.190
in the last 15, 20
years, and yet we

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.230
can't look at the hiring
process and realize it

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.610
overlooks a lot of candidates.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.700
Let me tell you a story.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.140
It's a story of how the
lead engineer at my team

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.980
came to work at my company.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.690
This is a woman that was
fresh out of college.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.940
She had not gone on the
straight and narrow.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.440
She didn't get a CS degree
and then just instantly

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.500
get into the workforce.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.620
She had some life
adventures along the way.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.490
She had been working
for us part time,

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.300
and we were just
dazzled by her work.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.660
She was doing technical
rigging in 3-D, which is

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.810
very, very difficult process.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.140
We loved her work and
we kept encouraging

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.860
her to apply to the
lead engineer position,

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.560
and she didn't do it.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.570
I asked her to keep
coming in and sit with me

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.550
as we were interviewing other
candidates for this position.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.880
As we did that, she
realized that she

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.370
had the exact same
qualifications as the men

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.680
we were interviewing
for that position,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:10.360
and that gave her the
confidence to move forward.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.390
Just for whatever
reason-- and it's really

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.640
too much to get into
here-- a lot of women

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.020
are kind of trained by society
to not believe in ourselves,

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.000
and we don't always apply
for these kinds of positions.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.930
So what you need to do is to
widen your networking efforts

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.260
to make sure you're looking
at absolutely everyone.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.340
We face a lot more inertia to
getting our foot in the door.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.080
OK.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.630
This is hard.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.540
So many times, when you try
to talk to people in tech

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.580
about even a very small
behavioural thing they might

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.840
have done that is not helpful,
it gets defensive very, very,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.760
very quickly.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:08.260
And I think part of this problem
is self identifying yourself

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.510
as a racist or a
sexist or a homophobe

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.560
is nearly impossible,
because we get

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.120
all these messages from society
that these things are bad.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.710
They're terrible.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.260
What ends up happening is
you tell yourself, hey,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.710
I'm not a bad person.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:25.840
I'm a nice guy.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.050
I care about women.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.800
You think of this
extreme example,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.210
and you say, I'm not that,
and you self identify yourself

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.690
as a nice person, and
you're unable to hear

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.070
any of the criticism there.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.770
And I want to be
straight up with you.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.840
I think we could do a
better job with this

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.310
as a society of
giving people a break.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.390
I think we have a really
unfortunate tendency to,

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.640
when someone makes one mistake,
often unconscious, often

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.640
unintentional, kind of
crucifying them about it,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.020
to be honest.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.640
I make mistakes all
the time in my field.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.520
I've told you about some today.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.940
I don't think that
makes me a bad person.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.500
We have got to get
past this so we

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.690
can hear about these behavior
problems and move forward.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.860
I think it's really telling
in all the years I've

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.680
been speaking about
women in tech issues,

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.140
I have almost never had a
guy come up to me afterwards

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.800
and say, hey Brianna, you know
what, I am part of the problem.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.550
There has almost never happened.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.210
It's always those other guys.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.610
It's always the other examples.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.360
The truth is, if you think that
the problem is someone else,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.870
you are part of the problem.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.740
We've talked a lot this
year about people of color,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.050
and again, to give
an example where

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.270
I have failed-- we had my
staff for the last game

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.050
that we shipped,
"Revolution 60," happened

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.320
to be all white people.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.840
I looked at that and I
realized that I was not

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.580
bringing people of color
into my own company,

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.640
to evaluate people of
color for these positions.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.390
I realized I had
a responsibility

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.570
to change myself, change
when network happens

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.820
and make sure it was
bringing people of color

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.440
in for those positions.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.590
This is a mindset where I'm not
saying, hey, I'm not a racist,

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.490
hey, I have nothing to fix
here, hey, I have no part

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.240
to play in making it better.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.170
This is a very helpful attitude
that all of us need to have.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:33.820
Again, this is all about
responsibility and thinking

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.930
critically about your behavior.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.260
What I love about
one of the videos

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.250
I've seen from Google,
An Unconscious Bias,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.860
is what they found
is the science shows

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.120
if you take one of the things
I'm talking about today,

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.970
if you just take one
thing, if you say hey,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.730
I'm not networking
enough with women, hey,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.840
I am invalidating people's
experiences-- if you make

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.310
a commitment to just change one
thing today-- the science shows

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.290
that that is going to cause you
to start thinking about more

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.730
things, and it will make you a
better person and a better team

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.520
mate.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.485
We all make mistakes.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.670
There is a misconception,
I feel, in tech,

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.810
that the problem women face
is like Don Draper sitting

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.130
in a tech office somewhere,
drinking some scotch,

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.060
and talking about how
broads can't code.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.210
Like that's the
hypothetical situation

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:36.000
that we think discrimination
is in this field.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.390
I have never had,
from a professional,

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.630
someone tell me to go
back to the kitchen.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.380
These kind of moments
are not the real problem.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:51.100
What we've set up is
this idea in our minds

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.370
that the real problem is
some raging sexist stereotype

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.980
from the 50s.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.450
The science shows
that's not quite right.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.220
Sexism in tech, according
to the science of it,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.630
is death by 1,000 cuts.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.200
And what happens is that
it's every single day you're

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.480
in this field, if you're someone
that's a person of color,

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.400
or someone that's gay,
someone that's a woman,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:22.000
you find yourself slowly
dying the death of 1,000 cuts.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.050
And how that happens is it's
little things all day long.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.940
People not inviting
you to meetings,

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:34.510
people underestimating your
capacity as an engineer, people

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.010
assuming that you
don't know your field,

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:40.340
even when you may have dedicated
your entire career for it.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.000
I had an example yesterday.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.560
I was talking at
the Apple TV event.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.810
I will tell you,
straight up, I know more

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:55.200
about running the Unreal Engine
on Apple platforms, Apple

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.240
mobile platforms, than
almost anyone else.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.170
You can probably
find, 20, 30 people,

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:01.840
maybe, in the world
that understand

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.190
the subject as much as I do.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:07.880
I was talking critically
about some of the engineering

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.010
choices that Apple
made when developing

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.530
this platform, in
particular the 200 megabyte

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.680
limit, which is kind of
obviated by a cloud solution.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.500
I was inundated by hundreds
and hundreds of people

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.210
writing me, assuming they knew
more than I did in this field,

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.900
and telling me I was
wrong, when all they had

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.330
was a rather obvious fact that
was mentioned in some tech

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.850
documents.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.160
This is a really good example
of a death of 1,000 cuts.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.950
This is just one minor
thing that happens,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:48.150
but it happens over and over
and over and over and over.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:49.980
They're called
micro aggressions,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.320
and they kind of slowly
push you out of the field.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.650
Another good example.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:57.910
At Apple's event
yesterday, they happened

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.200
to Photoshop a
picture of a woman

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.770
into smiling using
the new iPad pro.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.620
This is a pretty tone
deaf moment, right?

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.750
Guys don't understand
how often, when

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.930
you're walking down the street,
you're instructed to smile.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.420
You're told you
would be prettier

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.010
if you would just smile.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.160
This happens all the time.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.660
When Apple had not had any women
on stage yet at that point,

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.900
and they're Photoshopping
a woman in smiling,

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.070
it's a really tone deaf moment.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.720
That's something a lot
of guys I saw on Twitter

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.140
just didn't understand.

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.230
It was just a little
thing that was really

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.990
just kind of obnoxious.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.830
It pushes us away.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.220
This is a really good example.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.790
This happened last year.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.570
This is just a slide at a
conference, and you know,

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.960
it's completely tone deaf.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.590
Stuff like that will
happen to you almost every

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:54.890
single day if you're
a woman in this field.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.170
What we need to
understand is real sexism

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.100
in this field is
very, very subtle.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.140
A good example of this happened
here in Boston with Harmonix.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.220
You might have read this week
that they got $15 million

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.440
in venture capital funding.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.650
A friend of mine that
worked at Harmonix

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.510
was telling me this story.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:20.670
She was setting out
in a meeting and they

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.340
were looking at getting
a new person to come in

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.160
for an engineering position.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.150
The team leader kept
using masculine pronouns

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.710
when asking someone to
come in for the job.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.700
Well, this engineer he should
have x years of experience

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.180
with x, y, and z.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.170
He should be x.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.400
He should live in x.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.550
He should have this
kind of background.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.850
She stopped him in the
meeting, and said, excuse me,

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:53.000
this could be a man or woman
that we hire for this position.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.910
This engineer proceeded to
then completely talk over her,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.410
belittle her objection, and
said, this is not a problem.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.520
He means everybody.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.700
That's just a very small
thing that happens.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.570
It's subtle.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.350
This is a really hard
thing to understand,

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:15.440
and this is something, again,
I have learned in my lifetime.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.650
The absence of privilege
is not oppression.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.449
And I say this with all respect
to all the male engineers

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:28.409
in this room, this is a
system that really, really

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.560
works for you.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.040
When we're talking about
changing the system just

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.980
a little bit so other
people can come in

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.880
and you can have awesome
people on your team,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.840
we are talking about
changing things.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.050
And I want to be
clear, it is going

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.530
to disrupt some of the
boys' club atmosphere

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.199
that exists in tech.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.440
That is not oppression.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.500
That is a quality.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.610
I want to give you
a very quick story.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.140
So I was over at
MIT the other day,

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.720
and I was giving a presentation.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.760
Afterwords, I had some people
that were really moved by it,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.020
and they were telling me stories
about being out with drinks

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.880
with the guys afterwards.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.660
There was this one engineer
that was on the team

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.060
and he was sitting there.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.700
He was having drinks
out with his buddies,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.090
and he was really, really angry
about the talk that I gave.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.820
He was talking about how
he felt like he had never

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.010
fit in anywhere in his
whole life-- something

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.389
I have a lot of empathy for.

00:35:31.389 --> 00:35:32.930
I can understand
that, because I felt

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.770
the entire same way growing up.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.220
What he was saying was he
was really, really scared.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.790
The attack was going
to change to this place

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.730
where he couldn't have
bro time, couldn't

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.260
have pictures of bikini
girls on his screen saver,

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.790
and it would be a different
kind of atmosphere.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.450
As much as my heart
goes out to that person,

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:59.210
because I think
we all have a need

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.550
to want to belong
to a social group,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:06.680
it's not fair for him to
prioritize his own comfort

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.470
over just equality
for gay people,

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.960
for women, for people of color.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.170
The culture tech has been
built in your own image.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:22.560
I was at PAX Dev two weeks
ago, and I found myself-- there

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.740
was this weird moment.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.780
It was a 23-year-old kid.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.900
He's a white guy, and he's
sitting there talking to me,

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.477
and he was talking
about how he was

00:36:31.477 --> 00:36:33.810
terrified that he was never
going to find an engineering

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.450
position.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.700
And the whole time I was
sitting there talking to him,

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.460
I was realizing all the
assumptions I had in my mind.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.080
He looked like an engineer,
he had kind of messy hair,

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.610
and he was just
wearing a t-shirt

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.260
at a professional event.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.230
He kind of looked
like that stereotype.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.530
And in the back of my
mind, I'm going, of course

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.630
is going to find a job.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.700
I found myself saying,
I don't know anything

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.160
about his technical expertise,
I don't know anything

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.520
about his education,
I don't know anything

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.170
about how well he
plays with others.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.160
But he looks like
the part, right?

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.430
It's just another example
of the entire tech industry

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.120
being built in your image.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.850
When you close your eyes and
think about someone working

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.090
in this field, it
probably doesn't

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.320
look like me or other women.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.870
And the truth is, I
get so much hate mail

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.830
in speaking out against this.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.420
This is before Gamergate
that I got this.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.300
This is just
absolutely terrible.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.700
It's stuff like this I get
every single day speaking out

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.310
about this.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:44.010
This is something that would
be of benefit to everyone

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.710
here to understand.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.830
Let's be straight out.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.810
Tech is going to change.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.790
The momentum is on the
side of women and people

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.510
of color and other minorities.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.340
We are talking about these
problems more and more and more

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.310
and I feel very confident
that tech in 10 years

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.500
is going to look different
than it does today.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.660
I grew up in
Mississippi, which is

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.430
a state that was described
by MLK as sweltering

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.310
with the heat of
injustice and oppression.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.240
Growing up, I sure
did meet a lot

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.220
of people that were extremely
homophobic or racist.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.080
Even in my own social
groups, in college,

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.100
I would find these people.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.950
What will inevitably happen,
especially with gay rights,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.850
we'd kind of have
this person there

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.470
that was ranting
about gay people

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.570
being able to get married, and
they'd slowly be pushed out

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.710
of our social circle.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.710
Do you know what I mean?

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.190
They just had views
that were kind of dated

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:48.030
and we started moving
away from them.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.900
In the same way-- I'm
talking about this

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:56.760
in an utterly pragmatic terms--
this change is happening.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:02.250
Your work force will include
more women in the future.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.130
It's not just that this
is the right thing to do.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.430
This is to your own
career advantage

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:13.070
to develop the skills to learn
to work with other people.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.850
One of the best skills
for any tech professional

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.100
is being able to work
well with a team.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.720
A lot of times, when I talk
about women in tech issues,

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.280
there's this assumption
that women in tech

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.230
is just a chick thing, right?

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:33.660
Oh, well, you know, that's
just a women problem,

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.120
and I don't really
have to deal with that.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.820
I was at a tech
event last night.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.850
It was a VIP event with
investors and women startup

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:41.800
founders.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.020
As much as I love
events like that,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:51.480
it sometimes feels like there's
a trade off in this field

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.140
where the powers that
be will let women

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.450
go have our lunches
over here, and they'll

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.450
pay for us to have an auditorium
and do some networking events.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.840
But nothing really changes.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.720
I'm going to tell you, in
all honesty, straight up,

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.930
sexism in tech is not a
problem with women's behavior.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.710
I'm going to say
that one more time.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:20.030
Sexism in tech is not a
problem with women's behavior.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:24.510
This is a male behavior problem.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:28.300
I can be up here and I can speak
to you about changing this,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.311
but the only person that
can make this better is you.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.820
What we're going to do
is we're going to start

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.450
a conversation right now.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.214
I'll answer any question
in the entire world.

00:40:41.214 --> 00:40:43.630
Who's going to be brave enough
to put their hand up first?

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.127
And we will do that.

00:40:45.127 --> 00:40:45.960
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.110
Thanks for having the courage
to come here and give this talk.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.360
BRIANNA WU: I appreciate that.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.140
Thank you.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.100
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Your slides
are refreshingly direct.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.520
I didn't expect him to
be that so, because I

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.190
found that people don't seem
to respond to them that well.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.590
But in your experience, if
you're with a bunch of people,

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.570
one of them makes a comment
that they don't understand

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.227
is inappropriate.

00:41:09.227 --> 00:41:10.810
Have you found it's
better to actually

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.900
be more direct with
them and just say,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.510
straight up, that's
wrong, instead of saying,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:20.080
well, maybe it's
not quite like that?

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.440
BRIANNA WU: That's a
wonderful question.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.060
Let me answer it
equally directly.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.500
If you're a woman and you do
that, that direct conversation,

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.910
you will get
tremendous blowback,

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.040
which is why so many of the
women I know in game dev

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.900
are very, very careful about
dancing around this issue,

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.850
and just hinting to it
as subtly as she can,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.930
because she gets
so much blowback.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.650
This is where you
personally can do the most

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.130
good in the entire world.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.000
With the Gamergate thing,
we do have men on our field

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.160
that are speaking now.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.410
Chris Kluwe is one of them.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.610
Arthur Chu would be another.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.930
They don't get a fraction of
the death threats that I get,

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.930
or Anita gets, or Zoe Quinn
gets, or Randi Harper gets.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.170
What happens is when you
have that male privilege,

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.970
you are able to kind of pull
your buddy aside and be like,

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.520
hey, can we just
talk about that?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.750
That's not really cool
what you just said.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.950
Just have an open conversation
with them about that.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.790
That's almost no risk for you.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.595
I think if you're
a woman, you need

00:42:27.595 --> 00:42:29.720
to realize there are going
to be blowback for that.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.660
I personally made the choice
to just answer it directly.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.410
I'm not Oprah Winfrey,
again, but this

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.410
is where I would really ask
guys to step up and help us out.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:43.830
You can do so much
good, you have no idea.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.190
Let's go to another question

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.030
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I suspect
most people here in the room

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:51.719
are probably on your
side, are probably

00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:53.010
very receptive to this message.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.054
BRIANNA WU: Thank you.

00:42:54.054 --> 00:42:55.970
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah,
I am too, and thank you

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.810
for coming to give the talk.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.190
Do you think it's
better to try to engage

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:06.070
people who aren't here and
maybe wouldn't be as receptive?

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.570
Or do you think
it's better for them

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.272
to come to this conversation
of their own volition?

00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:10.980
BRIANNA WU: Sure.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.260
I think that's a
really good question.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.870
Did anyone else
here see the piece

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.560
on Vox last week
that was talking

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.980
what nerds don't understand
about politics by Dr.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.480
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.870
Did you see that?

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.070
That was a 10 out of 10 talk.

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.200
I called up that writer
on the phone afterwards,

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.950
and I started asking him
that exact question, how

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.180
we could get that answer.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.910
Let me tell you about
the science of it.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.060
I know Google
nerds love science.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.340
He has a lot of expertise in
climate change denial, people

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.160
that don't want to
believe in global warming.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.050
What happens is, with some
people, you are correct,

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.990
it is impossible to
change their minds.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.960
There's nothing that
you can say that is ever

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.750
going to make them feel
differently on that.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.760
You cannot scientifically
change someone's opinion.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.690
What you can change
scientifically

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.900
is someone's behavior.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.150
The human mind has this
really interesting trait

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.330
that we'd like to
think of ourselves

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.327
as rational creatures,
but we're not.

00:44:12.327 --> 00:44:13.910
We have this
psychological trick where

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:17.240
we decide how we want
to feel, and then

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.800
our minds act like lawyers
and justify the thing

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.340
that we want to believe.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.780
If you're a programmer, you've
learned to short circuit

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.270
that to a certain extent.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.700
We tend to be very
logical creatures,

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.375
but that is the
overall human tendency.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.290
You can't change
someone's opinion.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.780
You can change their behavior.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.900
So what happens if
you make a social cost

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.740
to that person doing something,
if every single time they

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.300
speak up, they face
consequences for that?

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.550
Even if it's just some
guy going, hey, that's

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:59.715
not really cool, hey, that made
me feel uncomfortable, hey,

00:44:59.715 --> 00:45:01.760
can you think about
this way, maybe?

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:07.650
What happens over time is you
change that behavior, and then

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.770
the psychological trick where
you decide how you want to feel

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.800
and then the mind
justifies it, you

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.460
decide that you want to
feel like not doing this,

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.520
because the social cost is less.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.260
And then your attitudes
slowly start to change.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.400
With the climate
change denial thing,

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.270
this would be if you
can get through any way

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:31.590
possible-- to get tax
rebates, to get people

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.530
to put solar panels
on their roof

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.520
to save on energy efficiency.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.150
What they found when you do
that is their opinions change.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:44.090
You can have the most dedicated
climate change denier,

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.300
but once they get
that government tax

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.750
rebate to put solar
panels on their roof,

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.940
suddenly, they're a proponent
of renewable energy.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.580
It's exactly the same
way in the field.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.040
So scientifically, that is
the best weapon that we have.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.454
Do we have another question?

00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:01.120
AUDIENCE MEMBER: First
of all, thank you

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.610
for the choice you're making.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.610
I cannot imagine choosing to
live a life where death threats

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.320
were just sort of a
background fact of it.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.200
BRIANNA WU: It's really bad.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.690
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I think it's
necessary to have conversations

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.210
in this space, for there
to be people like you,

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.140
so I'm grateful for you
for doing something I

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.390
don't think I'd be able to do.

00:46:19.656 --> 00:46:21.280
The question I was
curious about asking

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.000
is, do you have some
understanding or intuition

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.080
about where the depth
of vitriol comes from?

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.820
BRIANNA WU: Sure.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.280
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Some of it, I buy,

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.670
is being the confusion
between absence of privilege

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.467
and oppression, and
I get that, but it

00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:37.050
doesn't feel like enough to me,
and there's something about it

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.170
that I'm just not
wrapping my brain.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.700
BRIANNA WU: Oh, I spent
an entire year thinking

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.126
about this question.

00:46:45.126 --> 00:46:47.210
This is very insightful.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.180
This is as best as
I can figure it,

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.230
because that's getting at the
core of the problem, which

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.480
I love.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.910
How many people here are gamers?

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:57.820
Can you raise your
hand if you're a gamer?

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.320
Great.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.610
The biggest mistake
my parents ever made

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:07.460
was getting Nintendo
entertainment system in 1985.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.030
I remember opening
that box at Christmas,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:15.220
and I remember my grades went
to hell, I stopped socializing,

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.860
I stopped doing my
chores, and that

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:22.270
was all I did-- I still do it.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:26.390
What I remember about that
era-- and this was 30 years ago,

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:31.220
like Mario turns 30 soon,
guys, this is really amazing--

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.310
what I remember
about this era was

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:40.300
how marketed the
product was for boys.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.370
And this shows up in
all these subtle ways.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.730
Do you know there have
only been two core Mario

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.180
games where you could play as a
girl character, Princess Peach?

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.720
The first was "Super
Mario 2" in 1988,

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.020
and then as far as
the core Mario titles,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.640
we had to wait 25 years
for Princess Peach

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.920
to be playable again.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.240
Making this a boy space was
very deliberately chosen

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.554
by the Nintendo marketing
team back in 1985.

00:48:11.554 --> 00:48:12.970
They said that
they were targeting

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.750
boys between 5 and 10.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:17.560
Then when the Super
Nintendo came out in 1982,

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.580
they just rewrote the
same document and said,

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:23.250
we're targeting
boys 5 to 15 now.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:26.340
What has happened
is, I think we'd

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.100
like to say that the
problem is a bunch

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.840
of misogynistic
15-year-olds, and that

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.920
is part of the problem.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.060
But I think if you want
to look at it more deeply,

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.980
there are all these
unconscious messages.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:46.090
They've been telling
boys, now 35-year-old men,

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.430
that games are their space.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.130
It's not women's space.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.990
It happens in all
these subtle ways.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.580
Princess Peach is always waiting
to be rescued in the castle.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.850
When women are in games, we
are frequently over sexualized.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:04.930
We're always the sidekick
or the damsel in distress,

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:08.590
and we have huge, giant boobs
with lots of cleavage out.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:13.410
And what it is, is 1,000
unconscious signals that

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.890
have been sent to men
saying, this is for you,

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.780
this is not for women.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.640
They have this
intellectual shortcut

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.260
where they might be
theoretically fine with women

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:28.330
playing games, but the instant
we bring their lived experience

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:32.710
into it and say, well, it
really hurts me to never

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.040
be able to be the playable
character in a game,

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:40.690
well, I'd like to see a
woman larger than size six

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.909
represented in a video game.

00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:44.950
How many games can you
think of where you've seen

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:48.270
a mom as a playable character?

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.339
Do know what percentage
of women are going

00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:51.630
to have kids in their lifetime?

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.340
It's all unconscious by
the people in our field,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.870
but they feel-- it's kind
of the same as politics.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.784
Certain people feel their
identity is being taken away,

00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:05.950
and they get very defensive.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.090
Did you have a follow up?

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:08.006
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I do.

00:50:08.006 --> 00:50:09.844
BRIANNA WU: Go ahead.

00:50:09.844 --> 00:50:11.760
AUDIENCE MEMBER: If I
take what you're saying,

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:17.040
and I take it to sort of try
and wrap my brain around it,

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.600
what I'm hearing is that
people create or adopt

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.300
or dive into spaces that are
restricted to one set of people

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.960
when they are threatened
by another set of people.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.262
So I'm hearing you as saying
that people who are feeling--

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.970
and you can look at
what they say online,

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.160
and it's pretty clear, too.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.564
BRIANNA WU: Look through my
Twitter mentions sometime.

00:50:38.564 --> 00:50:39.980
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Saying that there

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.563
is a class of men
that feel threatened

00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:44.840
by the presence of women in
gaming seems a little obvious,

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.630
but it does bring up
the next question, which

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.470
is sort of, why?

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.780
What's going on there that
those people feel like they

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.499
need that space to feel safe?

00:50:55.499 --> 00:50:57.790
BRIANNA WU: Let me only tell
you another a quick story.

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.760
I grew up in Mississippi,
so my senator

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.890
at the time, Trent
Lott-- I actually

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.960
worked for him one summer.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.000
We'll leave that there.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.680
Don't judge me.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.388
I was very young.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.120
My senator, Trent Lott, once
did a study for the Republican

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.810
Party in the south-- and I'm
keeping this very apolitical,

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:23.190
we're just talking
about facts here--

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:28.390
he did a study
looking at what would

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:33.180
drive voter behavior to vote
for the Republicans that year.

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:36.710
They tested all these questions
like, the Democrats will

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.620
raise taxes, blah, blah, blah.

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:43.040
They found this one question
that raised through the roof

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.780
the response of it.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.940
The question was, the Democrats
want to take away your culture.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:53.160
And white Southern males
just responded off the charts

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.050
to this, just ridiculously high.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.840
What happens is, there's
a really deep set

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.350
evolutionary part
of our brain where

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:06.320
we're programmed from back when
we were living in caves to have

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.060
in groups and out groups, and
we're just programmed to say,

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.960
we're in this group, and
then this group over here

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.260
is the other, and
they are a threat.

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.720
You can see that portrayed all
through history, through war,

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.410
through all of this stuff.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:22.740
What's happening is
it's really tapping

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.770
into a very reptilian,
primordial part of the brain

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.610
where people feel like,
this is their in group.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:31.720
Their identity is based
in it, and they're scared

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.886
it's going to be taken away.

00:52:34.897 --> 00:52:36.480
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I
just wanted to pass

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:40.450
on a question from a speaker
last month, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:43.610
who just wanted to know what
we might see next from you,

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.860
and also, how friends
can help with anything

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:46.630
you're working on.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.170
BRIANNA WU: Oh, that's
a really great question.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.940
I love her.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.370
You should check out her book.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.860
What I am working on next is--
as if dealing with Gamergate

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.210
were not big enough for me,
we are working on the venture

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:05.200
capital scene right now to do a
multi-million dollar expansion.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.630
I can't talk about
some of it, but we're

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:11.880
very interested in what we're
calling emotional game play

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:12.790
dynamic.

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:17.150
To me, I feel like we
have reinvented this wheel

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:19.560
for 30 years in the
video game industry.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.950
How many first person
shooters have you played?

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.990
Because let's be
honest, Call of Duty

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:26.770
is not that different than Doom.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.915
It's like we keep reinventing
the same idea because it's

00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:31.520
the same people there.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.110
What we're doing is
taking a step back

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.930
from the entire
video game industry,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.800
from all the assumptions that
we've made, and we're saying,

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.820
what is the goal in the
video game industry?

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.610
To me, the goal is a holodeck.

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:47.740
The goal is a holodeck
and to go and interact

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.520
with different kinds of
people in emotional ways

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.610
and learn things about
yourself along the way.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.680
As we really have an
explosion in VR technology,

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.540
we have some very interesting
ideas about frameworks

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.100
to develop from this.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.820
We're raising millions
of dollars for that.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:09.340
As far as how to help
me-- guys, if I personally

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.170
dealt with all of my
death threats myself,

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.610
I would not do anything
else with my time.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.180
There's just too much of it.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.330
And it's sad, but I'm just
being straight with you,

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:22.880
being up here today, people
will see this video on Google,

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.810
I will get threats,
I will get attacked.

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:28.670
I have to employ in my
company a full time person

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:32.080
to deal with my harassment,
to talk to prosecutors,

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.580
to talk to the FBI, to
document this stuff,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.250
because I could not work
in this field if I did.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.940
I have a Patreon where people
can help pay for that position,

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.100
because startups don't have
room for extra positions

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.910
to pay people to
file death threat

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:48.170
charges with prosecutors.

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:49.590
That's how you can help.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.680
Maybe we'll give a link
to that in the video.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.721
Thanks for that question.

00:54:55.852 --> 00:54:57.810
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Stepping
back to the attitudes

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.810
that lead to the horribleness--
it makes me wonder,

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:04.830
were the cultural
watchdogs right all along,

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.071
that these games were corrupting
us during our formative years

00:55:09.071 --> 00:55:10.424
with destructive attitudes?

00:55:10.424 --> 00:55:12.896
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]

00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:15.270
BRIANNA WU: Can I tell you
the weirdest story about that?

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.254
Who else here was a gamer in
the 90s with Jack Thompson?

00:55:22.254 --> 00:55:24.670
Do you remember that, when
they were worried about "Mortal

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:28.170
Kombat" corrupting the youth?

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.130
I remember being a
teenager and being

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:32.980
like, oh, that's so
stupid, that's so dumb,

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.140
that's so full of crap.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.210
I'm not saying that it's
not, but I will tell you

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.660
an experience that I had.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.160
They're coming
out with "Hatred,"

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.840
which is this game that's
a mass murder simulator.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.730
You have a certain
person on Steam

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:55.830
that is demanding the creators
add modifiable tools so people

00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.430
can put me in that game
to kill, and Zoe Quinn,

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:02.830
and Anita Sarkeesian.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.000
I have gamers that
want to do that.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.350
I keep thinking back
to being a teenager

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:12.180
and my strong opinion about
violence doesn't matter.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.850
I'm just be a straight up, I
don't have an answer there.

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:18.010
I think we should be able to
make whatever games that we

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:18.560
want.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.830
I'm certainly not
pro censorship,

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:23.920
but I think something's
really wrong in our industry.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.939
I think we need to
think about that.

00:56:26.939 --> 00:56:28.230
Does that answer your question?

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.475
I'm not going to tell you we
need to start censoring games.

00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:35.030
I don't.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:38.660
I think it's impossible in an
age of digital distribution.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:42.940
But what I do believe
is that Nintendo,

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:48.060
Sony, Microsoft, and Steam
have a responsibility

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.440
to think about the product
that they're putting out.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.370
When Steam reversed
their decision

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:55.840
and did decide to
release "Hatred" which

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.230
is made by neo Nazis--
it's a white power thing

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:00.885
to just go kill people.

00:57:00.885 --> 00:57:02.260
You watch the
trailer and there's

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.630
a woman begging on her
knees for her life,

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.170
and you'll stick a shotgun
in her mouth and kill her.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.400
It is horrific.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:14.070
I don't think you should
censor that by the government,

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:16.770
and I think in an age of
digital distribution anyone

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:19.660
can play the game if they want.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.450
I think we should do that.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:23.290
Can we do two question
super quickly?

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.280
Great.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.930
AUDIENCE MEMBER: You mentioned
a couple of micro aggression.

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:31.174
You mentioned mansplaining
and interrupting.

00:57:31.174 --> 00:57:32.590
I wonder if there's
any others you

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:34.380
want to call out as
maybe anything that's

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.910
specific to the software
development environment?

00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:41.470
BRIANNA WU: I think
that a really big one

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:45.250
would be assuming women
do not know their stuff.

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:47.360
That's a really, really big one.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.960
It hurts a lot.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.780
I think talking over women in
meetings, and let me say this,

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.440
I love gender neutral examples.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.070
Look, a lot of us here
are software engineers.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:02.110
Almost all the engineers
I know are introverts.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.860
I'm not, but the
vast majority are.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.180
What I have noticed in
running my company is

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.130
if I don't take a firm
hand, the extroverts end

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.810
up talking over
everyone and introverts

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:15.610
can't get a word in edgewise.

00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:17.750
This includes a lot of women.

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:22.160
If you are product manager, you
have a strong responsibility

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.570
as a team leader to shut
down the extroverts like me

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:28.180
for monopolising the
entire conversation

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:30.480
and letting everyone be heard.

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.100
I could go into a
whole bunch of them,

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.890
but I think that's
a good example.

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:37.060
Last question.

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.730
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I was wondering--

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.900
there was a time in the late
tube and early transistor days

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.390
when computer operators
were mostly women,

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.530
and because [INAUDIBLE]
switchboard operation,

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.630
it was basically
seen as secretarial.

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.190
My question was, are
there any lessons

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:54.760
we can draw from the
path of computing?

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.855
Is there a time when it
was indeed mostly women?

00:58:56.855 --> 00:58:58.230
It wasn't a
prestigious position.

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.230
It became a prestigious
position, then came men.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.313
Is there anything we can
learn from the early part

00:59:02.313 --> 00:59:02.990
of that history?

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:05.090
BRIANNA WU: Yes, that's
a historical pattern.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:07.120
Believe it or not,
there's a huge pattern

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:12.370
through history of field
coming along and being born.

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.630
It starts off as
very prestigious,

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.590
and women are drawn to it, and
there's a pattern over and over

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:23.377
again that men move into the
field and end up changing it.

00:59:23.377 --> 00:59:24.960
I would love to tell
you what happened

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.940
in computing in those early
days is like an aberration,

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.770
but it's not.

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:34.420
There is so much
baggage that women

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.540
face to working as
professional engineers.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.770
I see this was someone
my friends' children,

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.880
who are 14, 15 right now.

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.090
And they're put into a culture
where beauty culture starts

00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:49.400
telling them who their friends,
are what they look like,

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.900
is so much more important than
doing that work we all know

00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.180
is so important,
sitting in your bedroom

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.810
and learning how to code.

00:59:57.810 --> 01:00:00.300
There are 1,000 messages
like that we really

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.610
have to move past as a society.

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:04.200
I've got to leave
it there today.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.440
Thank you all for having me.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.340
I appreciate it.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.690
[APPLAUSE]
