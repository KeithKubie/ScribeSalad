00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.605
When Markowitz added to the game was
this consideration of variance and

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.330
co-variance between individual stocks.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.030
And the recognition
that you want to blend

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.480
those together that
have anti-correlation.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.460
So you can have a much lower
risk portfolio if you combine

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.011
assets that are anti-correlated.

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:23.670
Or anti-varianced.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.850
[LAUGH] If that is a word.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.390
Because when one moves up,
the other moves down.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.510
They cancel each other out.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.870
And you have much less volatility.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.009
Now of course you want, overall,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.720
all these assets to in
general move up together.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.500
So often what we are looking for is
anti-correlation in the short term and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.790
positive correlation in a longer term.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.820
But out of this work grew
a number of algorithms,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660
one of the key ones being
mean variance optimization.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.820
Which is a way of taking a potential
set of assets and figuring out how they

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.050
should be blended together by looking at
their co-variance among other things.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.200
So let's consider this group of assets
here and how we might combine them or

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.640
allocate funds to them to
provide a good portfolio.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.870
One thing I didn't point out
before that I want to mention now.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.810
Is it generally the higher
return stocks or assets,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.228
whatever they might be tend
to also be the highest risk.

00:01:25.228 --> 00:01:29.200
So as we roll down the risk we
tend to also look at lower return.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.330
Now again, how do we combine
these into a good portfolio?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.560
Here's what goes in to
a mean variance optimizer.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.450
These are the factors that it considers.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.640
So for each stock you have to
provide an expected return.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310
In other words,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.380
what do we think in the future it's
going to provide in terms of return.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.560
You also provide volatility and
covariance.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.990
Volatility is simply historically
how volatile has each

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.050
one of these assets been.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.120
Covariance is a matrix which
shows between each asset and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.950
every other asset, what is
the correlation of daily returns.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.750
So it takes all of these into
account when it is searching for

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.040
the right waiting for
each of these stocks in a portfolio.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.880
So the last and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.360
perhaps one of the most important
inputs to this is the target return.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.510
We can target a return anywhere
from the max return asset

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.340
to the min return asset.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.710
And then anything else between those, of
course, we can accomplish by blending.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.500
So let's suppose this is
the level of our target return.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.530
So I'll just put a dotted line here so
we can mark that for later.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.030
So the output of an optimizer is
a set of weights, one weight for

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.700
each asset,
that provides the target return.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.240
But minimizes risk, so in the end we're
looking for a portfolio that's out here.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.250
In other words it's got risk that's even
lower than any of the individual assets.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.480
But it meets the target return.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.560
And this is possible because
we consider covariance.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960
We're only looking at individual risk

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.510
we wouldn't be able to find the right
blend that would bring us out here.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.440
Now that's it for optimization and
the insights from Markowitz.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.420
But there's one more thing to look at
with regards to optimizers that I'm

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.260
going to show you next.
