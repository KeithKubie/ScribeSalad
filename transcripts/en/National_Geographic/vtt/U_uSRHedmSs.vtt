00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.300
NARRATOR: There's
a new battleground

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.734
in this gender revolution--

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:05.133
bathrooms.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.100
And nowhere is that battle more
heated than in public schools.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.667
Now, even the Supreme Court
is set to weigh in on the case

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:15.300
of Gavin Grimm, a transgender
student in Virginia,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.433
who's fighting for the right
to use the bathroom that

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:21.166
corresponds to the
gender he identifies as,

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.200
not the gender he was
assigned at birth.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.233
I'm not looking for
separate but equal,

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.600
I'm looking for the
same opportunities

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.633
that my peers enjoy
every single day.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.066
And that includes using the same
restroom as any other student.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.033
NARRATOR: But one school
in South Central LA

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.066
is already forging ahead.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.500
The Santee Education
Complex High School.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
In 2016 it opened
what's considered

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.500
the nation's first gender
neutral, multi-stall restroom.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.333
A cause for
celebration for some,

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.600
a lightning rod for others.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.700
Santee is part of the LA
Unified School District,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.834
which represents
nearly 1,100 schools

00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.600
and more than 640,000 students.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.734
It's a district that's been on
the front lines of this issue

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.367
for years.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:09.367
The LA Unified School District
has had transgender-affirming

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.734
policies since 2005.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.433
NARRATOR: That was
more than a decade

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:16.367
before President Obama told
schools across the country

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.166
to open their bathrooms
to transgender students

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.567
or face losing federal funds.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.467
The policy that we
wrote 10 years ago

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.834
was inspired by a family with
a transgender first grader.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.133
The policy is actually pretty
simple, that our transgender

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.066
students can access
all facilities based on

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.767
their affirmed gender identity.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.934
In LA Unified a student
who is transgender

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:42.600
can change their name, their
pronoun, and access facilities.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.800
NARRATOR: It's a whole
new world for educators.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.700
So LA Unified trains
them in everything,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.867
from roll call in homeroom,
diplomas at graduation,

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:54.667
and, yes, the question of
who can use which bathroom.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.367
So we're going to
do a little test.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.567
There's going to be
some slides that come up

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:01.700
and I just want you
to call out the people

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.867
in the slide, what is
the bathroom that you

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:05.667
would probably direct them to.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:10.333
So if a student named John
comes back from spring vacation

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.867
and says my name is April
and I would like you to refer

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.633
to me by she and her, we
sit down with this student,

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:18.533
usually a counselor
will talk to them

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.900
and ask them what's
going on, how long have

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.200
you been feeling like this.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.166
We make a plan
with that student.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.734
What is it that you need?

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:30.633
Do you want to change how you're
known at school completely?

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:32.567
Do you want us to change
the name on the roster?

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:35.100
Which are things that
we're capable of doing.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.133
When a student is transitioning
and they meet with their school

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.600
and they talk about
their identity

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500
as something that is
affirmed, is deeply rooted,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100
it is consistent,
it is persistent.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.367
You can't be transgender just
for fifth period PE to have

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:53.867
access to the locker room.

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:57.867
We would not allow that
because it needs to be genuine.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:02.667
And if the administrator
has a reasonable suspicion

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.300
that the request
is not legitimate,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.867
they do not have to honor it.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.800
The situation of a
student, a male student--

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.200
interestingly we only seem to
worry about our male students--

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.500
but a male student
pretended to be transgender

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.200
so he can, for
predatory reasons,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.400
have access to a
female facility.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.400
I think that's
rather ridiculous.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.367
I've heard all kinds
of fears expressed

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.100
just through the media.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.066
None of those fears
have ever been realized.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.667
Ever.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:39.433
We have never had the
type of fearful misconduct

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.333
that people talk about with
our transgender students.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.834
That has never happened.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:50.333
Last year I got 17 phone
calls in three days,

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.367
from elementary
schools, mind you,

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:54.467
that had transgender
students whose

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:56.867
parents wanted them
to be able to attend

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.433
schools authentically.

00:03:58.433 --> 00:04:02.266
There are so many more students
who are coming out now,

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:05.333
just because of the
national conversation.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.734
When we talk to families
we can tell them,

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.467
we will be one of the
most affirming school

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.433
districts in the country.

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:16.300
It's a promise that I am
fortunate to be able to make

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.734
on behalf of all of us.

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:23.633
I do believe that, as a
country, we need to make space

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:26.400
for people who have more
fluidity around their gender

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.867
or people who are transgender.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.467
Kind of break that rigidity.

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:33.734
So I believe that, as a school
district and as a community

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:37.867
and as people who care about
others, that the more that we

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.867
can do to help people
be more of who they are,

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:43.033
the more they're going
to be able to be engaged

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.867
in their education,
follow their dreams,

00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:47.467
and be more of who they are.

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:51.734
Our goal is to help people be
more of who they are, not less.
