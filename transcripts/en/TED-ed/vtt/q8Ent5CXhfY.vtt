00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:11.097
Your cell phone is mainly made
of plastics and metals.

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:13.674
It's easy to appreciate 
the inventive process

00:00:13.674 --> 00:00:18.941
by which those elements are made to add up
to something so useful and entertaining.

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:21.746
But there's another story 
we don't hear about as much.

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:24.933
How did we get our raw ingredients
in the first place

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.802
from the chaotic tangle of materials
that is nature?

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:33.431
The answer is a group of clever hacks
known as separation techniques.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.489
They work by taking advantage
of the fundamental properties of things

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.124
to disentangle them from each other.

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:43.959
Simple separation techniques
apply to many physical scenarios,

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:45.791
like separating cream from milk,

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.920
extracting water from soil,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.138
or even sifting out flecks of gold
from river sand.

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.420
But not all mixtures 
are so easy to unravel.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.836
In some of those cases,

00:00:56.836 --> 00:01:01.499
we can exploit the differences between
physical properties within a mixture,

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.176
like particle size,

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:04.112
density,

00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:05.684
or boiling point

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:07.712
to extract what's required.

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:08.876
Take petroleum,

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.581
a mixture of different 
types of hydrocarbons.

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.448
Some of these are valuable as fuels,

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:17.665
and others make good raw materials
for generating electric power.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:21.491
To separate them, experts rely on one
important feature:

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.676
different hydrocarbons boil 
at different temperatures.

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:29.925
During the boiling process,
each type vaporizes at a precise point,

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:32.794
then gets separately funneled 
into a container

00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:35.947
and collected as a liquid as it cools.

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:38.776
Separation techniques 
also take us to the sea.

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:40.804
In some drought-stricken countries,

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:44.024
the ocean is the only 
available water source.

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:46.883
But of course,
humans can't drink salt water.

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:48.658
One way to get around this problem

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:52.877
is to remove salt from sea water 
with reverse osmosis,

00:01:52.877 --> 00:01:56.869
a process that separates 
water's ingredients by size.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.405
A membrane with pores 
bigger than water particles,

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.560
but smaller than salt particles,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.430
only lets fresh water pass through,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.263
transforming what was once undrinkable
into a life saver.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.093
Meanwhile in the medical world,

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:15.282
blood tests are a vital tool 
for evaluating a person's health,

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:17.921
but doctors typically 
can't examine blood samples

00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:20.527
until they've separated 
the solid blood cells

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:23.169
from the liquid plasma 
they're dissolved in.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.902
To do that, a powerful rotational force
is exerted on the test tube,

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:30.861
causing heavier substances 
with higher density,

00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:32.244
like blood cells,

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:35.236
to move away from the rotational axis.

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:38.267
Meanwhile, lighter substances 
with lower density,

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:39.486
like plasma,

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:41.545
move to its center.

00:02:41.545 --> 00:02:43.611
The tube's contents divide clearly,

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:48.016
and the blood cells and liquid plasma
can be tested independently.

00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:51.306
But sometimes, unlike oil,
seawater, and blood,

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.712
the parts of mixtures 
that we want to separate

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:56.287
share the same physical properties.

00:02:56.287 --> 00:03:01.406
In these cases, the only way to isolate 
ingredients is by chemical separation,

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:05.074
a complex process that relies 
on unique interactions

00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:09.322
between components within a mixture
and another material.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:11.995
One of these methods is chromatography,

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:16.023
a tool forensic scientists use 
to examine crime scenes.

00:03:16.023 --> 00:03:18.566
They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas,

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:21.334
and can monitor 
and analyze the ingredients

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:24.774
as they separate 
and move at varying speeds

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:26.930
due to their unique chemical properties.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.630
That information then tells scientists
precisely what was present at the scene,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.333
often helping to identify the culprit.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.298
Separation techniques are not just about
industry,

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:38.257
infrastructure,

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:39.195
medicine,

00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:40.518
and justice.

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:43.867
One of the most technically ambitious
projects in human history

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:48.528
is a separation technique aimed at
answering the fundamental question,

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.237
"What is the Universe made of?"

00:03:51.237 --> 00:03:54.158
By accelerating particles 
to extremely high speeds

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:56.188
and smashing them into each other,

00:03:56.188 --> 00:04:00.443
we can break them into 
their constituent parts ever so briefly.

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:02.911
And if we succeed at that, what's next?

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:05.427
Is there a most elementary particle?

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:08.040
And if so, what's it made of?
