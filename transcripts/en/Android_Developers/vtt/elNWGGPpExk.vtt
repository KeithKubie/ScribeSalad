00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.747
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:04.080
GINO MICACCHI: Hello, everybody.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.070
Thank you, Nico, and
the Google Play team

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.790
for giving me the toughest
spot in the agenda.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.050
We are all coming
back from heavy lunch.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.620
So it's going to be
difficult to engage you.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.740
But since it's a session
about engagement, let's try.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.330
So since we have
very little time,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.940
I don't want to spend too
much time on this slide.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.580
You can research about us.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.290
You can download our app.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.770
But the one thing I want you
to remember about ABA English

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.130
is very simple.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240
We teach English,
which is actually

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.710
a very simple sentence that
highlights the complexity what

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.490
we do.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.590
[? Because, see, ?] when you try
to work improving engagement,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160
sometimes you feel the barrier
of maybe not trying to really

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.050
achieve the final result that
your user is trying to reach.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.080
To put it simple, the
final goal for our users

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.190
is to learn a language.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.650
Can we really measure the fact
that the user is progressing

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.530
in learning language
with the classic metrics

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.460
that we have for engagement?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.600
So basically, a
few years ago, we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
were asking ourself
this question,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.510
is quantitative data
enough for us to measure

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.570
the efficiency of our methods?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.270
Is stickness, or one day,
seven day retention, the right

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.700
metric for us to measure that?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.890
And I want to ask
you a question.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.470
I think we are all
obsessed with metrics.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.480
How many of you have checked
your KPIs in the last 24 hours?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.460
Oh, come on, guys,
you should do better.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.100
The other question for
you is, how many of you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.610
had a meaningful conversation
with one of your customers

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.500
in the last month?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.040
I'm actually surprised.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.520
But see, this is the point.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600
We came to the realization
that quantitative data

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.470
was able to tell us
where the problem was.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.460
But to really go
further, we needed

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.100
to go to the real source.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
And so we decided to change
completely our mentality

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.190
and to really put
our student first.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.870
This has been a
long journey for us.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.840
And we are still halfway
through to become

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.510
a real customer-centric company.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.970
But still, it's a journey
I want to share with you.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.860
And the first step
that, for us, was

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.220
very important to go
through this journey

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.710
was to really have
management commitment.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.320
It is very hard if
management doesn't believe

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.870
in this statement,
to be able to become

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.540
a customer-centric company.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.180
The second thing we had to do--

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.510
luckily, we had the support.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.430
But the second
thing we had to do

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.000
was to basically shock
the organization.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.840
And to do that, we
literally brought people out

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.250
of the building.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.370
Yes, literally we took people
from different departments--

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.580
engineering, marketing,
product, of course.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.230
We went on the street.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.250
And we started interviewing
potential customers.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.380
It's something I invite you to
do also because, for us, it was

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.290
a very mind blowing experience.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.350
And the results we got
back from that experience

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.140
was that we stopped
discussing what we thought

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.150
was better for our user.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.870
And the conversation slowly
started becoming more oriented

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.020
to what the user will do,
what our user will need,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.670
in this moment.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.300
Sometimes you don't
need to go that far.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.540
You have probably the answer
already in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.970
Your customer support
team is in the front line.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.760
They know already what are
the main issues of the users.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.230
So simply ask them.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.758
Another important step for us
was to introduce user research.

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:48.050
Now, we do research every week.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.140
We have users coming
every week in the office.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.760
We do remote surveys.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.780
We do a lot of stuff that
allows us to have two ways

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.360
communication with our users.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.810
And another very important
part is trying to avoid silos.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.210
Sometimes this information,
like in the case of customer

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.500
support, is already available.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.330
It's only compartmentalized
into department,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.190
as someone else said.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.680
You need to make this
information available

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.010
if you really want to focus
on customers to improve

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.060
engagement.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.750
And we brought this up
into our development cycle.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.910
So basically, you can read a
lot about dual-track agile.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.890
I highly recommend an
article from, more or less,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.920
10 years ago from Marty Cagan
from the Silicon Valley Product

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.350
Group that explains a lot
about the methodology.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.340
But the basic concept is you
have basically two tracks.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.800
In discovery, you try to
figure out what to build.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.910
In delivery, you deliver
what you already validated.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.210
And so having our process,
our development process,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.070
considering these two
different moments,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.520
they are both tentative
moments, was key for us

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.500
because, in discovery,
we use techniques

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.640
like design springs,
prototyping, research

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.240
to quickly validate hypotheses,
to formulate and validate

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.980
hypotheses.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.540
And thanks to the
qualitative data

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.410
we got from this first phase,
we can more confidently

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.850
move into delivery.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.710
Also, engineering teams are
more happy at this point

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.130
because their probability
of what they are building

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.090
in the delivery track is higher
because we already validated

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.070
key hypotheses in discovery.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.490
So to give you an
idea and trying

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.090
to also jump into a
real life example of how

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.970
we had to leverage qualitative
data in combination

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.410
with quantitative ones, look
at this very simple step

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.340
in our old onboarding.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.660
So again, we teach English.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.040
So in the onboarding
stage, we were asking users

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.290
to tell us what was their
initial level of English.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.230
If we look at only
quantitative data,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.590
we weren't losing so
many users in this step.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.710
Actually, barely nobody was
dropping off at this point.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.920
Every user was
selecting a level.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.390
But you know what?

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.230
When we started in analyzing
their sentiment in this stage,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.770
we discovered that many users
were actually frustrated.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.440
How do I assess my
level of English?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.530
And how this is going to
work out at the end for me

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.280
in the app?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.280
What we found out
is that, eventually,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.110
the fact that
users were randomly

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.680
selecting level of
English in this stage

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.530
led to abandonment later on.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.960
We had users that were
overestimating their level.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.920
And they were basically facing
with too difficult exercises,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.400
and vice versa, users were
underestimating themselves

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.500
and finding the
exercises we were

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.960
proposing too easy for them.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.210
So we worked in a solution.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.010
We prototyped
different solutions

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.770
to try to address this issue.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.400
And at the end we
went for one that

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.650
was kind of counterintuitive.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.280
We created a way longer
funnel during the onboarding.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.310
Now we ask users to
take a level test.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.285
Yes, we still have easy path.

00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:09.660
If you're a beginner, if you
want to skip the onboarding,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.460
then you can still do that.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.290
But our new happy path for
users onboarding the app

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.118
goes through a level test.

00:07:17.118 --> 00:07:18.910
And again, it's
counterintuitive because we

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.210
were adding many steps in
the onboarding process.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.370
You will think, OK,
many more steps,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.320
the funnel will be longer.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.610
And you will lose users.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.650
Well, it wasn't that the case.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.460
In fact, what we saw
overall, with these

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.160
and all other experiments
that we did on the onboarding,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.150
is that we achieved double
activation in our app.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.400
And again, if we were only to
focus on the quantitative data,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.380
we were never going to discover
where the real problem was.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.070
So again, what we
learn, as a company,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.680
is that you need to
go to the source.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.600
You need to talk
with your customers,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.330
eventually even going
out of the building.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.020
Complement quantitative
data with qualitative data.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.650
Bring it into your
full development cycle.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.800
Make it practice for you
to have this feedback

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.020
into your development cycle.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.560
And ultimately, experiment.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.140
Experiment a lot
because, at the end,

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.270
it's what really is
going to help you

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.370
find the successful solutions.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.080
Thank you.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.780
I'm going to pass
the baton to Rishit.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.840
I hope I said it right.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.340
Thank you.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.721
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:35.262 --> 00:08:37.179
RISHIT JHUNJHUNWALA:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.570
I'm Rishit from Truecaller.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.520
So what is Truecaller?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.320
Quick view on that.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.360
Truecaller is a
communication app

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.320
that improves not only your
calls but also your messages.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.850
We've been around for a while.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.553
We're headquartered in Sweden.

00:08:52.553 --> 00:08:53.970
The main thing to
get from this is

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.040
that our context is that we are
operating at a certain scale.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.805
We were able to do
some of these things

00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:02.180
because we operate
at that scale.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.850
So talking about
engagement, the first thing

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.540
is how did we measure
the engagement.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.460
There are a bunch of
metrics that we can use.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.650
We looked at sessions
per DAU, time spent.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.370
But then we stuck
to DAU/MAU ratio.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.030
This was the North Star
metric that we're using now.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.090
This is the email that
goes out to all employees

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.600
across the company
every single day.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.600
We do have feature level
metrics as well, of course,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.690
for engagement.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.380
But we thought this was a good
overall, overarching metric

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.640
to track.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.820
It also gave us a comparison
with some of the other apps.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.760
So we said, let's
stick to this one.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.150
So that's how we measure it.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.660
But what did we do to
increase our engagement?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.500
So the first thing
was we realized-- we

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.850
made this mistake many times.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.830
As we were launching
new things, we

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.740
realized that a lot of
our users didn't even

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.020
know that we had launched
some of these things.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.390
So we made the
effort introducing

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.710
some of these features to them.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.550
We also ensured
that we got users

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.830
to upgrade to the latest
version of the app, which

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.270
was spoken about in the
last session as well.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.580
This made a huge
difference to us.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.970
Here's another example
of education that we use.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.310
We sent out a notification.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.720
It's slightly contextual so
that we don't spam our users.

00:10:26.803 --> 00:10:28.970
The other one thing that
we did, which I don't think

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.270
is spoken about enough--

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.040
it did come up in the
earlier session-- was speed.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.190
If you can improve
your app launch speed--

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.070
just that exact metric,
app launch speed--

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.550
you can easily get a
few percentage points

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.040
at the very least
of your engagement.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.560
Faster apps are much
easier to engage with.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.110
And that's what users love.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.050
So please focus on speed if
that's something you can do.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.780
And please focus on
your app open speed.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.170
And then we looked at, how is it
that we can add more features?

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.550
Where should we look at for
more features for engagement?

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.700
And this is about going deeper
into your existing use case.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:16.708
So we were already there in
the user's life for calls.

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.000
When you get an incoming
call, we showed you caller ID.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.650
Or we told you it was spam.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:21.760
And that's great.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.310
So we said, how can we
participate even further

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.140
into that calling experience?

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.630
So that's when we built the
dialing experience insight.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.170
So we went deeper into
the calling space.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.650
The other thing we did was,
while you can go deeper

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.400
as well, we also looked at
slightly adjacent parallel use

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.000
cases.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.860
So we were already
in the calling space.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.110
And we were doing really well.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.738
Users love what we were doing.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:47.530
And we said that similar
problem that we're

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.780
solving in the
calling space actually

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.510
exists in the messaging
space as well.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.275
So maybe we can go horizontal
and introduce messaging.

00:11:56.275 --> 00:11:58.150
And I think this was
one of our biggest gains

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.880
in engagement, that
we went horizontal.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.920
And our users loved that.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.210
The other thing we
found was, all our apps,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.890
everyone has some user
base and some community

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.190
that is already using your app.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.820
Use that community to further
create engagement in your apps.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.810
So we had features
like tagging, which

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.040
is on the screen,
commenting, spam reporting.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.080
We took all of the
community generated content.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.770
And we put this
back into the app.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.590
So we actually
showed other users

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.860
that this number
has 56 spam reports.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.070
And this many people
have tagged it as this.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.900
And that actually
gave this feeling

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.800
to the rest of our users
that the app is alive

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.840
and it's active and it's
meant to be engaged with.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.780
So our community
engagement actually

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.530
drove further
engagement as well.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.980
All of this resulted in
really good gains for us

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.440
when we focused on
it, 30% increase

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.350
in that DAU/MAU ratio
North Star metric for us.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.760
So that's great.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.740
A lot of things went well.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.760
30% increase, I got a
pat on my back as well.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.890
But we were hurt in
many different ways.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.100
And here are some
examples of that.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.650
The first one was--

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.030
so we educated our users.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.020
We pushed them to learn
new features that we have.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.990
But we really annoyed our users.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.380
We were hammered in the
app store for our ratings

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.370
and reviews.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.400
And we had to pause
our a roadmap to focus

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.620
on some of these things,
and that really hurt us.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.230
So be careful, when
you're educating users,

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.940
that you don't go overboard.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.870
Keep track of these
things closely.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.010
Also, what happened was, while
we were focused on this North

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.180
Star metric, we started
ignoring the key stats that

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.190
are available on Android
Vitals that was there

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.780
in the earlier session.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.320
Specifically, crash
rate, wakelocks--

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.420
these things hurt us also.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.210
Uninstall rates went up.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.520
Our ratings went down.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.400
So always, when you're
adding new stuff,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.680
please make sure
you're tracking Android

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.930
Vitals as well because
we've learned the hard way

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.330
that it really
makes a difference.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.540
The third one is--

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.530
I mean you can obsess about this
metric, any metric, some North

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.110
Star metric for your app.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.930
But don't get obsessed,
like don't make your roadmap

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.260
obsessed with that metric
because what will then

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.290
start happening is, you'll
forget that users actually

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.170
don't give a shit
about your engagement.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.130
They care about
their life and how

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.750
you're improving their life.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.720
You have to keep adding stuff
that adds value to your users.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.520
Otherwise, your competitors
will go ahead of you.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.980
Where do you want to take
your user strategically,

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.200
you will lose out
on those aspects.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.250
So I think the
theme of this talk

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.620
is exactly what I should end
with, that you should do less.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.770
Do it better.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.990
And I think that's what will
likely get you more engagement.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.716
With that, I will hand
over to Timur from BADOO.

00:15:10.716 --> 00:15:14.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:19.650
TIMUR GARIFZYANOV:
Hello, everyone.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.830
Thank you, Gino and Rishit,
for great presentation.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.880
My name is Timur.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.280
I'm from BADOO.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.270
To give you a little bit more
context, BADOO is not one app,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.700
BADOO is a group of dating apps.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.810
One of our biggest brands is
Badoo, obviously, and Bumble.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.350
But we also have Chappy, which
is like a dating app for gays,

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.660
and Lumen, which is
dating before for seniors,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.060
like over 50-- so a
lot of different brands

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.810
with the same dating
mechanic inside.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.190
Our businesses are huge.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.290
We have one billion votes
placed per day in our group.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.850
We have 460 million users
registered around the apps.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.640
So we are, by far, the biggest
dating group in the world.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.070
And we have 300,000
users registered daily.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.650
So engagement and how to make
engagement smart and doing

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.200
more by less is in our hearts.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.390
And it's what's driving
our business forward.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.150
So what I decided
to do is to give you

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:19.220
some examples of the features,
which we launched recently,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.280
and how they affected
our KPIs and how,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.700
by looking differently
in these KPIs,

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.650
you can take
different decisions.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.800
And I want to start with
feature, which is sending

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.760
[INAUDIBLE] hearts in chats.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.000
So chat is our
core functionality.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.430
We have chats in
all of our apps.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.800
And we decided
probably users have

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.900
a problem with
sending the message

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.150
like, we're spending too
much time thinking about what

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.250
should be sent, like
how we should approach

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.390
with people first.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.180
And we wanted to give
them easy experience.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.872
We said, OK, let's give them
this one button, like hearts.

00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:54.330
And you're just
sending this heart.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.300
And you invite a person
to a conversation.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.380
Great feature.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.450
We launched this one.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.849
Results were quite
controversial.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.220
So obviously, a lot of
people sending these chats.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.920
Like, the number of messages
now ecosystem rose for like 20%,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.050
like everyone sending
chats to everyone.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.200
Everyone initiated chat easily.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.900
But when we started to dig
deep into these metrics,

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.109
we find out that reply
rates for these messages

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.920
was ridiculously low.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.670
So for males, compared to normal
messages, it's about 6% down.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.340
For females, they don't
respond to these messages.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.780
Like, they're ignoring this one.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.860
So obviously we don't like the
people ignoring the messages.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.600
We don't like people--
we're not focusing

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.620
on initiating new chats.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.350
We're focusing on
the meaningful chats.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.870
And our main metrics,
like female retention,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.980
started to go down.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.280
Females not only didn't like
to reply to these messages,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.490
but they didn't like
this flooding of hearts

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.680
so much that they
were leaving the app.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.970
So we decided to iterate on this
one and launch a new feature.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.840
Like instead of giving you easy
access to sending a message,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.390
what if we will go
backwards and actually

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.950
we'll disallow you
to send a message,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.790
and make it much, much harder.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.020
So we launched a feature which
is called bad openers blocker.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.410
So if we will see that you're
sending some bad message,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.390
like "hey," or
"hi," it's saying,

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.900
OK, this one message
is probably bad.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.916
And this one is not open,
very good conversation.

00:18:25.916 --> 00:18:27.730
The results were obvious.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.230
This feature was
launched on Bumble,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.647
which have a unique mechanics,
where it's only females can

00:18:31.647 --> 00:18:32.770
initiate the chats.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.720
Obviously this feature dropped
down the initiating chats

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.090
ratio, like 6% of females
initiating the chats.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.930
But the reply rate for these
messages rose like 14%.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.020
And we have this metric which
is called meaningful chats.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.730
It's like how many messages were
sent, what was the reply rate.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.500
It's given us an overall
score of quality of a chat.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.060
It's over 7%.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.507
So by sending less
messages, we are actually

00:19:00.507 --> 00:19:02.090
improving the ecosystem
for our users,

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.320
by actually sending more
meaningful messages,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.960
and exchanging in more
meaningful conversations.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.450
I will jump for more
complex examples.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.550
And the first one
is push messages

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.270
controlled by algorithm.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:23.040
So [INAUDIBLE] have a
very interesting topic

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.970
about that sometimes you don't
know are you [INAUDIBLE] users?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.110
Are you annoying enough?

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.710
Like where is this borderline
between being annoying

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.630
and notify enough users?

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.400
Because we want
users to be notified

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.620
about the important
events in our system.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.610
So we decided that probably the
humans and the manual approach

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.620
is very hard for this one.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.110
So what if we'll ask a
computer or machine learning

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.060
algorithm to control this one?

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.100
And we wrote a machine
learning algorithm, basically

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.170
with statistics.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.760
We gathered the
data about should we

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.710
send these messages right now?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.690
You probably already
have enough messages.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.090
Or probably you don't
have enough messages.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.720
And based on this data,
we decided, should you

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.670
be notified about
this event right now,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.218
or we should postpone this one?

00:20:10.218 --> 00:20:11.760
So we launched this
feature recently,

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.790
and the results was
quite surprising.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.800
For males we dropped like
total number of messages, 30%.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.590
For females, we more
than halved the number

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.960
of messages we sent for females.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:29.070
Obviously it means that for some
of them we were not [? over ?]

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.010
[? notifying, ?] but
borderline annoying.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.430
And interesting fact
that although we

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.120
send less messages for females,
like we notify them less.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.810
And in our industry
obviously, retention

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.660
is always linked to
the number of messages,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.430
like number of push
notifications, number

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:51.030
of users you return back.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.850
But what we learned is that
by sending less messages,

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.100
we actually retain,
and we actually

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.710
return back to more females.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.730
They're more inclined
to return back.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.410
Another one is
machine algorithm.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.180
Obviously like with
dating, matching

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.880
is our core service,
core functionality.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.100
All of our apps have
a matching game.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.950
Like when you match
with people, you vote.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.760
You show interest.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.110
You say that I'm not interested.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.480
And if both of you are
interested, this is a match.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.780
And we open the conversation
functionality for you.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.380
So for the last
couple months we were

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.030
focusing on this
poor experience,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.840
like how we can
improve this one.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.460
What is the main
metric for this one?

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.560
For a long time our metric
was total number of matches,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.770
or number of matches per user.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.450
But we said that probably
it's not the right metric.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.390
Probably we should focus not
on generating more matches,

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.660
but to distribute them better,
or to balance the activity

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.470
better.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.430
So we launched
the new algorithm.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.600
And results in some
countries-- obviously

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.177
we operate in 170 markets.

00:21:53.177 --> 00:21:54.510
Some markets [INAUDIBLE] better.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.200
Some markets
slightly less better.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.665
After launching
the new algorithm,

00:21:59.665 --> 00:22:01.290
total number of
matches wasn't changed.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.690
So from the perspective
of these KPIs,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.220
it was like a failed experiment.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.070
We spent like half a year
and achieved nothing.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.470
But when we started
to look broader,

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.360
on the broader topic,
what we noticed

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.250
is that actually 20% of
users now have match.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.720
Obviously if you're
focusing on the total number

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.330
or matches per
user, you can have

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.390
one user with 10 matches
and another user with 0.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.960
[INAUDIBLE] The
median must be 5.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.060
Or average would be 5.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.300
So obviously we generated
more matches for the users

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.870
without them.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.400
So now more users in our
ecosystem have matched.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.990
And 50% more of them
have a yes vote,

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.430
which is sometimes
people vote yes on you

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.570
and you don't vote yes on them.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.300
But this can happen.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.285
But still, they generate
more matches, more yes votes.

00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:52.800
And we generate
engagement for them.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.140
We generate events for them.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.420
So why it's successful
from this perspective?

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.550
So, again, what we
learned, and what

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.400
we have seen from these
examples is that you not only

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.540
need to focus on some KPIs.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:13.120
You need to focus deep
on what these KPIs bring

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.840
into your ecosystem,
how these KPIs translate

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.260
into your ecosystem, like what
is the meaningful KPIs for you.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.683
I have many, many more examples.

00:23:21.683 --> 00:23:24.100
I chose only four because I
have a very, very short amount

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.090
of time.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.460
If you want to discuss,
I would be somewhere

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.350
near a coffee shop.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.120
Please join me.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.150
Let's discuss, and I
will share with you more.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.540
Thank you, everyone,
for your attention.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.380
Going back to Nico.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.430
[APPLAUSE]
