00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.900
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I
remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.640
We live in an interesting time because of our internet culture don't we?

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.240
[music begins]

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.200
Most of us just go online for either
business or pleasure, but then there's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.950
another two groups of people we're all
too familiar with. Those looking to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.630
"offend" and those looking to "be offended".
Admit it, we've all come across these

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.510
people and they're both pains in the ass.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.040
Extremists trolls looking to get
attention by pissing people off, and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.440
extremist crybabies looking to get
attention by acting like everything

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.210
everywhere is an insult.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.660
We usually shrug or laugh them off and
then go on with our lives.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.140
But the combination of the two extremes has led to an interesting issue being

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.120
addressed, our humor.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.920
Some would argue humor has gone way too far, driving too much into bad taste and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.540
harsh stereotypes. Others would say humor has gone too soft, afraid to anger the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.260
politically correct sensitivities of the
world. Are either of them right?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.860
Do any of them hold any water? Well first of all, offensive comedy is nothing new.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.280
Comedians have been censored, harassed, even sent to jail for jokes that today

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.329
would be seen as pretty commonplace.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.309
That's because, as mentioned by myself and others, all comedy is based on some form of misery.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.450
So you always have to address something unpleasant in order to get a laugh.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.229
George Carlin, one of the world's most
beloved rule breakers, once said "comedy

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.770
doesn't work unless someone's getting
offended", and he's right.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.670
Puns are a mockery of language, goofy faces are a mockery of strange-looking people,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.689
you really have to think about it,
but yeah, somebody's pride has to be

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.249
challenged in order for it to work. But what most good comedians realize is the more truth

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:45.079
in pain you can emphasize, usually the
more funny it is. "Tom and Jerry" is much

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.859
funnier than "Smurfs" because it really
looks like the pain hurts.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.950
"Malcolm in the Middle" is much funnier than "Full House" because they address

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.599
much harsher realities.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.840
But of course, if you were to see any of these in real life, you'd probably be

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.720
horrified and wouldn't laugh at all.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.360
Hence this is why comedy is a defense mechanism, which I go more into in other editorials.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.670
But this begs the question: When does a joke go too far?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.370
Why is it ok when Dave Chappelle uses the n-word, but not okay when somebody

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.700
else uses it like, uhhh...

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.220
Yeah. To many of us, this might
seem pretty fucking obvious what the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.310
difference is, but like in many cases, you need an extreme to understand an extreme.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.940
So we'll just use this one as an example. When Richards used the word, it wasn't to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.390
laugh at a problem or offer an
interesting point of view, his intent was

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.560
to seriously hurt a person. With
Chappelle, he uses the exact same word

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.600
but he's mocking such hate, he's using it as a means of satire and to get people

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.980
to look at an issue.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.250
Both were trying to make the audience
laugh, but one came from a place of trying

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.280
to do something positive, while the other came from a place of trying to do

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.570
something negative.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.370
So does it simply come down to intent? Not entirely.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.740
Gilbert Gottfried got in trouble when he made tsunami jokes shortly after a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.340
massive Japanese earthquake. It even
ended up costing him his voiceover job

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.660
for Aflac. Now, tsunami jokes were nothing new, but when it was made just after that real life event,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.100
the pain was still too close for most
people. This is why most people say

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.260
"comedy is pain plus time". We've all heard Titanic jokes or Lincoln assassination

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.340
jokes, but if you were to make those
shortly after the event, it would be seen

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.640
as insensitive because you wouldn't be taking into consideration the pain

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.360
others are going through. This is where the phrase "too soon" comes from.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.640
Gottfried eventually apologized as he realized he crossed the line. There wasn't enough

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.590
positivity to the joke in order to make
people laugh.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.890
That doesn't make him a bad person and his career would still do fine,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.880
but many would agree the joke hurt more than it healed.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.140
Some comedians however thrive on bad taste, there's people like Matt Stone and Trey

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.550
Parker, and to a lesser extent Seth
MacFarlane, who make no qualms that they

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.630
want to try anything funny and don't
care who gets offended in the process.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.140
While both can be entertaining, most find themselves enjoying Stone and Parker's

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.430
humor more. But why? They both seem focused on shock value and what's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.360
inappropriate.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.660
Part of it may come from the fact that their most popular projects- "South Park" and "Book

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.920
of Mormon" -instill trust that its
creators can be goofy, but also have a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.660
balanced mind set. The extremism seems like an excuse to apply common sense

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.709
into a world of madness, something a lot of us can identify with and see a lot of

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.009
comedy in. Seth MacFarlane's work is
always a mean crazy person in a mean crazy world.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.740
So his comedy seems less balanced and more desperate to shock.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.340
Nowhere is that more obvious than with the joke about Sarah Palin's child

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.900
I think, it's actually kind of confusing.
On "Family Guy", Chris goes on a date with a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.170
girl who has Down syndrome and she says her mother is the former governor of

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.370
Alaska. Palin got so pissed and caused others to make a big fuss about it, but

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.370
to me, the biggest insult is the joke
doesn't make sense.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.560
Palin has a son with Down Syndrome. Are they implying that former governors of

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.000
Alaska have Down Syndrome kids? Are they saying the son got a sex change and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.430
suddenly became a teenager really fast?

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.180
The joke is such a cheap shot at shock humor that people got offended by it

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.670
before they even asked if they really
got it.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.330
That's an example of humor looking to
shock just for the sake of shock value.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.350
Now that's not to say it can't be funny
or even downright hilarious at times, but

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.410
it's not going to hit as many
bull's-eyes as South Park, as we've seen

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.040
in the past couple of years, because we relate with Parker and Stone's humor more

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.560
and therefore trust them more. So even the art of bad taste is still an art nonetheless.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.639
But what about when it goes the other
direction? When not being too offensive

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.030
kills the comedy, but being too
politically correct kills the comedy.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.539
Remember when they banned Speedy Gonzales for a while?

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.499
Yeah, this was actually a thing. So many people were offended and said he was a

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:42.699
bad Mexican stereotype. That is, except for one group of people. F**king Mexicans!

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.479
Yeah, they thought Speedy was fine,
there was nothing wrong with him!

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.900
Eventually too many complained saying they wanted to see him back, that that's exactly what

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.020
they did. And now he's back in the
regular Looney Tunes lineup. That was

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.760
getting offended for a group of people
that wasn't even offended!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.560
Jerry Seinfeld once made a joke about models looking pissed on the runway and people

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.210
were shouting "sexist" at him.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.870
In fact, he stopped playing at college
campuses because audiences were too

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.729
sensitive to his material. College
campuses were too sensitive to the most

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.289
vanilla stand-up you can think of?
I thought colleges were supposed to be wild and

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.300
crazy, a bunch of party people.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.689
Jerry Seinfeld was too extreme for you?

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.749
Christ, they'd probably faint if Raffie went on stage.

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.099
Amy Poehler, one of America's funniest performers and feminist icon, did a

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.639
sitcom on Hulu about a comedian who leads the profession because her colleagues

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.289
say too many offensive jokes.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.860
Guess what happened? Twitter got offended at the offensive jokes they were

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.240
supposed to find offensive. Christ, isn't that kind of like saying: "You know I know

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.349
I'm not supposed to like the Nazis but
the way you represented them they just

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.460
seemed a little too mean,

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.200
these were a little too mean for Nazis". These aren't the only comedians that have noticed it.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.770
There's a brilliant Key and Peele sketch where a company vice president asked a

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.210
black man, a white woman, and a gay man, to listen to a speech to make sure it's not offensive.

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.409
They made dozens of complaints about how offended they are before he even gets to

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.500
the speech. When he finally does begin the speech, he says "a Chinaman, a Pollock,

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.560
and an Arab walk into a bar", and of
course the three of them have no problem.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.219
And I think that sketch gets to why
there is such an extreme between people

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.219
who are looking to offend, and people who
are looking to be offended.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.900
It all comes from where we place our
emotions. We still live in an online

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.280
culture where you can be ambiguous and therefore your actions don't really have any punishment.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.220
Now not everybody abuses this like a
psychopath, but many use the internet as

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.400
a means to get out aggression and
frustration that everybody feels in their lives.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.560
Of course if you do it in a healthy way
that's not hurting anybody, there's

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.380
nothing wrong with it. At least, if you
realize that's what you're doing.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.000
Socially awkward people looking for fast attention usually become trolls or pick

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.420
pointless fights in forums, and we all
see them throw out swear words and

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.700
slurs and pretty much just ignore them. But then there's people looking to fight for a cause, which is fine.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.210
Causes are good. They set change in
motion and let the world know when it's

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.650
time to correct something. But if you go into a cause for a wrong reason, say to

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.190
fulfill an emotional, even selfish need,
you're going to probably be making the cause look bad.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.720
If you're fighting for something to fill
a void and not because you want actual change,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.480
you're liable to be more emotional and
closed-minded to the subject.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.930
This can also lead to seeing scenarios
that aren't really there. Remember when

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.490
Michael Jackson said one of his albums didn't sell because Sony was racist?

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.410
Uhh yeah, that must be it.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.400
Remember when Meryl Streep called Disney a "sexist anti-semite", even though there

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.960
has never been any evidence to prove so?

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.160
And not to bring up Palin again but:

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.539
Remember when she turned feminist for just a few minutes?

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.839
Claiming that the reason everybody was picking on her was because she was a woman?

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.250
Nailed it. You have given us no other
reason to possibly make fun of you.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.120
All of these are good causes: Race,
religion, gender, the equality of all of them is worth fighting for.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.660
But pent up emotion can explode at the wrong time and at the wrong people, leading

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.870
us to demonize perfectly good ideas or causes.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.190
Don't worry, we're not going to be short of racist, sexist, bigoted assholes out there.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.820
You don't need to go searching for them were they don't exist, and you don't need to

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.800
destroy good comedy for it either.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.430
In reality, the best way to cause change isn't to soften humor, but rather

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.860
increase humor. Great comedians like John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, and Jon Stewart

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.340
have become the most trusted people in media not because they wave their

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.870
fingers and complain but because they apply humor, satire

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.010
and common sense to facts that really
matter. But let's be honest, it's the

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.180
comedy that draws us in. We listen to them first because they're funny

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.140
then because they're dealing with hard
truths. Look at John Oliver on YouTube,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.910
he's fucking exploding!

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.850
Lots of people are getting interested in subjects that they never would have been

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.410
interested in before, but because he
makes them so funny and so interesting

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.700
you'd rather listen to him than some
stick in the mud on Twitter. But, if we're

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.810
to go by the "no comedy can be offensive" guidelines, then not only would we lose

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.210
these incredible truths, but also the
great comedians that made it possible.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.970
So then, should we never be offended by anything? No. There are people and jokes

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.420
that are trying to spread more hate and despair rather than joy and change, and

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.660
we should call them out on it. But does that mean we should list the things we can

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.000
talk about and the things we can't talk
about?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.660
Of course not, that'd be against free
speech and limiting our growth.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:21.060
Remember when we were offended by Bart Simpson on TV? Or Madonna? Or any of these other people?

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:24.909
These were shocking icons that were
going to destroy our generation, and now

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.160
they're just commonplace, people barely even give a shit about them anymore, but

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.740
they evolved us to an area where this
could be commonplace and talk about

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.839
subjects that need to be talked about.

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:38.159
So then, how do we know who to get
offended by and who not to get offended by?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.220
Well sadly, the answer is not in any book and it's not online,

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.339
you just have to use common sense. I
think most of us get a pretty strong

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:51.600
feeling that Louis C.K. and Chris Rock
don't use their offensive comedy out of

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.830
mean-spiritedness, they use it to make
you laugh and bring out a strong point.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.300
Where comedians like Carlos Mencia and Andrew Dice Clay probably do use it

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.940
out of mean-spiritedness, aren't funny,
and that's why they didn't last very long.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.810
You just have to use your intuition. Does your gut say that deep down they're

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.370
really prejudiced or sexist or whatever.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.430
Will we always be right? Probably not. There's certainly people we have trusted before that have let us down.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.700
And there's even good comedians that cross the line because comedy is a tricky tightrope.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.510
But it's a tightrope that needs to be
walked, and we need to slip up sometimes,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.490
Every comedian does. It shows how far we could go, and how far we probably

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.630
shouldn't go. And it also shows that we can make wrong steps, but through the

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.779
positivity that made us likable to begin
with, we can get back on track.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.500
Some do this beautifully, others not so
much, but if the alternative is fear and judge everything,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.980
then comedy will be dead very quickly. So, still push the envelope of what's not

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.560
accepted and still fight for what's
worth fighting for.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.460
Just be sure that you're communicating it with the right intention. Because

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.600
the cost isn't worth the price. Of all
things the 90s show "Duck Man" might

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.660
have made the most brilliant comments about comedy ever,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.000
It's when a comedian comes in claiming he wants to do humor that doesn't offend anyone.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.550
"So this medical care giver of
indeterminate gender, because nurses can

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.450
be male or female, says to his or her
disabled or should I say differently

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:20.830
able patient..." You get the idea. But when he surprisingly becomes a big hit, our

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:26.530
hero comes along and says some of the most poignant words ever about the importance of comedy.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.730
They're actually so good, that I think it
only fits to end the editorial with it.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.820
"It's precisely when humor is offensive
that we need it most!

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.570
Comedy should provoke! It should blast through prejudices, challenge

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.250
preconceptions! Comedy should always leave you different than when it found you! Sure,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.470
humor can hurt, even alienate, but the
risk is better than the alternative.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.400
Demand to be challenged! To be offended! To be treated like thinking, reasoning

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.800
adults!" a duck voiced by Jason Alexander just said one of the most important things ever.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.700
This is why comedy is so great. I'm
the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

["The Review Must Go On" plays]

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.080
Hey guys! Doug Walker here, as I said in the past I'm going to end these videos with

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:33.980
a shout out to a different charity each
week, and this week we are doing the

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.899
"Ronald McDonald House Charities".

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.959
This is actually a charity we've worked
with a couple times in the past, and they

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.699
they do wonderful work in supplying people and children, especially who need help, who are

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:51.889
sick, and they do their best to give them a place where they can go and they

00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:55.430
can have help, and they can have
medical attention, and they can have

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:01.279
support, and they can have people who are so kind and so caring, and again we've

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:05.240
seen a lot of this firsthand and these
are just such kind,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.190
awesome, wonderful people, and as I said before, we've we've done work with them

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:15.350
before and we've done charity drives, and they are just a wonderful group that are

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.269
working for such a good, good cause just to give children as well as adults just

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:24.860
a place to feel home, a place to feel
safe, when they're going through all

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:30.880
sorts of really tough things and it's a
wonderful fantastic foundation to check out.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.779
You can check it out at the address
here, they do wonderful work they are so

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:41.930
awesome at what they do, and you know you can of course just give at the McDonalds,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.529
You know they always have the little box there, but it means so much more if you

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:49.370
go to the website, see what they do, and maybe open up your heart a little bit

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.730
more, because they definitely do very,
very good work.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.010
So definitely, if you get a chance, go
check them out.
