STEPHEN CARPENTER: So we have
heard from the introductions

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.820
and the backgrounds
of the people

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
sitting around the table,
their numerous interests

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.910
and numerous starting
points or ways

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.290
to connect to issues of water,
of community, of access.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.400
And so the range of
disciplinary interests

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.200
I find quite fascinating.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.120
And in terms of
the work that I've

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.310
been doing with
curriculum, it really

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.350
speaks to this notion
of interdisciplinarity,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.280
and some folks use the
term transdisciplinarity.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.490
But in some ways, when we're
interested in key issues,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.450
social issues, those
disciplines go away.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.490
It's about people.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.190
It's about something beyond
science or beyond art

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.810
or beyond whatever that
discipline might be.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.960
So our multiple
areas of expertise

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.420
really come into play
quite nicely here.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.636
This year, not only
do I have the pleasure

00:01:03.636 --> 00:01:06.100
and the good fortune to be
able to visit three times here

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580
at MIT as a visiting artist.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.590
But I'm also a visiting
artist and visiting

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.912
learner at a local
elementary school back home.

00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:16.370
And essentially,
people were asking

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.630
me, what are you doing at MIT?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.630
And what are you doing
at the elementary school?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.680
And I said, I'm
doing the same thing.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.620
Yeah.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.500
And the key is I'm going--

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.840
I want to know at the
elementary school,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.210
specifically, what they can
teach me about what I think

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.740
I know about what I'm doing.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.281
And that's what
we're doing here too.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.240
I'm eager to learn about
what you can teach me

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.042
about what I think I'm
doing, but also what

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:41.500
we can teach each other, what
we can learn from each other.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.460
Quite often, in some
educational spaces,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.090
administrators,
teachers, other folks

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.420
in various levels
of making decisions

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.380
forget, explicitly or
otherwise, that learners

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.700
bring knowledge with them to
every single learning context.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.790
So there's as much learning
going on in one direction

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.510
as there are in
multiple directions.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.650
So we all have valuable
information to share.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.606
So I'm eager to have
that conversation.

00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:11.980
So it's about the
filters, right?

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.660
It's about how these ceramic
water filters inspire

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.780
multiple curriculum
possibilities, not just

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.360
a curriculum or
instructional possibilities

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.250
for how do you make the filter,
and how do you use them?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.110
But there are other
ripples, pardon the pun.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.210
There are other ways that the
filters might inspire learning.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.420
For example, the
filters are designed

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.880
to sit inside a plastic
water receptacle

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.710
like the one you see here and
the one you saw in the video.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.160
But what if you asked artists
to create a ceramic receptacle

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.550
in their own style if you
gave them the specifications,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.980
and they created the
vessel in their own style?

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.200
And then you could
actually have an exhibition

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.950
of these receptacles.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.220
And that exhibition could
tour to different locations.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.100
And in doing so, you could
promote the exhibition.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.740
But you could also then talk
about the global water crisis.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.220
You could talk about lack
of adequate access to water.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.950
You could talk about the ways
that artists and other folks

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.650
are engaging in work to
respond to these issues.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.090
And so these exhibitions went
on for a number of years.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.797
My colleagues and I were talking
about reviving this practice.

00:03:27.797 --> 00:03:30.130
The idea is if someone purchases
one of the receptacles,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.890
that money essentially is
a donation back to a water

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.180
project.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.800
This is a vessel that I
created as part of that work.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.310
And it's inspired by
the sanitation workers'

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.090
strike in 1968, I Am a Man.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.880
And it relates in
many ways to found

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.300
object art, assemblage work from
some of the modernist artists.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.320
That's a top of a trophy I
found at a secondhand store

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.710
with a guy with a little fedora.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.690
It was perfect, right?

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.970
And I made these little signs.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.070
But the idea being, how
can the work of art itself

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.730
function as a way to
speak out and speak back

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.920
to social issues?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.290
Inspired by-- this one was
inspired by the water filters

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.498
and water filter receptacles.

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:21.779
So those links become entangled.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.910
But they also allow
for other trajectories

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.196
of thinking to happen.

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:27.570
Well, we can talk
about protests.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.130
We can talk about, well,
what is a basic human need?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.090
What is a human right?

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.737
What is privilege?

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:35.320
What do you need and
what do you want?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.780
Those are two different things.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.400
And I think those kinds of
conversations with students

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.390
are quite powerful.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.240
Who has access?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.910
Who sets up the limitations?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.200
What is necessary?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.424
Who takes action?

00:04:50.424 --> 00:04:51.840
These kinds of
questions, I think,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.620
are central to not only
a curricula within art

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.950
within education, but also
curricula within the various

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.770
disciplines that are
represented around this table.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.040
AUDIENCE: I'm
leaving on the 13th

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.760
to go to Puerto Rico to
a central mountain town,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.270
Cidra to bring
solar lamps, water

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.900
filters, and solar
panels, and solar panel

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:28.380
kits to a certain sector
of a barrio in Cidra.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.600
So the idea of a filter that
fits in a luggage, because I'm

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.180
limited to what I can personally
carry-- three 50-pound bags.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.640
And I'm paying $75 for
the third one, two, three,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.560
whatever, to do that, because
the bothersome part for me,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.390
this is not my background.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.710
I don't know.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.720
So we have rechargeable
batteries at home

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.790
that we've been very true to.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.500
We only use our
rechargeable batteries.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.080
That's as far as
that goes with us.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.700
And then the filter
water inside it.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.230
But water is basically good.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.370
But seeing all these
shipments of bottled water

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.290
and the requests for batteries
in an island and just the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.020
waste that that will create
and that no one thinks about.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.290
And how can at least in
one corner of the world--

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.220
or in this case, that island,
can we try to do something?

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.860
Because I talk to my family.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.890
And they go to a river, and
that's where they bathe.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.140
And that's where they
get water to clean.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.065
And clean and bathe.

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:33.690
That's it, because
they won't drink it,

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.330
because they don't know
if something died further

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.310
up the mountain.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.750
And they don't have
access to that.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.490
And then there's sun
everywhere, right?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.030
So just that immediate
thing, and it's

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.060
called Sector Bloquera, because
at the bottom of the hill,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.260
there's a huge
hardware type of like--

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.705
[SPEAKING SPANISH] just like
a lumber yard type of thing.

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:01.830
I was going to say sawdust.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.820
I'm like, oh, I can easily get--

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.750
--I can get tons of sawdust
from the [SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:21.210
But yeah, the access and how, in
a limited time frame can one--

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.830
as I look at that little
one right there just

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.220
to do that, because--

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.430
right.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.749
And that weighs nothing.

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:34.290
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
It weighs nothing.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.510
So I guess that's my of this.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.380
And then I see [INAUDIBLE],,
like [INAUDIBLE] Hartford.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.020
I'm from Hartford, so
he has Hartford roots.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.410
And Dred Scott, it's a
really exciting presentation.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.570
And he contextualizes
it really incredibly.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.880
But this really drew me
because of the immediacy

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.410
of what's happening out there.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.910
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:07.176
Well, what we're seeing in
Puerto Rico right now is just--

00:08:07.176 --> 00:08:09.050
for me, it's beyond
words, beyond adjectives.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.800
I can't-- it's indescribable.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.180
I spoke with a colleague, and
friend of mine a few days ago.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.820
His family is in Puerto Rico.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.405
And he says it's--

00:08:18.405 --> 00:08:20.780
he talked about-- before we
heard the reports in the news

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.750
about the gas issues
and the water issues,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.670
he told me about both of those.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.530
I also appreciate your comment
about sending water bottles

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.280
and batteries.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.654
And that just
creates more waste.

00:08:32.654 --> 00:08:33.320
It's helpful.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.659
But unless you think
about what happens

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.590
beyond the life of
that material, that's

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.929
being irresponsible
at some level, right?

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.260
So the rechargeable, the
recyclable, the renewable

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.090
is important.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.760
Yeah, these little filters
are made from the same mixture

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.690
as the large filters.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.100
They're just on a smaller scale.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.516
You see in the
back on that table.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:55.640
We made some mini
filters yesterday.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.290
We still have some
clay and sawdust.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.956
We can make some more
today if you want.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.240
They would need to be tested
to make sure that they

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.490
have the proper flow rate.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.380
But the other thing is
we have to make sure

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.710
that the water that is
there, that these filters

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.700
would filter out the bad stuff
in the water that's there, OK?

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.930
So I'm happy to make some
small filters, if you'd

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.480
like to take some with you.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.410
And you'd have to see.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.118
But you also need to
take some test kits.

00:09:26.118 --> 00:09:27.230
And I have some test kits.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.660
If I don't have them
here, I can get them.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.890
We can get them to you.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.410
But the idea is that you
need to test the water.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.200
It would be equally
irresponsible to say,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.336
oh, here's something to take
with you and it doesn't work.

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:41.210
So we have to figure
out what's in the water.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.000
And that's the basis for setting
up the filter facilities.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.460
But the idea of being
able to take some of these

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.200
in your backpack
and on your carry-on

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.050
and being able to distribute
it and have immediate response,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.050
that's a big deal.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.810
And so what you're
up to and the work

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.100
that you're going to be
doing is very important.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.140
But these things
are fragile too.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.630
So the packing
that it would take

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.370
would require taking
up some space as well.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.410
So there's always give
and take, push and pull.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.740
I was talking to
someone yesterday

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.380
about a very similar
part of the conversation.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.230
And one of things we started
to do when I was at Texas A&amp;M,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.490
before I moved to Penn
State, was revolving

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.896
around this very thing.

00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:28.145
And we thought, you know what.

00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:30.140
May I borrow your bottle
for just a second?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.380
This opening is about the
same size as larger bottles.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.800
I don't have one here,
so like a liter bottle.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.550
What if we turned it over,
and you cut it right here?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.345
Or you cut it just enough that
you could have a little flap,

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:45.700
all right?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.350
And then what if we took the
same material, and instead

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.320
of what some folks are
doing with making disks--

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.510
they look like hockey pucks that
you can put inside PVC piping--

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.315
what if we made little corks?

00:11:00.315 --> 00:11:01.690
They look like
little wine corks,

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.148
but it's made out
of this material.

00:11:03.148 --> 00:11:04.495
That could fit into this bottle.

00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:05.411
So you lift the hinge.

00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:06.760
You put the cork down there.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.450
And then we have our own
little portable receptacle.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.772
So it would take this
bottle that then gets

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:14.980
discarded that creates waste.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.007
Maybe it becomes a
repurposed individual?

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:21.340
Yeah, you're just creating cork.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.820
How many wine corks could
you take in your backpack?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.740
Hundreds, right?

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.860
So it's that notion of scale
and responsibility and access

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.670
and immediacy.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.450
Maybe after a couple
of weeks or maybe

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.580
in this case, unfortunately,
a couple of months,

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.182
there would not be that need.

00:11:40.182 --> 00:11:42.140
And you'd have ways to
deal with the recycling.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.900
But anyway, what
you're talking about

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.410
is a very important issue
and set of concerns.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:52.810
I first became familiar with
the term "creative disruption"

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.580
from David Darts, who
is an art educator,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.200
and his doctoral
dissertation and work looking

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.520
at the practice of culture
jamming, which grows out

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.350
of an entire practice
of responding

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.500
to capitalism and advertising.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.990
So David looked at this idea
of visual culture jamming,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.480
where you add--

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.950
instead of looking at
culture-specific broadly--

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.240
visual culture, more
specifically, and the way one

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.800
might look at the visual
components of a culture

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.690
differently through
some sort of what

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.880
he called creative disruption.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.200
Creative meaning,
his sense, coming

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.100
from an artistic or cultural
production perspective,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.380
but yeah, you can be disruptive.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.600
One might argue, you know, any
kind of disruption is creative.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.670
But certainly, the
creative in this sense

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.570
comes from a more generic
notion of artistic or cultural

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.070
production.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.500
AUDIENCE: How many decades
ago, approximately, for that?

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.708
STEPHEN CARPENTER: About one.

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:08.110
[LAUGHS] Well, no, yes, the
term is about 15, 20 years old,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.290
in the sense that I
understand it to be.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.320
AUDIENCE: It's been
a very popular term

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.609
in business management.

00:13:14.609 --> 00:13:16.150
Harvard Business
School, they've been

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.850
teaching courses in
creative destruction

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.190
as a strategy for
entrepreneurship.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.720
So if you want to take
on the big companies,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.840
you need to do something that
disrupts the whole logic of how

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.792
whatever that service or product
is is organized and presented.

00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:36.250
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Part of the work

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.550
that I do at my
current university

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.650
and previous universities
in art education

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:50.320
is to prepare teachers of
art, but even K-12 teachers.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.670
And so with that
preparation, there

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:58.000
are methods courses or
curriculum development courses

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.180
that essentially are structured
to respond in many ways

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.990
to very specific
skills or content.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.400
And that's all fine
and good, except, what

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.680
I find more interesting
are the questions

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.340
that emerge that can be
center points for curriculum.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.040
So instead of thinking
of curriculum development

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.740
and management, it's the idea
of theorizing curriculum.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:28.030
So spinning it around in
terms of the questioning, most

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:32.380
teacher preparation programs
that I'm familiar with,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.240
because there are
these standards

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.480
and points for
accreditation, students

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.360
must meet specific responses.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.800
And they're pretty
rigid, those curricula.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.210
But I think that there are
ways to play in and around.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.860
I've worked this
way for a while.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.620
Around, by still responding
to those expectations

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.750
for certification,
but at the same time,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.700
open it up so that
teachers become

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.790
knowledgeable and prepared
and have experience

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:10.596
to have an ongoing engagement
with learning and developing

00:15:10.596 --> 00:15:12.220
interesting and
exciting curricula that

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.610
responds to social practices.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.110
For

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:23.790
Example, the idea of focusing
on a theme or a concept

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:29.780
or a question, rather than on
a specific outcome or skill.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:36.150
Just making that shift is a big
challenge for a lot of teacher

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.490
preparation programs,
because what you're doing

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.192
is you're essentially saying,
the predetermined content

00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:42.900
that we have and the
predetermined skills

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.530
that we have is not all
there is to our discipline,

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.980
that there could be more to it.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.970
And it also suggests that it's
not really the idea of learning

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.330
that's important in education.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.750
It's about teaching content.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.480
So I like to turn also
the shift from teaching

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.670
to learning, to making the
project about learning.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.080
And so this is how I'm going
about it myself, Larry,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.930
working with undergrads
and grad students

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:13.240
to put questions at the
center of their curriculum.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.460
So it becomes an
inquiry-based approach.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.070
Or it becomes a
thematic approach.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.470
And often, it's inspired
by social issues.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.420
I can show you an
example or two,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.310
if you'd like, and
specifically to water.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:32.020
So one of the things that
I've enjoyed doing is using--

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.850
we've had a back and
forth, Larry, about access

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.800
to education in broad spaces.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.520
Online is one way
that that happens.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.390
So MindMeister is
a free application.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.060
And so my early work in
curriculum theorizing

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.760
and development looked
at spatial hypertext.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.960
So what if you took
a concept like--

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960
and more than a concept.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.410
I mean, water is a
broad idea, a big--

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.800
so what if we put water
at the center here?

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.910
And what I did was, I said,
look, at a group of students,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.130
we said, if we put water
at the center, what

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.720
are the ideas and questions and
concepts that emerge from just

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.980
us thinking about water?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.579
So there might be technology
concerns and issues

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.130
related to pollution.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:26.150
There are contemporary artists
who are looking at and thinking

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.195
about water.

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:33.260
There's information then at
the next level that relates

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.600
to our understandings of water.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.660
And so what you're seeing
here is an interconnected web

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.870
of information inspired by
the simple notion of water.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.289
What if you as a teacher--

00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:49.080
you can be a teacher,
you can be an artist,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.510
you can be whatever--

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.100
what does water
make you think of?

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.090
What questions emerge?

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.070
What do you know about water?

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.410
What are you curious
about about water?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.562
If you start curriculum
in that place--

00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:02.270
what do you know?

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.103
What don't you know?

00:18:03.103 --> 00:18:04.880
What would be
interesting to know?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.140
And you go off in these
various dimensions.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.110
And you start to
learn along the way.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.850
And you're not doing
it by yourself.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.160
You're learning with
a group of people.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.950
So everyone in class
has access to this web.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.420
Everyone in class,
over the series

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.878
of days that we're
working on this,

00:18:21.878 --> 00:18:24.830
can see how it continues
to be populated.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.740
And we all have access to
everybody else's information.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.200
This is a curriculum
right here of water

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.740
that could be navigated,
that could be--

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.020
and again, I'm not showing
you all of the details.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.046
But you could select
certain components of it,

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:42.170
highlight those components.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.250
There might be
some key questions.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.624
You might like
some of the things

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.015
that one person looked at.

00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:48.140
All right, so here are some
issues about pollution,

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.420
sanitation in civilizations.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.360
This piece also allows
us to put embedded video

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.600
and other content.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.850
So the idea would be, if
the preparation of teachers

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.300
or the work that teachers do
as they prepare to be certified

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.570
and licensed moves away, in
my view, from only focusing

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.140
on discipline content,
only on discipline skills,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.700
but privileges the questioning
and the nurturing of inquiry

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.952
and learning, I
think what we have is

00:19:17.952 --> 00:19:19.285
we have a different sensibility.

00:19:19.285 --> 00:19:21.070
You have teachers
who aren't limited

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.410
by their own disciplines
and are seeking ways

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.820
to make those connections.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.790
And in doing that,
a curriculum that

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.040
comes from this
mode of development

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.310
can then respond to any state
or local standards of learning,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.520
any national
curriculum concerns.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.800
The example I want to show you--

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.550
you ever been to an
elementary art exhibit,

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.990
and you see all of the
images look very similar?

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.860
You see all the paintings
and the drawings, whatever.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.810
Rarely, do we see art criticism.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.910
Rarely, do you see
young children's art

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.955
historical papers on display.

00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.330
It happens every
once in a while.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.040
This is a water filter display
at the Chesterfield County

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.180
Exhibition.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.560
So this is just one teacher.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.610
Sean Collins did this.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.880
And so he used the water filters
as part of his curriculum

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.420
but also as part of
the art exhibition.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.790
He got comments from
teachers, like, wow, what?

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.572
How does this-- art?

00:20:14.572 --> 00:20:16.030
This is part of
your art curricula?

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.149
Well, yeah, why not?

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.190
This is what we're doing.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.890
And he linked it to Greek vases.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.830
And he linked it to
expressionist painting.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.360
He linked it to all sorts
of other components.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.300
But by making the art curriculum
or the space in which an artist

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.960
might think inclusive of
appropriate technology

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.707
and social issues and
social responsibility,

00:20:37.707 --> 00:20:39.040
that's a disruption right there.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.330
So can elementary kids do it?

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.800
Absolutely, they can.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.440
This is a page from
the Reservoir Studio,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.510
including names of
the art teachers

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.690
who have agreed to work
with me or found interest

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.590
or that have invited me to
do water filter performances

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.810
but also work on
curricula with them.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.990
And this list keeps growing.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.940
I haven't updated it yet.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.065
But I have several others
who have been interested.

00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:03.181
Here's a person who came to a
curriculum conference, Denise

00:21:03.181 --> 00:21:03.680
Gordon.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.120
She was a science
educator in Texas.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.410
She came to this curriculum
and pedagogy conference.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.930
And instead of
presenting a paper

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.500
on the water filters, my
colleague, my mentor Richard

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.280
Wukich and I, we set up a water
filter production facility.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.950
And we made filters as our
conference presentation.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.240
And so people coming in
expecting to see a paper

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.240
presented, they helped
me sift sawdust.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.195
And [CHUCKLES] we
made the filters.

00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:32.890
The reason I'm telling you that
is because Denise Gordon showed

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.039
up to that presentation.

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.580
And she said, I am
a science teacher,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.800
but I think in these
interdisciplinary ways.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.180
And I like these experiential,
hands-on approaches.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.270
And so I sent her four
mini-filters at her request,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.390
two that had silver embedded
in them and two that did not.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.110
And her advanced
science students,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.500
middle school students, did
tests on those water filters.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.720
They tested the water
from two local sources.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.690
They did research on the
production of the filters.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.160
And they set up--

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.780
they found other
commercial filters,

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.430
and they ran the results.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.770
And they found that
these little filters

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.266
worked as well or better than
those commercial filters on two

00:22:12.266 --> 00:22:13.390
different sources of water.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.030
One was, I think,
the local river.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.820
And the other was some
other sewage space.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.640
But my point is that she
empowered her students

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.207
to take control and
to lead the inquiry.

00:22:25.207 --> 00:22:26.290
And this is middle school.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.150
So can middle school
students think in these ways

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.775
and consider their place in the
world and their responsibility?

00:22:30.775 --> 00:22:31.420
Absolutely.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.812
And again, these are just
two of many possible ways

00:22:34.812 --> 00:22:35.770
that this might happen.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.640
But just responding
specifically to that question.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.700
AUDIENCE: How do we
place for the disruptive

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.030
way of doing things
and incremental way

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.530
of doing that thing?

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.920
Probably what is existing,
taking it ahead and improving

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.000
on it may be quite incremented
and disruptive where

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.700
you put a full stop and
start with something new.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.770
In fact, ceramic
filter itself, I

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.540
don't know whether to
call it disruptive,

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.370
because a filter existed.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.700
And it was modified
in some ways.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.150
So I'm really confused
about these definitions

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.990
about disruptive, incremental.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.280
What is it?

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.410
And how do you go
back, especially

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.980
in terms of disasters,
where I think the need is

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.672
to go back to basics?

00:23:19.672 --> 00:23:21.880
STEPHEN CARPENTER: For me,
disruption is incremental.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.520
It's a process.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.810
It's a verb in my thinking.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.432
Certainly one can disrupt
with a specific action.

00:23:29.432 --> 00:23:31.640
And it seems like it's only
happening in that moment.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.980
But we can think more broadly
that once that moment happens,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.050
there are continuing
echoes from that.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.160
So I think it's also
site-specific too,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.910
the degree of incremental change
or disruption that happens.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:46.840
But I don't--

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.780
I'm not thinking about
disruption, necessarily,

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.850
as one specific moment.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:57.910
I think of it in a longer term,
in a moving, time-based way.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.410
So that's one part
of your question.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.493
I think the second part
had to do with the filters

00:24:01.493 --> 00:24:03.940
and seeing them as disruptive.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.270
And certainly, for folks who
didn't have adequate access

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.960
to clean water and now
they might have access,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.900
the filters have disrupted
that previous narrative

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.150
of inaccessibility,
and have disrupted

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.340
a longstanding-- a
generational experience

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:26.290
with being sick
and having disease.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:32.280
So it's disrupting that health
issue and that human issue.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.380
And so there's that.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.160
And then going back
to basic, absolutely.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.890
I mean, you do what
you need to do.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.580
And certainly, the
water's coming down.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.860
Let's get some plastic
and collect the water.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.450
I mean, that seems like the
most appropriate technology

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.480
that we've talked about today.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.450
I think your examples
are right on.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.644
And I hope it clarified
a little bit how

00:24:55.644 --> 00:24:57.560
I'm thinking about
disruption, not as an idea.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.050
I didn't clarify-- disruption
for me is not a moment.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.020
But it's an ongoing--

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.145
AUDIENCE: It's a continuum.

00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:04.280
STEPHEN CARPENTER: It's
a continuum, absolutely.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:04.780
Yeah.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.544
And it's variable.

00:25:05.544 --> 00:25:06.710
AUDIENCE: It was my job too.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.360
I mean, it's a job
for us to do that.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.590
So even though it's
disruptive or not disruptive,

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.617
my job is to provide clean
water to people out there.

00:25:15.617 --> 00:25:16.700
And that's what I'm doing.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.280
[CHUCKLES] So whether
it is disruptive or not,

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.360
it's that simple.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.901
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
Well, yeah, it is.

00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:24.470
Yeah, yeah, and I
think sometimes I

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.895
like to be a bit more dramatic,
maybe, than necessary.

00:25:26.895 --> 00:25:28.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.480
And to think more
broadly or differently,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.810
folks didn't have the water.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.500
And you allow water
to be available.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.749
You disrupted their
lack of access, so--

00:25:38.749 --> 00:25:40.040
AUDIENCE: I think I did my job.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.540
[CHUCKLES]

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.370
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
You did your job.
