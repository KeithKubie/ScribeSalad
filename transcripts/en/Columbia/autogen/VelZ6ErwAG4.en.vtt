memory of course and the reason it's a
 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.560
memory of course and the reason it's a
memory is that I somehow had a epiphany

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570
memory is that I somehow had a epiphany
 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.760
memory is that I somehow had a epiphany
at that moment and I recognize that this

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770
at that moment and I recognize that this
 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:37.620
at that moment and I recognize that this

smack the hammer die with the hammer and
 

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.880
smack the hammer die with the hammer and
this caused us in silver and copper and

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:53.890
this caused us in silver and copper and
 

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.730
this caused us in silver and copper and
gold are comparatively soft the image

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:56.740
gold are comparatively soft the image
 

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:01.160
gold are comparatively soft the image
that is on the the anvil die becomes

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:01.170
that is on the the anvil die becomes
 

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.950
that is on the the anvil die becomes
hammered into the one side of the coin

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960
hammered into the one side of the coin
 

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.310
hammered into the one side of the coin
and that that is on the hammer die gets

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:08.320
and that that is on the hammer die gets
 

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.560
and that that is on the hammer die gets
on to the other side of the coin and so

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:10.570
on to the other side of the coin and so
 

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.210
on to the other side of the coin and so
then you have a finished coin you move

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:12.220
then you have a finished coin you move
 

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.960
then you have a finished coin you move
it aside and you put another blank in

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:15.970
it aside and you put another blank in
 

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:20.150
it aside and you put another blank in
there and you hammer another coin mm-hmm

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160
there and you hammer another coin mm-hmm
 

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.960
there and you hammer another coin mm-hmm
the width of what of the coin of the

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:24.970
the width of what of the coin of the
 

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.580
the width of what of the coin of the
dies it's the same as the width of the

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:26.590
dies it's the same as the width of the
 

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.280
dies it's the same as the width of the
coin

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:28.290
coin
 

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:31.920

yeah they're comparable II a small

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:31.930
yeah they're comparable II a small
 

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.360
yeah they're comparable II a small
that's the reason you have the animal

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:33.370
that's the reason you have the animal
 

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.920
that's the reason you have the animal
die is set in much larger base but it's

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:37.930
die is set in much larger base but it's
 

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.250
die is set in much larger base but it's
how big the coin is will be the

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:41.260
how big the coin is will be the
 

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.870
how big the coin is will be the
determinant of how substantial the die

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880
determinant of how substantial the die
 

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:53.520
determinant of how substantial the die
is and this is a this is known as you

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:53.530
is and this is a this is known as you
 

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.200

know stamping a coin that's what's done

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:55.210
know stamping a coin that's what's done
 

00:42:55.210 --> 00:43:01.040
know stamping a coin that's what's done
is an event and it has certain technical

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.050
is an event and it has certain technical
 

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:06.600
is an event and it has certain technical
qualities for example the orientation of

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:06.610
qualities for example the orientation of
 

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.120
qualities for example the orientation of
the hammer die to the animal to the

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:09.130
the hammer die to the animal to the
 

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.680
the hammer die to the animal to the
anvil die you know

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:10.690
anvil die you know
 

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.840
anvil die you know
Kling catalog you might see an arrow I

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:12.850
Kling catalog you might see an arrow I
 

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.340
Kling catalog you might see an arrow I
will say they're pointed in the same

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.350
will say they're pointed in the same
 

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.930
will say they're pointed in the same
direction or they're pointed in opposite

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:15.940
direction or they're pointed in opposite
 

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.590
direction or they're pointed in opposite
directions or they're pointed crosswise

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:18.600
directions or they're pointed crosswise
 

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:22.310
directions or they're pointed crosswise
because in some cases they're hinged and

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:22.320
because in some cases they're hinged and
 

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.010
because in some cases they're hinged and
therefore you get a constant thing it's

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:26.020
therefore you get a constant thing it's
 

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.340
therefore you get a constant thing it's
also well established that the hammer

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:29.350
also well established that the hammer
 

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.700
also well established that the hammer
die wears out before the anvil die

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:31.710
die wears out before the anvil die
 

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.990
die wears out before the anvil die
because it's getting more of the force

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000
because it's getting more of the force
 

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.570
because it's getting more of the force
from the hammer and therefore if you

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:36.580
from the hammer and therefore if you
 

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.120
from the hammer and therefore if you
have a crack that inevitably cracks

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:39.130
have a crack that inevitably cracks
 

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:41.790
have a crack that inevitably cracks
appear the crack appears first and the

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800
appear the crack appears first and the
 

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.610
appear the crack appears first and the
hammer die and therefore you wear out

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:44.620
hammer die and therefore you wear out
 

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.950
hammer die and therefore you wear out
the hammer die before you wear out the

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960
the hammer die before you wear out the
 

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.510
the hammer die before you wear out the
animal die so then you put in a new

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520
animal die so then you put in a new
 

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.830
animal die so then you put in a new
hammer die and then you say okay well

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:52.840
hammer die and then you say okay well
 

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.810
hammer die and then you say okay well
here's a coin that has a anvil die and a

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:57.820
here's a coin that has a anvil die and a
 

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.590
here's a coin that has a anvil die and a
new hammer die and you you put hundreds

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:01.600
new hammer die and you you put hundreds
 

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.050
new hammer die and you you put hundreds
of coins in a row and you can say oh now

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.060
of coins in a row and you can say oh now
 

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.360
of coins in a row and you can say oh now
we have known as die links and therefore

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:06.370
we have known as die links and therefore
 

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.760
we have known as die links and therefore
we can give a chronological series by

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:08.770
we can give a chronological series by
 

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.260
we can give a chronological series by
the replacement of dies the very

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.270
the replacement of dies the very
 

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:14.880
the replacement of dies the very
sophisticated stuff but of course you

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:14.890
sophisticated stuff but of course you
 

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.530
sophisticated stuff but of course you
may have to hit hit it twice with a

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:16.540
may have to hit hit it twice with a
 

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.290
may have to hit hit it twice with a
hammer because you miss the first time

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:19.300
hammer because you miss the first time
 

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.720
hammer because you miss the first time
and then you get double struck coins or

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:21.730
and then you get double struck coins or
 

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:26.100
and then you get double struck coins or
all sorts of weirdnesses show up in this

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:26.110
all sorts of weirdnesses show up in this
 

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.910
all sorts of weirdnesses show up in this
in this process but if you know what's

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920
in this process but if you know what's
 

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.300
in this process but if you know what's
going on

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:33.310
 
 

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:38.070
 
you can tell a lot at one point in my

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:38.080
you can tell a lot at one point in my
 

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.520
you can tell a lot at one point in my
career I got a call from the head of the

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:41.530
career I got a call from the head of the
 

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.400
career I got a call from the head of the
the chief Islamic numismatist of the

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:44.410
the chief Islamic numismatist of the
 

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:48.540
the chief Islamic numismatist of the
American Numismatic Society and he said

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:48.550
American Numismatic Society and he said
 

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.950
American Numismatic Society and he said
that a horde had been found and it had

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:52.960
that a horde had been found and it had
 

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.250
that a horde had been found and it had
gotten onto the coin market had been

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:56.260
gotten onto the coin market had been
 

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.890
gotten onto the coin market had been
found in Iran and half the hoard was in

00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:58.900
found in Iran and half the hoard was in
 

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.300
found in Iran and half the hoard was in
London and the other half was in New

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:00.310
London and the other half was in New
 

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.820
London and the other half was in New
York and it would soon be dispersed

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:02.830
York and it would soon be dispersed
 

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.240
York and it would soon be dispersed
among coin collectors by the merchant

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:06.250
among coin collectors by the merchant
 

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:09.120
among coin collectors by the merchant
who had the hoard and he wanted to have

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:09.130
who had the hoard and he wanted to have
 

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.780
who had the hoard and he wanted to have
a hoard recorded before it got was first

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:12.790
a hoard recorded before it got was first
 

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:14.790
a hoard recorded before it got was first
but he didn't have time to do as he

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800
but he didn't have time to do as he
 

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.110
but he didn't have time to do as he
asked me if I come to New York and

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:16.120
asked me if I come to New York and
 

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.240
asked me if I come to New York and
record the hoard and so I came down and

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:21.250
record the hoard and so I came down and
 

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.640
record the hoard and so I came down and
for the first time and only time I had a

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:23.650
for the first time and only time I had a
 

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:28.560
for the first time and only time I had a
stack of gold coins you know they're fun

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:28.570
stack of gold coins you know they're fun
 

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.380
stack of gold coins you know they're fun
to play with you know you can put in

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:31.390
to play with you know you can put in
 

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.990
to play with you know you can put in
your nose your ear you can just sort of

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000
your nose your ear you can just sort of
 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.420
your nose your ear you can just sort of
rub them throw them up and down all

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:36.430
rub them throw them up and down all
 

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.560
rub them throw them up and down all
those things you'll want to do with gold

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:39.570
those things you'll want to do with gold
 

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:44.250
those things you'll want to do with gold
but as I as I started recording the the

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:44.260
but as I as I started recording the the
 

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.360
but as I as I started recording the the
hoard it quickly became apparent that

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:47.370
hoard it quickly became apparent that
 

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.630
hoard it quickly became apparent that
all of the coins were from the same dyes

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640
all of the coins were from the same dyes
 

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.450
all of the coins were from the same dyes
and I could lay them out in order at

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:54.460
and I could lay them out in order at
 

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.550
and I could lay them out in order at
which they were struck because there was

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560
which they were struck because there was
 

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.540
which they were struck because there was
a crack and the crack grew and I could

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:00.550
a crack and the crack grew and I could
 

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:04.140
a crack and the crack grew and I could
see the crack grow over a sequence of

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.150
see the crack grow over a sequence of
 

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:08.210
see the crack grow over a sequence of
about 70 dinars here's a gold dinars and

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220
about 70 dinars here's a gold dinars and
 

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.700
about 70 dinars here's a gold dinars and
and so then you think why would you ever

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:11.710
and so then you think why would you ever
 

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.090
and so then you think why would you ever
have 70 Goldie dinars that are

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:15.100
have 70 Goldie dinars that are
 

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.520
have 70 Goldie dinars that are
sequential issues from the same dies

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:19.530
sequential issues from the same dies
 

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.840
sequential issues from the same dies
particularly when they are from a ruler

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:21.850
particularly when they are from a ruler
 

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.820
particularly when they are from a ruler
who had previously been known to have

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:23.830
who had previously been known to have
 

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.970
who had previously been known to have
only two extant coins or two or three a

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:26.980
only two extant coins or two or three a
 

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.490
only two extant coins or two or three a
virtually unknown ruler from a

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:29.500
virtually unknown ruler from a
 

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.450
virtually unknown ruler from a
numismatic point of view and it suddenly

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:33.460
numismatic point of view and it suddenly
 

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.670
numismatic point of view and it suddenly
became obvious that this was this was a

00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920
characters were about a millimeter high
 

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:04.730

was able to read about the first fifty

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:06.630
was able to read about the first fifty
 

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.809
was able to read about the first fifty
by finding Quranic passages that were

00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819
by finding Quranic passages that were
 

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:12.260
by finding Quranic passages that were
there and the style was that of

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:12.270
there and the style was that of
 

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:15.770
there and the style was that of
numismatic kufan which is a very very

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780
numismatic kufan which is a very very
 

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.680
numismatic kufan which is a very very
particular style of writing in Arabic

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:18.690
particular style of writing in Arabic
 

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:24.319
particular style of writing in Arabic
and it also became apparent that that

00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:24.329
and it also became apparent that that
 

00:58:24.329 --> 00:58:29.180
and it also became apparent that that
these prints were not made exclusively

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:29.190
these prints were not made exclusively
 

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.460
these prints were not made exclusively
once I found other examples were not

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:31.470
once I found other examples were not
 

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:35.030
once I found other examples were not
made exclusively on wood but were cast

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040
made exclusively on wood but were cast
 

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.870
made exclusively on wood but were cast
metal and so the process appears to have

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880
metal and so the process appears to have
 

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.829
metal and so the process appears to have
been something from Mesopotamia probably

00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839
been something from Mesopotamia probably
 

00:58:42.839 --> 00:58:49.089
been something from Mesopotamia probably
where people would take a tablet of clay

00:58:49.089 --> 00:58:49.099
where people would take a tablet of clay
 

00:58:49.099 --> 00:58:52.030
where people would take a tablet of clay
of course they'd had tablets of clay for

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.040
of course they'd had tablets of clay for
 

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.160
of course they'd had tablets of clay for
you know thousands of years and they

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:55.170
you know thousands of years and they
 

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.829
you know thousands of years and they
would you know write a met and write

00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839
would you know write a met and write
 

00:58:57.839 --> 00:59:00.349
would you know write a met and write
something in the clay then they would

00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359
something in the clay then they would
 

00:59:00.359 --> 00:59:03.230
something in the clay then they would
build up borders around the text and

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240
build up borders around the text and
 

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.650
build up borders around the text and
pour molten tin over the whole thing

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660
pour molten tin over the whole thing
 

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.470
pour molten tin over the whole thing
then when the tin cooled they take the

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480
then when the tin cooled they take the
 

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.839
then when the tin cooled they take the
tin plate off and used that to print

00:59:11.839 --> 00:59:11.849
tin plate off and used that to print
 

00:59:11.849 --> 00:59:13.819
tin plate off and used that to print
from because the plate would have

00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:13.829
from because the plate would have
 

00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:15.079
from because the plate would have
reversed the letters than when they

00:59:15.079 --> 00:59:15.089
reversed the letters than when they
 

00:59:15.089 --> 00:59:19.609
reversed the letters than when they
printed it becomes it becomes correct

00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619
printed it becomes it becomes correct
 

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:24.680
printed it becomes it becomes correct
again and and I found a poetic reference

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:24.690
again and and I found a poetic reference
 

00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:28.930
again and and I found a poetic reference
to two metal plates of of this sort and

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:28.940
to two metal plates of of this sort and
 

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.880
to two metal plates of of this sort and
so then there was the question of

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:31.890
so then there was the question of
 

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.940
so then there was the question of
the earliest prints in the Muslim world

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:34.950
the earliest prints in the Muslim world
 

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:37.610
the earliest prints in the Muslim world
are almost simultaneous with the

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:37.620
are almost simultaneous with the
 

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:42.890
are almost simultaneous with the
earliest prints in China and that that

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900
earliest prints in China and that that
 

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:50.930
earliest prints in China and that that
was a puzzlement did was this a Chinese

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940
was a puzzlement did was this a Chinese
 

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:56.230

simultaneous invention was strengthened

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.220
simultaneous invention was strengthened
 

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.060
simultaneous invention was strengthened
by the fact that all of the known prints

so the paper probably comes from China
