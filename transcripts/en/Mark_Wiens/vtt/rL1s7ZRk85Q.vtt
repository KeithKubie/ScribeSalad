00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.730
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.150
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Trincomalee,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.850
on the east coast of Sri Lanka.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.388
And Sri Lanka is known for
having some of the best crabs,

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:10.170
mud crabs, in the entire world.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.560
And Trincomalee, it's full of bays,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.660
there's inlets of water.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.780
There's lagoons, which
is the perfect place.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.300
This is one of the best places
in Sri Lanka to eat crab.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.450
So we're gonna get some mud crabs,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.010
we're going to go back to a family home,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250
they're going to cook a Sri
Lankan Tamil meal for us.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.250
It's gonna be incredible food.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.993
I can't wait for lunch today.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.703
How are you?

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:32.034
- Very fine.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.617
(upbeat music)

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.650
(bird calling)

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.210
- [Woman] There's a step there, (mumbles).

00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:48.570
- [Mark] Woah, this is
more like a inlet of water,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.280
kind of forming into a
lagoon from the ocean.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.340
We're very close to the ocean
on a wooden, rickety dock.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.070
You want to be a little bit
careful stepping on this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.170
so you don't bottom out!

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.782
But Uncle here has--
(child squealing)

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:05.687
Oh, where did Micah-- (laughs) Thank you!

00:01:07.932 --> 00:01:09.060
(laughing)

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.370
- Hello, so nice to see
another random Uncle

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.630
carrying Micah down the dock.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.490
This is a Sri Lankan,
Trincomalee crab coast,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.560
so they have some baskets of crabs,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240
which I think are still in the water

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090
that we're going to check out here

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.133
and enquire about the lunch opportunities.

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:31.490
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.072
- [Woman] Oooh.

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:34.584
- [Mark] Wow!

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:38.196
- [Woman] Wow, (speaking
in foreign language).

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.363
- [Mark] Nice.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.410
Especially the claws are
really big, blue in color.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.320
And then the fishermen are
telling us that there are cages

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.020
that they have throughout this kinda bay,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.870
inlet of water, lagoon.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.160
But this is really prime
conditions for Sri Lankan crabs.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.120
This is crab country.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.560
This is where you will
find some of the best crabs

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.803
in all of Sri Lanka.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:05.287
(fishermen speaking foreign language)

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.470
(relaxing music)

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.720
- We're following Uncle back to his house

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.880
where he's gonna wrap up the crabs

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.520
and then we're going to
take them to then go cook

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730
Sri Lankan Tamil food out of those crab--

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.110
With those crabs, with those products.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.800
Crabs are so beautiful, they're
so, like, healthy-looking.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.830
And then this entire
community, the people,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.130
the village here, most of
them would be crab farmers,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.500
crab raisers, so they get the
crabs when they're smaller,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.510
then they raise them in the
cages to grow them bigger.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.403
So this is like an entire
crab coast community.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.538
(relaxing music)

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:50.538
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.059
- [Man] (speaking in foreign language).

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.809
(relaxing music)

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:01.870
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language).

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.640
- [Mark] He puts a foot on, a
toe onto the top of the head

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.760
and then kind of like wraps
it, the body and the claws.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.803
And then that just secures the claws.

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:17.393
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.367
- [Man] (speaking in foreign language).

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.099
(upbeat music)

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.649
- [Mark] Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.086
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.669
(upbeat music)

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.463
- [Mark] Alright.

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:35.046
(upbeat music)

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.363
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:47.350
In here.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.570
Made it to the family home,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.870
in towards the city of Trincomalee,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.480
and I love this house,
it's so brightly-colored.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.010
There's orange, there's turquoise,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.590
there's yellow painted on the walls.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.360
And then the aunties
are going to get started

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.710
cooking right now.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.210
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.970
- She's just washing
them, cleaning them up.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.770
Doing it very quickly, lots
of experience, you can tell.

00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:24.869
- [Woman] (speaking in foreign language).

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.493
- [Mark] This is for the crab curry?

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:31.975
- [Woman] Yes, yes.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:33.180
- [Woman] They've already
cooked everything else.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.357
- [Mark] Oh, they've cooked
everything else, okay.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.040
- [Woman] Yeah, because it's 2.30.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.138
- [Mark] Yeah, we came kinda late.

00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:38.388
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.680
- All the rest of the dishes
that they've prepared--

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.300
they've already prepared,
they've already cooked

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.360
because we got here kind of late

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.850
and it's kind of past lunch time

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.560
but she's just gonna cook up the crab

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.230
and then all the dishes
will be ready for lunch

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.640
and I'm getting very, very hungry.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.680
Like, she just tossed in some
onions to a little bit of oil.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.363
That's gonna be the base
for beginning the crab.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.840
- [Mark] Right off the floor.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.943
Fennel.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.980
Caraway.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.813
There's fennel in there.

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:16.849
- [Woman] Yes.

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.193
Fennel, fenugreek, cumin.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.840
- The kitchen space situation a little--

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.038
oh, there's a chimney
that goes all the way up

00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:28.040
there to the roof.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.020
Okay, but it's a little bit tight in here,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.950
the stove is kinda tucked away.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.350
We're all kinda huddled into
this little chimney space,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.420
but she just tossed--

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.820
oh, those onions are caramelizing,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.490
but she just tossed in a
spice mixture of-- oh, wait.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.260
Of caraway.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.530
- [Woman] So, that is salt, and that is--

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.380
they are spices.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.213
- [Mark] Curry powder.

00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:50.506
- [Woman] Curry powder from this area.

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:51.340
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.472
- [Woman] Yeah, so it's
like a Trinco curry powder.

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:55.530
The curry powder, the area, like that.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.572
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:05:56.572 --> 00:05:57.739
- [Woman] Mmm.

00:06:02.021 --> 00:06:03.308
The magic powder.

00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:04.890
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.277
First she caramelized some onions,

00:06:07.277 --> 00:06:09.530
and then she gathered a handful of spices.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.400
There was fenugreek, there was fennel,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.680
cumin and mustard seed.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.860
She tossed them in the oil,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.840
stir-fried it around and around.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.440
That's a unique blend of spices,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.210
and then on the crab
she actually tossed in

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.210
like a whole handful, a whole
spoon of a local curry powder

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.130
and then some salt.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.020
Some, like, sea salt on there, too.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.973
Sprinkled it on.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.060
The Moringa leaves are
gonna go in the curry,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.940
and also the pounded green
chili that she pounded.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.870
That's gonna go, later.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.830
As for now, the crab is just gonna boil,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.130
simmer away in that curry
powder blend of spices

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.256
that she added.

00:06:47.256 --> 00:06:49.839
(upbeat music)

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.260
And then she just tossed in
the crushed green chilies

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.920
and the Moringa leaves, into the broth

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.660
that has been created,
that crab juice broth.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.930
And just kinda tuck that away,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.250
that's gonna infuse into
the gravy, into the sauce

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.172
and then, like, steam up into the crab.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:20.755
(upbeat music)

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.993
- Right.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.630
- Brought out all the food,
they brought the table out

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.650
into the patio so that
there's better light,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.070
if we're gonna eat outside,
the air is quite nice.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.903
It's not too hot.

00:07:40.903 --> 00:07:42.620
All the dishes, they're gonna serve us

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.360
the traditional style, which
would be on a banana leaf

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.085
as the plate, so that you--

00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:49.650
That's just the best way to mix and match,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.690
mix the rice up with
the different curries.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.370
You can smell the aroma,
the crab is ready.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.814
It smells so good.

00:07:55.814 --> 00:07:57.024
(upbeat music)

00:07:57.024 --> 00:08:01.755
(people speaking foreign language)

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:04.338
(upbeat music)

00:08:09.817 --> 00:08:10.958
- [Mark] That one is fish.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.136
(upbeat music)

00:08:14.136 --> 00:08:15.061
- [Woman] Here's some appalam.

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.990
(man speaking foreign language)

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.040
- [Woman] Ah, okay this
is their meat again.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.898
- [Man] Oh, wonderful meat.

00:08:20.898 --> 00:08:22.425
- [Mark] Wonderful.

00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:25.534
(people speaking foreign language)

00:08:25.534 --> 00:08:28.117
(upbeat music)

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.490
- We are sitting down, we've got the rice,

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.550
we've got all-- you put all the varieties

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.270
of different dishes, the
curries, the vegetables

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.980
all surrounding your rice.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.690
The aunties are a little bit shy.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.894
Oh, they're gonna come, okay.

00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:46.744
(laughing)

00:08:46.744 --> 00:08:49.327
Yeah (laughs).

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.640
- [Mark] Got some of the crab?

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.680
I think they'll join us.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.847
Think they'll join us.

00:08:53.847 --> 00:08:54.680
Right, right.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.470
Oh, and there's also
the rasam, which is the,

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.840
it's like herbal soup,
but we'll probably--

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.673
what you put on the rice.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:01.550
I'll probably just taste this first,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.560
and then add some of
that rasam to the rice.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.393
Or should I add it right now?

00:09:05.393 --> 00:09:07.270
- [Woman] No, you can
eat first and then add.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.103
- Eat first and then add,

00:09:08.103 --> 00:09:08.936
keep adding some rasam?

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:09.769
Okay.

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:10.840
Okay, I will begin with this,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.420
which is like, I think it's--

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.366
is it like green onion,
spring onions or leek?

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:16.303
Oh, the rasam, thank you.

00:09:16.303 --> 00:09:17.711
- [Man] Not a problem.

00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:18.890
- [Woman] How you liking it?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.823
- [Mark] Really mix it in with the rice.

00:09:22.989 --> 00:09:25.950
Mmm, oh that's only my first, like, bite

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.030
and that's not even the main dish

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.560
and it's incredible.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.010
Like, I think they're
leek but sliced very fine

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.850
so you got that crunch.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.150
Is that shredded coconut in there?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.983
- [Woman] Yes, that's shredded coconut.

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:35.250
- Oh man, that's what makes it.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.050
It's like salty, shredded coconut

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.343
with that crispness of leek.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.180
Wow, that is amazing, that is amazing.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.013
Thank you.

00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:44.846
- You're very welcome.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.600
- What is your favorite dish?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.013
- Favorite, mas.

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:52.598
- [Woman] Mas.
- Oh, the deer?

00:09:52.598 --> 00:09:53.431
- [Woman] Yes.
- Yes.

00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.264
- The deer, okay.

00:09:54.264 --> 00:09:56.590
Oh yeah, another surprise
dish that we got is deer.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.690
It was a surprise dish, we had no idea

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.780
they were gonna cook some deer.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.013
But that looks beautiful,
that's what we'll try next.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.933
Oh yeah.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.892
Oh, he's right about the deer.

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:09.725
Mmm.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:14.280
The texture is very similar to beef,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.160
but then the spices
they're using, the onions.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.630
The, like, caramelized
down onions in there.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.270
The chili in there, the curry leaves.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.103
It's awesome.

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:25.000
And Roseana dished me a bowl of the rasam,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.710
which is the soup.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.810
Which I will add some of that to the rice.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.260
(children shouting)

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.740
- Mix in with some of the dahl,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.098
mix in with some of the vegetable.

00:10:36.098 --> 00:10:38.681
(upbeat music)

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.840
Oh wow.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.330
I don't know what the
flavor's coming from this,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.690
if it's the dahl or the--

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.523
Wait, is that even dahl?

00:10:50.523 --> 00:10:51.987
It tastes almost like pumpkin.

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:52.820
- [Woman] It's pumpkin.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.950
- Oh, it is pumpkin.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.100
I totally was mistaken, that's my mistake.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.830
That is not dahl, that is pumpkin.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.820
And it does, yeah, that's like sweet,

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.460
like mushy in the best kind of way.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.850
It's wonderful.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.890
We don't even have dahl, right?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.848
- [Woman] No.

00:11:06.848 --> 00:11:08.656
- This is a fish curry.

00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:12.823
(man talking in foreign language)

00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:18.060
Mmm, it has like a very
nice cinammon-y taste to it,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.063
and I'll follow that with
one of the fried chilies.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.135
Oh yeah, that's almost
like a chili, like, jerky.

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:27.772
It's like, maybe dried and fried,

00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:28.963
and there's like--

00:11:28.963 --> 00:11:30.850
Woah, the flavor's not
spicy, but it's like

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.480
so smoky flavorful.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.040
And then finally, for that crab.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.490
I'm gonna re-juice it, and you can see

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.770
how that juice, it's just--

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.603
It's just pure.

00:11:38.603 --> 00:11:40.450
It's just like that-- their spice blend,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.060
their curry blend, the
Moringa leaves in there.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.363
That looks incredible crab,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.530
and this is the fresh crab that we got--

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.000
Oh, it's just blooming.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.153
Crack this guy open.

00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:54.902
(relaxing music)

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.753
Is it okay?

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:02.500
(upbeat music)

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.690
Oh, the crab is so good.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.340
It's so sweet, it's so fresh

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.120
and in that, like, spice
blend that they added to it,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.700
it almost has like a mushroom-y, spicy

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.533
kind of taste to it.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:15.650
Like, I don't know what I'm tasting.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.510
Like, mushroom.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.880
I'm tasting, like, that spice
blend though, that is key.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.580
That's key, whatever
is in that spice blend.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.970
Maybe it's the fenugreek that sort of

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.300
gives it a little mushroom-y taste.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.070
Coconut milk is great,
do not get me wrong.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.940
I love coconut milk, but then
coconut milk sometimes like,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.430
it milds out the spices so you can't taste

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.510
all the individual cumin and the turmeric.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.343
But when there's no coconut milk in it,

00:12:34.343 --> 00:12:35.810
it's just the pure spice,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.341
and that's just caked up on the crab.

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:38.510
That's wonderful.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.923
Re-juice it one more time.

00:12:48.674 --> 00:12:49.563
Wow.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.410
Like, the crab itself
is amazing, but their--

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.170
I love their recipe, and it's so simple.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.440
It took her, like, 15 minutes to make.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.020
She just, like, piled in the spices,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.830
no recipe, just from her head.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.580
And just like simmered it down,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.600
and then just like put on a cover.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.867
15 minutes later, toss
in the Moringa leaves

00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:08.202
and the chilis, and it was done.

00:13:08.202 --> 00:13:09.035
How's the food over there?

00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:10.426
- Mmm (laughs).

00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:12.457
- [Mark] I'm sorry,
how's the food, Ruzaina?

00:13:12.457 --> 00:13:15.020
- Obviously you can see, right?

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.260
I'm like super enjoying it.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.650
Yeah, that's what happens.
- Awesome.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.270
- So much spices and

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.700
it's just so good.
- Oh, it's so good.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.200
Like, across the board, everything

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.950
tastes awesome.
- It's so good, yeah.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.160
- Like super awesome,
you can't explain it.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.570
You're just speechless.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.158
It's, argh, so good.

00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:35.447
- [Mark] That is so, so good.

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:36.467
- [Ruzaina] I've eaten
everything (laughs).

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.690
- [Mark] Another thing
you can do with the rasam,

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.683
is just drink it.

00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:43.680
Ohh.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.650
- [Ruzaina] Yeah (laughs).

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.080
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.050
It's like creamy, it's thick.

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.670
You can taste all the,
like, spice and herbs in it.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.650
It's so good.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.550
Okay, we got a lot more dishes to try.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.090
I'm gonna move in for the eggplant.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.328
Oh, it's so mushy, you can
feel it in your fingers.

00:14:00.328 --> 00:14:02.911
(upbeat music)

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.890
The eggplant is amazing.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.310
It's so creamy, but mushy creamy.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.473
And then finally, some
of the bitter gourd.

00:14:11.473 --> 00:14:13.210
I think that might be the last dish,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.050
main dish that we got here.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.924
Check that bitter gourd out.

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:18.384
(upbeat music)

00:14:18.384 --> 00:14:19.630
Oh.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.790
Thank you.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.430
Thank you very much.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.799
Auntie just handed me the claw.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:27.577
(upbeat music)

00:14:27.577 --> 00:14:29.898
Oh yeah, oh I love it.

00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:31.380
Mmm.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.670
Again, it's kinda like caramelized,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.590
it's kinda like, almost like dehydrated,

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.980
so it has a little crunch to it.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.880
The vibrancy, the bitterness, the--

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.280
it's superb.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.190
That's the story of all the dishes,

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.570
they're so, like,

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.420
they're so, like,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.960
filled with dry spice and fresh spice.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.450
They're, like, strong in taste,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.400
but like mellow and harmonic.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.970
A harmony of flavors all at the same time.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.060
And what I love so much
is that the food is not--

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.650
it's not heavy, it feels healthy,

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.130
it's refreshing, it's nutritious

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.150
from all the spice they use.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.930
It's amazing, and the flavors are just

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.273
impressive to your mouth.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.740
Ruzaina has just told me I'm not the only,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.740
like, one who can taste the
mushroom-y taste in the crab.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.462
She says it's because of the water,

00:15:17.462 --> 00:15:18.295
and like the mud, mmm.

00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:20.549
- [Ruzaina] Yeah, and the area.

00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:22.028
So, each area produces different type of--

00:15:22.028 --> 00:15:24.923
- It's really like a
mushroom-tasting crab, uh-huh.

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.624
- [Ruzaina] It all depends on the water.

00:15:28.624 --> 00:15:31.070
(upbeat music)

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.350
- And that pumpkin.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.150
I'm gonna move in for the claw, now.

00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:37.850
And it's properly cracked all the way,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.980
so you can probably just pull it,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.032
release it, oh yes.

00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:44.140
So, that thick spice down
there is just amazing.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.430
- [Man] The aromatic butter.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.323
- [Mark] Okay.

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:48.906
(upbeat music)

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.850
- Wow, yeah.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.920
Like, the mushroom-y flavor of the crab.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.310
It's like, you really
will think of mushroom

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.273
like almost immediately
on your first bite.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.920
It's so sweet, and then
that spice mixture is just--

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.112
yeah, that spice mixture.

00:16:06.112 --> 00:16:06.945
It's incredible.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.950
Just check this out, you
can see in the shell here

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.800
just that spice, look at that.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.650
That is the dry spice,
that is their curry,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.790
their family curry paste.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.817
Chili powder, curry powder.

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:23.963
(upbeat music)

00:16:23.963 --> 00:16:24.796
Oh, that's superb.

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:26.133
That's really the flavor.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.170
I think you're gonna dish me out--

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.360
It's not really dessert,
but it's kinda like

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.603
to end the meal, to palate cleanse.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.560
Kinda as an end.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.683
One scoop of rice, or maybe
a couple scoops of rice.

00:16:42.988 --> 00:16:47.030
- [Woman] (talking in foreign language).

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.450
(man and woman talking
in foreign language).

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.840
- Thank you.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.820
That is yogurt, or curry?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.090
Is that yogurt or curry?
- Curd.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.933
And then the rasam, okay.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.457
Then you sorta scoop on some of the rasam.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.060
Okay, or one more?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.893
- [Man] Yeah.

00:17:03.893 --> 00:17:04.912
- [Mark] Okay.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.120
- [Woman] (talking in foreign language).

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.550
- [Mark] Fully just coat--
like mixed it all evenly

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.300
throughout, all the way.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.980
So that the curd is mixed in,

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.383
so that the rasam is fully mixed in.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.753
This looks like a pretty
good dessert for me.

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:25.068
Mmm, mm-hmm.

00:17:27.783 --> 00:17:29.520
That is my kind of a dessert.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.313
Rice, the coolness of
the yogurt, or the curd.

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:37.190
And then it's just, like, light and like--

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.390
that's like a digestive.

00:17:40.604 --> 00:17:43.187
(bird calling)

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.516
Alright, final bite.

00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:48.666
- [Ruzaina] You're not
afraid to do (mumbles).

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:49.499
- Bites.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.603
Okay.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.730
That was, like, truly a majestic meal.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.080
And then what you can
do is just wrap it up.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.913
Thank you.

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.759
- [Ruzaina] Woah.

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:03.960
Is that correct?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.143
Wrap it up.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.293
(laughing)

00:18:08.293 --> 00:18:09.980
Oh, the crab shell fell out.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.890
Okay, I'll have to just--

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.093
okay, thank you.

00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:15.311
Thank you.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.550
Wow, that was a meal.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.941
An incredible meal.

00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:23.060
(people talking in foreign language)

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.396
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.880
(upbeat music).

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.130
Oh, look at how, like,
fat these bananas are.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.653
They're so, like, chunky.

00:18:33.957 --> 00:18:37.203
Mmm, that is a really good banana.

00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:40.483
It's like apple-y tasting,
and like perfectly tart.

00:18:42.592 --> 00:18:45.175
(upbeat music)

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.800
Hello, how are you?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.140
So, we just-- oh, do I
have some curry on my lens?

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.210
That was an incredible meal.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.060
The mixture of the different
dishes, the spices, the flavor.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.690
That was cooking with love, the crab,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.000
and such a simple preparation
but so good, so fresh.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:08.920
Right from the source.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.260
The family, they welcomed
us into their home.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.370
I wanna say a massive
thank you to the family

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.790
for their generosity, for
allowing us into their home,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.463
for cooking for us, for
sharing the food with us.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.443
