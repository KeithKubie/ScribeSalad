I already gave you the keystrokes for the first two. Then, for this last, super

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:08.342
complicated one, here they are. Remember that you need to use arrow keys to move

00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:12.308
out of either being in a superscript position, for exponents, or for moving

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.388
positions around in fractions. If you didn't play around with this a whole lot,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:20.283
you might want to take a second to go back to the last quiz. Type this one in

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.438
again, and then use the arrow keys, the different arrow keys, to see where they

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.524
move you around within the expression. I hope you're as excited about how pretty

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:32.034
your answers can look using MathQuill as I am. I think it's really, really

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:32.417
awesome.
