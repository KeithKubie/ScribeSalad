Hi, I'm Luke.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; And I'm Anthony.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; And we're coaches here at Udacity.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.950
When you're first learning to code,
both concepts and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.470
tools are being presented
to you at the same time.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.340
It can be hard to
understand the concepts.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.430
If you aren't sure how to use the tools
you need to apply the concepts yourself.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.250
&gt;&gt; In the next series of videos,
we're going to show you some tips for

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.400
setting up your workspace.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.420
That will help you really make the most
of your Udacity learning experience.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.680
And they'll be useful throughout your
entire life as a computer programmer.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.870
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.870
Next, we  'll talk with Mike,
a programmer with years of experience.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.890
To find out why it's so important to
set up your workspace for development.
