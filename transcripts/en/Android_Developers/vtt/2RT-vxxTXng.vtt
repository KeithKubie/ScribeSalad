NICK BUTCHER: And welcome to
this week's edition of Android

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.010
Developers Office Hours.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.630
So coming to you live
from London, my

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.890
name is Nick Butcher.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.860
And I'm joined by--

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.230
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Richard
Hyndman.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.460
MATT GAUNT: And Matt Gaunt.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.980
NICK BUTCHER: And as usual, this
is your chance to ask us,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.840
the Android Developer Relations
and Google TV

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.980
Relations any Android
development or

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.450
GTV development questions.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.570
As usual, this is not a forum
for announcing new products or

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.996
commenting on launch
dates [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:33.900
and so forth.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.360
So unforunately, we will
not be able to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.130
comment on those things.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.050
But yeah.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.610
Any questions or discussions
about an Android development,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.030
this is the place.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.012
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes,
Carlos from Madrid.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.130
That was aimed at you.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.140
NICK BUTCHER: I always call
those preempted--

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.570
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Preempted
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.610
question asking something
that we're not going to.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.300
Sorry about that.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.990
NICK BUTCHER: We have a usual
suspects live in the Hangout.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.640
So I see Hugo, [? Yossi, ?]

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
and is that [? Tal? ?]

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.455
[? TAL: Yeah, ?] that's me.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:03.350
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We've got two
people on phones this week.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.450
That's what happens when it
gets close to Christmas.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.790
NICK BUTCHER: How are
you doing, guys?

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.220
TAL: I am good.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.140
I am not on the phone.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.030
I am on the computer.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.700
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.230
Any exciting Android
development

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.215
news you want to discuss?

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:15.770
I think we just had the--

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.330
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.040
Absolutely.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.940
The Play Store team, some of
which are based out of London,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.580
just popped their heads through
the curtain here to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.430
say that they've just flipped
the switch, pressed the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.460
button, and launched the feature
that is expansion

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.570
files on the new Google Play
Developer Console.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.793
So is that the last point,
the last one that--

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:36.226
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:36.920
Multi APK.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.742
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Multi APK
[? is still not ?]

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:39.425
available.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:40.110
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, yes.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.085
Hopefully a lot of you have
used the new and improved

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:43.160
developer site.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.460
You should hopefully be
enjoying its better

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.960
organization, and response to
design and all this good stuff

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.825
on the new [? hub ?] site.

00:01:50.825 --> 00:01:52.000
So yeah.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.456
Slowly moving all the features
from the old site into the

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.985
new, better designed site.

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:00.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And now it
supports expansion files.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.630
TAL: I heard, also, something
about YouTube, right?

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.526
YouTube API and [INAUDIBLE],
something like that.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:07.810
NICK BUTCHER: I heard
this too.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.150
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Excellent.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.320
Can you tell us more
about that?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.020
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.940
API, right?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.550
TAL: There is a new version
of the YouTube API.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.230
I didn't get to check
it out here.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.810
Just wanted to know if you know
something about that.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.540
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.280
Google I/O?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.780
NICK BUTCHER: No, it's
not an Android thing.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.166
It's just a YouTube API thing.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:22.599
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.465
YouTube API thing.

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:23.900
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.505
You can go to the YouTube
developer office hours, at

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:28.200
developers.google.com/live.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.940
But, yeah.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.390
The new YouTube API is at
developers.google.com/youtube.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.790
I haven't looked into at all,
yet, so if anybody has any

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.050
more information on
what the YouTube

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.800
Data API v3 is, excellent.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.570
I don't.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.020
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.170
Right.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.390
So do anyone live in the room
have any questions?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.036
Or should we jump right on
into that moderator?

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:52.470
TAL: I had a quick question
about something simple, but I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.260
didn't find it.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.380
when a user presses on a button
on my app, I want to

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.090
lock the device, to send
it to Lock Screen.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.470
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.150
TAL: And didn't find exactly
how do I do it.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.130
I heard something [? with ?]
administrative permissions or

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.730
something that.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.198
I don't know.

00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:13.790
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.820
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.030
Your [INAUDIBLE] than
mine, [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.130
TAL: So how do I go about it
to get the device to go to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.820
Lock Screen, once, let's
say, [? he ?] presses a

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.070
button in my app?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.320
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I assume
you've done the normal

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.520
searches on the Stack Overflow
and Google and stuff?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.680
TAL: Yeah.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.890
I tried a few sample codes that
people left, but none of

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.800
them seem to do the job.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.020
HUGO: I think, in the
past, you could set

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.926
the writers to 0.

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.020
It would lock the [? phone. ?]

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.470
I'm not sure if that's
official or--

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.820
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No,
definitely not.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.490
HUGO: --if it's working--

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.893
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Is this a
question from [? Tal, ?] by

00:03:55.893 --> 00:03:58.560
any chance?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.810
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:04.320
NICK BUTCHER: If you get
the Keyguard service

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.420
and then invoke it.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.030
RICHARD HYNDMAN: You can get
the KeyguardManager, but

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.280
people are saying for some
reason, it isn't working.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.320
I don't know.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.726
This is why we ask people to
please put their questions in

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:16.585
the moderator first.

00:04:16.585 --> 00:04:18.620
Your app cannot stop anyone from
pressing the Home button.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.029
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.660
You can programmatically
lock the screen

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.020
with the Screen Locker.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.800
KeyguardManager, system service

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.870
activity Keyguard service.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.120
Have you tried that
one, [? Tal? ?]

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.010
TAL: No, I missed
that one on--

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.830
is it on Stack Overflow?

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.094
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.830
It's the number one answer on
Stack Overflow when I searched

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.128
for lock Android device.

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:43.740
Look for the KeyguardManager
and the Disable Keyguard

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.480
Permission.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.280
TAL: OK.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.506
So I'll go and look at that, and
see where that leads me.

00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:53.692
Is that the Nexus 10?

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:55.380
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The one that's
illuminating my face?

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.960
It's giving me a suntan.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.565
TAL: [? Now-- ?]

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:00.830
yeah.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.950
I got one [INAUDIBLE],
so it's pretty--

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.350
RICHARD HYNDMAN: The one that's
illuminating my face?

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.090
It's giving me a suntan.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.680
TAL: [? Now-- ?]

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.670
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Somebody's
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.190
be--

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.620
MATT GAUNT: I think
it's Marie.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.140
TAL: And--

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.430
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.971
TAL: Is that the Nexus
10 over there?

00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:21.440
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.030
NICK BUTCHER: Are we
in a loop here?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.040
No it looks like we do have
a [INAUDIBLE] new

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.710
faces here, as well.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.224
We have Giuseppe, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.020
Giuseppe.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.875
And Marie.

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:31.062
I think-- is this the
first time you've

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:33.200
ever joined us, Marie?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.320
No, it looks like we
do [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.920
faces here, as well.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.327
We have Giuseppe, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:38.265
Giuseppe.

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:39.203
And Marie.

00:05:39.203 --> 00:05:40.375
I think-- is this the
first time you've

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:41.550
ever joined us, Marie?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.210
MARIE: Yes.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.860
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.050
new faces here, as well.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.760
We have Giuseppe, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.392
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE],
as well as in Hangout.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:50.870
NICK BUTCHER: Marie?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.430
MARIE: Yes.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.465
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.750
NICK BUTCHER: Close
the YouTube tab.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.870
MARIE: The sound is really
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.996
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:05:58.996 --> 00:06:01.595
You're watching us twice
at the same time.

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:03.960
Bye.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.210
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.280
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So Marie is
on an infinite loop there,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.430
unfortunately.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.820
NICK BUTCHER: I think you
need to close the

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.690
YouTube tab, Marie.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.870
And then, hopefully, it will
only come through once through

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.665
the Hangout.

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:16.615
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Bye.

00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:18.040
Wrong tab.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.650
OK.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.340
NICK BUTCHER: And who
else do we got?

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.613
We've got Andrew Kelly
down here?

00:06:22.613 --> 00:06:23.480
Hello, [? Clemens. ?]

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.390
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There he is.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.520
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
MARIE: No.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.940
Now.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.100
OK.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.800
It works.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.060
No, it wasn't the YouTube.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.880
It was a--

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.150
I have a special microphone.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:45.052 --> 00:06:47.050
MARIE: What's wrong with you?

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.430
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.720
RICHARD HYNDMAN:
It's Christmas.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.580
We're having--

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.544
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.440
MARIE: Hello, from Germany.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.330
Hello, Nick.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.000
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.610
Italy.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.970
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.210
MARIE: I want to tell you, have
a nice Christmas time.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.240
And thank you for all
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.130
Yes, just--

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.740
I want to say just hello.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.200
NICK BUTCHER: Hello.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.833
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I wish I could
take the camera out and

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.030
show you around the office.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.410
MARIE: --new message for you.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.576
my new hoodie, I have a
Android in my pocket.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:23.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.490
HUGO: Aw.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.148
NICK BUTCHER: I'm a medium,
Rich is a large, and--

00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:28.144
MATT GAUNT: Medium, as well.

00:07:28.144 --> 00:07:30.140
Yeah.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.730
MARIE: How are you, Richard.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.960
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm
doing very well.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.980
Thank you, Marie.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.680
MARIE: What are you
doing in holiday?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.504
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.504 --> 00:07:39.230
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I really meant
to finish my app up.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.180
I know there's only
one screen left.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:40.590
I'm close.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.550
I'm just waiting for
your feedback.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.530
I know.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.110
It's getting very close now, but
I didn't get a chance to

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.520
work on it.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.166
I was buying Christmas
presents and stuff.

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:52.150
And see the hat.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.995
MARIE: OK.

00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:53.360
NICK BUTCHER: Promise.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.692
This Christmas, you're going to
finish your updates to the

00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:56.630
ultimate [? clipboard. ?]

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:57.190
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:57.850
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.800
the entire experience.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.420
[? Everyone can ?] see just
how easy it is to have a

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.640
personal [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.306
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Epic.

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:03.760
NICK BUTCHER: Excellent.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.750
MARIE: OK.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.390
I have a question.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:13.080
When do you plan to start in
2013, your Android Design In

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.930
Action show?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.676
On the first January
week or second?

00:08:18.676 --> 00:08:20.110
NICK BUTCHER: That's a good
question, actually.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.930
I don't think we've
even decided yet.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.792
What's the first Tuesday
in 2013?

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:29.265
MARIE: Oh, horrible.

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:30.370
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Monday,
the 7th sounds good.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.340
Yeah, Tuesday, the 8th.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.460
NICK BUTCHER: Tuesday,
the 8th.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.870
MARIE: Somebody tried to--

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.456
NICK BUTCHER: No rest.

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.549
MARIE: --to call me.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.607
OK.

00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:40.010
NICK BUTCHER: I don't know.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.295
We'll speak to [? Adam and ?]

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:44.186
Roman, and we'll announce
something.

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:45.360
MARIE: That would be nice.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.060
Maybe I can prepare something.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.930
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, nice.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.670
MARIE: [INAUDIBLE] big plans.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.220
And I saw my office today, and
you're invited to join us in

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.610
Berlin next year for
a special plan.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.120
And maybe, I see
you in January.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.460
I got the [? mail ?] from
your colleague.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:04.785
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:07.224
All secrets to us but awesome
if that happens.

00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:08.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.150
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We have enough
of your artwork up

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.110
around the office, now, to make
you very much at home.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.940
We probably have more of you
artwork up in our office than

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.410
you have in your own house.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.394 --> 00:09:18.380
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.160
OK.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.310
MARIE: I don't want to interrupt
your Developer

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.060
Office Hours.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.120
I know, I'm a designer.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.150
I have to leave.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.160
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yep.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.900
Get out.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:32.090
MARIE: [INAUDIBLE]
big discussion.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.230
And yeah.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.990
I just want to say, hello.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.040
And have a nice Christmas
time, and see you soon.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.920
NICK BUTCHER: Thank
you very much.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.770
Same to you.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.130
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.645
Happy New Year, as well.

00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:42.780
MARIE: Thank you for
all your work.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.490
Bye.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.150
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Cheers.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.440
Bye.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.986
OK, so [? Clemens ?] has asked
us a question in the chat

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:54.560
window, which Matt's going
to lean forward and read.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.264
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:56.264 --> 00:09:59.590
if this is relevant here because
it's a Google service.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:00.555
NICK BUTCHER: Yep, it is.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:02.477
MATT GAUNT: If you have time,
at some point, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.880
actually.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.510
OK.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.856
So what [? Clemens' ?]

00:10:09.856 --> 00:10:12.050
question, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.680
has come through in the
G+ thread, and--

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.879
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:19.336
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Oh.

00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:22.256
Giuseppe, Giuseppe.

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:23.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.520
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Let's
get the G+ question.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.050
NICK BUTCHER: First,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.046
says, cool sweater, Rich.

00:10:27.046 --> 00:10:28.490
Where could he get one?

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I got this
last year, unfortunately.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.620
I used it one week last year,
and now it's back in service

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.800
for the week before Christmas
this year.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.960
NICK BUTCHER: I don't think I
want to know, unfortunately.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.790
RICHARD HYNDMAN: They
were never on sale.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.990
You just have to get
one printed.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.870
[WHISTLING]

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.960
NICK BUTCHER: And
next up, Alex.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.160
I think you asked this
same question in

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.230
the moderator thread.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.800
Al asks, can I share a secondary
screen between

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.850
multiple devices?

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.070
For example, if I will connect
two Nexus 4s using some

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.705
tablet to the same TV--

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:01.250
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.110
Two Nexus 4s, one
adaptor, one TV.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.170
NICK BUTCHER: --can I see the
same layout that can be

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.750
controlled from both Nexus 4s?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.190
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Can
you have two--

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.290
NICK BUTCHER: So the
answer is no.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.430
NICK BUTCHER: Basically, the way
that [INAUDIBLE] standard

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.955
works is it's a Wi-Fi direct
connection between one device

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:16.230
and the adaptor.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.750
So I can't, to start with, see
any way that you could have

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.390
two devices connecting to the
adaptor at any one time.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.090
And then, the way that the
presentation API works, the

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.260
second screen API on Android, is
it's very much one layout.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.550
It's almost like a
dialog really.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.200
Good [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.810
[? contacts ?]

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.220
and so on.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.930
It's actually attached and
owned by one application

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.615
[? onto ?] the phone.

00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:38.240
So it's not like you can even
background the application and

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.135
still have something
on the screen.

00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.400
It's very much [? paired ?]
between what's on the screen

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.920
and what's on the device.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.015
So you'd have to use some kind
of intermediary thing.

00:11:45.015 --> 00:11:46.840
So maybe one device
could be a host.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.390
And the other phone could
connect to the other phone.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.910
So you probably could use
Wi-Fi direct [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.210
time.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:55.900
Probably use some other socket
connection or Bluetooth or

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.380
something like that to talk
between the phones themselves.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.550
And one of things would have to
be the master controlling

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.420
what's on the TV display.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.430
That's the only way I could see
[INAUDIBLE] doing that.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.543
Or you could perhaps use
something like GTV where GTV,

00:12:06.543 --> 00:12:08.900
the Google TV itself could
be the master.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.670
And then, both phones
talking to that.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.945
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:11.750
[INAUDIBLE] we [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.370
protocol, so that would be able
to handle the multiple

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.620
devices connect to the
one Google TV device.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.140
And then, yeah.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.310
Because it's got its own
application it can deal with

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.246
however you want to do it.

00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:24.000
If you want to have
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.440
priority of the other devices.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.193
Yeah.

00:12:26.193 --> 00:12:27.160
So, yeah.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.486
There's a couple options
on the Google TV side.

00:12:31.486 --> 00:12:33.700
NICK BUTCHER: So hopefully
there's a few options for you.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.060
Thanks for the question, Alex.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.730
And so has [? Clemens ?]

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.310
typed out his question now?

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.140
MATT GAUNT: Yes.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.380
OK.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.855
So what I missed in v3 is there
is actually no way, at

00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:45.430
least documented
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.000
service is all-- is
available or not.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.460
So I'm assuming this is checking
that the In-app

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.935
Billing version v3
is available?

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:54.330
[? RICHARD HYNDMAN: Or you ?]
can check that.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:54.690
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.710
I would've thought so.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.940
I then implemented a little
method, which checks for the

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.248
com.android.vend
ing.billing.InAp

00:12:59.248 --> 00:13:03.900
pBillingService.BIND
service intent.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.180
But I don't actually know if
that will totally work.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.414
So I'm asking myself why that
feature is missing.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:11.240
Will it be [INAUDIBLE] some--

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Not quite
sure what you mean,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.210
[? Clemens. ?]

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.080
MATT GAUNT: So how would you
go about checking the v3

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.990
In-app Billing [INAUDIBLE]
the question.

00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:28.366
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:29.972
is billing available?

00:13:29.972 --> 00:13:30.310
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.750
There is a Google--

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.190
yeah.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There is a call
for is billing available,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.340
which we'll check.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.570
NICK BUTCHER: It's the first
thing all of [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.185
do, right?

00:13:37.185 --> 00:13:37.680
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.050
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.410
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But you
have to bind first.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.492
You bind to the service,
and then you check--

00:13:42.492 --> 00:13:44.845
You ask the service if
billing is available.

00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:47.270
And if the bind to the service
fails, then assume the service

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.680
isn't there.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.510
Maybe he wants to know if
there's a way of checking

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.002
whether the service is going
to be there before.

00:13:53.002 --> 00:13:55.170
MATT GAUNT: But then, that would
be filtered out based on

00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:01.150
the Play Store filtering,
wouldn't it?

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.450
RICHARD HYNDMAN: v3 is backwards
compatible though.

00:14:07.406 --> 00:14:08.460
MATT GAUNT: I'll have
a double-look.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.770
RICHARD HYNDMAN: All right.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.020
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:21.970
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.160
NICK BUTCHER: Another question
has come up in the G+ thread,

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.910
while [INAUDIBLE] digs
around for a link.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.780
Dan Williams asks, he has
recently optimized his

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.983
application for tablet
devices.

00:14:31.983 --> 00:14:34.270
How does Google Play determine
when an app is

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.270
optimized for tablets?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.970
Ie.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.720
How do I make it visible
to the tablet users?

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.665
So the answer is, your manifest,
basically, tells

00:14:43.665 --> 00:14:47.420
Google Play which screens your
application supports.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.520
And that's it really.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.470
So you don't need to
do any extra steps.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.060
It's not like some others stores
out there where you

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.330
have to opt in and tick a box
or something like that.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.420
Your app, using the support
screen's manifest within your

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.190
application, tells Google Play
what devices can run it.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.660
[INAUDIBLE] that's done.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.500
But good job, yeah.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.645
One thing you will hopefully
see is that we are doing

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.990
something where applications
which run better and optimized

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.690
for tablets will hopefully start
ranking better on tablet

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.160
devices when searching
in the Play store.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.100
So hopefully you'll see that.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.350
There's nothing you
have to do.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.170
That's just us tweaking our
internal algorithms, which we

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.230
can't share the details of.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.305
HUGO: Is the Play store now
looking at the smallest width

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:33.260
qualifier, or still at the
support screen [? stuff? ?]

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.820
NICK BUTCHER: The filtering,
yeah, is not using the

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.830
smallest width just yet.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.160
It's still using
support screen.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.050
But at some point in the future
hopefully we'll be

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.030
moving to that.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.280
HUGO: OK.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.264
NICK BUTCHER: Anything
to add [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:46.264 --> 00:15:46.666
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:47.920
Sounds really good to me.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.791
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:51.232
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Ah.

00:15:51.232 --> 00:15:53.440
Refresh.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.660
NICK BUTCHER: All right.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.560
Should we take [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.470
any live questions in
the [? room? ?]

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.670
GIUSEPPE: Can I ask a [? good ?]
question, please?

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.664
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:59.664 --> 00:16:01.155
Giuseppe.

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:03.640
GIUSEPPE: Hello.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.790
I was reading this morning news
about the new encryption

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.600
in Jelly Bean, OK?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.040
About the APK, the application
encryption.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.070
Can anyone suggest a good
documentation somewhere to

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.500
read and understand well how
to use this new feature in

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.770
Jelly Bean to encrypt the
APK to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.140
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
for you by the Play store.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.732
You don't have to do anything,
but it only affects 4.1

00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:34.982
[? upwards. ?]

00:16:37.292 --> 00:16:39.572
GIUSEPPE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:39.572 --> 00:16:40.020
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.870
It's automatic.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.350
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.430
GIUSEPPE: Only starting--

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.140
only starting Jelly Bean, or
in the future we can expect

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.535
some [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:50.748
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:50.748 --> 00:16:52.644
[TYPING]

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:55.240
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Only on Jelly
Bean [? upwards. ?]

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.490
GIUSEPPE: Only on Jelly Bean.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:56.960
OK.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.160
So this will be done
automatically.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.350
Or in the future the old
application from [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.179
application will disappear,
right?

00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:15.240
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.550
GIUSEPPE: Richard,
can you hear me?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.940
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yes, yes.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.950
GIUSEPPE: So this means that
in the future, all the

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.125
application will be encrypted
automatically?

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:28.015
NICK BUTCHER: Paid
applications.

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:31.235
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Paid
applications.

00:17:31.235 --> 00:17:31.722
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:17:31.722 --> 00:17:34.157
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:34.157 --> 00:17:36.105
RICHARD HYNDMAN: As all people
upgrade to Jelly Bean, onward.

00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.355
Yeah.

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:46.360
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.520
there is nothing
for you to do.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.610
If you're interested
in [? hard work, ?]

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.553
I did read an interesting tear
down, I guess, of looking at

00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.850
how the service works
under the hood.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.230
Which is on Nikolay
Elenkov's blog.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.755
If you go to
nelenkov.blogspot.com, there's

00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:04.270
an interesting assessment of
the service just for your

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.740
background.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.603
But as a developer, there's
nothing for you to do.

00:18:09.441 --> 00:18:10.691
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.726
NICK BUTCHER: Any other
questions from people in the

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:17.855
Hangout before we jump into the
pre-submitted questions?

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:18.290
HUGO: Yeah.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.860
I might have one.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.440
I've been trying to [? port ?]
over Rainy Days to the new

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.570
Maps API, but the biggest
trouble is animating a layer.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.170
In the previous API, I could
just [INAUDIBLE] something.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.900
But now it's all [INAUDIBLE]
overlays or whatever, there

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.250
seems to be no good way to
animate, besides switching the

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.955
layers, of course.

00:18:46.955 --> 00:18:51.510
So I don't expect really
an answer, but--

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.160
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Animate what?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.610
Sorry.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.025
From point to point or
animate [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:55.025 --> 00:18:56.620
NICK BUTCHER: The marker.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.620
HUGO: No, I have [INAUDIBLE]
my application shows a rain

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.570
radar image, so it steps
through the time

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.780
from like 10 minutes--

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.980
in steps of 10 minutes.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.740
So that layer, itself,
is animated and

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.310
projected on the map.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.460
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.350
HUGO: But in--

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.350
so in [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.650
I just have an overlay that I
animate myself using a handler

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.510
and those kinds of things.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.596
But in the new API, you have
to actually add some

00:19:30.596 --> 00:19:33.090
[INAUDIBLE] overlay or
[INAUDIBLE] sets or those

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.132
kinds of things.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.460
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's no
way of animating that?

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.320
HUGO: There is really
no good way.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.090
If I try to set [? it ?] visible
or height one layer

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.350
and then, make another layer
visible, then it's not really

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.448
smooth or--

00:19:44.448 --> 00:19:45.304
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:19:45.304 --> 00:19:47.768
No, I have not tried that--

00:19:47.768 --> 00:19:49.200
animating a layer.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.350
HUGO: I thought about just
drawing over it with a

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.795
[? view ?] or something, but I
guess that won't work either.

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.340
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No, I'm sure
a number of solutions will

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.622
emerge over the next couple of
months, if it is an issue.

00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:03.098
But I haven't seen
it myself yet.

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:03.536
HUGO: OK.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.412
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.460
If you do that, can you put it
in a frame layer, and just

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.610
draw it-- your own layer
on top of the map?

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.205
HUGO: Yeah.

00:20:10.205 --> 00:20:14.280
I thought about it, but then
I would also need a custom

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.096
location overlay for that.

00:20:16.096 --> 00:20:17.400
NICK BUTCHER: You have to listen
to the panning events

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.976
and so forth.

00:20:17.976 --> 00:20:18.788
Yeah.

00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:19.600
HUGO: Yeah.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.060
And for now--

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.360
for example, now I have an
option to show the location on

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.670
top of the clouds, so if it's
very cloudy, then you can see

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.660
your location still.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.040
But, yeah.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.180
If I go that route, then I have
to draw, basically, every

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.465
map thing, like location
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:36.465 --> 00:20:36.922
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:36.922 --> 00:20:37.380
Yeah.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.690
Got it.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.160
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Interesting.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.458
I have not tried that.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.860
HUGO: But other than that,
no other questions.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.330
NICK BUTCHER: So what's the
question from [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.230
MATT GAUNT: So what's the
complete [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.110
backed by CursorLoader?

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.270
NICK BUTCHER: I think you
might be muted there,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.530
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.580
Do you want to unmute,
and then ask

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.378
the question yourself?

00:21:07.378 --> 00:21:08.800
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.700
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.010
MALE SPEAKER: Hi,
how's it going?

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:15.800
I posted a question last weekend
or last Hangout.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.880
And I wasn't able to join
because I guess

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.050
that group was full.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.140
What I'm trying to accomplish
is, basically, have a

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:29.280
multi-autocomplete view backed
by a CursorLoader, but what I

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.710
want to have happen is have
a custom tokenizer.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.740
So instead of having a common
delimited tokenizer, I wanted

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.640
to achieve something like a
space delimited tokenizer.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.470
So I know I have to
override the--

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:50.990
I think it's in the
TextWatcher class.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.790
TextWatcher [? has ?] an
onTextChanged method.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.660
And I'm running into issues
as far so overriding that

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:08.250
because, for example, let's
say I type in the word Joe

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.470
Johnson or the two words, Joe
Johnson, I think the call to

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:19.080
onTextChanged happens more times
than I'm anticipating

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:24.740
when, basically, a delimiter
was entered like a space, I

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.115
expected it to only be called
once, but it's being called

00:22:27.115 --> 00:22:28.365
like more than once.

00:22:31.112 --> 00:22:32.080
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.660
MALE SPEAKER: So I'm not
able to successfully

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:40.450
implement this custom--

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.710
what's it called?

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.200
Like a custom TextWatcher.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.300
But if I go take the approach
of using a simple

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.320
CursorAdaptor, and don't go
the CursorLoader approach,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.580
then I'm able to implement it.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.750
But it's not--

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.030
I don't think it's
as efficient.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.820
NICK BUTCHER: So at what
stage are you trying--

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.660
how come you can do it with
the CursorAdaptor, but not

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.910
with the Loader?

00:23:07.536 --> 00:23:12.940
MALE SPEAKER: I think it has
something to do with when I

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:17.460
did go with a simple
CursorAdaptor approach, then I

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.090
took a look at--

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.350
I have a filtered query provider
that has a run query

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.930
method that I'm overriding.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:31.890
And I'm also noticing that
onTextChanged method, this run

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.680
query seems to be getting
called twice, as well.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.030
So I'm not really familiar with
how the TextWatcher run

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.280
query method gets called.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.150
I was expecting it to
just be called once.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.220
When text it changed, I thought
it would just get

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.680
called once, but it seems
like it's getting

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.240
called more than once.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.860
And there's an argument
in the onTextChanged

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.540
method, called [? s ?]

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.490
CharSequence.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.350
It's a type CharSequence.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.530
And that's, basically, the
length of the string.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.250
So the first time onTextChanged
is called, it's

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.530
of a certain length.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.760
And the second time
it's called, it's

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.210
of a different length.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.820
So if I'm trying to do any kind
of processing of a custom

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.930
tokenizer, it's not what
I anticipated.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:22.990
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.350
isn't the beforeTextChanged
[INAUDIBLE] and the one

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.470
afterwards is the
onTextChanged.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.160
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.800
So I tried to put some kind of
logic to see what the string

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.770
was before TextChanged and
after TextChanged.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:42.610
I wasn't able to get something
to really work, as far as the

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:46.210
changing from the first call
to the second call.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.380
So I was looking into that
approach, but I haven't come

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.500
up with any clean solutions.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.910
MATT GAUNT: You're not--

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.090
you're not setting the text
at any point in these

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.850
methods, are you?

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.890
Like, if you're running it
through a tokenizer, then

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.900
stripping out spaces or white
characters and then--

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.970
MALE SPEAKER: Well, basically,
what I wanted to do is, as

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:13.380
soon as I saw delimiter, I
saved this value of s.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.330
And then, I do something
with that value of s.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.980
But the problem is this
onTextChanged gets called

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.290
twice, once--

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.600
instead of just being called
once after you see a

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.460
delimiter, it gets
called twice.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:33.320
So the first time I see the
delimiter, it says, oh, the

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.770
string is Joe Johnson.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.710
Then, the second time it
sees actually more

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.360
text, if I keep typing.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:46.050
And instead of being that new
word, it has the entire string

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.613
of Joe Johnson plus
the extra text.

00:25:49.613 --> 00:25:51.026
NICK BUTCHER: I think that's the
expected behavior, right?

00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:53.045
The TextWatcher will
always return the

00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:54.850
entire text of the--

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.590
in the editable text.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.910
MALE SPEAKER: So is there any
way to get, as soon as you see

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.830
a delimiter, then grab
that first--

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.790
the text before the first
delimiter, and then,

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.950
basically, only see--

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:14.520
delimit it by potential
delimiters?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.330
The thing that's tricky is that
the delimiter is a space

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.560
that I wouldn't use, but there
could be spaces within a text.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.980
Basically, the text could be
like contacts, where you have

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.190
a first name and a last name
separated by a space.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:37.870
But if this multi-autocomplete
text view has different

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.480
contacts, it could
have a bunch of

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.260
different contact names.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.345
And within those contact names,
it has a first name and

00:26:44.345 --> 00:26:48.480
a last name that happens
to have a space.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.490
So that's where it becomes a
little tricky with just a

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.840
common delimiter.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.152
NICK BUTCHER: It sounds like
you're going to have to keep

00:26:55.152 --> 00:26:56.402
track of it yourself really.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.990
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:02.130
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --and decide
when you want to keep the

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.305
string, and when you don't
want to keep it.

00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:04.920
NICK BUTCHER: I think
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.060
it sounds like, at some point,
you're putting set text within

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.860
your TextWatcher, which is
entirely legitimate.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.594
You can do that, but you need
to handle the case so you

00:27:11.594 --> 00:27:14.470
don't end up in some kind of
recursive loop or anything.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.260
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.510
MATT GAUNT: --I had was if you
had a [INAUDIBLE] where you

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.645
could only enter in valid
information, which then

00:27:19.645 --> 00:27:20.980
affected other [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.106
Then it reinfected that one.

00:27:23.106 --> 00:27:26.500
If you start getting really kind
of messy traps, you have

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.920
to make sure you get to a point
where you account for

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.090
that, basically.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.340
NICK BUTCHER: And the other
thing you could take a look at

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:38.060
is the Chips UI, which is
the UI we use in the SMS

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.085
application on Android.

00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:40.510
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:41.670
NICK BUTCHER: Similarly,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.610
which is open source so you
can take [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.300
Chips UI, I think it's clled,
which gives you those-- you

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.970
know, as you enter a name,
it turns it into a little

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.300
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:48.460
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.460
I was reading a little bit about
that, but I didn't get

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.576
to check out the documentation
yet.

00:27:56.576 --> 00:27:57.790
MATT GAUNT: I think there's
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.470
somewhere isn't there?

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.370
NICK BUTCHER: I'm not sure.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.321
MATT GAUNT: I've seen
it come up a

00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:02.303
couple of times somewhere.

00:28:02.303 --> 00:28:03.285
But, yeah.

00:28:03.285 --> 00:28:04.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.420
MALE SPEAKER: I was
thinking, maybe

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.340
potentially, my approach--

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.110
once I see a delimited--

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.140
like let's say someone
typed in Joe Johnson.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.360
And then, they pressed Space.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:21.530
Then I can save this in
some global variable.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.030
And regardless of what the
onTextChanged is, then I just

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.100
update that global variable.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.630
And I can put some arbitrary
delimiter within this string,

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.570
so I could say Joe Johnson.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.872
And then, put like
a [? pipe ?]

00:28:36.872 --> 00:28:40.140
that would just delimit it
in this arbitrary string.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.190
And then, if more text is added,
onTextChanged will

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:48.580
always show what's in the Edit
Text View, but my global

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.630
string will show how
it's delimited.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:52.030
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.540
That sounds reasonable.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.670
Either like holding them
in a map or a set or

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.296
something like that.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:55.682
Yeah.

00:28:55.682 --> 00:28:56.070
MALE SPEAKER: Something.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.050
Like that.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.850
OK.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:05.410
And I'll take a look at that
Chips UI or the Chips--

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.400
in the Messenger.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.260
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.856
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:29:10.856 --> 00:29:11.995
NICK BUTCHER: No worries.

00:29:11.995 --> 00:29:13.450
Good luck.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.905
But just go back to
your question.

00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:17.826
Why were you trying to
[INAUDIBLE], rather than using

00:29:17.826 --> 00:29:19.076
the OnQuery?

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:28.690
MALE SPEAKER: Because I wanted
to, basically, asynchronously

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.720
do the loading in
the background.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.770
And I've read that CursorLoaders
are a lot more

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.850
efficient at that.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:45.230
Instead of blocking the main
UI, I thought it would be a

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.720
better approach.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.580
MATT GAUNT: Does a lot of the
heavy lifting, isn't it?

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.970
NICK BUTCHER: Well, I think most
[INAUDIBLE] will do that,

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.540
anyway, for you, right?

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.146
You normally use a--

00:29:56.146 --> 00:29:57.512
what's it called--

00:29:57.512 --> 00:29:59.542
it's an async query
anyway, isn't it?

00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:01.018
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:01.018 --> 00:30:02.494
I forget what it's called.

00:30:05.938 --> 00:30:07.188
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.490
Yeah.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.400
I think it normally does it
asynchronously anyway.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.416
So I wouldn't--

00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:13.842
MALE SPEAKER: Oh.

00:30:13.842 --> 00:30:15.120
A multi--

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.230
oh.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.450
It already does it
asynchronously?

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.710
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.980
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:25.510
So potentially, just using a
simple CursorAdaptor, it's as

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.070
efficient as it needs to be.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.580
Because with the simple
CursorAdaptor, I think, what

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.800
happened is something about I
needed to manage the Cursor.

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.940
And it wasn't closed properly.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.320
That's why it went with
the CursorLoader,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.240
so it handled that--

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.005
Cursor and managing
that efficiently.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.810
I think I turned on
a debugging mode--

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.670
one of the strict modes-- and
it complained because the

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.390
Cursor wasn't closed
correctly.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.030
So that's why I went with the
approach of CursorLoader that

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.226
would manage that Cursor.

00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:07.820
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.930
The standard use case is using
AsyncQueryHandler with

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.435
[INAUDIBLE], right?

00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:15.130
Is that what you're doing?

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.010
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.280
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.580
So AsyncQueryHandler
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:18.865
UI.

00:31:18.865 --> 00:31:19.400
So, yeah.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.986
You're OK there.

00:31:21.986 --> 00:31:22.440
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.060
And then, I just have
to figure out where

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.210
to close that Cursor.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.706
You have to manage
that yourself.

00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:28.400
Yeah.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.636
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:30.636 --> 00:31:31.080
All right.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.747
Thank you.

00:31:31.747 --> 00:31:35.090
NICK BUTCHER: No worries.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.770
Cool.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.560
OK.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.850
We've got some chat going
on in the sidebar.

00:31:41.403 --> 00:31:43.475
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's just
about Hugo's maps.

00:31:43.475 --> 00:31:44.060
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, OK.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.180
About the animated Maps
question still.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.780
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.825
Any more live questions from
the people in the room?

00:31:48.825 --> 00:31:50.850
I see we were just joined
by a couple of people.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.176
We've got AJ I think.

00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:56.905
How are you doing?

00:31:56.905 --> 00:31:59.648
And some usual suspects,
as well.

00:31:59.648 --> 00:32:00.530
No last questions?

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.212
You guys [INAUDIBLE] questions
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:03.860
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.010
from the Netherlands, almost
certainly, [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.375
NICK BUTCHER: I bet.

00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:09.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It's asking--

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.118
NICK BUTCHER: That
could be anyone.

00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:11.552
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Because
that can be anyone.

00:32:11.552 --> 00:32:14.151
It does start with, will
it ever be possible.

00:32:14.151 --> 00:32:15.540
But it's not really a question
we should be

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.520
answering in this forum.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.760
Will it ever be possible to
remotely debug an Android

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.660
application, running
on a device without

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.920
connecting a cable?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:28.308
Obviously, Google TV devices
already allow this, but

00:32:28.308 --> 00:32:29.830
Android devices, in
general, don't.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.560
There's a few ways, if
you've got a rooted

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.460
device, you can do it.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:33.845
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:33.845 --> 00:32:35.570
ADB [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.540
instead.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.990
It connects through
wirelessly.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.520
I've seen people doing
this, but I've not

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.870
heard anything about--

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.490
no future announcements, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:50.980
HUGO: Yeah.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.850
I think you can put it in TCP
mode, right, when you have

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:54.604
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:54.604 --> 00:32:58.956
your phone connected through
USB [? once, ?]

00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:00.206
then you can [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.120
Let me look up the command.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.861
But it's something like ADB TCP
or something like this.

00:33:08.861 --> 00:33:09.360
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.180
HUGO: And then, you can connect
to it the same way as

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.800
you connect to Google TV.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.920
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's no UI
for getting the IP address

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.840
back out of it again.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.220
HUGO: Well, you can look at
the wireless setting, like

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.820
you're doing with Google TV.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.070
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.900
MATT GAUNT: So the way the
Google TV side of it works, is

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.655
you have enter in the IP address
in the machine you're

00:33:29.655 --> 00:33:31.110
going to connect to.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:33.915
And then, from your machine,
ADB connect with the IP

00:33:33.915 --> 00:33:34.820
address of the device.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.130
And then, from that point,
you create a

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:38.260
two-way pairing process.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.390
And then, you're good to go.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.610
And then, it just looks like
a USB device, essentially.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.300
But, yeah.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.133
In Germany, I think most
developers are happy

00:33:47.133 --> 00:33:48.945
connecting cables [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:49.400
HUGO: Yeah.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.170
And the thing is that you have
to first put it in TCP mode

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.920
with the cables [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.200
If you're able to do that, then
you probably just want to

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.290
stick the cable [? in it. ?]

00:33:59.290 --> 00:33:59.660
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.290
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Well, I'm still
pretty sure it's only

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.960
available if you're on
rooted device, right?

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.660
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.010
I think I remember seeing
it at some point.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:07.990
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:10.540
or something, but yeah.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.139
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I think you
can only set your device in

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.384
TCP mode if you are rooted.

00:34:14.384 --> 00:34:15.634
HUGO: Really?

00:34:17.483 --> 00:34:18.409
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm
just trying to find

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.149
it myself now, but--

00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:25.100
HUGO: It's a question
on Stack Overflow.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.530
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Does someone
on Stack Overflow got an

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.469
answer, which doesn't
require root?

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.932
HUGO: Yes.

00:34:30.932 --> 00:34:32.469
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Do you know
what the question number is?

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.969
MATT GAUNT: He just pasted it.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.070
HUGO: I just pasted it.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.643
It's a long number.

00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:44.370
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.615
In the G+ comments,
Carlos asks--

00:34:47.615 --> 00:34:48.929
has a question about moderators

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.340
in Android dev community.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:50.690
Can you--

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.679
I'm going to ask Carlos, can you
give us some more details

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.940
about what you think.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.219
There's not enough moderation
going on in

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.250
the Android dev community?

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.150
Or are you enjoying it
or what's going on?

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:02.650
Yeah, some more details,
please.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.370
RICHARD HYNDMAN: That answer
there does say if your device

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.530
is rooted, Hugo, at the top.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:07.665
HUGO: Yeah, but the
second paragraph.

00:35:07.665 --> 00:35:09.230
From a computer, if
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.970
USB access already, that
part just works.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:14.906
I'm pretty sure I did that.

00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:17.600
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.070
HUGO: Because I borrowed some
phones from a colleague.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.920
And then, I gave him back his
phone, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:25.168 --> 00:35:26.136
NICK BUTCHER: Cool.

00:35:26.136 --> 00:35:27.590
HUGO: I can try it right now.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.010
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.210
Jamie [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.200
says, I need to share a class
worth from Android screens

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.370
with the teacher.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.990
Can someone point me
in right direction?

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.440
I can access the output on a PC
with USB, but I need this

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.116
over wireless, so a teacher can
view what is going on in

00:35:43.116 --> 00:35:44.920
their class.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.040
So I guess you're trying to
[INAUDIBLE] some kind of

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.280
wireless screen chat, so I'm
going to say that the

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.250
[INAUDIBLE], which is
probably [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.270
you're going to need to have a
Nexus 4 [INAUDIBLE] dongle of

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.230
which I don't know of any
on the market just yet.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.920
Any other solutions
you could use?

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.500
RICHARD HYNDMAN: There's loads
of HDMI broadcasters.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.900
If you've got HDMI, [INAUDIBLE]
get a little box

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.340
to use wireless HDMI to HDMI.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.100
VNC, isn't that on Android
somewhere?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.030
Maybe it only goes one way.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.554
You can view the desktop
from the tablet,

00:36:14.554 --> 00:36:15.910
but not vice versa?

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:16.362
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:36:16.362 --> 00:36:18.152
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:20.510
Droid, can you do [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.600
NICK BUTCHER: Can you do
screen share on an app?

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.330
There's Droid [INAUDIBLE] screen
or something like that.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.610
[INAUDIBLE] you've already
managed to get it

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:29.130
onto a PC over USB.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.045
And then, could you share from
the PC to your teacher

00:36:31.045 --> 00:36:32.800
somehow, perhaps?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.470
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But, yeah.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.000
The ideal way would be--

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.960
MATT GAUNT: And I think this is
to make sure that all the

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.320
kids are doing what they're
told, maybe.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.150
Because it sounds like
each kid has got

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.290
their own Android device.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.010
And then, the teacher is
supposed to make sure what

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.920
they're doing is right.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.318
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:48.318 --> 00:36:53.764
[BANGING]

00:36:53.764 --> 00:36:54.720
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.604
Android [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:57.604 --> 00:37:01.670
MATT GAUNT: So it's kind
of like [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.442
style, where you get all the
devices coming [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:04.442 --> 00:37:04.905
screen shots.

00:37:04.905 --> 00:37:05.370
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.623
You need something custom
[? firmware ?]

00:37:06.623 --> 00:37:07.970
[INAUDIBLE] that property,
really.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.180
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:09.880
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And the teacher
would be able to

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.600
choose which one of the screens
she was looking at.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.454
And what was going on on that
screen and all that is

00:37:13.454 --> 00:37:15.510
definitely against our
security model.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.105
NICK BUTCHER: An interesting
one there.

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:21.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.250
interesting question from
Gabriel [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.480
He asks--

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.430
he has a [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.880
and with multiple pages, with
multiple list views

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.530
in each of the pages.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:36.150
At the moment, each list
fragment is querying different

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.310
parts of the same
database table.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:42.225
At the moment, each fragment
queries the--

00:37:42.225 --> 00:37:43.540
has the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.690
querying the database.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.990
And he's wondering if it would
be more efficient to have one

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.790
query [? against ?]

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.520
that table and at the
activity level.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.175
And then, [? farm ?] out
that information to

00:37:52.175 --> 00:37:54.925
the different fragments.

00:37:54.925 --> 00:37:57.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:02.000
MATT GAUNT: Well, databases are
inherently secured against

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.520
asynchronous queries,
aren't they?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.880
What about Cursors?

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.020
Because if they're not, then I
could imagine you could get

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.860
into some sticky situations.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.310
Where if you're flipping between
the two, and both

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.980
adaptors are fed set off
of the same Cursor,

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.930
then it could lock.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.600
So it might actually be safer to
do it the way you're doing

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.370
it because then you'd have
independent Cursors, so--

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.555
RICHARD HYNDMAN: We need
a bit more information.

00:38:24.555 --> 00:38:27.110
It depends how much data
we're talk about here.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.802
If he's talking about like
5, 10k of data, whatever.

00:38:29.802 --> 00:38:30.764
Then, yeah, fair enough.

00:38:30.764 --> 00:38:33.390
Maybe load that into the
activity and just use it

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:34.282
inside the application.

00:38:34.282 --> 00:38:37.090
If you can load it without the
application suffering,

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.165
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:38.165 --> 00:38:39.360
being concerned about memory.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.630
But if he's talking about much
more data, then potentially

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.668
you could load the first level
of all the data for all the l

00:38:45.668 --> 00:38:48.158
And then when you drill down,
load that separately.

00:38:48.158 --> 00:38:51.150
MATT GAUNT: Well, if you've got
a view pager and you're

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.680
recycling the list fragments
as you're swiping, then you

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.480
could load all the data you need
for that one fragment.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.553
Then, as it gets wiped off and
killed, you'd kill the data--

00:39:00.553 --> 00:39:01.470
NICK BUTCHER: But the
view pager wouldn't

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.346
recycle right, see?

00:39:03.346 --> 00:39:04.774
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:04.774 --> 00:39:06.787
MATT GAUNT: There is a version
where you can make it

00:39:06.787 --> 00:39:08.098
do it, can't you?

00:39:08.098 --> 00:39:10.891
No?

00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:12.141
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.800
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.820
It sounds like, depending on how
you've got your view pager

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.480
set up and the amount of data,
that it may be a good idea.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.670
But we just need a little
bit more information--

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.090
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:24.980
RICHARD HYNDMAN: --else
in the string.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.734
NICK BUTCHER: My worry is the
whole point of using Cursors.

00:39:27.734 --> 00:39:30.130
It can be like an arbitrary
list [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.880
grow into an [? arbitrarily ?]
large data set.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.840
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So what?

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.902
NICK BUTCHER: [? --and I ?]
worry about [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:34.902 --> 00:39:38.280
to manage them all yourself and
piece them back together.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.740
And you're returning a much
larger data set in it.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.500
I think the idea-- you know, I
don't know if there's a right

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.040
answer here.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.210
I think you could probably end
up writing a lot more code.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.105
It might be a little bit more
efficient, but then, the

00:39:51.105 --> 00:39:53.025
overhead of having to do
it all yourself might

00:39:53.025 --> 00:39:53.670
not be worth it.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.600
So you could do a test, and
see if it works out.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.490
Any good advice?

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.240
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.980
For me, it's just a little
bit more information.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.260
But, yeah.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:04.875
I kind of agree.

00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:06.880
If you're managing all of that
yourself, there's a lot of

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.160
room where I think things could
start just leaking and

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.320
lead to some bad times.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.015
NICK BUTCHER: I think Carlos
has replied to

00:40:16.015 --> 00:40:17.090
his original question.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:17.950
MATT GAUNT: Oh, yeah.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.380
OK.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.930
Carlos says, the main problem
with the Android dev

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:22.570
community, he's saying, is
there's quite a lot of

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.850
advertising [INAUDIBLE]
different levels of

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.030
questions and so on.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.070
Maybe different sections or
different levels of Q&amp;A

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:28.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.560
Android.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.620
So we have different sub-forums
in there, right?

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.485
What are they?

00:40:34.485 --> 00:40:37.222
I don't remember
[? off-hand. ?]

00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:38.850
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.430
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What
was the question?

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.180
Sub-forums, is this
Carlos' question?

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.610
MATT GAUNT: On the Android
community.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.601
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:47.000
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.650
So there are sub-sections,
right?

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.730
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:53.930
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.710
There are sub-sections
on there.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.604
If you think that we need some
more, then we'd be happy to

00:40:58.604 --> 00:41:01.140
add some more, [? if ?]
needs be.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.060
At the moment, I think
the communities are

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:03.760
all settling down.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.080
I think there's a bit of a
communities rush at the moment

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.000
where everyone trying to get
everyone to join each other's

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.890
communities-- a lot of
cross-pollination.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.690
I think we've had quite
a light hand.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.500
We've tried not to moderate
too hard.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.200
And only things which are
completely off-topic--

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.285
if there's some overlaps,
someone saying, you know, join

00:41:19.285 --> 00:41:21.870
our design and developers
community or something like

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.540
that, which is [? valued ?] to
some people, we've been trying

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.980
not to remove those
kind of posts.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.600
But it sounds like you feel
that we could do some more

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.130
moderation.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.980
So that's good feedback.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.175
So does anyone else
in the Hangout

00:41:35.175 --> 00:41:35.980
here have any feedback?

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.000
Have you been using the Android
Developer Community?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.625
Have you found it useful?

00:41:38.625 --> 00:41:39.870
Have you found It too noisy?

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.937
Has anyone else got any
experience they want to share?

00:41:45.416 --> 00:41:45.913
No?

00:41:45.913 --> 00:41:47.410
No one?

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.640
HUGO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.140
community?

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.390
NICK BUTCHER: The
G+ Community.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.770
HUGO: There's a lot of
noise form people, I

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:56.580
want to make an app.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.330
Where do I start?

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:00.230
NICK BUTCHER: I want to
make a what-- sorry?

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.110
RICHARD HYNDMAN: An app,
where do I start?

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.630
HUGO: There are a lot
of questions like, I

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.310
want to make an app.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.140
Where do I start?

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.820
And then, yeah.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.580
I point them to Android.com,
but that seems so

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.060
obvious to me that--

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.890
NICK BUTCHER: You think
we could do

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.130
like a newbies section?

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.660
Or a different community
almost?

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:14.810
HUGO: Yeah.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:15.960
Something like that.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.920
Just, maybe, if you have some
place to put frequently asked

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.340
questions or starting
points of--

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.500
because most of the responses
on those kinds of questions

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.690
are pointing to
[? developers.com/android ?]

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.370
[INAUDIBLE] developers
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.660
training, right?

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.450
NICK BUTCHER: Right.

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.710
HUGO: That's the right place
to start, I guess.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:42.250
There are a lot of those
kinds of questions.

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.550
Also, a lot of questions
that don't make

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.620
sense, in whatever way.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.850
NICK BUTCHER: I think part of
the problem is it's quite a

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.630
large topic, isn't it,
Android development?

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.000
I mean, that--

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:52.353
HUGO: Yeah.

00:42:52.353 --> 00:42:54.650
NICK BUTCHER: --Android
[INAUDIBLE] huge range from

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.290
newbie questions to incredibly
advanced questions.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.380
I feel like the level of
discourse in the Android

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.435
Design Community has been less
noisy, I think, because it's a

00:43:04.435 --> 00:43:05.330
smaller focus.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.700
It's a smaller subset,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.550
HUGO: Yeah.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.420
NICK BUTCHER: And maybe
that's what's missing.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.240
I mean, we have the
sub-forums.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.240
But you obviously get--

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.340
if you're in the community, you
see all of the things that

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.520
I'm talking about.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.492
So it can feel noisier.

00:43:16.492 --> 00:43:19.890
Perhaps we need to have other
communities or something.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:20.562
I don't know.

00:43:20.562 --> 00:43:22.710
That's some feedback we need to
take back and work out the

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:23.920
best way forward.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.380
HUGO: But splitting out
the check out my

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.430
app was a good thing.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.950
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.970
I really like that idea of
being able to broadcast

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.030
potentially what you're
working on.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:37.750
And letting other people know,
oh, this is what I've

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:38.680
worked on so far.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.290
Check it out.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.790
Maybe give some feedback.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:43.856
MATT GAUNT: Pretty cool
for sort of early

00:43:43.856 --> 00:43:45.194
testing, beta testers--

00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:45.640
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.060
MATT GAUNT: --to get it to
community and get feedback.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.900
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.380
MALE SPEAKER: I feel like it's
kind of difficult to really

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:57.360
categorize where posts
can land because you

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.970
never really know--

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.440
there could be a really advanced
user posting on the

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.100
community, and then, some
novice developer.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.090
So it's hard to just say, oh,
post directly to this

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.200
sub-community because there
will be overlap.

00:44:16.567 --> 00:44:17.840
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, but I
guess you're always

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.600
going to have that.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.210
There always needs to
be that entry point.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.276
And then, people are going
to be pointed off

00:44:22.276 --> 00:44:22.950
to the right thing.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.150
And there will be people that
will just find the new--

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.240
if there was a new sort of
community, people would just

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.150
jump straight in there if it's
the first one they find, post

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.790
probably better off asking that
in the main community.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:34.724
So--

00:44:34.724 --> 00:44:38.370
MALE SPEAKER: I think if there
was, maybe, the first time you

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:42.440
actually join the community,
I think it may be like

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.880
intimidating for some new person
to go and see, oh, this

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:51.040
is where I enter any type
of discussion--

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.160
if maybe the very first time
you join the community, it

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.650
says, if you are sort of a
novice user, we suggest going

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.250
and posting in this sub-forum.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.250
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.570
It's always been like--

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.830
you see it in the IRC channels
back in the day when Android

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.210
was fairly new, you kind of have
Google engineers versus

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.145
other people.

00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:16.510
Yeah.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:17.320
You'd have people come in.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.730
And they'd literally just
ask product questions.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.930
And then, it's like, go here.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.090
So, yeah.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:25.405
I guess you need that level of
direction one way [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:25.405 --> 00:45:25.800
Yeah.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.695
Good feedback.

00:45:28.695 --> 00:45:31.430
NICK BUTCHER: Andrew in the
sidebar is commenting, it's

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.280
very noisy.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.300
lots lof look at my
app posts too.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.510
Rather than every community post
appearing in my timeline,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.560
I would, maybe, only like
to see those from

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.040
people in my circles.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.034
In order to view all posts,
I need to visit

00:45:44.034 --> 00:45:44.900
the community page.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.530
So kind of like the volume
sliders you can have on

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.900
circles, right?

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.550
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I don't get

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.274
community posts in my timeline.

00:45:51.274 --> 00:45:51.688
MATT GAUNT: I get them.

00:45:51.688 --> 00:45:54.874
But they're kind of
gently snuck in.

00:45:54.874 --> 00:45:56.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.200
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.085
the option, though, of only
getting them from [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:01.085 --> 00:46:02.080
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.689
just says 99 plus
new messages.

00:46:04.689 --> 00:46:06.048
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:06.048 --> 00:46:09.736
then, they have these little
things 99 plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:09.736 --> 00:46:12.285
NICK BUTCHER: I get
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:12.285 --> 00:46:14.952
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.952 --> 00:46:18.460
and Carlos is suggesting that
maybe we could have some

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.940
helpers with a moderator
badge.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.442
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:21.442 --> 00:46:22.692
communities.

00:46:24.676 --> 00:46:25.140
Yeah.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.230
I guess it kind of takes
on a bit of a forum

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.256
moderator style approach.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:35.800
Yeah.

00:46:37.565 --> 00:46:38.646
[INAUDIBLE] just haven't
noticed.

00:46:38.646 --> 00:46:39.896
They're so relevant.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.325
MATT GAUNT: Does anyone else
have any questions

00:46:45.325 --> 00:46:46.575
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.800
NICK BUTCHER: I'm [? taking ?]
typing.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:07.980
So we're just following a link
[INAUDIBLE], a lot of question

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.940
MATT GAUNT: --which I'm
instantly regretting, which

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:10.920
which I can't see.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.710
NICK BUTCHER: [? Lock ?] screen

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:13.070
orientation of a Dream service.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.045
So Michael has been fiddling
with the Dream service API.

00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:20.980
Michael was in the
Hangout, right?

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.230
Can you ask the question
live [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.010
[BANGING]

00:47:33.124 --> 00:47:35.068
RICHARD HYNDMAN: What's the
first tab at the top?

00:47:35.068 --> 00:47:36.526
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:38.480
MATT GAUNT: Sorry.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.818
NICK BUTCHER: Matt broke it.

00:47:41.818 --> 00:47:43.068
MATT GAUNT: My bad.

00:47:47.806 --> 00:47:51.299
I shant ever do that again.

00:47:59.782 --> 00:48:01.778
[BANGING]

00:48:33.456 --> 00:48:35.444
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm just
watching the live stream

00:48:35.444 --> 00:48:35.936
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:35.936 --> 00:48:39.430
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE] we
had it freeze again.

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:40.354
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:40.354 --> 00:48:41.160
I think we're still live.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:41.640
Yeah.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.510
We're still live, dude.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.500
People are still watching us.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.320
We're in a window somehow.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.860
MATT GAUNT: Hello.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:51.226
We thought we completely
left the Hangout.

00:48:51.226 --> 00:48:52.640
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I just opened
the live stream and realized I

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:53.490
could still see myself.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.110
So, there must have been a
window open somewhere.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.390
Let's not click through
to links [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.830
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:57.880
Not going to do that again.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.180
If you have a question, you
have to type it out.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:00.775
Otherwise, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:00.775 --> 00:49:02.830
RICHARD HYNDMAN: So is Michael
in the Hangout with us, there,

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.080
on the right-hand side?

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.030
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.816
Michael, do you have a
camera or microphone?

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:12.660
I'm guessing not.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.663
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I'm guessing
he's going to say no,

00:49:13.663 --> 00:49:14.609
mic is messed up.

00:49:14.609 --> 00:49:15.082
Sorry.

00:49:15.082 --> 00:49:15.555
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:17.220
RICHARD HYNDMAN: In
this day and age?

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:20.620
Excellent.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:21.740
MATT GAUNT: Should we go for
another moderator question?

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.000
Are there any more moderator
questions?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.095
MATT GAUNT: [INAUDIBLE] got the
actual Stack Overflow in

00:49:27.095 --> 00:49:28.345
the moderator.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.380
I think we've done a few.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.580
NICK BUTCHER: OK.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.660
So we'll worry about Michael's
question from Stack Overflow.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.660
So he's been playing with
the Dream service API.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.440
And would like to lock the
screen orientation to a

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.775
landscape when the Dream service
is shown because he's

00:49:47.775 --> 00:49:50.000
showing widescreen photos
and doesn't want

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.710
to have black bars.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.770
He's tried a number of things
like Set Orientation and using

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.760
Android Screen Orientation
Landscape in the manifest, but

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.660
none have worked.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.220
Which makes me wonder, is
it possible to lock the

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.530
orientation of a
Dream service?

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.750
Have you guys tried this?

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.356
MATT GAUNT: Can't say I have.

00:50:06.356 --> 00:50:08.322
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Not since
the API went public.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.910
[? Previously. ?]

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:19.010
NICK BUTCHER: So, yeah.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.070
That's the difference.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.970
Dream service isn't
quite an activity.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.760
It's similar to an activity, but
not actually an activity.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.990
I'm wondering if you can get the
window manager and ask the

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.830
window managers to do
some stuff for you.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.060
MATT GAUNT: That might be quite
a good way of doing it.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.310
NICK BUTCHER: There's an
unattached window.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.770
So the answer is, we don't
know off-hand.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.500
I'm just thinking out loud.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:44.890
MATT GAUNT: I mean, that would
make sense, though,

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:45.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.183
there is a window feature,
[? wouldn't ?] you?

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:55.550
RICHARD HYNDMAN: All of the
current ones rely on landscape

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.800
or portrait, right?

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.030
NICK BUTCHER: I see in the
comments, Andrew Kelly

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.500
suggesting you could use a
different crop type-- scale

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.146
type-- in your image views so
you don't have the black bars.

00:51:11.146 --> 00:51:11.548
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:51:11.548 --> 00:51:13.666
I think the better solution
would be to make it support

00:51:13.666 --> 00:51:16.630
portrait, to be honest, instead
of just landscape.

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.670
People may want to have
it either way around.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:22.720
And all the current Dreams
do support both.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.190
I'm just making sure that the
current Dream supports both.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.440
Yeah.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.270
MATT GAUNT: I mean, that might
be the option, as well, is

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.265
have multiple images, rather
than just the one.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:43.626
I do believe I tried to mess
with the window manager.

00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:44.100
Yeah.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.130
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:47.670
but the result has only showing
40% of the image

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:48.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.230
scale type.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:53.650
So maybe try doing something
nice with multiple images and

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.220
[? animating ?]

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.910
around when you change--

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:58.050
RICHARD HYNDMAN: But really,
please just try and support

00:51:58.050 --> 00:51:59.260
both orientations.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.430
I mean, [? my dock ?] for Nexus
4 would be portrait.

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.695
And for my Nexus 7 or 10
would be landscape.

00:52:04.695 --> 00:52:08.870
And if I wanted to use your
Dream on both, one of them

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.240
wouldn't be available.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.300
So it'd be nice if you
just supported both.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.650
Let the user choose which way
around they want their device.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.326
MATT GAUNT: Andrew Kelly is
suggesting Ken Burns effect.

00:52:18.326 --> 00:52:19.180
I like it.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.445
Thinking outside the box.

00:52:25.558 --> 00:52:26.560
RICHARD HYNDMAN: OK.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.150
Is there anything in the
moderator that you can see.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.415
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:52:28.415 --> 00:52:29.620
So Andrew asks, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.840
In-app Billing doesn't support
subscriptions.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.250
Are you working on it?

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.185
We're not going to announce
anything, but that sounds like

00:52:36.185 --> 00:52:38.092
a safe assumption.

00:52:38.092 --> 00:52:41.245
[LAUGHING]

00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:42.880
NICK BUTCHER: Again, from Andrew
Kelly, the one-man

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.795
moderating machine, you asked,
in response [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:49.320
piracy question last week,
wasn't it mentioned at Google

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.570
I/O that future [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:55.420
a device.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.100
Say that's correct.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.783
That's the app encryption that
we talked about earlier with

00:52:58.783 --> 00:53:00.196
Giuseppe's question.

00:53:00.196 --> 00:53:02.900
[INAUDIBLE] the Dream
Service question.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.620
Jamie asks, is there a way to
work out the measured height

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:09.180
and width of a text
view [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.000
before it's drawn?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.460
I've tried getting the image
height working [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.146
And then, the length
and height of

00:53:16.146 --> 00:53:17.490
the text using Paint.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:21.335
It's close, but it's
still a bit off.

00:53:21.335 --> 00:53:24.330
If I was going to interpret the
question correctly, you're

00:53:24.330 --> 00:53:27.330
trying to get the measured
height of a view.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.020
But it sounds like you're trying
to get it before it's

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:29.750
actually been measured.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:32.440
So the correct approach, I would
say, rather than trying

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.325
to imitate what the layout
system is doing, is wait until

00:53:35.325 --> 00:53:36.380
it's actually been measured.

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.330
And then, get it.

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:39.855
So if you look at something
called the View Tree Observer

00:53:39.855 --> 00:53:40.540
[? class, ?]

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.930
you can get a View
Tree Observer for

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:44.510
your current activity.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:46.200
And attach [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:46.950
global layout.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.330
I think that's the name
of the event.

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:53.470
So you can get a callback once
it's done the laying out and

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.150
measuring [? parse ?]
of your application?

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.516
So at that point, once the
measuring is completed, you

00:53:57.516 --> 00:54:00.850
can then query your view to get
the pixel size, once it's

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:01.470
been measured.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.640
So I'd say, do that, rather
than trying to imitate the

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.240
layout system.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:08.538
MATT GAUNT: Good call.

00:54:08.538 --> 00:54:09.024
NICK BUTCHER: Done that one.

00:54:09.024 --> 00:54:09.510
Done that one.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:10.970
Done that one.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:11.320
Cool.

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:15.030
Andrew Kelly asks, when creating
entries in the

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.700
device's [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:19.770
done directly, rather than
[INAUDIBLE], is there a way to

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:23.484
include HTML links or
image attachments?

00:54:23.484 --> 00:54:24.408
Do [? you got the answer? ?]

00:54:24.408 --> 00:54:25.320
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I don't.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.720
I haven't [? gotten to the ?]
extras you can [? put. ?]

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.480
NICK BUTCHER: And so my gut
feeling is, I think that you

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.560
only have access to the notes
field, in which case, you can

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.200
put any text, but I don't
think you can actually

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.500
[? mark ?] it up in any way.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.170
I don't believe.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.630
What happens if you put
a link in there.

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:42.190
I haven't tried it.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.590
RICHARD HYNDMAN: I see
Andrew has tried it.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:46.250
He's typing now.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.448
And [INAUDIBLE] not marked up.

00:54:52.964 --> 00:54:59.390
Any markup I supplied just
gets rendered as text.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:00.800
Fair enough.

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.990
layout URLs.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.962
MATT GAUNT: Aw, sad face.

00:55:08.962 --> 00:55:11.420
NICK BUTCHER: And I'm not
trying [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:13.955 --> 00:55:16.200
MATT GAUNT: If you're getting
access to the content provider

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.550
to put the entries into the
calendar stuff, if you could

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.940
get access to another calendar
entry in the content provider,

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:29.531
then maybe you could find out
what the official one does.

00:55:29.531 --> 00:55:29.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:32.090
Create an event through the
web URLs [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:32.982
put a link in it.

00:55:32.982 --> 00:55:34.250
And see how it gets saved.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.383
Could be interesting.

00:55:35.383 --> 00:55:37.190
MATT GAUNT: That's, obviously,
depending whether you can get

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.370
access to it from the
Android side or not.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:40.275
NICK BUTCHER: Should
be able to.

00:55:40.275 --> 00:55:40.740
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.990
In which case, do that.

00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:44.960
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:45.665
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:45.665 --> 00:55:49.200
or look at the source code.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:49.458
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:50.300
There you go.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:51.590
Because then, you should
be able to see what the

00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:51.910
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.050
[? does, as ?] well.

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:54.994
Yeah.

00:55:54.994 --> 00:55:55.990
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Check
the source.

00:55:55.990 --> 00:56:00.490
I'd like to create a link to
re-launch an app when clicked

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:03.702
from a calendar entry.

00:56:03.702 --> 00:56:04.700
Fair enough.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.180
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:05.926
I think you can do that.

00:56:05.926 --> 00:56:07.402
I think that's what [INAUDIBLE]
did, right, when

00:56:07.402 --> 00:56:08.740
they re-did it?

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.695
MATT GAUNT: Well, I guess that's
getting it to launch an

00:56:11.695 --> 00:56:12.610
app from a URL.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:13.870
You could do it [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:14.790
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
filter.

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.770
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.080
NICK BUTCHER: Carlos in Madrid
says, are we going to see a

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.250
better API for official
functionality for gaming apps.

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:26.760
That then, falls into the
not commenting on future

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:27.250
[INAUDIBLE] announcements.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.100
So, sorry.

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:28.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:29.864
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:29.864 --> 00:56:30.860
NICK BUTCHER: Oh.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.340
That's [INAUDIBLE], you
did read ahead.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:33.980
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Ah.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.220
Yes.

00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.910
You didn't think I picked
him out of [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:38.046
country, city.

00:56:38.046 --> 00:56:41.360
Is France a country?

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.550
NICK BUTCHER: And seeing as
we're running out of time,

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.810
we'll give the people live in
the Hangout a last, final

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:48.930
chance to ask any questions
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:50.260
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Final
chance this year.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.530
NICK BUTCHER: --ask or add or
say goodbye or anything?

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:59.780
TAL: I've got [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:00.940
NICK BUTCHER: Go ahead,
[? Tal. ?]

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:01.021
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:57:01.021 --> 00:57:04.830
I had a question about how
to set up the [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:07.590
display on a Nexus 4.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.700
Is there a certain app that
you need to download?

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.540
Or is it just you need an
adaptor on a TV, and it

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.290
automatically sticks?

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:16.213
NICK BUTCHER: It's under the
Display setting, right?

00:57:16.213 --> 00:57:16.706
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Yeah.

00:57:16.706 --> 00:57:18.924
Under Display, you just turn
Wi-Fi displays on, and then it

00:57:18.924 --> 00:57:21.050
appears in your Quick Settings
menu, the two finger drag down

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:25.006
[INAUDIBLE]-- it's actually the
one finger [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:25.006 --> 00:57:25.470
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.985
So if you go to Displays on
your Settings app, there's

00:57:27.985 --> 00:57:31.290
[INAUDIBLE] options
[? as what ?] is displayed.

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:33.838
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:57:33.838 --> 00:57:36.320
NICK BUTCHER: And once it's
on, then you should get an

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.530
option in the Quick
Settings menu.

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:40.030
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.030
RICHARD HYNDMAN: And
you can tap it.

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:42.730
And it'll tell you if there's
displays detected.

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.458
And if there are, you
just connect.

00:57:44.458 --> 00:57:45.386
And you're off.

00:57:45.386 --> 00:57:45.850
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:46.693
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Good to go.

00:57:46.693 --> 00:57:48.142
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:48.142 --> 00:57:49.108
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE]
display.

00:57:49.108 --> 00:57:50.074
RICHARD HYNDMAN: [INAUDIBLE]
display.

00:57:50.074 --> 00:57:51.040
Nice.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.814
And I can't wait to get myself
a dongle and try it out.

00:57:53.814 --> 00:57:56.070
Hopefully we'll have
a lot more on the

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:58.200
market in Q1 next year.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.860
NICK BUTCHER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:58.860 --> 00:57:59.810
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Different
companies.

00:57:59.810 --> 00:57:59.980
Yeah.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:01.815
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:01.815 --> 00:58:03.920
MALE SPEAKER: I have a laptop
that has [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.670
capabilities, but I'm not able
to detect the laptop, as far

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.514
as a wireless display.

00:58:10.514 --> 00:58:11.840
RICHARD HYNDMAN: No.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.170
OK.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.470
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.700
two different, most likely,
different standards, at least.

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:17.970
MALE SPEAKER: Oh.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:19.560
It's a little bit different?

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.750
RICHARD HYNDMAN: They're
probably both transmitting

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.300
devices, not receiving
devices.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.570
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:25.940
Yeah.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.400
So the laptop is not
a receiving device?

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.260
RICHARD HYNDMAN: Right.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:30.270
You can't just broadcast--

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.610
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:31.705
NICK BUTCHER:
[? Same reason you ?] can't

00:58:31.705 --> 00:58:34.096
see your laptop screen on your
phone, I don't think.

00:58:34.096 --> 00:58:36.710
RICHARD HYNDMAN: It would
be quit fun, though.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:37.710
Anyway.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:38.900
All right, guys.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.980
I think we'll call it
to a close there.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.690
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:42.158
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:58:42.158 --> 00:58:43.562
Well, Happy Holidays.

00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:45.580
Like we said, this is the
last one this year.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.980
We'll be back in the New
Year, at some point.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:49.393
And we'll announce when.

00:58:49.393 --> 00:58:49.957
But, yeah.

00:58:49.957 --> 00:58:50.650
Thank you very much.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.810
And have a good break.
