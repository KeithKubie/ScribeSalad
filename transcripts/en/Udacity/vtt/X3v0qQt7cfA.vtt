Joanna, thank you so much for coming in

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.790
and going through my 23andme report with, with us

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.986
and with all of you out there. Is that

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.170
pretty much all there is to the 23andme report?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.860
&gt;&gt; No, we just scratched the surface. there are all kinds

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.329
of tools that you could use to go deeper into your health

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.860
and deeper into your ancestry. and one in particular, a tool called

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.400
DNA Relatives allows you to connect with people with whom you share

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.320
DNA, people in the 23andme database. And you can

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.600
discover new relatives and really flesh out your family tree.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.490
&gt;&gt; Now that sounds like a really cool feature. And we're

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.400
going to use it in lesson 11. So all of you

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.530
should stay tuned because we're going to discover if Sterling Tadlock,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.900
our adopted individual, can find any biological family members of his own.
