a look at some apps so we've got a few
what we're going to try get through as

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150
what we're going to try get through as
 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.970
what we're going to try get through as
many of these as we can and they

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
many of these as we can and they
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.800
many of these as we can and they
represent quite a very large variation

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810
represent quite a very large variation
 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.000
represent quite a very large variation
in app type so I think it's fair to say

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
in app type so I think it's fair to say
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.500
in app type so I think it's fair to say
yeah i think you know we talked about

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510
yeah i think you know we talked about
 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.300
yeah i think you know we talked about
financial apps and i think that our

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310
financial apps and i think that our
 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.460
financial apps and i think that our
viewers took that a lot of different

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
viewers took that a lot of different
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.800
viewers took that a lot of different
ways absolutely um everything from app

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
ways absolutely um everything from app
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.690
ways absolutely um everything from app

exactly which i noticed that you haven't

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690
exactly which i noticed that you haven't
 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.560
exactly which i noticed that you haven't
installed maybe you didn't realize that

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570
installed maybe you didn't realize that
 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.180

it's all about managing your finances
this is sort of a metaphor that's

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050
this is sort of a metaphor that's
 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.810
this is sort of a metaphor that's
interesting well i did see the game and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820
interesting well i did see the game and
 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
interesting well i did see the game and
I thought this is a game well you might

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830
I thought this is a game well you might
 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.210
I thought this is a game well you might
have it is a game in the same way that

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
have it is a game in the same way that
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.330
have it is a game in the same way that
light life is a game yeah in fact it's a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
light life is a game yeah in fact it's a
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.830

disappointed that no one's nominated the
 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.509
disappointed that no one's nominated the
game of life because I guess would have

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519
game of life because I guess would have
 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.979
game of life because I guess would have
been an interesting opportunity indeed

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989
been an interesting opportunity indeed
 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.400
been an interesting opportunity indeed
oh so why don't we taking a short look

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
oh so why don't we taking a short look
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.250
oh so why don't we taking a short look
at absence absolutely uh this is a I

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260
at absence absolutely uh this is a I
 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.379

guess its financial and way but not

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389
guess its financial and way but not
 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.630
guess its financial and way but not
quite the way we it's about saving money

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640
quite the way we it's about saving money
 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.460

this is kind of an interesting we think

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370
this is kind of an interesting we think
 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.570
this is kind of an interesting we think
that it might skirt the line on on

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580
that it might skirt the line on on
 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.930
that it might skirt the line on on

google play store policies so but what
 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.420
google play store policies so but what
it does is it tracks the the prices the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
it does is it tracks the the prices the

it does is it tracks the the prices the

you know that's okay you know we're
 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.040
you know that's okay you know we're
seeing a lot of this right now we're

seeing a lot of this right now we're
 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.600
seeing a lot of this right now we're
seeing a lot of fake action bars why do

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
seeing a lot of fake action bars why do
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.190
seeing a lot of fake action bars why do

you think that it's probably because

that said I think what's what's

action bar works the way that you would

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
action bar works the way that you would
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.550
action bar works the way that you would
expect it to

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560
expect it to
 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.960
expect it to
the only feedback I'd give in this

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970
the only feedback I'd give in this
 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.850
the only feedback I'd give in this
particular instance is to be careful

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860
particular instance is to be careful
 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.790
particular instance is to be careful
about the icons the style of the icons

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800
about the icons the style of the icons
 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.010
about the icons the style of the icons
that you're using and so in this case

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020
that you're using and so in this case
 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.780
that you're using and so in this case
they're they're using sort of the themed

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790
they're they're using sort of the themed
 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.870
they're they're using sort of the themed
the icons so that they you know sort of

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880
the icons so that they you know sort of
 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.270
the icons so that they you know sort of
faded into the action bar itself it's an

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280
faded into the action bar itself it's an
 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.320
faded into the action bar itself it's an
interesting approach but that's

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
interesting approach but that's
 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.700
interesting approach but that's
immediately what makes it obvious that

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710
immediately what makes it obvious that
 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.770
immediately what makes it obvious that
this isn't you know a standard action

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780
this isn't you know a standard action
 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.510
this isn't you know a standard action
bar so I would have a look at the design

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520
bar so I would have a look at the design
 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.659
bar so I would have a look at the design
side and stick to the design guidelines

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669
side and stick to the design guidelines
 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.909
side and stick to the design guidelines
in terms of your icons right so I think

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919
in terms of your icons right so I think
 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.330
in terms of your icons right so I think
what we've over and over is that if you

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340
what we've over and over is that if you
 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010
what we've over and over is that if you
have a great design idea that doesn't

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020
have a great design idea that doesn't
 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.480
have a great design idea that doesn't
fit into our design guidelines by all

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490
fit into our design guidelines by all
 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.879
fit into our design guidelines by all
means use it but if you're trying to

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889
means use it but if you're trying to
 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:14.610
means use it but if you're trying to
mimic something that the Android design

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620
mimic something that the Android design
 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.460
mimic something that the Android design
guidelines already cover and it looks

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470
guidelines already cover and it looks
 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.080
guidelines already cover and it looks
enough like a standard Android feature

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090
enough like a standard Android feature
 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.230
enough like a standard Android feature
that people might think it is then don't

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240
that people might think it is then don't
 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.210
that people might think it is then don't
make it work differently and you

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220
make it work differently and you
 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.230
make it work differently and you
preferably don't make it look

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240
preferably don't make it look
 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.300
preferably don't make it look
particularly exactly i think that's the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310
particularly exactly i think that's the
 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.379
particularly exactly i think that's the
key here it's like if you want to do

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389
key here it's like if you want to do
 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:29.909
key here it's like if you want to do
something radically different and that's

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919
something radically different and that's
 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.310
something radically different and that's
a fantastic idea you know we love to see

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320
a fantastic idea you know we love to see
 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.780
a fantastic idea you know we love to see
really innovative designs but if you're

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790
really innovative designs but if you're
 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.090
really innovative designs but if you're
doing something which is supposed to

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100
doing something which is supposed to
 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.460
doing something which is supposed to
which looks like an action bar or any

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470
which looks like an action bar or any
 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.290
which looks like an action bar or any
other sort of system element it should

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300
other sort of system element it should
 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.270
other sort of system element it should
it should behave the same way and should

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280
it should behave the same way and should
 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.710
it should behave the same way and should
look as close to it as possible so that

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720
look as close to it as possible so that
 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.810
look as close to it as possible so that
you're not sort of getting thrown right

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820
you're not sort of getting thrown right
 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.670
you're not sort of getting thrown right
now speaking of icons I think that's

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680
now speaking of icons I think that's
 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.560
now speaking of icons I think that's
actually my biggest concern about this

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570
actually my biggest concern about this
 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.180
actually my biggest concern about this
appellation i should say right off the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190
appellation i should say right off the
 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.370
appellation i should say right off the
top I love this out I'm sorry the value

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380
top I love this out I'm sorry the value
 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.590
top I love this out I'm sorry the value
that this app exists I love the idea

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600
that this app exists I love the idea

behind it but there's one thing that I
 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.510

am concerned about and that is that the
 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.020
am concerned about and that is that the
app is using these icons which represent

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:21.860
universal application things like
 

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.740
universal application things like
settings back up and the support page if

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:23.750
settings back up and the support page if
 

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.820
settings back up and the support page if
you have them anywhere you may as well

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:24.830
you have them anywhere you may as well
 

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.440
you have them anywhere you may as well
have them everywhere I think that makes

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.450
have them everywhere I think that makes
 

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.340
have them everywhere I think that makes
it easy you don't want to have to

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.350
it easy you don't want to have to
 

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.990
it easy you don't want to have to
navigate your app to figure out where

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000
navigate your app to figure out where
 

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.910
navigate your app to figure out where
you can get to settings gotta feeling

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920
you can get to settings gotta feeling
 

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.240
you can get to settings gotta feeling
that's reasonable but now let's see what

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.250
that's reasonable but now let's see what
 

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.600
that's reasonable but now let's see what
happens okay so cancelled okay so once

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:37.610
happens okay so cancelled okay so once
 

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.690

again we had three way no four ways of

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:40.700
again we had three way no four ways of

back key are we coming that the back
 

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.170

affordance down I think just the back

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.180
affordance down I think just the back
 

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.090
affordance down I think just the back
not really sure what affordance even

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:52.100
not really sure what affordance even
 

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.370
not really sure what affordance even
means but it seems really really smart

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:54.380
means but it seems really really smart
 

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.760
means but it seems really really smart
it does it really does so the up

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:57.770
it does it really does so the up

affordance it took us back the back key

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:04.640
affordance it took us back the back key
 

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.490
affordance it took us back the back key

took a break I ended the break and then
 

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.670
took a break I ended the break and then
I had to describe the break but then I

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680
I had to describe the break but then I
 

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.440
I had to describe the break but then I
can't feel like describing the brakes so

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:29.450
can't feel like describing the brakes so
 

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.140
can't feel like describing the brakes so
just laughed but now did I not take a

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.150
just laughed but now did I not take a
 

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.450
just laughed but now did I not take a
break or do I just not have the break

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:34.460
break or do I just not have the break
 

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.540

to go ahead and assume that the way we

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:47.570
to go ahead and assume that the way we
 

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.850
to go ahead and assume that the way we
have done the bottom here some sort of

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:48.860
have done the bottom here some sort of
 

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.120
have done the bottom here some sort of
report

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.130
report
 

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.670
report
that's not telling me much I'm gonna

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680
that's not telling me much I'm gonna
 

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.430
that's not telling me much I'm gonna
drop that back down well well what if

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440
drop that back down well well what if
 

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.900
drop that back down well well what if
what if we stopped working when we be

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:57.910
what if we stopped working when we be
 

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.020
what if we stopped working when we be
able to let's stop working okay all

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.030
able to let's stop working okay all
 

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.000
able to let's stop working okay all
right good so now it's asking us what

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.010
right good so now it's asking us what
 

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.720
right good so now it's asking us what
work have you done it's a fair question

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:05.730
work have you done it's a fair question
 

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.990
work have you done it's a fair question
hmm let's just that because I have a

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000
hmm let's just that because I have a
 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.750
hmm let's just that because I have a
suspicion that if I hit back or up or

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760
suspicion that if I hit back or up or
 

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.640
suspicion that if I hit back or up or
anything I'd lemongrass a but it's going

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:14.650
anything I'd lemongrass a but it's going
 

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.890
anything I'd lemongrass a but it's going
to lose the work that I've done so we

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:16.900
to lose the work that I've done so we
 

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.150
to lose the work that I've done so we
should have about six minutes of work

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160
should have about six minutes of work
 

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.030
should have about six minutes of work
there we hit save we go in task save so

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.040
there we hit save we go in task save so
 

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.130
there we hit save we go in task save so
we've got let's have a look on breaks so

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.140
we've got let's have a look on breaks so
 

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.949
we've got let's have a look on breaks so
indeed both both brakes of minus a

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959
indeed both both brakes of minus a
 

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:28.140
indeed both both brakes of minus a
minute I think maybe it can manipulate

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.150
minute I think maybe it can manipulate
 

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:34.740
minute I think maybe it can manipulate
time oh they can't possibly mean

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:34.750
time oh they can't possibly mean
 

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.690
time oh they can't possibly mean
negative i think what it's saying is

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:36.700
negative i think what it's saying is
 

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.680
negative i think what it's saying is
that so this is essentially like double

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:39.690
that so this is essentially like double
 

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.870
that so this is essentially like double
accounting so this is minus a minute in

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880
accounting so this is minus a minute in
 

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.910
accounting so this is minus a minute in
that it's a minute away for a total of a

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:44.920
that it's a minute away for a total of a
 

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.590
that it's a minute away for a total of a
little slow right so this makes sense

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600
little slow right so this makes sense
 

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.900
little slow right so this makes sense
but in the way that is described here

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:48.910
but in the way that is described here
 

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.520
but in the way that is described here
it's kind of backwards so i understand

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:50.530
it's kind of backwards so i understand
 

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.020
it's kind of backwards so i understand
from your accounting perspective that it

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.030
from your accounting perspective that it
 

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.910
from your accounting perspective that it
represents a negative number but in

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:53.920
represents a negative number but in
 

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.220
represents a negative number but in
terms of breaks i'm looking at this

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.230
terms of breaks i'm looking at this
 

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.380
terms of breaks i'm looking at this
going how am i spending minus time on a

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:58.390
going how am i spending minus time on a
 

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.360
going how am i spending minus time on a
morir so you should probably make sure

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.370
morir so you should probably make sure
 

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.850
morir so you should probably make sure
that everything is in the correct you

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:02.860
that everything is in the correct you
 

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.650
that everything is in the correct you
know orientation is well wonderful ways

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:04.660
know orientation is well wonderful ways
 

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:10.200
know orientation is well wonderful ways
don't say detailing yeah see you're

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:10.210
don't say detailing yeah see you're
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.180
don't say detailing yeah see you're
right that it's it's very similar w

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.190
right that it's it's very similar w
 

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.880
right that it's it's very similar w
double column accounting but the thing

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:14.890
double column accounting but the thing
 

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.020
double column accounting but the thing
that makes double count I'll calm

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.030
that makes double count I'll calm
 

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.000
that makes double count I'll calm
accounting understandable is that there

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.010
accounting understandable is that there
 

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.340
accounting understandable is that there
are in fact your columns yeah that's

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.350
are in fact your columns yeah that's
 

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.450
are in fact your columns yeah that's
kind of the case so you can only really

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:21.460
kind of the case so you can only really
 

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.610
kind of the case so you can only really
you know it makes it appropriate if you

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:23.620
you know it makes it appropriate if you
 

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.530
you know it makes it appropriate if you
have sort of your work time and your

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:25.540
have sort of your work time and your
 

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.660
have sort of your work time and your
brakes next to each other then it makes

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:27.670
brakes next to each other then it makes
 

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.510
brakes next to each other then it makes
sense if not as in here it kind of

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520
sense if not as in here it kind of
 

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.020
sense if not as in here it kind of
doesn't need no expenses no also details

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.030
doesn't need no expenses no also details
 

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.420
doesn't need no expenses no also details
etc so I think the key piece of

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:36.430
etc so I think the key piece of
 

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.740
etc so I think the key piece of
information from what we've looked at

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:37.750
information from what we've looked at
 

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.720
information from what we've looked at
here is really that you want to make it

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:39.730
here is really that you want to make it
 

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.340
here is really that you want to make it
obvious to the user what their actions

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:41.350
obvious to the user what their actions
 

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.350
obvious to the user what their actions
are going to do so in this case even

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360
are going to do so in this case even
 

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.510
are going to do so in this case even
though we hit cancel and it said that

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520
though we hit cancel and it said that
 

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.340
though we hit cancel and it said that
the action which we had tried to perform

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.350
the action which we had tried to perform
 

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.500
the action which we had tried to perform
had been cancelled it hadn't been right

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:49.510
had been cancelled it hadn't been right
 

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.940
had been cancelled it hadn't been right
it's still here we still have the brake

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:50.950
it's still here we still have the brake
 

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.160
it's still here we still have the brake
which is frankly what the user wants and

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.170
which is frankly what the user wants and
 

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.590
which is frankly what the user wants and
expects and so we're glad that it does

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600
expects and so we're glad that it does
 

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.080
expects and so we're glad that it does
behaves this way

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.090
behaves this way
 

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.430
behaves this way
don't tell me that it's cancelled if

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440
don't tell me that it's cancelled if
 

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.870
don't tell me that it's cancelled if
it's not cancelled really all you're

00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880
it's not cancelled really all you're
 

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.110
it's not cancelled really all you're
saying here is you didn't put in a

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120
saying here is you didn't put in a
 

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.840
saying here is you didn't put in a
description and frankly the the use case

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:05.850
description and frankly the the use case
 

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:06.980
description and frankly the the use case
where you're going to want to go in

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:06.990
where you're going to want to go in
 

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.710
where you're going to want to go in
there and not n type something and then

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720
there and not n type something and then
 

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.240
there and not n type something and then
not keep whatever you've typed is pretty

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.250
not keep whatever you've typed is pretty
 

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.590
not keep whatever you've typed is pretty
much pretty close to zero right yeah

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600
much pretty close to zero right yeah
 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.910
much pretty close to zero right yeah
well especially if you have the ability

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:13.920
well especially if you have the ability
 

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.830
well especially if you have the ability
at it afterwards precise it you can

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840
at it afterwards precise it you can
 

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.690
at it afterwards precise it you can
always change it so it sort of really in

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700
always change it so it sort of really in
 

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.370
always change it so it sort of really in
that case it should only be there should

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380
that case it should only be there should
 

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.780
that case it should only be there should
only be one thing you can do there which

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:20.790
only be one thing you can do there which
 

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.760
only be one thing you can do there which
is basically edit that break which is

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:22.770
is basically edit that break which is
 

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.050
is basically edit that break which is
exactly what you're doing so you want to

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.060
exactly what you're doing so you want to
 

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.940
exactly what you're doing so you want to
edit it and then return back to where

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:25.950
edit it and then return back to where
 

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.040
edit it and then return back to where
you were so you don't need you don't

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.050
you were so you don't need you don't
 

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.600
you were so you don't need you don't
need to confirm save you don't need to

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:29.610
need to confirm save you don't need to
 

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.250
need to confirm save you don't need to
cancel you don't need to do anything

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260
cancel you don't need to do anything
 

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.080
cancel you don't need to do anything
other than be able to exit back so it

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.090
other than be able to exit back so it
 

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.430
other than be able to exit back so it
should really just you know everything

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440
should really just you know everything
 

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.660
should really just you know everything
should take you back one step and

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:35.670
should take you back one step and
 

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.390
should take you back one step and
successfully safe yeah exactly so the

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400
successfully safe yeah exactly so the
 

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.790
successfully safe yeah exactly so the
other thing so if we you know I wouldn't

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:40.800
other thing so if we you know I wouldn't
 

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.850
other thing so if we you know I wouldn't
mind also the ability to I mean if I'm

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860
mind also the ability to I mean if I'm
 

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.590
mind also the ability to I mean if I'm
gonna keep track of breaks like that

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600
gonna keep track of breaks like that
 

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.920
gonna keep track of breaks like that

glad that I don't work on a job that

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:54.890
glad that I don't work on a job that
 

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.530
glad that I don't work on a job that
where that is even remotely necessary

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:57.540
where that is even remotely necessary

where that is even remotely necessary
what if I did I wouldn't want to type I

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360
what if I did I wouldn't want to type I
 

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.360

tools because I've seen a lot of them
 

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:11.620

less interaction they take the better
 

00:21:14.179 --> 00:21:16.330

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:30.950
exactly the same principle you don't
 

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.799
exactly the same principle you don't
want to have to do much really the only

do you say I'm switching to another task
and frankly you don't even necessarily

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:37.970
and frankly you don't even necessarily
 

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.779
and frankly you don't even necessarily
want to say what that task is at the

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:40.789
want to say what that task is at the
 

00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:42.850
want to say what that task is at the
time you just want to hit one button and

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:42.860
time you just want to hit one button and
 

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.860

out three different time sheets at
 

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.549
out three different time sheets at
half-hour intervals so that was fun I

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559
half-hour intervals so that was fun I
 

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:05.830
half-hour intervals so that was fun I
haven't filled out a timesheet since I

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840
haven't filled out a timesheet since I
 

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.850

quite like here is that as you're
putting through all of the details you

00:22:57.229 --> 00:22:57.239
putting through all of the details you
 

00:22:57.239 --> 00:22:59.239
putting through all of the details you
can actually hit this button and it'll

00:22:59.239 --> 00:22:59.249
can actually hit this button and it'll
 

00:22:59.249 --> 00:23:01.249
can actually hit this button and it'll
figure out the office details for you

00:23:01.249 --> 00:23:01.259
figure out the office details for you
 

00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:03.199

which makes me in 25 Charleston we are

00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:05.339
which makes me in 25 Charleston we are
 

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:08.239
which makes me in 25 Charleston we are
but I'm going to give it that okay what

00:23:08.239 --> 00:23:08.249
but I'm going to give it that okay what
 

00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:10.180
but I'm going to give it that okay what
it might also be even more useful is to

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.190
it might also be even more useful is to
 

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.820
it might also be even more useful is to
do a geocoding reverse lookup and figure

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:13.830
do a geocoding reverse lookup and figure
 

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.469

interested in the company than then i am
in the actual specific location but as I

00:23:23.989 --> 00:23:23.999
in the actual specific location but as I
 

00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:27.560
in the actual specific location but as I
wanted to highlight this so now see I

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:27.570
wanted to highlight this so now see I
 

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.169
wanted to highlight this so now see I
guess my problem here is that this this

00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179
guess my problem here is that this this
 

00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:31.549
guess my problem here is that this this
navigation so we are using this

00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559
navigation so we are using this
 

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:33.289
navigation so we are using this
appropriately for navigation but it's

00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299
appropriately for navigation but it's
 

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:34.849
appropriately for navigation but it's
not immediately obvious that all of

00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:34.859
not immediately obvious that all of
 

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:36.680
not immediately obvious that all of
these other things exist in export and

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:36.690
these other things exist in export and
 

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.810
these other things exist in export and
files don't really fit that category

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820
files don't really fit that category
 

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.909
files don't really fit that category
they should kind of probably be in the

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919
they should kind of probably be in the
 

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.379
they should kind of probably be in the
overflow menu with something that you

00:23:42.379 --> 00:23:42.389
overflow menu with something that you
 

00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:44.419
overflow menu with something that you
can always get to and so you're really

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:44.429
can always get to and so you're really
 

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:45.979
can always get to and so you're really
only looking at timesheets and projects

00:23:45.979 --> 00:23:45.989
only looking at timesheets and projects
 

00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:48.409
only looking at timesheets and projects
and so I would client so I'm not

00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419
and so I would client so I'm not
 

00:23:48.419 --> 00:23:53.240
and so I would client so I'm not
certainly not endorsing Earth's

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:53.250
 
 

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.340
 
yeah so and I'm certainly not endorsing

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:55.350
yeah so and I'm certainly not endorsing
 

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.140
yeah so and I'm certainly not endorsing
a dashboard pattern but but I think in

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.150
a dashboard pattern but but I think in
 

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.760
a dashboard pattern but but I think in
this instance where you've got this sort

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:58.770
this instance where you've got this sort
 

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.380
this instance where you've got this sort
of amount of space here on your on your

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.390
of amount of space here on your on your
 

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.600
of amount of space here on your on your
homepage effectively it might be useful

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:02.610
homepage effectively it might be useful
 

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.270
homepage effectively it might be useful
to have a way right here of being able

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280
to have a way right here of being able
 

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.830
to have a way right here of being able
to initiate but and that's the thing you

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840
to initiate but and that's the thing you
 

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.730
to initiate but and that's the thing you
can I see ok I've got app clinic um I

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740
can I see ok I've got app clinic um I
 

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.620
can I see ok I've got app clinic um I
drop that down i assume that if i had

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:12.630
drop that down i assume that if i had
 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.090
drop that down i assume that if i had
more projects i would have more things

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100
more projects i would have more things
 

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.940
more projects i would have more things
miss Ross knows jack the thing is when

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:16.950
miss Ross knows jack the thing is when
 

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.650
miss Ross knows jack the thing is when
i'm looking at this that's a natural

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:18.660
i'm looking at this that's a natural
 

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.570
i'm looking at this that's a natural
time for me to be thinking oh I need

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580
time for me to be thinking oh I need
 

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.430
time for me to be thinking oh I need
another ones i wouldn't mind having a

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440
another ones i wouldn't mind having a
 

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.370
another ones i wouldn't mind having a
birthday a new project in there yeah so

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380
birthday a new project in there yeah so
 

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.810
birthday a new project in there yeah so
i think it's it's reasonable to have

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820
i think it's it's reasonable to have
 

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.510
i think it's it's reasonable to have
this here in the navigation both time

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520
this here in the navigation both time
 

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.800
this here in the navigation both time
feed some projects but i think what you

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:30.810
feed some projects but i think what you
 

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.510
feed some projects but i think what you
want here because this is the screen

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520
want here because this is the screen
 

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.760
want here because this is the screen
what is your name what if i just had the

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:34.770
what is your name what if i just had the
 

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.960
what is your name what if i just had the
you know there's a plus but there is a

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:35.970
you know there's a plus but there is a
 

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.910
you know there's a plus but there is a
plus arm it's the wrong post button it

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:37.920
plus arm it's the wrong post button it
 

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.350
plus arm it's the wrong post button it
is it's actually the Bayer Aspirin

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360
is it's actually the Bayer Aspirin
 

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.450
is it's actually the Bayer Aspirin
button it is the mayor has been funny

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460
button it is the mayor has been funny
 

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.810
button it is the mayor has been funny
yeah that's a trademark infringement all

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820
yeah that's a trademark infringement all
 

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.590
yeah that's a trademark infringement all
over the place ah so now I have okay add

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600
over the place ah so now I have okay add
 

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.190
over the place ah so now I have okay add
add task alright i guess i was in the

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200
add task alright i guess i was in the
 

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.530
add task alright i guess i was in the
task view is that so i think the idea

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:54.540
task view is that so i think the idea
 

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.150
task view is that so i think the idea
here is that for every project you have

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:56.160
here is that for every project you have
 

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.370
here is that for every project you have
tasks so necessary that you went and

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380
tasks so necessary that you went and
 

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.110
tasks so necessary that you went and
bought donuts for the app clinic and so

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120
bought donuts for the app clinic and so
 

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.600
bought donuts for the app clinic and so
you add that task into this project that

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:02.610
you add that task into this project that
 

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.370
you add that task into this project that
there's a task that you consistently

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380
there's a task that you consistently
 

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.430
there's a task that you consistently
fail out yes it really is now so yeah so

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440
fail out yes it really is now so yeah so
 

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.050
fail out yes it really is now so yeah so
let's just have a quick look you can add

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:09.060
let's just have a quick look you can add
 

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.330
let's just have a quick look you can add
tags what work ever made none I've

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340
tags what work ever made none I've
 

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.780
tags what work ever made none I've
failed about location feeling pretty sad

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.790
failed about location feeling pretty sad
 

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.220
failed about location feeling pretty sad
about it not quite sure what the feeling

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:16.230
about it not quite sure what the feeling
 

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.210
about it not quite sure what the feeling
is for but I kind of like it and there's

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220
is for but I kind of like it and there's
 

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.580
is for but I kind of like it and there's
no way to just so there's no description

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:22.590
no way to just so there's no description
 

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.170
no way to just so there's no description
or anything else for the for this task

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:24.180
or anything else for the for this task
 

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.750
or anything else for the for this task
is just basically the description the

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760
is just basically the description the
 

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.920
is just basically the description the
summary where I hit save

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:30.930
 
 

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.540
 
so again it's not it's not entirely

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:33.550
so again it's not it's not entirely
 

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:38.330
so again it's not it's not entirely
clear what that means if we go back here

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340
clear what that means if we go back here
 

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.090
clear what that means if we go back here
it seems like I've gone back twice

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:42.100
it seems like I've gone back twice
 

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.000
it seems like I've gone back twice
projects so now the navigation is broken

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.010
projects so now the navigation is broken
 

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.710
projects so now the navigation is broken
I'm sort of like wait I didn't navigate

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720
I'm sort of like wait I didn't navigate
 

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.750
I'm sort of like wait I didn't navigate
that many parts in and this task that I

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760
that many parts in and this task that I
 

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.700
that many parts in and this task that I
just said where does it live what does

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:51.710
just said where does it live what does
 

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.980
just said where does it live what does
it do do I need to have been working in

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:53.990
it do do I need to have been working in
 

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.070
it do do I need to have been working in
order to create the task so the the way

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080
order to create the task so the the way
 

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.250
order to create the task so the the way
that all the things join together how do

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.260
that all the things join together how do
 

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.440
that all the things join together how do
projects and tasks and breaks and work

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:02.450
projects and tasks and breaks and work
 

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.090
projects and tasks and breaks and work
how does that all fit together it should

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.100
how does that all fit together it should
 

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.620
how does that all fit together it should
be obvious I shouldn't have to figure it

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:05.630
be obvious I shouldn't have to figure it
 

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.350
be obvious I shouldn't have to figure it
out because as he instead I don't want

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360
out because as he instead I don't want
 

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.760
out because as he instead I don't want
to have to fill out a timesheet to begin

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:09.770
to have to fill out a timesheet to begin
 

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.080
to have to fill out a timesheet to begin
with I'm only doing this either because

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.090
with I'm only doing this either because
 

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.630
with I'm only doing this either because
my employer requires it or because I

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640
my employer requires it or because I
 

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.950
my employer requires it or because I
need to be able to keep track of who the

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960
need to be able to keep track of who the
 

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.590
need to be able to keep track of who the
bill right and the so you want to do as

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600
bill right and the so you want to do as
 

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.910
bill right and the so you want to do as
little thinking as possible when it

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:18.920
little thinking as possible when it
 

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.010
little thinking as possible when it
comes to to filling in that so you want

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.020
comes to to filling in that so you want
 

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:22.360
comes to to filling in that so you want
to have a really clear flow of

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:22.370
to have a really clear flow of
 

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.040
to have a really clear flow of
navigation through each of those tasks

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.050
navigation through each of those tasks
 

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.290
navigation through each of those tasks
and I think you know as a homepage this

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:26.300
and I think you know as a homepage this
 

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.169
and I think you know as a homepage this
is really nice it shows you what you're

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:29.179
is really nice it shows you what you're
 

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:30.880
is really nice it shows you what you're
working on and sort of one click to

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:30.890
working on and sort of one click to
 

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.500
working on and sort of one click to
start which is great and so if you can

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.510
start which is great and so if you can
 

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.600
start which is great and so if you can
have ways to to link to new projects and

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:34.610
have ways to to link to new projects and
 

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.700
have ways to to link to new projects and
new tasks as appropriate directly from

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:36.710
new tasks as appropriate directly from
 

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.590
new tasks as appropriate directly from
that I think you're onto something and

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600
that I think you're onto something and
 

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.100
that I think you're onto something and
you also i think want to you want to

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.110
you also i think want to you want to
 

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.780
you also i think want to you want to
simplify this navigation so once you get

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:43.790
simplify this navigation so once you get
 

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.580
simplify this navigation so once you get
into the project side it all starts to

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:45.590
into the project side it all starts to

something which when I was experimenting
with various Google a POS before I

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:22.340
with various Google a POS before I
 

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.820

joined Google it did exactly that so

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:24.830
joined Google it did exactly that so
 

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.990
joined Google it did exactly that so
it's a actually saved everything

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000
it's a actually saved everything
 

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.880
it's a actually saved everything
straight into google calendar so you can

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:27.890
straight into google calendar so you can
 

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.650
straight into google calendar so you can
see exactly what task you performed and

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:29.660

then there's a script that ran on a

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.070
then there's a script that ran on a
 

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.440
then there's a script that ran on a
server which passed the calendar and

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.450
server which passed the calendar and
 

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.900
server which passed the calendar and
created a a google doc spreadsheet which

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:34.910
created a a google doc spreadsheet which
 

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.760
created a a google doc spreadsheet which
was the actual time sheet that is really

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:36.770
was the actual time sheet that is really

cool which was tidy and you know i like
 

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.030
cool which was tidy and you know i like
that because it meant that I could you

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:40.040
that because it meant that I could you
 

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.919
that because it meant that I could you
know record the information on my phone

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:41.929

but then when it came to actually saving
it and producing it and printing it out

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.620
it and producing it and printing it out
 

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.680
it and producing it and printing it out
it was all done you know in the cloud so

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:47.690
it was all done you know in the cloud so
 

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.690

up to my Google Calendar like that
 

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.419
up to my Google Calendar like that
because I think it would it would

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:52.429
because I think it would it would
 

00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:54.820

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:08.110
at least you get those two hours it's
important so yeah I think that would be

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120
important so yeah I think that would be
 

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.269

so you know in fact I think in this in

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:47.789
so you know in fact I think in this in

to point it out you know first the
 

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.560
to point it out you know first the
action bar of course is just as useful

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:36.570
action bar of course is just as useful
 

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.290
action bar of course is just as useful
as a woman is to say no particular well

as a woman is to say no particular well
not as much and then they have this this

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.050
not as much and then they have this this
 

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.020
not as much and then they have this this
area over here on the left now that's

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.030
area over here on the left now that's
 

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.990
area over here on the left now that's
really interesting to me um it's it's

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000
really interesting to me um it's it's
 

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.470
really interesting to me um it's it's
unconventional I don't dislike it I find

unconventional I don't dislike it I find
 

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.900
unconventional I don't dislike it I find
it to be useful but there is actually a

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:53.910
it to be useful but there is actually a
 

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.810
it to be useful but there is actually a
pattern which we just added which is

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820
pattern which we just added which is
 

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.339

called they help me out here the drawer
 

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.109
called they help me out here the drawer
the drawer absolutely yeah if you look

00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119
the drawer absolutely yeah if you look
 

00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:03.400
the drawer absolutely yeah if you look
for the drawer pattern I you've seen

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:03.410
for the drawer pattern I you've seen
 

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.510

to be added to the design pattern so the
 

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.180
to be added to the design pattern so the
design team sat down looked at all of

design team sat down looked at all of
 

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.930

the variations on this and sort of try

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940
the variations on this and sort of try
 

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.109
the variations on this and sort of try

to be a fragment inside here I think

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:27.510
to be a fragment inside here I think
 

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.640
to be a fragment inside here I think
that makes a ton more sense yeah I I

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:30.650
that makes a ton more sense yeah I I
 

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.320

would like the invoices to be listed
over on the left whereas right now I

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640
over on the left whereas right now I
 

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.720
over on the left whereas right now I
think this is more you know most likely

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:38.730
think this is more you know most likely
 

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.520
think this is more you know most likely
it's going to be all the vices yeah and

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:40.530
it's going to be all the vices yeah and
 

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.680
it's going to be all the vices yeah and
I think that that's really what we've

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:42.690
I think that that's really what we've
 

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.100
I think that that's really what we've
been getting at is in general this is

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.110
been getting at is in general this is
 

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.860
been getting at is in general this is
you know I would call this like the the

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:47.870
you know I would call this like the the
 

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.260
you know I would call this like the the

on something where you've got this sort
of folder idea over on the left and then

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:56.850
of folder idea over on the left and then
 

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:02.690
of folder idea over on the left and then
a list view on the right and that that

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700
a list view on the right and that that
 

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.570
a list view on the right and that that
almost never feels right to me no it's

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:05.580
almost never feels right to me no it's
 

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.130
almost never feels right to me no it's
not it's not quite right not oh no not

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140
not it's not quite right not oh no not

about things being sort of in this
 

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.080
about things being sort of in this
hierarchical folder structure there's

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.090
hierarchical folder structure there's
 

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.700
hierarchical folder structure there's
really no reason why you can't sort of

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:16.710
really no reason why you can't sort of
 

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.380
really no reason why you can't sort of
have everything kind of on the left

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.390
have everything kind of on the left
 

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.560
have everything kind of on the left
mm-hmm exactly especially since they've

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:21.570
mm-hmm exactly especially since they've
 

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.300
mm-hmm exactly especially since they've
already gone hierarchical with this so

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.310
already gone hierarchical with this so
 

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.070
already gone hierarchical with this so
it wouldn't be that hard to just say

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:25.080
it wouldn't be that hard to just say
 

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.530
it wouldn't be that hard to just say

and see them listed underneath invoices
 

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.970
and see them listed underneath invoices
and then I could see the invoice details

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980
and then I could see the invoice details
 

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.340
and then I could see the invoice details
get over on the right have a big plus

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.350
get over on the right have a big plus
 

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.230
get over on the right have a big plus
icon next to each of the category so you

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240
icon next to each of the category so you
 

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.270

can add any way an invoice new estimate

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280

purchase order etc yeah I think I would
 

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.850
purchase order etc yeah I think I would
probably prefer that yeah so again it's

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:46.860
probably prefer that yeah so again it's
 

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.770
probably prefer that yeah so again it's

working which means you need to take a
 

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.440
working which means you need to take a
few seconds to figure out what just

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:00.450

you've got a huge amount of white space
 

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.190
you've got a huge amount of white space

bad thing here to actually have the

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:27.130
bad thing here to actually have the
 

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.190
bad thing here to actually have the
white space around the borders rather

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200
white space around the borders rather

00:42:30.329 --> 00:42:30.339
than in the middle of your screen
 

00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.309
than in the middle of your screen
because this this part here in the

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319
because this this part here in the
 

00:42:32.319 --> 00:42:34.140
because this this part here in the
middle this is where you actually are

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.150
middle this is where you actually are
 

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.250
middle this is where you actually are
going to be paying attention that's

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:35.260
going to be paying attention that's
 

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.510
going to be paying attention that's
where the user is going to be looking

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520
where the user is going to be looking

but all the important stuff is on the
 

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.380
but all the important stuff is on the
edges so I think if I had to choose the

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:40.390
edges so I think if I had to choose the
 

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:45.180
edges so I think if I had to choose the
the most Android way to do this it would

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.190
the most Android way to do this it would
 

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.990
the most Android way to do this it would
probably be to have this left-hand

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000
probably be to have this left-hand
 

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.030
