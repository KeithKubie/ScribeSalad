10
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.310
I want to share my feelings and I appreciate if you will reciprocate.

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.693

15
00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:54.520
I think it's going to be,
I think you're going to enjoy it.
You know,

16
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.830
you're listening to this.
I think you'd enjoy it.
Um,

17
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.510
you know what I would enjoy if somebody could tell me how I can buy a quality

18
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.810
quality.
You know what?
Maybe it's just these fucking headphones.

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.610
Maybe it's just as Jack,
whatever.

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.550
Let's continue promoting knowing that people can hear me.

21
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:13.420
But I can't hear myself.
And when you can't hear yourself,

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.970
how are you going to be able to open up to others?

23
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.670
That's the question that we want to talk about here today.
Um,

24
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.010
it's going to be on November 29th.

25
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.540
It's fucking going to be on Netflix though,
right?
That's the deal.

26
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:29.380
Let's see what we got here.

27
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.860
Let's try to put this in here and let's see if this fixes the problem.

28
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:37.030
How about this new headphones?
You know,
most people,

29
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:40.870
if they were a professional,
they woulda hit pause by now.
That's not me,

30
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.050
is it not?
That's not how bill does it.
Bill just keeps going.
And why would you,

31
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:48.250
what do you know?
It still doesn't fucking work.
Does anybody know who?

32
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.860
<v 1>Who the fuck makes a Goddamn fucking headphone Jack that's of quality?</v>

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.350
You know,
you go down a guitar center.
Thank you.

34
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:59.400
Fucking buy the Goddamn fucking mixture when it works and then everything else

35
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:00.540
fucking sucks.

36
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.520
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.680
<v 1>it doesn't make any sense.
You go to a Lexus dealership,</v>

38
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:09.600
everything's at the fucking Lexus level.
Unfucking believable.

39
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.780
It is fucking bullshit.

40
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.350
I've been bitching about this for fucking two Goddamn fucking months.

41
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.370
You know all the dumb shit that I do with my life.
Oh,
the fucking bars.

42
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.900
I go into your take one night,

43
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.440
you take a fucking night off and go buy a fucking headphone Jack

44
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.250
[inaudible] efforts and family is going to be a lot of that.

45
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.630
If that's what you're into.
Hey,

46
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.730
does anybody know where the fuck I can fucking go and buy some shit that wasn't

47
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:38.560
made in fucking China is they're passive aggressive fucking way to say fuck you

48
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:43.390
to my country.
Is anything made in this fucking Goddamn fucking country anymore?

49
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.860
The fact that this fucking thing,

50
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.640
I just bought this and then you can sell this and they would have,
fuck,

51
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:50.690
am I going to call,

52
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.750
call some fucking guy in India who's pretending like he's here and then he can

53
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.040
do this fucking bullshit.
I'm chill.
I be sure I'm you feel that way?
I

54
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.450
<v 0>understand.
Get the fuck out of here.</v>

55
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.063
<v 2>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.480
<v 0>By the way,
I know your name is Todd.
Ah.</v>

57
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.490
It feels good to blow out the lines every once in a while.

58
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.550
Everybody over over something that you totally have power over.

59
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.110
Um,
anyways,
this is what I do now.
I just yell at things.

60
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
I don't yell at people anymore.
I just,
I just,
you know,
you well,

61
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.480
you know what I like when you yell at an inanimate object,

62
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:26.000
you feel like it's listening.
You know,
cause it never interrupts.

63
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
Never tells you you're wrong.
All right.
Anyways,

64
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.550
efforts or family is going to be up November 29th on Netflix.
Please watch it.

65
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.470
Also,
uh,

66
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.240
the seventh annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit tickets going fast.
Loving it.

67
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.500
Tuesday,
February 19th at 7:00 PM at the city center in New York City.

68
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.060
A lineup.
Jim Gaffigan,
big Jay Oakerson.
Gary Gulman,

69
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:57.740
Chris read Michelle Wolf.
SIFA sounds rich.
Vos is hosting and yours too.

70
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.810
Oh,
freckles.
All fucking freckles with is fucked up headphones.

71
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.960
I'm not the headphones.
It's the God damn check stuff.
Fucking Jag.

72
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.270
BOMP bomp bomp bone.
I'm sorry.
Anyways,

73
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.440
um,
so this week I got to do this,
this inner,

74
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:20.060
this Skype interview with this coffee company.
All right.
And uh,
I fucking hate,

75
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.740
I hate Skype.
I fucking hate it.
You know what,
he Skypes in another one.

76
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.570
Those fucking things on your computer that wants you downloaded.

77
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Every time you turn your computer on it fucking sticks.

78
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.530
It's fucking Goddamn face out there.
It's like,
Hey,
did I click on you?

79
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.640
Did I click on you?
They'd say,
shut up.

80
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.760
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

81
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.380
<v 0>I got this other thing right.
I got to,
I got this external hard drive thing.</v>

82
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.270
I used it one time.

83
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.080
Every time I shut down my computer and turn it back on again.

84
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.940
It's like that fucking,
you know,

85
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.280
you know that person at the party when you just sitting there like,

86
00:04:55.281 --> 00:04:58.850
who invited this guy?
That's what all of those apps are like.

87
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.480
You know,

88
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.040
we need to make sure every time they turn on your computer that this comes on

89
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.560
and we remind them that it's on your computer.
Well,

90
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.900
it makes me want to do is eventually grab that icon or whatever the fuck you

91
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:16.140
call it and drag it over to the trashcan.

92
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.570
And my favorite thing ever is when you hit the Lee trash,
that little poof,

93
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.390
they're little poof of dust,
you know?
Would you like?
I'm going to be,

94
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.060
wouldn't it be great if you could do that to the guy at the party?

95
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.440
You just fucking big paper,
machete Arrow.

96
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:33.160
You put it on them and you poke them in his belly.
He giggles and then he just,

97
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.180
he just disappears and he can get back to the cool conversation you were having.

98
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.920
Or maybe you are just sitting there enjoying yourself in the corner and he

99
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.530
decided that he was going to be,
you know,
I'm a social guy,

100
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.880
I'm just going to come up and say hello.

101
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.890
Rather than seeing that somebody clearly is over in the corner not wanting to

102
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.230
talk to anybody.
I'm going to go over there and go fucking talk to him.

103
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.250
You know what I mean?
I Dunno that.
I mean maybe that's just a fucking

104
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.110
<v 1>white thing.
The way we fucking walk up to wild animals and shit.
Maybe we,
it's,</v>

105
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.340
it starts at the party by going over to the person in the corner who clearly has

106
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.820
some sort of fucking issues.
Clearly not a PR person.
You want to steer clear of.

107
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.790
You gotta walk up,
you walk up,
you say alo,

108
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.370
and because of the rules of society over there,

109
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:20.000
this guy doesn't rip your fucking head off.
And then you just,
Oh,

110
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:25.001
I think maybe I'll apply the same annoying behavior I use at a party into the

111
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.910
wild.
Maybe I'll do that.
Hey,
polar bear.

112
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.640
I'm going to come and be an open fucking spirit.

113
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.170
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.360
<v 1>The amount of,
you know,
I follow that,
uh,
discover sharks on Instagram,</v>

115
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:43.361
the amount of fucking morons that are so into sharks that trying to prove how

116
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:48.320
not dangerous they are and they're fucking jumping in the water with them.

117
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.570
It's like he didn't,
you didn't watch the crocodile hunter.

118
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.710
That's what the fuck he did.
Do you think you know nature better than that guy?

119
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.750
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.110
<v 1>Do the way that guy got killed.
That was like a great episode of the wire.</v>

121
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.750
You just didn't see it coming.
You know what I mean?

122
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.930
All those years fucking with those ridiculously ridiculously poison snakes and

123
00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:14.070
may get snakes and fucking Australia that could be take out a small country with

124
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:16.590
one bite,
the entire fucking population.

125
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.970
And this guy's going over there with his fucking booty shorts on with aerobics

126
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.730
socks.
Fucking with these things.

127
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.960
You think in one of these days this guy is going to get bit and his shapely Tan

128
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:32.090
calves right now didn't happen.
All right.

129
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.620
Maybe it's going to be,
I don't know that.

130
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.530
What else did he fuck with some sort of fucking wild boar?

131
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.120
That's what you thought was going to get them.
Certainly a fucking crocodile.

132
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
<v 3>You know,</v>

133
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.250
<v 1>you thought that would get them in one ended up fucking getting them a goddamn</v>

134
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.480
sting.
Ray never saw that coming.
That was just like the wire.
Well,

135
00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:56.560
what's his face?
Oh my God,
I forgot the iconic fucking,

136
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.990
the guy used to rob the drug dealers.
I'm not going to ruin it.

137
00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.960
I'm not spoiler alert.
It's been a spoiler alert.

138
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.680
It's been out for fucking 15 years or whatever.
I'm not going to ruin the ending.

139
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:08.860
But the way that guy,
you know what happens to him,

140
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.570
you just don't fucking see it coming.

141
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.753
<v 3>MMM.</v>

142
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.600
<v 1>I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore.
But anyways,
I'm doing a,</v>

143
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.260
one of my favorite people,
one of my favorite podcasts of all time.

144
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:22.870
This Wednesday I'm going to be on the Joe Rogan experience.

145
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.770
I'm also doing dice Clay's podcasts,
uh,

146
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.180
later on that day and I'm finally calling in to spit and check what's on

147
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.880
Barstool.
All right.
I'm running the gambit.

148
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.990
<v 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.010
<v 1>The gamut of podcasts that day.
I'm doing Kevin and being on Friday</v>

150
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.570
and that's local out here.
If you live in La local radio,

151
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:47.710
I'm sure they have an app that you can download and listen to it wherever the

152
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:51.430
fuck you want to.
And then what else?
I've got a couple of folders tomorrow,

153
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:57.090
but I now you have to download fucking Skype so I can do this phone or today at

154
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.180
noon so then I can then immediately fucking delete it again.

155
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.120
Don't forget about me.
I'm on your computer.
We know Skype.

156
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.170
Everybody knows you here.
Everybody knows you're fucking here.

157
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.471
The only thing,
one,

158
00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:14.690
one positive thing I will say about Skype as I love the phone ring.

159
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.970
[inaudible] I don't know what it is about it.
I like it.
I like,
other than,

160
00:09:21.971 --> 00:09:25.060
than that,
everything about it is a

161
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.450
<v 2>all right.</v>

162
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.480
<v 1>It's fucking annoying.
You know what I mean?
Um,
anyways,</v>

163
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.230
how was your Thanksgiving [inaudible] joy use the,

164
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:36.770
I already talked about thanksgiving.
I forgot I did it on Friday.
Talk Friday.

165
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.800
What,
what are you gonna talk about?
Let's talk about the debacle.

166
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.550
If you are a wolverines fan that was Michigan,
Ohio state,

167
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.850
Jesus fucking Christ.
That was just,
that was just a,

168
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:52.090
sorry fucking,
they should have beat them this year.
They really should have,

169
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:52.840
you know something.

170
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.600
As much as the buckeyes are walking around with their chest puffs out,

171
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.550
it's like you let up 40 fucking points.

172
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.290
I don't know what you're so excited about.
Fucking unbelievable,
man.

173
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.240
I swear to God,

174
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.990
if those cons didn't get that fucking ridiculous spot two years ago,

175
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.740
it would have been a rivalry again.
Nowaday,
they just,

176
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.730
they just got the psychological advantage that fucking gave two years ago when

177
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.390
everybody,
I'll let you tie.
Officiating Squad was from fucking Ohio.

178
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.610
I think he got the first day or whatever the fuck it was.
Anyways,

179
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:31.611
I just wanted a game is what I wanted and I wanted hard blah to win one.

180
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.550
So then you could have the fucking urban Meyer Harbach 10 years war,

181
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.820
but now you know,
I dunno,
urban Meyers got some sort of cyst in his head.

182
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:44.450
I had no fucking idea.
I didn't know that.
So it's just like,
yeah,
dude,
you got a,

183
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:47.420
you got a wife and kids,
what are you doing here?
You know,

184
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.140
every time they run the ball for a lost,

185
00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:52.940
the guy literally has to fucking bend over to his ankles.

186
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.390
He gets headaches when he flips out and it's just like,
it's like,

187
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.700
it's literally a ticking time budge.
It's,

188
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.680
am I going to say it's unsettling to watch.

189
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.040
You know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.
But then it's like,
what is he going to do?

190
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.400
Just sit at home with his sister being pleasant.
I mean,

191
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:12.370
the man has to live his fucking life,
right?

192
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.953
<v 2>MMM.</v>

193
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.270
<v 1>Anyways,
what else?
What did we talked about?
We've talked about headphone Jack.</v>

194
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.310
He's talked about sis in people's heads.
Um,

195
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.383
<v 2>yeah,</v>

196
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.850
<v 1>patriots jets.
That was the one football game.
I watched that one.</v>

197
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:30.040
And I watched the,
uh,

198
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.520
watch the end of the Steelers game and it was tough to watch big Ben.

199
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.410
Uh,
lose that one.
Man.

200
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.270
I saw two fucking amazing quarterbacks have tough games.

201
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.400
Aaron Rogers had that guy open and then a big band,
you know,
I don't know.

202
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.920
I'm talking like I would have fucking made the past,
but
um,

203
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.480
I'm so out of it right now.

204
00:11:50.481 --> 00:11:53.770
Like I was actually rooting for the Steelers cause the,
just,

205
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.180
I fucking hate the Broncos just because they kicked our ass from Craig Morton,

206
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.030
right through John Elway.
And I'm still not over it

207
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.920
every fucking time in edits.
Every fucking time we play him.

208
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.730
It's always an away game.
We've always back in their horseshoe,
back in the day,

209
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.590
it'd be freezing fucking cold out.

210
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.250
It would start snowing and then we would just get the shit kicked out.

211
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.130
And we all in,
every time we played them,
it was just be like,
you know,

212
00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:23.180
we had hope and it had some sort of playoff implications and then that would be

213
00:12:23.181 --> 00:12:28.040
it.
That's the old,
you know,
that's the old Boston sports fan.

214
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:31.900
As opposed to now where everybody's mean.
Anybody born from the ninth,

215
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.990
1990 on is just absolutely spoiled.
Um,

216
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.930
as far as being the page us,
uh,
a Boston sports fan,
which I'm totally fine with.

217
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.270
Um,
I watched a little bit of Celtics,

218
00:12:44.271 --> 00:12:48.950
caught a little bit of the Bruins verse the Canadians and um,
I don't know.

219
00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:52.250
I just had it.
I had a great weekend,
man.
I really had a great weekend.
I tell you,

220
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.820
I think I told you that guys.
This did I tell you I took my,
uh,

221
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.640
I told you that last,
last week.
I took my kid to guitar center,
man.

222
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:01.820
It was fucking awesome.
God knows we didn't buy any fucking headphone Jackson.

223
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.360
Let's fucking idiots.
They're not idiots.
But you did need to know why.
Why?

224
00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:08.710
Why are you selling shit that doesn't fucking work.
Hey Bill,

225
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:10.450
why didn't you keep the receipt and bring it back?

226
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.580
Because I don't want to fucking make another trip over there.

227
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.000
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.200
<v 1>All right.
I never take the receipt.
I'm not coming back.</v>

229
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.020
Doesn't fucking work.
I'll just yell about it

230
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.530
rather than just getting in my car and solving the problem.

231
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.960
Um,
okay.
You know,
every time I think I turned the corner as a person,

232
00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:35.090
I just realized,
oh Jesus,
it's just like this.

233
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.710
There's another fucking storage shed of emotional shit I have to fucking go

234
00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:40.544
through.

235
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.573
<v 2>You know,</v>

236
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.320
<v 1>if,
imagine if they could do that with your personality.</v>

237
00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:50.010
They had this storage wars with you,
right.
And they just make you stand in.

238
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:53.910
There is a middle aged person and they get a bunch of fucking women out there

239
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.420
looking for a partner and that just bid,
not,
you know,
and then they just,

240
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.660
they opened the door and you're fucking standing there

241
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.470
with your fucking dad jades and your little cut belly trying to suck it in and

242
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.250
it just looking in your eyes.

243
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.250
You're trying not to look away like some wild animals shit,
you know?

244
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.280
Then they start bidding on you.
What do you think they'd been on you?

245
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.150
Let's just say,
you know,
we'll make it easy.

246
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.610
A hundred bucks is like,

247
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:27.580
this guy looks like the winner top shelf Johnny blue.

248
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.240
I want to be with this guy in zero is this guy's a fucking zero.

249
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:36.370
This guy's a loser.
Everything he touches turns to Shit,
you know?

250
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.260
What do you think you'd be on that?

251
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.540
I think the only thing that saves me is I earned a good living other,

252
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.600
if you take that out of the equation,
all right.

253
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.170
I think I am.
I'm in the 30s,

254
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.760
depending on how fucking crazy your dad was.

255
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.980
I would say I might even drop down into the 20s.
You know,

256
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.840
I'm looking at an emotional lottery pick the next season.
Uh Oh,
by the way,

257
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.820
um,
you know,

258
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:11.390
I was talking to Varanasi and he was saying I was fuck this guy's named sake.

259
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.330
Say Quan Barkley was just having like a career day,

260
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.020
almost a hundred yards in the first half or some fucking shit against the
eagles.

261
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.790
And then they ran him four times in the second half and he just couldn't wrap

262
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:27.350
his head around the fact.
It's like,
dude,
the giants are tanking.
Okay,

263
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:29.240
they're not going to make the fucking [inaudible].

264
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.180
You know the Patriots it we'd be in trouble,
but they,

265
00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.720
they're going to tank people tank.
All right.
Indianapolis.

266
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.460
They tank to get Andrew Luck.
Peyton manning came back.
Hey doctor said I'm good.

267
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.170
Oh No,
Peyton,
we're worried about you.
I will fucking worried about you.

268
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.580
Then Peyton goes on to fucking,
you know,

269
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.560
win a super bowl over there and fucking Denver.

270
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:53.561
I love that you have in order to said whenever anybody treats this superstar

271
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.410
with absolute disrespect,

272
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.100
that guy ends up in Colorado and wins championships.

273
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:05.780
If you noticed that the fucking Canadians,
all right,

274
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.700
this scarf where and fucking snooty guide.

275
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.190
Damn fans booed Patrick Wall.
I'm going to say this again.
They booed.

276
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.050
Patrick was a man not only a hall of Famer Natalie Winter of two Stanley cups at

277
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:20.660
that point,
that DDI change the position.

278
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.940
You're talking about this a handful of fucking people in the history of the NHL.

279
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.360
They can say that I changed the position to Patrick was one of them.

280
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.260
And what did he do?
He went to the Colorado avalanche one,
not one,

281
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.480
but two fucking Stanley cups

282
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.470
and all of those fucking pocket square blue blog,

283
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:45.350
a rouge cops sport coat wearing concept there.

284
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.760
I still sitting there with the course,
sign up their ass waiting for another cup.

285
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.190
25 fucking years later,

286
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.060
Indianapolis Colts tank a fucking season so they can get Andrew Luck.

287
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.770
Where does Peyton manning go?
Does he try to pile on in San Francisco?

288
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.770
And Jim Harbaugh was there and they will one fucking piece away.
Now he does not.

289
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.410
Pate Manning says,
I'm going to be a fucking man about this.

290
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.750
I've gone to the Goddamn Broncos.
Not saying they were bad,

291
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.130
but that would've been a layup in San Francisco.
It's tough to say.

292
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:18.770
It would've been a lamp with Jim.
Horrible after that.
Fucking lost the other day.

293
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.360
Bow and I'll put them in the unimaginative fucking play.
Calling run,
play action.

294
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:26.870
Fake third and long.
Let's throw it.
Um,

295
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.010
way to fucked his way to fuck his pate man and go.

296
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:35.030
He goes to Denver and it goes to not one,

297
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.370
but two Superbowls gets his ass kicked in the first one.

298
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.900
But I only played Seattle,
you know,

299
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:41.690
they were all fucking roided up and nobody gave a shit cause they're in Seattle.

300
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:44.570
That's not cheating.
You know,
it's a competitive edge.
Right.

301
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.600
But he comes back and wins it like the next year or the year,
a year later,

302
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.910
I forget what should write another super
bowl trophy.

303
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.760
Okay.
So I'm thinking that the giants had get a tank this year.

304
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.860
Then they're going to go out,
they're going to draft the fucking quarterback.

305
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.470
They're going to tell Eli winter,
if not one,

306
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:07.040
but two super bowls against bill Belicheck,

307
00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:08.570
the greatest fucking coach of all time.

308
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.230
They're going to tell him they hit the fucking bricks of,

309
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:14.770
where do you think that man's going?
Not The Broncos.

310
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.670
He's going to shock everybody's going to play point guard for the Denver Nuggets

311
00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:20.580
and they went an NBA championship.
Right.

312
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:28.180
Um,
sorry.
Um,

313
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:33.100
what's you're listening to right now is a man who has a lot of Shitty as to do

314
00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:37.900
this week and he doesn't want to get out of bed.
Oh,
was I enjoy in my time off?

315
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.890
Oh,
did I enjoy it?
You know,

316
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.930
but I realized I was enjoying it too much because I was continuing to,
you know,

317
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.280
have some drinks,
have some cigars,
and what I really realized it was,
Bill,

318
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.930
when you have time off,

319
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.100
what you need to be doing is drinking water and getting eight hours sleep,

320
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.290
then you'll actually feel rested.

321
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.980
Then the vacation won't seem like it went by too quickly.

322
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.860
I realized this last night,
the last day of my vacation.

323
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:10.911
All right,

324
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:15.140
but when I'm going to do is I'm going to apply the wisdom that I've learned.

325
00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:17.330
I can't even say wisdom because I have learned this lesson.

326
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.750
I've learned this lesson more fucking times.

327
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.480
And then Ohio state has kicked the fucking shit out of the wolverines in the

328
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.950
last decade and a half.
Um,
anyways,

329
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:33.570
what's going to happen or how state urban Meyer,

330
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.090
everybody's saying is going to leave this year.
Well,
yeah,

331
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.950
that's not good for football.
You got to give me the date.

332
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.710
It was just building up.
You now are by,
ah,
Harbaugh has to,

333
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.300
Harbaugh has,
whenever smokers had got my voice cracks the next day,
horrible.

334
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.390
I has to fuck it.
He's gotta,
he's gotta get,
he's got a big debt guy.

335
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.940
He can't take his ball and go home off for health reasons.
He can.
You don't,

336
00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.230
how about give him shit.
Oh,
is that it buddy?
Huh?

337
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.200
One little fucking cyst and you're going to go home.

338
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.150
Then urban could just walk away going 62,
63,
whatever they fucking scored.

339
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.220
Um,
anyways,
uh,

340
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.930
Jesus Christ.
Now what do I do?
I do with some reads.
Let's do some reads.

341
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.420
That's why I'm reading.

342
00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.600
<v 2>Ah,</v>

343
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.630
<v 1>read notes on the moon home or one in.
All right.</v>

344
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:35.530
Five reads everybody.
Not One,
not two.

345
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.160
Like the Stanley cups that Patrick,
while one,

346
00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.510
actually the Canadians are playing good this year,
you know,
you know,

347
00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:47.020
not good enough for their fan base because they expect things I love.

348
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.790
I love one of fan base expects things out of their professional sports
franchise,

349
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:54.790
but nothing out of their own personal lives.
That right there,

350
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:58.780
that is a true sports fan.
Um,
all right,
fine.

351
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.960
Blood sugars box everybody.
Oh Jesus.
Do I love these case.

352
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.500
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef free range.

353
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:13.711
Organic chicken and the one the only inevitably replaced the,

354
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.890
the the,
the fucking pork that changed the position.

355
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.730
The Patrick Wa of pork heritage,
bread.

356
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.300
Pork.
Now a lot of you like me,
you probably say,

357
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.540
well what exactly is heritage bread?
Pork.
And I know you've explained this well,

358
00:21:29.541 --> 00:21:31.960
guess what?
It's so fucking good.
I'm going to explain it again.

359
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.830
Heritage Badge pork is,

360
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.840
is murdered pigs that are pure bred pigs that you can trace their family tree

361
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.530
all the way back to Europe.

362
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:46.531
They weren't over here fucking these low rent pigs here in the United States of

363
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.320
America.

364
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.820
You know that sit around watching reality TV while they were eating cotton
candy.

365
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:55.930
These,
these,
these are European pigs.
They read,

366
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.110
they smoked cigarettes,
holding the cigarette from underneath.

367
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.540
These pigs can ride scooters.
Everybody and I'll do this.

368
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.890
It's incredible.
It's the best takes and pork chop I've ever fucking had.

369
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.320
My mouth literally waters when I read this shit.
Incredible.

370
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.920
Incredible quality of butcher box meat starts with the commitment to raising

371
00:22:16.921 --> 00:22:21.921
animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones before they are

372
00:22:21.931 --> 00:22:25.330
slaughtered.
Yeah,

373
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.620
they listen to fucking feel good music.
And then one day you just walk up.
Hey,

374
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.320
piggy,
look at that over there.
Then he gave me all right there.

375
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:35.890
Fred over cook with a piece of,

376
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:40.180
but the peace of mind knowing you are eating healthy,
high quality meat.

377
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.090
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

378
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.120
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

379
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.840
Unless you're a tub of shit and you're fucking gluttonous and you'd go through

380
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:52.540
it in three days,
it's your choice.

381
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.130
You know you want to have the meat sweats,
so you want to have abs.

382
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.690
It's all up to you.
You can choose from five different box types,
all beef,

383
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.650
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box.

384
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.100
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

385
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.930
Like my new favorite cook there,
Johnny and Johnny,

386
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.700
I live on the hill every morning I walked down to buy what I'm going to cook

387
00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:19.534
that day.

388
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.240
My name is Johnny and this is what's left to the Italian American section in San

389
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.760
Francisco.
I fucking loved that guy.
Next time I go to San Francisco,

390
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:28.990
I want that guy to come to a show.

391
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.853
<v 3>MMM.</v>

392

393
00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.930

By the way,

396
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.550
fuck Turkey Bacon.
All right,
that's a little aside.
You know what?

397
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:55.160
I need to learn how to cook it because I tried to cook it like the pig shit,

398
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.120
you know,
or did you just bathes in its own grease?
I like to burn it up.

399
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:03.680
By the way,
you know,
my wife's,
I take,
I take it off in about 15 minutes.

400
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.640
You know,
mine,
I,
I leave it in there for another eight minutes.
Um,

401
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:08.901
all right,

402
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:13.340
that's $20 off your first box and a package of free bacon in every box for the

550
00:33:27.661 --> 00:33:31.050
to go out and get the fucking deep fryer you or whenever the hell it is you're

551
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:35.100

Now you wonder,

554
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.250
did the person bring the knife there just in case they didn't quite get to the

555
00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:46.430
fucking nerf football fast enough.

<v 0>Um,</v>

558
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:52.090
I don't like making fun of people with not a lot of money who have to go and do

559
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:52.721
shit like this,

560
00:33:52.721 --> 00:33:55.620
but that there's no reason to stab somebody over a fucking microwave.
Is there?

561
00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.500
Um,
I mean,
you can shoot somebody over a refrigerator,

562
00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:00.710
but we're talking to microwave here.
I mean,

563
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.240
you can get one of those like 30 bucks.
All right,
Sarah,
choose New York.

564
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:09.870
Two men have been stabbed at a confrontation at a central New York Mall amid

565
00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:13.210
black Friday shopping.
This couldn't have been about this.

566
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.050
I feel like the violence only happens at Walmart.
Am I crazy?

567
00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.880
Allegedly.
Alright.
Syracuse police tell local media outlets.

568
00:34:21.881 --> 00:34:26.881
It happened around 4:15 PM at destiny USA police and the mall manager management

569
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.290
say the dispute began at Mace at the Macy's store.

570
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.740
It's not immediately clear what sparked the confrontation.
Well,

571
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:36.610
if you're in Macy's,

572
00:34:36.611 --> 00:34:39.820
I imagine it's the men department and they were looking at a couple of button

573
00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:40.654
downs there.

574
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:45.760
A officer's found one man wounded in the abdomen and another man wounded

575
00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:48.490
elsewhere on his body.
That means he gets stabbed in the groin.

576
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.480
Both are in their twenties and were taken to a hospital managing just laying

577
00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:54.670
under a clothes,
clothes rack.

578
00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:57.940
Just looking up at this shirt that was so fucking important eight seconds ago,

579
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.830
please say the injuries don't appear.
Life threatening,
uh,

580
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.830
photos by syracuse.com and ws.
Why our TV show,

581
00:35:05.831 --> 00:35:09.700
a portion of Macy's and another store's entrance were taped off for a time.

582
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.890
Uh,
destiny USA managers say saying a statement,

583
00:35:14.891 --> 00:35:19.891
the bloodshed was an isolated incident that that's absolutely unacceptable.

584
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.030
There you go,
buddy.
Make,
make,
make,

585
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:27.040
make a strong stand and strengthens our resolve to remain vigilant.

586
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.030
What does that mean?

587
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.363
<v 2>Okay,</v>

588
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.850
<v 0>that's the statement.
Listen,
those were the y'all.
This is,
this is the,</v>

589
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.303
of all that.
Listen,

590
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.960
those were the only two people that got stabbed at Destiny USA,

591
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:44.220
uh,

592
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220
which is absolutely not acceptable to stab someone at this small.

593
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.000
And,
uh,
we're now gonna try,
uh,
to,

594
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.090
you know,
really look at people,

595
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.890
do make sure there's no stabbing motions towards another customer.

596
00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.173
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

597
00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.310
<v 0>Are we really going to get to the point in this country where you're gonna have</v>

598
00:36:09.311 --> 00:36:13.600
to have a metal detector in a fucking clothing store?
All right,
man.

599
00:36:13.601 --> 00:36:17.230
Shopping on black Friday at Walmart has a heart attack.

600
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.750
He must've got to the Billy Best first and he couldn't fucking imagine as look.

601
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.530
Oh,
Bill.
Really?
I'm sorry.
What am I?
This is a fucking comedy podcasts.

602
00:36:26.531 --> 00:36:30.160
They have to make fun of things.
[inaudible] air.
Alright.

603
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.450
Wham,
wham,
Wham,
wham.
Bonk,
Bonk,
Bonk,
bonk out.

604
00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:36.820
All right.

605
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.050
A man died Friday after having an apparent heart attack while shopping at the

606
00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:43.570
Walmart waned.
Sorry.
This is the Walmart,
right?

607
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:49.240
They'll take this job and shove it.
I work in here no more.

608
00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:53.380
That's my fairly bash.
You put that damn mother fucker all right.

609
00:36:53.381 --> 00:36:55.810
At the Walmart on the u s to 80

610
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.220

Say where the fuck is Fenix looks like Phoenix,

611
00:37:01.221 --> 00:37:05.150
but it's not.
It's Phenix city.
All right.
Little geography lesson.
Everybody.

612
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:10.970
All right,

Alabama.
Oh,
Jim,
give me a break.

616
00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:27.590
This is probably against fucking a Bam.
A fucking,
uh,

617
00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:33.160
War Eagle Fin.
It's a city in Lee and Russell counties in the state of Alabama.

618
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.910
Oh,
it's almost in Georgia.
It's almost in Georgia.

619
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.280
That's the funniest thing about,
at the,
as they looked down on Alabama.

620
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.030
Fucking hilarious.
Wait Lot Graham.
Shit.

621
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.420
We Polish our boots.
All right.

622
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.150
A man died Friday after having an apparent heart attack while shopping at the

623
00:37:52.151 --> 00:37:54.490
Walmart on us to 80 in Phenix city.

624
00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.830
Authority said the death during Black Friday shopping was a sad note to the

625
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.680
holiday season.
Oh,
here's,
here's a,
um,

626
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.080
a little side note as a toddler drowned in his big gulp that he drove,

627
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:10.210
they dropped
and whatever.
It's black Fridays,

628
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.250
some black humor,
um,

629
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.430
witnesses on Facebook expressing their condolences.

630
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.050
Russell County Coroner said Teddy Venable 71 ah,
I feel bad.

631
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.570
This is somebody's grandfather had a heart of the history of heart problems.

632
00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:25.690
He was pronounced.
All right,
so that doesn't have anything to do with Walmart.

633
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.790
Yeah,
he hits you.
Let's get the guy in the history of heart problems.

634
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.620
He made it to 71 God bless them,

635
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:38.710
I hope for is peace of he was a fucking Bama fan rather than Auburn.

636
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.100
Yeah.
So he had more joy in his life.
He probably was.
I bet he was.

637
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.210
That's what kept him going.
All right,
man.
Injured in shooting.

638
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.700
<v 3>Okay.</v>

639
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.300
<v 0>See where we go from here.
Jesus Christ,
all these,</v>

640
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.570
he shows a glock when you get here.
All right,
man.

641
00:38:53.571 --> 00:38:57.830
Injured and shooting and New Jersey Mall,
Elizabeth,
New Jersey.

642
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.510
The waning hours at black Friday were disrupted in New Jersey Mall on Friday as

643
00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:06.860
a man was wounded by gunfire shortly after 8:00 PM.

644
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.950
That is way too early in the evening to get shot.

645
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.250
What did the guy who got shot say,
I'm actually,
I'm actually,

646
00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:17.070
I'm going to side with the shooter on this one.
You know what I mean?

647
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.190
You should somebody around midnight.
Then thena here.

648
00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:20.310
You're fucking drunk ass all,

649
00:39:20.311 --> 00:39:24.840
but you shoot somebody at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM they deserved it.
All right.

650
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.640
The man was shot in the wrist,

651
00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:32.930
in a hallway between the marshals and Tommy Hilfiger stores at the Mills,

652
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.330
at Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth.

653
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:38.623
<v 3>All right.</v>

654
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.170
<v 0>The shooter was,
has not been caught in.</v>

655
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:43.870
The victim is not cooperating with the authorities.
All right,

656
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:47.090
this is gang related.
This has nothing to do.
Okay.
There you go.
See?

657
00:39:47.091 --> 00:39:49.900
You know what too?
Those are really only just one stabbing at Macy's.

658
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.230
Another guy had a history of heart problems.
You know we went there.

659
00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.490
The the fucking,
I don't know what the hedge clippers were still there.

660
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.750
He couldn't believe it.
He fucking had a heart attack.
Yeah,
that guy.
Yeah,

661
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.480
they did that shit.
You know,
get shot in the wrist day.
I'm not going.

662
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.070
What happened Jan?
I don't know.

663
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.950
You sit there and put a bullet in your fucking risks and you're not cooperate.

664
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.150
That is gang related.
I'm going to go out on out on a limb there.
All right,
Bill,

665
00:40:13.151 --> 00:40:14.470
can we get back to the podcast?

666
00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.160
[inaudible] I'm gonna make you guys hate that song.
Sorry.
All right,

667
00:40:19.161 --> 00:40:23.010
let's get to a little,
so let's get to some of the questions here.
All right.

668
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.650
Gaslighting.
Hey,
Billy.
Truck,
nuts.
Um,
anyone,
what that means.

669
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.050
I heard you and Nia talking about gaslighting.

670
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.440
I thought you might find it interesting that the origin of that word comes from

671
00:40:33.441 --> 00:40:36.800
in 1944 movie called gaslight.
Yes.
Somebody sent this to me.

672
00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:37.640
This is really interesting.

673
00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:42.200
It's about a husband that systematically manipulates little things in her

674
00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:45.170
environment to get her to think she's crazy.

675
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:48.770
One example is when he dimmed the gas lights in the house,

676
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.610
she mentioned to her husband about the dim lights and he would pretend that they

677
00:40:52.611 --> 00:40:57.020
were fine.
The wiki page explains it.
Well,

678
00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:01.460
longtime lay listener and love the show.
I'm going to have to watch that.

679
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.730
All right,
go to the page.
Here we go.
Let's read.
All right.

680
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:10.390
Gaslighting I taught gaslighting was you.
You're like blowing somebody up.

681
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.550
You know,
saying that they were better than they were.

682
00:41:12.551 --> 00:41:14.080
It turns out it was the exact opposite.

683
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:19.030
It's a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow the seeds of doubt

684
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.110
in a targeted individual or in a member of a targeted group,

685
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.440
making them question their own memory.
Perception,
insanity.

686
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.640
Using persistent denial,
misdirection,
counter diction,
and lying.

687
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.960
I feel like persistent denial,
misdirection encountered contradiction.

688
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:39.350
That's more like,
that's more finessed.
The lying is just,
yeah,

689
00:41:39.351 --> 00:41:40.910
that's just gorilla pimping,
right?

690
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:45.350
You just fucking punching him in the face and attempts to destabilize the victim

691
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.340
and de legitimize the victim's belief.
Uh,

692
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:53.390
instances may range from the denial by an abuser that the previous abusive

693
00:41:53.391 --> 00:41:56.630
incidents ever occurred.
Oh,
this is what your parents always say.
Oh,

694
00:41:56.631 --> 00:41:59.540
that never happened.
Um,

695
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.860
opt to staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of

696
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:07.610
disorienting the victim.
All right.

697
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.560
Guess what I'm going to watch tonight?
I'm gonna Watch that movie.
Gaslighting,
uh,

698
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:15.980
again is a gas lighting,
gas lighting,
um,

699
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.610
movie called gaslight.

700
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.140
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

701
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.990
<v 0>I got to watch that.
Anything in black and white,
I fucking,</v>

702
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:26.990
I really enjoy including one of my specials.
Sorry.

703
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:31.610
Advice for the fellow cubicle warriors.
Hey,
Billy Wonka.
Huh?
Now.

704
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:34.010
How did nobody ever come up with that one?
Billy Walker.

705
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.030
I recently changed my life by setting all my devices tonight mode,

706
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:41.000
permanently phone,
laptop,
iPad.

707
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.650
I had the standard headache and I paid some all these screens in my face all day

708
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:50.120
long.
We got to buy those glasses that they gave me.
The Blue Tint on him.

709
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:51.480
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

710
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.820
<v 0>Yeah.
What did went away over here?</v>

711
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.100
It's to the point now when someone shows me their iPhone,

712
00:42:56.101 --> 00:43:00.030
I kind of pull back cause I can feel those blue lights wrapping my brain.

713
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.790
I think it's something you and your listeners should know.

714
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.670
Oh,
you said everything tonight.
Oh,
night mode.
Oh,

715
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:09.920
so it's not as bright in your face.
Well,
you know,

716
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:13.190
it'd be great if you show me how to do that.
I could probably look that up.

717
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.780
I like the direction you're going in,
sir.

718
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:19.640
Any sort of paranoia is right in my fucking wheel offs.
Uh,
my first comedy show,

719
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:24.230
what's the etiquette?
Oh,
sit there and shut the fuck up.
Laugh if it's funny.

720
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.050
If you want to heckle Haeckel but don't be a baby anyways.
Hi Bill.
Big Fan.

721
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.420
So glad that you're coming to Germany out.
Jesus,

722
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:33.710
this is somebody from another country.

723
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:39.050
There's no comedy in Germany or it's they laughing.

724
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.310
Um,
I have just bought a ticket to your first show of the tour,

725
00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:46.530
the one in Cologne,
uh,

726
00:43:46.531 --> 00:43:50.260
on June 4th of January.
By the way,
I learned the last time Cologne,

727
00:43:50.261 --> 00:43:54.520
Germany was one of the number one bombed cities in World War II and there's

728
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:57.330
still a few buildings that survived a big fans.

729
00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:58.690
So glad that you were coming to Germany.

730
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:02.850
I've just bought a ticket for your first show in that tour.
Uh,

731
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.850
the one in Cologne.
I had the best time when I was there last time.
Uh,

732
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:08.710
so I'm anticipating it's going to be another great show.

733
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.230
This will be the first comedy show I go to in my whole life.

734
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:15.460
I moved to Germany two years ago.
Before that I lived in Moldova.

735
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.920
I'll small and insignificant country that bright stars don't go to any ways.

736
00:44:22.001 --> 00:44:25.090
Do you think that on one of your podcasts episodes,

737
00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:29.050
you could take a minute or two to explain how these comedy shows go for you?

738
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:31.860
What does the ideal spectator like?

739
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.520
Should I bring flowers and give them to you on stage?
I this guy,

740
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:37.170
this guy is going to heckle the shit out of me.

741
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:41.010
And how do you get the chance to meet you after the show?

742
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:43.080
It would be a real honor to be able to do so.

743
00:44:43.081 --> 00:44:47.010
Thank you all the best to you and your family and I wish you a great European

744
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:52.160
Troy,
uh,
tour.
Um,
this is,
you go there,

745
00:44:52.161 --> 00:44:56.000
you sit down,
you get yourself a drink and then you listen to the comedians.

746
00:44:56.001 --> 00:44:59.540
If what they say is funny,
you laugh at what if it isn't,
don't laugh.

747
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.100
And uh,
if you go too long without laughing,
then you heckle.
I mean,

748
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.310
that's a part of it.
I hate to tell that to an audience member.
But that's true.

749
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.940
And I think that that's one of the great things about standup comedy is the

750
00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:15.260
heckling.
It's a great thing about politics too.
You know,
it's fun,

751
00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.100
but it sucks as a politician cause you can't tell them to go fuck themselves.

752
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:23.720
You know?
Look,
well,
let me ask you this.

753
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.400
Why did you raise the taxes in our county?

754
00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:30.060
Because you're fucking your sister in that fucking pig trough.
Yep.

755
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.780
Hayseed content that gets an applause break in my business.

756
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.520
That ends your career as a politician.
Although Donald Trump,

757
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.880
president Trump has shown that maybe that isn't the case.
Um,

758
00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.470
I am so excited for this European tour.
I am,

759
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.760
I am clean living Billy until I get out there,
you know what I mean?

760
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:54.940
And I'm not going to fuck it up either because I'm taping a special in March,

761
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.290
I believe of next year.
So,
um,
I had my last bit of fun.

762
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.560
Um,
this weekend I am done.
No cigars,
no fucking booze,
no bread,

763
00:46:05.561 --> 00:46:09.330
no cookies,
no chips,
no,
no nothing.
And uh,

764
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.300
I'm shutting it down during the,
during the toughest time of the year.
And uh,

765
00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:17.050
I feel fucking good about it.
Eight hours sleep and I'm drinking fucking waters.

766
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:22.440
And this includes right through the rose bowl because I'm sad to announce

767
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.223
<v 1>that</v>

768
00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.171
<v 0>the,</v>

769
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:30.340
literally the cornerstone of the tailgate can't make it this year because he's

770
00:46:30.341 --> 00:46:33.880
got a Gig.
Uh,
the,
the,

771
00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:36.840
the five star Chef Jason Law had.

772
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:38.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

773
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.000
<v 0>Unfortunately,</v>

774
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:45.150
due to circumstances beyond his control cannot be there this year.

775
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.230
And um,
it,
it's,
yeah,
it's,
that's like,
you know,

776
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.960
he's going to be there next year,
hopefully.
You know,

777
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.790
who knows if he keeps fucking getting gigs,
I don't know.
But this is like,

778
00:46:57.791 --> 00:46:59.970
you know,
I don't know.

779
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:03.420
I'm hoping it's just this year,

780
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.620
but the fact did,
he's not going to be there.
I mean,
you know,

781
00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:08.630
he does his Reggie Jackson impression,

782
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.120
he fucking just crushes it with the breakfast sandwiches.
He just made it just,

783
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.680
it's like a massive,
you know,
this is like Derek Jeter retirement.

784
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.570
Oh,
I was,
I'm just going to say he's out with an injury.

785
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:23.690
So we're going to go easier.
I think we're going to go easier this year,

786
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.500
do it a little bit differently,
but I'm not going to be boozing,
um,

787
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.040
at all done with this shit.

788
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:35.041
I got to get myself a tip top condition because I am not a young man anymore.

789
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.810
And that,
that European tour is a 10 cities in 10 nights.

790
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.293
<v 2>MMM.</v>

791
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:48.360
<v 0>And it's just,
yeah.
So I'm,
and a lot of those places I haven't been to ever,</v>

792
00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:53.880
so I cannot go there and fuck up.
I have to go there and be,
you know,

793
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.130
I gotta be in my best on my best behavior.

794
00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.090
Got To help him not on planes every fucking day.

795
00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.440
<v 2>MMM.</v>

796
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.280
<v 0>But if I am going to be,</v>

797
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:06.460
the last thing I need to be doing is fucking going out there acting like a

798
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:10.240
fucking idiot.
All right.
Here we go.
Uh,
drinking as a college freshman.

799
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:12.520
Speaking of boozing,
dear bill,
I'm a college freshman,

800
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.660
freshmen and just recently went to my first dorm party that wasn't held in my

801
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:21.250
room.
It's hilarious.
You sound like me back in the day.
I'm an introvert.

802
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:25.750
So luckily for me,
I got a roommate who is social and likes to party.
Otherwise,

803
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.230
I'd probably be spending all my time,
my room and not interacting with anybody.

804
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:30.910
Well,
that's good.
Good.
Get yourself out there.

805
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.030
It doesn't mean you've got to be an idiot though.
All right?

806
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.550
You got to drink responsibly.
Actually,

807
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:39.700
you're not supposed to be drinking because you're under age.
Look at me.

808
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:41.110
I'm a dad now.
Uh,

809
00:48:41.111 --> 00:48:44.470
I mostly kept to myself throughout high school and had a few friends but never

810
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:48.340
really,
really did much with them outside of school.
Uh,
because of that,

811
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.490
I never had any alcohol.
I'm not much of a party guy,

812
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.480
but I want to step out of my comfort zone.
So I started,
decided to go.

813
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.930
It sounds like the beginning of it.
Yeah.

814
00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:02.720
<v 1>A really interesting movie.
Oh God.
Okay.
So you go in there.
All right.
Um,</v>

815
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.680
hey,
this is the thing for all you young people out there.

816
00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:08.480
If you've never really done something before,

817
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.560
the best thing you could do is tell people that you haven't just fucking own it.

818
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.320
Yeah.
I never,
I never drank any more.
I'm a little nervous about it.

819
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.610
I just want to go easy.
Just give me one here and they'll all lap or they'll,

820
00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.453
they'll like it.

821
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.730
It's when you act like you've been there before and that's when you get in

822
00:49:22.731 --> 00:49:27.170
trouble.
I'm not much of a party guy,
but I wanted to step out of my comfort zone,

823
00:49:27.171 --> 00:49:31.040
so I decided to go.
A bet includes even being a virgin.

824
00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:32.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

825
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:35.110
<v 1>Do you know,
where's the fucking shy?
Never,
never banged anybody.</v>

826
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.100
It hasn't happened for me.
Help me out guys.

827
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:40.460
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

828
00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.980
<v 1>Then it,
then you get,
you have,
you get brings people together.</v>

829
00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.500
Let's get them lake.

830
00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:45.650
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

831
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:49.160
<v 1>just don't go to a hook.
Uh,
I'm not much of a party guy,</v>

832
00:49:49.161 --> 00:49:50.870
but I wanted to step out of my comfort zone.

833
00:49:50.871 --> 00:49:54.680
So I decided to go for my lack of experience.
It seemed pretty wild.

834
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.270
There was lots of alcohol,
mostly hard liquor,

835
00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:03.340
vaping making out and loud rap music that I didn't know the lyrics to.
Dude,

836
00:50:03.341 --> 00:50:05.890
you are hilarious,
man.
This guy's a writer.

837
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.940
<v 0>Um,
it really painted.
Yeah.</v>

838
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.310
<v 1>Being the sheltered person that I am,</v>

839
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:14.010
I stayed in the corner and just observed everyone else.

840
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:17.760
I was approached by a few people that offer to alcohol,
but I kindly refuse.

841
00:50:17.761 --> 00:50:21.780
That's good.
You're a strong person saying that I would drink something else.

842
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:26.220
I realized that the alcohol would helped me loosen up.
So it was pretty tempting,

843
00:50:26.221 --> 00:50:28.340
but not having any experience with it.

844
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:31.700
I decided not to smart man using your head.

845
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.950
Even though I kept to myself for the most part,

846
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.160
I had some fun and I'm looking forward to the next party.
I am,

847
00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:41.930
I am a pretty small person on and five pounds soaking wet and about five feet,

848
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:46.400
seven inches tall.
So it wouldn't take much for me to feel the effects.

849
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.890
Um,
I am mostly afraid of how I would act and what I would say.
Dude,

850
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:55.970
you're a very smart person.
A college is all about new experiences,
right?

851
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:56.691
So what do you think?

852
00:50:56.691 --> 00:51:01.520
Should I drink the next time a party at a party or gathering comes up?

853
00:51:01.521 --> 00:51:05.000
If so,
what advice do you have?
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

854
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.430
I dunno,
you're underage so I can't tell you to go drink.
You shouldn't do.

855
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.230
If if I,
if how I would,
I wish I would've handled she situations like that.

856
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.180
I just tell you roommate that that's the deal.

857
00:51:17.181 --> 00:51:21.170
I never really drank or anything like that and I would stay in your dorm room

858
00:51:21.171 --> 00:51:22.670
and just drink a beer.

859
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.110
I would do that and then tell your roommate to say,
Hey,
can you do me favor?

860
00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:29.960
Just look out for me.
At this party.
I don't want to do with say anything stupid.

861
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.160
Right.
And then on top of that,
when you go to the party,
don't fucking,

862
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.140
don't get crazy as long as you got to,

863
00:51:37.141 --> 00:51:38.900
as long as you sitting there with a beer in your hand,

864
00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:40.160
you can legally have water in them,

865
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.740
in the canned for all they know and just be sipping a,
you know,

866
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:47.690
but it's a very mature thing that you're already considering not being out of

867
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:52.550
control.
So I wouldn't do that.
Okay.
You shouldn't drink if you're under age.

868
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.400
You shouldn't.
I did.
It was stupid.

869
00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.730
I got in a lot of trouble and it ended with me getting fucking arrested in me.

870
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:02.390
Finally fucking smarten up.
Really in the really,
the reality is,
is,
you know,

871
00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.360
nothing good comes from it.
It's not good for you.

872
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:09.260
It's not good for you health wise.
Um,
it's not,
it's not good.

873
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.110
It's just not good for you.
Um,
you put on,

874
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.440
you're going to put on the wrong kind of weight if you do.
However,

875
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:19.310
when you're of age,
occasionally having a beer is the way you do it.

876
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:22.280
If you were mature person,
here I am,
50 years of fucking agent,

877
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:25.970
I still have to shut it down because I don't even know how to do it.
Um,

878
00:52:25.971 --> 00:52:28.310
so they know that that is the world that you're going into.

879
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:31.610
So I think it's good that you're very cautious.
Um,

880
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.090
having said that,
there's other ways to have fun,
but you know,

881
00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:37.550
you want to meet some women or whatever,
so just fucking go,
you know,

882
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:39.770
it's a strong move.
These would go there and you're not drinking.

883
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.750
You know what I mean?

884
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.840
But then it gets weird if you start talking to a woman and she's been drinking

885
00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:48.080
and then you haven't,
and then she wants to fucking hook up,

886
00:52:48.081 --> 00:52:52.130
then it's this weird fucking,
yeah,
it gets,

887
00:52:52.131 --> 00:52:54.590
it gets fucking weird man.
Um,
I would,
you know what I would do,

888
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:58.670
I would explore the place,
other ways to be social.
Go to the fucking party,

889
00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:02.720
don't fucking drink.
You know,
you'll be ahead of the game.

890
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:07.640
Um,
and then I would find other,
other social activities.
I mean,

891
00:53:07.641 --> 00:53:10.640
you're not the only person at school that doesn't drink.
You know,

892
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.700
maybe you can meet some fucking responsible,
you know,

893
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:18.200
woman have a good time.
That way.
There's a lot of ways to skin the cat.

894
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:21.890
And I'm really outside my element because I was the idiot that went to the

895
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:24.920
fucking party and did shitty in school.
So

896
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.950
<v 0>there you go.
You don't have to drink,
you know,</v>

897
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:33.750
have to fucking have a beer.
Uh,

898
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:35.880
all right to press girlfriend,
just no,
dude,

899
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:39.560
you're totally in control and there's nothing wrong with anything about you,

900
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:42.660
anything that you're doing.
And uh,

901
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.450
and a lot of ways she's stronger than most other people because they're just

902
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:48.900
doing what everybody else is doing,
which is the easiest thing.
Right?

903
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.250
And you'll see it in your lifetime.

904
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:53.220
Whenever he douche bag goes out and gets themselves a fucking robot because

905
00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:55.710
their neighbor has one.
All right to press girlfriend.

906
00:53:55.711 --> 00:54:00.210
Hello Billy [inaudible] Billy blue balls.
Um,

907
00:54:00.211 --> 00:54:05.211
so recently I've started a relationship with the girl and uh,

908
00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.360
she told me that she needed to tell me something very important that I might not

909
00:54:10.361 --> 00:54:12.970
like about her.
Uh,

910
00:54:12.971 --> 00:54:17.170
she told me that she had been diagnosed as depressed for several years.

911
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:18.071
Mind you,

912
00:54:18.071 --> 00:54:22.540
I've only known this girl for several months and I don't know her circumstances.

913
00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:26.380
Is this a deal breaker?
Do I break up with their,
should I ignore it?

914
00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.100
If I break up with her,
is she going to harm herself?

915
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:34.180
The situation puts me in a bad position and I am not sure what to do.

916
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:38.260
I think she regrets telling me because she doesn't want me to judge her.
Also,

917
00:54:38.261 --> 00:54:42.070
I am a younger male still in high school and I feel like I am not mature enough

918
00:54:42.071 --> 00:54:45.550
to deal with this situation.
Help us appreciate it.
Ah,

919
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:46.923
<v 2>all right.</v>

920
00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:50.460
<v 0>Okay.
Number one,
anytime you have a problem,</v>

921
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:52.920
you should never ignore it cause all it does is just get bigger.

922
00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.313
<v 2>MMM.</v>

923
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.630
<v 0>Is this a deal breaker?
Do I break up with her?</v>

924
00:54:58.631 --> 00:55:03.010
These are all decisions you have to make.
Um,
as far as you breaking,

925
00:55:03.011 --> 00:55:06.520
if you do break up with it,
is it going to harm her?
He,
it's,
it's not your,

926
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:11.521
your responsibility in life is your happiness when it comes to relationships.

927
00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.070
Okay.
And if you're in something you don't want to be in,
in a nice,

928
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:18.550
respectful way,
you sit down with the person,
you tell them you're not happy,

929
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:19.870
that you liked them.

930
00:55:19.871 --> 00:55:23.290
You just don't like him in a way where you want to continue and then you don't

931
00:55:23.291 --> 00:55:27.280
just not talk to him.
You can still be friends with them and stuff like that.

932
00:55:27.281 --> 00:55:31.450
You just,
you don't have to be a fucking asshole about it.
However,
though,
if,
if,

933
00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:35.610
you know,
if at the end,
all of this shit,

934
00:55:35.611 --> 00:55:37.980
what this person is bringing to the table is not what you're into,

935
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:40.860
then there's nothing wrong with breaking up with them.
Um,

936
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.810
there's plenty of ways for her to get help.

937
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:47.820
It's not your responsibility that she has been diagnosed as depressed.

938
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.280
Um,
but you know,
I,

939
00:55:52.281 --> 00:55:56.880
I would talk to her about it and just say like,
you know what?
It's what,

940
00:55:56.881 --> 00:56:01.650
it's
how it makes you feel just yet.
I don't want to just silly,

941
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:06.210
I'm not judging.
We all got our,
our issues or whatever.
Um,

942
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.640
you know,
I would just talk to her and learn more about it.
Learn,
how is it,
how,

943
00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.090
how deep is it?
You know,

944
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:14.880
she laid on the floor for weeks and can't get out of the fucking house.
I mean,

945
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:16.980
you know,
I mean that's,
that's,
that's a lot to take on.

946
00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:21.890
And someone who's out there with butterfly flies swirling around your head.

947
00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.760
If you're not having a fucking problem,
know it's,
it's all going to be up to you.

948
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:25.930
But I would not ignore it.

949
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:29.680
I would just sit down and talk to her about it and then digest it and then see

950
00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:33.040
how you're feeling about it and whatever your gut is telling you to do,

951
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:36.310
I would do.
And if it's stay with her,
I would stay with during,

952
00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:39.190
if it's says to leave,
leave,
but do what you know.

953
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.400
You don't have to be mean when you break up with somebody.

954
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.960
And one of the worst things ever is they don't teach people how to break up with

955
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:50.440
people.
Uh,
I,
there should just be a fucking class on that.

956
00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.120
And like the masters of it are the ones who can break up with somebody and they

957
00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:59.960
can still be friends with them
is an incredible thing.
But,
and,
but I,
and you know,

958
00:56:59.961 --> 00:57:04.390
and I think the only way to do that is it from day one,

959
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.350
you're just honest and you're constantly checking in emotionally about where

960
00:57:08.351 --> 00:57:11.680
you're at.
Because if you don't,
and it's going off the rails and you know,

961
00:57:11.681 --> 00:57:13.600
it's off the rails and the other person doesn't,

962
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.870
that's when somebody feels like they got dumped.

963
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.760
But if you're talking the whole way along,

964
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:20.950
the other person kind of knows it's good,
still sucks.

965
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.950
It's still going to be painful,
but it's not that fucking like,

966
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.200
where did that come from?
And then the next thing you know,

967
00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:29.620
she's standing outside your fucking bedroom window with a pair of sharpen

968
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:34.360
scissors.
All right?
So there you go.
That's the podcast.

969
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.270
It's a little bit short this week,
but,
uh,

970
00:57:37.271 --> 00:57:42.271
I gotta I gotta figure out how to fucking download Skype again so I can do this

971
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:45.010
other bullshit or whatever.
All right.
Ah,
that's it everybody.

972
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:47.680
I hope you all had a great thanksgiving.
I hope you all have great thanksgiving.

973
00:57:47.681 --> 00:57:50.150
I hope you didn't get trampled on black Friday.

974
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.290

977

Um,

980
00:58:12.941 --> 00:58:15.190

I've never done this podcast,
but,

981
00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:17.860

Jesus Christ.
