00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.460
So let's review everything that
we know so far, because it's

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.470
good to keep reviewing.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.360
Because these are things
you should never forget

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.870
the rest of your life.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.330
So if I have a line and if I
draw an angle that goes--

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.530
let's say this is the
pivot point, right?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.790
If I go all the way around
the line, or in a circle,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.975
that's 360 degrees.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.430
We learned that there are
360 degrees in a circle.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.750
Right?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.440
We also learned that if
I have lines like this.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:41.140
If I have two angles-- let
me draw it like that.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.490
And this is angle x.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.625
This is angle y.

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:57.825
x and y are supplementary.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.630
And that just means that
they add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.810
x plus y is equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.920
And why does that make sense?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.200
Because look, if we add
up x plus y we have gone

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.450
halfway around the circle.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.040
So that's 180 degrees, right?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000
So this is part of the way, and
this is the rest of the way.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.620
So x plus y are going
to equal 180 degrees.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.380
So hopefully we
have learned that.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.316
And then let me switch colors
for the sake of variety.

00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:39.080
Let me use my line tool.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.140
If I have-- let's see,
I'm going to draw

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.050
perpendicular lines.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
If I have that line, and
then I have that line.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.080
And they are perpendicular.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.270
And then I have another line.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.870
Let's say it goes like that.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.730
And then I say that
this is angle x.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.030
Woops.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.650
This is angle x.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.240
And this is angle y.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.040
Well, I said this line and this
line are perpendicular, right?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.390
So that means that they
intersect at a 90 degree angle.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.710
So we know that this whole
thing is 90 degrees.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.010
And so what do we
know about x plus y?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.435
Well, x plus y is going
to equal 90 degrees.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.330
Or we could say that x
and y are complementary.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.920
And I always get confused
between supplementary

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.670
and complementary.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.910
You just got to memorize it.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.470
I don't know if there's
any-- let's see, is

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.650
there any easy way?

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950
180, supplementary.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.890
You could say that 180-- 100
starts with an O, which

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.950
supplementary does
not start with.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.080
So there.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.500
There's your mnemonic.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.910
Complementary.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.100
And 90 starts with an N,
and complementary does

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.920
not start with an N.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.450
That's your other mnemonic.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.930
Complementary.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.590
I don't know if I'm
spelling it right.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.590
Who cares?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.750
Let's move on.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.190
So let's learn some more
stuff about angles.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.490
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give you an arsenal,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.640
and then once you have that
arsenal you can just tackle

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.280
these beastly problems that
I'm going to throw at you.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.960
So just take these for granted
right now, and then in a few

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.630
videos, probably, we're
going to tackle some

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.505
beastly problems.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.480
And you know, I'm
using variables here.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.486
And if you're not familiar
with variables you

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:42.135
can put numbers here.

00:03:42.135 --> 00:03:46.050
If x was 30 degrees, then y
is going to be 60 degrees.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.670
Right?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.050
Or in this case, if x is, I
don't know, 45 degrees, then y

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.960
is going to be 135 degrees.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.560
That other way.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.290
Let me draw another property of
angles of intersecting lines.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.890
So if I have two angles, two
lines that intersect like this.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.760
So a couple of
interesting things.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.695
So first, I'm going to teach
you about opposite angles.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.510
Let me switch colors.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.860
Let me switch to yellow.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.710
So if this is x degrees, then
it turns out that the angle

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.110
opposite to it is also
equal to x degrees.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.180
And you don't believe me?

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.550
Well let me prove it to you.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.900
Let's say we call this,
I don't know, let's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.800
call this y degrees.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.560
Right?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.520
And I'm going to prove
to you that the x and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.020
the y are the same.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.680
Well what do we know already?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.640
Let's call this other angle--
and I'm doing this to

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:10.530
confuse you-- angle z.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.940
Well what do we know about
angle x and angle z?

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.160
It may not be obvious to you
because I've drawn it slightly

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.350
different, but I'll give you
a small hint with

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.310
an appropriately
interesting color.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.870
So what angle is this
whole thing right here?

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.550
Well I'm just going
along a line, right?

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.600
That's halfway around a circle.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.000
So what angle is that?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.190
Well that's 180 degrees.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.250
So what does x plus z equal?

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.820
Well, x plus z is going to
equal that larger angle.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:54.040
x plus purple z is going to
equal-- I think I'll switch to

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.030
the blue; maybe it's taking too
much time for me to switch--

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.890
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.580
Or x and z are supplementary.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.630
I've run out of space.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.900
So what do we know about z?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.400
Well z is equal to 180 minus x.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.750
Right?

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.070
Because x plus z is 180.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.540
Fine.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.850
Now, what's the relationship
between z and y?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.770
Well, z and y are
also supplementary.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.210
Because look, if I
drew this angle here.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.792
Look at this big angle.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.690
What angle is that?

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.260
Well once again I'm still going
halfway around the circle.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.990
Right?

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.390
But now I'm using this
line right here.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.230
So that's 180 degrees.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.440
So we know that angle z
plus angle y is also

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.685
equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.820
Right?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.930
Or, I don't want to keep
writing it, but z and y

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.670
are also supplementary.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.500
But we just figured out
that z is 180 minus x.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.140
Right?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.960
So let's just substitute
that back in here.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:29.420
So we get 180 minus x plus
y is equal to 180 degrees.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.690
Why don't we subtract 180
degrees from both sides

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.960
of this equation.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.540
That cancels out, and we get
minus x plus y is equal to 0.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.730
And then add x to both sides
of this equation, and

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.030
we get y is equal to x.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.000
That was a very long way of
showing you something that is

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.080
fairly simple-- that opposite
angles are equal to each other.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.950
So x is equal to y.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.730
And if you've played around
with this, if you just drew a

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.160
bunch of straight lines and
they intersected at different

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.720
angles, I think when you
eyeball it it would make sense.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.590
And then similarly, if that's z
then the other opposite angle

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:15.510
here is also z degrees.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.790
So what do we know now?

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.870
The total angles in a
circle, 360 degrees.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.380
When two angles kind of
combine, go halfway around the

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.520
circle-- or they combine,
kind of form a line.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.530
There's different ways
you can think about it.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.370
We know they're supplementary.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.350
They add up to 180 degrees.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.920
x plus y is 180 degrees.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.360
If they add up to 90
it's complementary.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.570
x plus y is 90.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.020
And then opposite angles
are equal to each other.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.350
Right?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.130
This angle is equal
to this angle.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.310
And then this angle is going to
be equal to this angle for the

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.990
same reason-- because
it's opposite.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.355
In the next video I'm going
to show you about parallel

00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:55.940
lines and transversals.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.170
More fancy words for what
I think are fairly

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.520
straightforward concepts.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.350
I'll see in the next video.
