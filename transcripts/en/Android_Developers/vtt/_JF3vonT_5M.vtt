00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
TREVOR JOHNS: --couldn't play
a video as an Android

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.760
application.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.600
Of course, you already mentioned
one of them, which

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.400
is to go ahead and open up the
native YouTube application.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.780
You can do that via an intent.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.820
And that's definitely a good
approach, but the downside

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.290
there is that it's going
to take you out of your

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.340
application.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.620
And so if you're looking for a
more immersive experience, you

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.290
have a few other options.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.080
You could go ahead and ad a web
view which links to the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.900
Flash version of YouTube.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.570
Or you could also go
and low the HTML

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.200
file version of YouTube.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.560
Each of those have
some catches,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.800
though, pretty important.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
Older devices-- and actually
some newer devices for that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.510
matter, too--

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.850
don't have Flash installed.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.010
So the Flash Player's not
always available.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.700
And older devices aren't going
to be able to play HTML5 file

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.600
video unless they have an
HTML5-compliant WebView

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.530
implementation.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.970
So with that out of the way,
for current devices, that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.160
pretty much limits
your options to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.750
built-in YouTube app.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.190
So for almost all practical
purposes right now, I'd say

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.590
the best option is to go ahead
and fire it off an intent and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.150
send the user off to the YouTube
player just so they

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.950
have the best YouTube
playback experience.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.010
Now that said, we did
pre-announce a YouTube API for

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.880
Android at Google
I/O this year.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.840
It's not ready yet, but
it will be at some

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.600
point in the future.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.340
And that will allow you to go
ahead and embed YouTube videos

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.320
within your application,
just as a--

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.650
basically the way WebView works
except it will be a

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.730
YouTube view.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.030
So if you want to learn more
about that, go ahead and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.430
search Google for YouTube
Android API.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.460
And there's a slide
deck and a--

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.470
actually a video on YouTube for
that matter, where you can

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.340
go ahead and learn more
about all of that.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.020
And keep an eye on that
for some time

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.330
later in the near future.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.190
Don't know an exact date, but
sometime hopefully soon, there

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.040
will be some more
news on that.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.415
And if you want a demo,
actually, the Google I/O app,

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.860
the Android schedule
app is a good

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.820
example of how that works.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.445
ALEX LUCAS: Here is actually
an interesting question.

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.370
I don't know the answer to
this myself, but is it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.810
possible to detect at run time
if the phone will support

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.380
YouTube via Flash?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.680
TREVOR JOHNS: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.270
I imagine you could actually
check PackageManager and look

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.580
for the Flash package.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.130
And if you see that on there,
It's probably a pretty good

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.910
sign Flash is working.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.280
ALEX LUCAS: Right.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.260
See what I would suggest maybe
is, because the post from

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.320
Michelle does state that she
would prefer to keep the user

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.370
inside the app, is if there's a
way to detect at run time if

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.510
Flash is supported on the device
or if YouTube via HTML5

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.580
would be supported on
the device, it would

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.710
require extra effort.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.090
But you could just do all three
implementations and say,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.490
OK, if Flash is supported on
this device, do it in Flash.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.360
If not, if HTML5 is supported
on this device,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.780
do an embedded WebView.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.170
If not, intent out.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.610
That way you would have a wider
range of phones that you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.650
support for in-app and not
necessarily have to go to the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680
YouTube app every time.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.160
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.850
Now, I've seen some people use
RTSP also, but I'm not sure if

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.960
that's actually allowed.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.070
So you might want to check the
YouTube terms of service.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.290
I sort of a suspicion that
you might not be

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.790
allowed to do that.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.580
ALEX LUCAS: We discourage
sketchy behavior.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.850
TREVOR JOHNS: Right.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.600
ALEX LUCAS: Ethical and TOS
issues aside, even though they

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.850
are real issues.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.570
But if you do something like
that, it is liable to get

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.100
broken in the next version of
Android once a security fix

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.720
for that is determined.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.980
TREVOR JOHNS: I don't think
that's a security issue.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.830
ALEX LUCAS: Not security,
but--

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.380
TREVOR JOHNS: I think that's
just a YouTube terms of

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.550
service issue.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.240
But in any case, I think the
correct answer here until we

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.290
get the YouTube API
out is to go

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.650
ahead and use the embedded--

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.600
the native YouTube app.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.450
I think for pretty much every
case there, you're going to

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.060
get the best experience
that way.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.000
At least for now.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.480
So let's go ahead and move
on to the next question.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.470
I just realized, Dan, we never
turn on the lights in here.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.250
ALEX LUCAS: Makes
us look like--

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.440
DAN: We can make that happen.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.420
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, all right.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.220
Let's move on to the
next question.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.370
ALEX LUCAS: All right, the
next question. "A real

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.960
Bluetooth headset button push
still works in the foreground

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.320
music app, but my mimicked
action_media_button intents no

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.990
longer work in Android
4.0 or above.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.690
As I said, Google
music hogs them.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.546
What are Bluetooth headsets
doing differently?"

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.950
TREVOR JOHNS: Excellent
question.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.630
So this question, I think, just
came in probably about 10

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.829
minutes before our broadcast.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.500
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah, we,
unfortunately, have not had

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.450
time to research it, and neither
of us, I think, know

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.880
off the top of our heads.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.960
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.325
It's possible that
it's being--

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.560
the media framework is going
in and integrating directly

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.410
with the Bluetooth stack.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.810
I'm not actually sure.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.280
The good news is the source
is out there.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.480
If you want to go ahead and take
a look, you can go ahead

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.490
and dig into it a
little deeper.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.100
We'll do the same on our end and
try and get you an answer

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.260
for the next show.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.550
Again, we just don't
have enough time.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.080
We didn't have enough time
before to actually get

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.430
researching an answer here.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.800
I think trying to mimic the
action_media_button intent to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.440
simulate a Bluetooth button push
is a little sketchy, so

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.750
I'm not terribly surprised
that you're

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.080
having some issues there.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.690
But we'll try and get you an
answer, try and figure out

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.460
what's going on.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.510
Join us next week and we'll have
an answer for you at the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.520
beginning of the show.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.330
ALEX LUCAS: We just
got brighter.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.330
TREVOR JOHNS: It did.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.765
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:05:14.765 --> 00:05:15.635
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:05:15.635 --> 00:05:16.690
ALEX LUCAS: It takes
away my ominous,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.240
shadowy appearance, though.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.670
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.960
So, "is there a reason why
Google does not release

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.200
updates of new Android versions
for all interested

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.300
developers with Nexus 7 and the
Galaxy Nexus devices right

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.560
away outside of the long OTA
cycle without having to root

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.140
the device and doing
it manually?"

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.368
ALEX LUCAS: Yes.

00:05:33.368 --> 00:05:33.520
Next question.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.545
TREVOR JOHNS: And that's
by Chris from London.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.440
Oh, I think it's actually
a valid point.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.420
ALEX LUCAS: I was joking.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.050
TREVOR JOHNS: So right now,
the way we do software

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.500
updates, assuming you have a
device that has an OS update

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.280
available, is we roll the device
out to a fraction of

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.450
users at a time.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.760
And there's a number of
reasons we do that.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.520
First off, it makes sure that
we don't overload carrier

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.320
networks for people who are
on cellular connections.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.040
In fact, I think there's even an
option in there where they

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.430
can go and offer only to
Wi-Fi users for the

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.750
first 24, 48 hours.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.260
But we also go and roll out
slowly just to make sure if

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.240
there's any bugs with update,
major, major bugs that somehow

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.800
we didn't catch during testing,
That way we can go

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.680
ahead and abort the update and
solve those problems before

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.990
many users are impacted.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.150
Now, we do test things pretty
thoroughly, and it's rare that

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.470
something like that happens.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.730
It's just a safety device that
we've basically built in.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.280
I think in the case
of developers,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.320
it's a valid concern.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.270
It would be definitely very nice
to be one of the first

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.670
users to get a software update,
so that way you can

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.800
update your application.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.850
So I'll make sure that the--

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.360
actually, I think that we
already filed a bug this

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.300
morning for this.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.750
So there is a bug open.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.790
We'll go ahead and make sure
that the OTA team sees it as a

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.130
feature request.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.660
I think it's completely
valid, and thank you

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.480
for the great idea.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.773
We'll see we can do to get
that implemented for you.

00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:54.156
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:06:54.156 --> 00:06:55.406
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.040
ALEX LUCAS: OK.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.750
"When will we get a supported
Marketplace API, eg, to search

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.850
the marketplace for apps
and pull their details,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.480
screenshots, and analyze
comments and ratings?

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.550
Microsoft and Apple support
this, and they are closed

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.840
markets."

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.080
That's a good question.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.420
Unfortunately, this definitely
falls into the category of

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.060
roadmap question.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.490
And as a matter of policy, we
can't discuss future features

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.580
that we may or may not be
implementing or whether or not

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.740
we're working on them, when the
hypothetical release day

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.620
would be, that kind of thing.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.770
We will definitely file it
as a feature request.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.640
But we can't really say anything
about when it would

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.750
happen, or if we're
working on it.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.130
TREVOR JOHNS: Yep.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.350
I think that's a pretty
good answer.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.920
So Percy from the Philippines
says, "can I retrieve data

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.210
from the Google Maps API
so I can use it for my

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.180
location-based service
application I'm developing/"

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.270
So I'm not sure what sort of
data you're looking for Percy,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.740
but there are a number
of things that

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.100
you can access already.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.760
You can access the user's
current location via the

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.010
location manager.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.010
And that actually really doesn't
have anything to do

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:08.790
with Google Maps.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.880
It's just what's the user's
latitude, longitude, altitude,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.640
basic data you'd get from GPS.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.480
Or if there's a Wi-Fi network
nearby, it can do course

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.740
location, things like that.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.580
You can also do geocoding which
is-- actually I think

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.020
it's reverse geocoding.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.650
Is it?

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.270
No.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.170
It's standard geocoding.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.910
Yeah.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:32.650
It's converting latitude
and longitude to a

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.929
human-readable address.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.409
ALEX LUCAS: That's reverse
geocoding.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.909
TREVOR JOHNS: OK.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:37.909
Now, do we--

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.400
I think we support both
ways, don't we?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.690
ALEX LUCAS: I believe we
support both ways.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.680
Those actually might be
via the Maps API.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.400
TREVOR JOHNS: Actually
it's not.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.660
It's via LocationManager.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.240
ALEX LUCAS: Interesting.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.860
TREVOR JOHNS: I think it uses
Maps under the hood.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.610
But it is part of the
LocationManager package.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.510
So there's utilities to go and
convert from lat/long to an

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.080
address and back from
address to lat/long.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.210
So that's all totally
possible.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.940
Now if you want to do something

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.900
more graphical, right?

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.770
You want to display a map and
let the user see where they

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.030
are in the world as opposed
to just telling them their

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.140
numerical address, right?

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.000
You can embed MapView inside of
your application which will

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.230
render Google Maps, the
user's location.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.620
And there's some limited
options to go

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.020
and customize that.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.940
If you want to go a step further
and start adding

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.080
really complicated stuff
like polygons--

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.590
ALEX LUCAS: Markers.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.070
TREVOR JOHNS: --markers, custom
map tiles, you could go

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.320
ahead and add a WebView that
loads the Google Maps

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.130
API from the web.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.120
And that's how you
can get some of

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.990
those advanced features.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.460
We definitely encourage
people to use a

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.980
standard MapView at first.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.580
But sometimes you want to do
these advanced things, and

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.020
that's when you have to look
into the web-based APIs.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.350
So I think that's a
yes as far as the

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.140
answer to this question.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.100
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.310
TREVOR JOHNS: Now if you want
to do something like get

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.960
driving directions, though,
that's where you're going to

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.980
run into some problems.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.460
And you won't be able to pull
that data out of Google Maps.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.070
But I believe you can send the
user-- yeah, you can totally

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.130
just send the user over to
Google Maps and construct a

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.610
URL for directions and
have that load.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.390
So there are ways to go and
tell Google Maps what data

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.990
you'd like it to display.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.550
But it'll still be within Google
Maps for the users

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.700
receiving that content.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.670
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.710
I I also want to add, we do have
a lot of online resources

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.340
for using the Maps API.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.080
With Android, it's on
developer.android.com/android.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.840
I don't remember the tail
end of that URL.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.540
TREVOR JOHNS: Wait,
developer.android.com/android?

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.180
ALEX LUCAS: Oh, sorry,
developer.google.com/android.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.030
TREVOR JOHNS: There you go.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.550
ALEX LUCAS: And that's where
most of the APIs for using

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.920
Google services with Android--

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.570
that's where you're going
to find those.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.510
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.310
So moving on to the next
question then.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.550
X asks, "whereabout in the
source code can I find the 4.1

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.650
LockScreen?

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.030
The use case is to borrow the
layout, aesthetics, assets, of

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.860
the unlock ring." So this is
another one of those questions

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.612
that came in right before the
show, so we haven't had a

00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:04.180
chance to look it up yet.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.060
That being said, I want to
say that there's just--

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.230
there's a package called
LockScreen?

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.280
ALEX LUCAS: I think so.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.640
TREVOR JOHNS: It might
be a little off.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.860
If you go to source.android.com,
you can go

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.080
to the package viewer
and find--

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.610
and just search the page for
lock, and it'll come up.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.920
I know it's in there but I
can't remember the exact

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.772
package name off the
top of my head.

00:11:26.772 --> 00:11:30.390
I can try and research it during
the next question.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.900
ALEX LUCAS: If you have the
Android source downloaded

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.320
already, I would say just grep
the source for LockScreen.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.790
It'll be probably capital S--

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.990
or capital L capital S. But I
don't know the package off the

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.160
top of my head.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.620
We'd have to look that up.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.160
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.770
So let's go hit the
to next question.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.800
Alex, do you want to
take this one?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.960
ALEX LUCAS: Sure.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.860
"What is the best view
to use to display an

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.810
option between two items?

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.330
I want the user to be able to
select between one way and

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.160
round trip.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.970
The available options
don't seem to

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.230
fit well in my opinion.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.210
What would you suggest?"

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.820
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:12.500
So you just want to go and
have an option chooser

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.840
basically, like a
radio button?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.070
ALEX LUCAS: Just to select
between two.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.400
So I guess the--

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.860
what are the options
we have right now?

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.400
We have the spinner, which
is a drop-down.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.850
And we have radio buttons.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.230
We also have, I guess, tabs,
depending on how you would--

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.890
if it would make sense in
the context of your app.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.520
TREVOR JOHNS: Or you could put
two buttons side by side and

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.170
make them stay pressed.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.150
ALEX LUCAS: Or you can have
one button that's a toggle

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.670
button that just changes the
label or whatever action it's

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.630
going to perform.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.210
It's really difficult
to say best one to

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.410
use, because we have--

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.670
I mean, we just iterated
over most of them.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.890
There are several options,
and it very

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.420
much depends on context.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.680
So being able to say--

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.395
OK, so to choose between one-way
and round trip, I

00:13:03.395 --> 00:13:08.320
assume, means something along
the lines of buying airline

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.140
tickets via an Android app
or something like that.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.220
There I would probably go with
a drop-down so you don't take

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.450
up too much of the screen.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.700
But it really is context
dependent.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.020
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, I think--

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.590
I mean, I think that's pretty
much all the options I can

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.380
think of off the
top of my head.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.100
I mean, it's tough to say
without actually seeing what

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.780
your application's doing.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:41.450
We can go ahead and give you
lots of very, very general

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.520
advice, but a screenshot would
help immensely here.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.250
So if you happen to be watching
live, feel free to

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.550
hop on Google+, give us a little
bit more background

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.580
about what you're doing, and
we can go ahead and try and

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.510
get you some more tailored
advice to your app.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.890
Failing that, there's also the
Friday App Clinic, where you

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.026
can go and get advice from--

00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:02.240
I believe Reto and Ian are
hosting that right now.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.270
ALEX LUCAS: Reto and Ian.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.796
TREVOR JOHNS: And then also
there's the UI Show, too.

00:14:05.796 --> 00:14:07.340
ALEX LUCAS: What day
is the UI Show?

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.870
TREVOR JOHNS: Monday.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.100
ALEX LUCAS: Monday.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.852
Oh, OK.

00:14:08.852 --> 00:14:09.470
Monday's good.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.350
DAN: Actually, it's Tuesday.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.470
TREVOR JOHNS: Tuesday.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.990
ALEX LUCAS: Tuesday.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.330
All right. it's Tuesday now.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.974
TREVOR JOHNS: I think it's
probably always been Tuesday.

00:14:16.974 --> 00:14:19.100
ALEX LUCAS: I would say also,
one thing to keep in mind for

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.140
the Friday App Clinic, the way
that works is you submit your

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.240
app and usually you submit
a link to on market--

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.240
or, sorry, on Google
Play Market.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.260
So if the app isn't developed
yet, then that wouldn't be the

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.286
place for it.

00:14:32.286 --> 00:14:33.440
In that case, you'd probably
want to send a couple

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.210
screenshots to the UI
review on Tuesday.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.190
But, yeah, I would say those
are options for followup.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.100
But based on what I can see of
the one way versus round trip,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.270
it seems like drop-down
would be--

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.590
it would not be a bad choice.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.810
I don't know about
best choice.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.460
I can't say without looking
at you application.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.340
TREVOR JOHNS: Right.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.550
I'm just in here trying
to find that

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.120
LockScreen package here.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.820
But no, I think that's
a good answer.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.000
Without seeing the app,
I think we've said

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.750
everything we can.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.610
But again, if you're watching
live, we'd love to get some

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:11.120
more details and give you some
more tailored device.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.670
So let's move on to
the next question.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.040
Joe from Maine asks, "I am
sendOrderedbroadcasting--"

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.150
wow, it's a verb now.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.110
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.300
TREVOR JOHNS: "I am
sendOrderedbroadcasting

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.050
ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTONS--

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.220
or button intents to
MEDIA_BUTTON_PLAY_PAUSE--" oh,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.030
I think this is the same
question we got-- "to mimic a

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:33.990
Bluetooth headset button push.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.620
In Android 4 and above, only
Play Music responds, but

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.630
pre-4.0, the current music
playing app would respond.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.720
What changed in Android 4?"

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.580
I think our answer here is
the same as last time.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.700
We got this question right
before the show, so we don't

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.380
know without actually digging
through the source, which it

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.700
takes us more than 10 minutes,
especially as we are prepping

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.390
for the show.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.140
So definitely a good question.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.130
I'd love to get you an answer.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.130
We just didn't have enough time
to answer it because this

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.290
question came in late.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.300
We'll try and get you an answer

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.560
by next week's broadcast.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.810
All right.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.780
And this is actually probably
a good time to remind anyone

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.970
who is watching live,
feel free to join

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.770
us on Google+ Hangouts.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.640
I assume that Dan over here in
the corner is monitoring that.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.020
So if anybody does want to go
and ask a question, just I

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.520
guess either speak up or--

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.900
you are watching the Hangout,
right, Dan?

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.090
DAN: I am watching both.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.010
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, Excellent.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.380
Yeah, there's a tech there
in the corner.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.390
Yeah, so if you do have a
question, just wave your hand,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.060
type something in the
chat, speak up.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.310
We'll try and get you
on there live.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.470
If you don't have a microphone,
you can also go

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.190
ahead and type your questions to
us in Hangout chat, and we

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:37.210
can read them out.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.400
We'd love to get
live questions.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.280
Go easy on us.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.070
We can only do so much without
actually having time to

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.700
research stuff.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.490
But again, questions like that
last one on UI, excellent

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.100
things that we'd love to discuss
live if anyone does

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.600
want to go over any of that.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.810
So let's see here.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.630
This question.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.160
Daniel says, "I understood you
wanted to look into last

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.070
week's issue after the show--

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.970
Edit Text and onPause.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.329
Any news on that one?" I
don't think we have a--

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:06.599
that's the--

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.250
Is that the one that has to do
with the support library?

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.560
ALEX LUCAS: Oh, that's the one
where the value of the text

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.000
box would change when you
rotated the device.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.730
TREVOR JOHNS: OK.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.145
ALEX LUCAS: So it was
pre-populated with Hello

00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:21.400
World, and you typed, zzz, and
the value is helloworldzzz.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.630
Then you rotated the device.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.855
The new value would
just be zzz.

00:17:25.855 --> 00:17:26.890
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, that one.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.960
ALEX LUCAS: And it was a--

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.270
it's an interesting quirk.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.380
We haven't actually had
time to determine

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:32.950
the cause of that.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.290
But I will hopefully have
time to dig into that.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:35.350
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.518
We should get you an answer
on that one by

00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:37.270
the end of the day.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.201
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:40.950
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.570
DAN: We actually have
a screenshot for the

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.640
reservation--

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.420
TREVOR JOHNS: Oh, excellent.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.060
ALEX LUCAS: Awesome.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.250
TREVOR JOHNS: Are you able
to put that up some way?

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.570
DAN: No, but you can just
take a look over my

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.035
shoulder right here.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.700
ALEX LUCAS: OK, so there's
two buttons.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.760
Is there any way for you to
throw that into the Hangout so

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.200
that we're not just a bunch
of people staring

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.350
off-screen into space?

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.680
DAN: Um, I have--

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.060
TREVOR JOHNS: You could load
it on the Hangout computer.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.970
DAN: Yeah, I can put
it on the Hangout

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:08.960
computer if you guys want.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.790
TREVOR JOHNS: All right,
yeah, let's do that.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.070
ALEX LUCAS: Sure, yeah.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.450
TREVOR JOHNS: So we'll get back
to that in a second while

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.940
Dan goes and makes that
magically work for us.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.230
All right.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:22.020
So Viti asks, "could somebody
look at this issue on the

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.750
Android bug tracker regarding
the broken clipboard on

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.730
Samsung's Galaxy S3?"

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.600
So I did take a look at this.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.640
And so the issue, in particular,
here is whenever

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.590
the user copies data into the
clipboard on that particular

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.710
phone, there's a crash.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.750
And that's not really a
compatibility issue per se.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.760
I mean, the API is still--

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.640
the API hasn't changed any.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.960
It's more just an issue of
general system stability as

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.780
far as I can tell.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.230
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.650
TREVOR JOHNS: And I'm not sure
where exactly-- whether or not

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.030
that's an issue because of a
modification that Samsung's

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.840
made or if it's a problem
in the framework code.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.650
That said, since it is a Samsung
device this only

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:06.590
happening on, my suspicion is
that there's some interaction

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.410
with one of Samsung's
modifications

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.800
or a driver or something.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.500
I think this is a question that
we have to send over to

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.670
Samsung and they'll
have to address.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.910
It's really outside of our
hands in that case.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.990
If it was a compatibility issue,
we could update the

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.820
compatibility test suite.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.560
This is just more an issue of
the system is having some

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.100
problem with the clipboard.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.380
So definitely a bug we'd like
to look into, but it's one

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.045
that Samsung's going to be
responsible for fixing.

00:19:36.045 --> 00:19:39.590
So that being said, now that you
pointed it out, I'll make

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.760
sure that somebody at Samsung
does see that.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.330
So let's move onto the
next question.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.000
I think Dan's still working
on that screenshot.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.470
ALEX LUCAS: "When a user touches
a listview item, I'd

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.160
would like to hang a view off of
the bottom of the listview

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.510
item such that it overlaps
the next listview item.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.150
Do you think that this
is possible?

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.570
And off the top of your head,
any ideas on how you would do

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.740
it?" That's tricky.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.600
So I don't know if it
would necessarily

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.660
be possible to alter--

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:18.150
basically, you would have to
alter the z-value so it would

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.980
sort of hang over the
next listview.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.055
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, I don't
think-- you wouldn't be able

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.770
to do it as a part
of the listview.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.370
It'd have to be another view
that you stack on top.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.930
And in order to do that, you'd
have to go and compute where

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.140
the item is on your screen
and precisely

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.590
position a window there.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.260
It's sort of painful.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.740
I think it's totally possible.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.350
Just go and create a new view.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.870
Like Alex said, you're going to
want to make sure that it's

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.641
in front of everything else
and then just set the x,

00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:46.510
y-coordinates.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.210
That said, I think an easier
option would just be to go and

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.910
make you listview item
just a little bigger.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.230
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah, that's
what I would do.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.720
You would still have the
effect of pushing

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.520
it out of the way.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.360
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, it's
not going to overlap.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.330
But it's going to slide
the options underneath

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.340
it out of the way.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.200
ALEX LUCAS: And if you really
wanted to, you could also

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.460
maybe alter the brightness of
the one below it and above so

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.130
that the others around
it kind of fade out.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.180
TREVOR JOHNS: Or the other thing
you could do, actually,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.634
is just insert another listview
item underneath it.

00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:16.310
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah, you
could also do that.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.330
TREVOR JOHNS: In either case,
I'd make sure you take

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.840
advantage of the animation
framework.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.950
There's a flag you can set on
the listview to go and make

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.640
things nicely animate
in and out.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.690
And that'll get you some nice
eye candy to go along with

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.790
this effect.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.130
ALEX LUCAS: Right.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.350
If you're in the Hangout, I'd
be curious why you're trying

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.530
to do this.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.480
It's not really a behavior that
is typical of a listview,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.536
and it might be kind
of jarring.

00:21:43.536 --> 00:21:48.150
Dan's showing us pictures-- or
a video feed of ourselves,

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.770
staring into the abyss.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.250
Anyway, it's not something
that's expected, and I'd be

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.710
curious what the goal
of that is.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.900
If it's just to command
attention for one listview

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.410
item or to indicate it as
selected, or something like

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.590
that, there are other ways to
accomplish that that will

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.000
require less coding
on your part.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.070
So if--

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.260
David from Oakland, if you're
in the Hangout or watching

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.730
online, just pop into the
Hangout and give us a little

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.280
bit more context.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.520
And we could probably
answer your question

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.328
a little bit better.

00:22:20.328 --> 00:22:21.010
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.570
Dan, do you have that screenshot
for us ready?

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.820
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:22:27.034 --> 00:22:30.570
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, so are you
able put that up live?

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.580
DAN: Not right at this minute.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:32.980
TREVOR JOHNS: OK.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.660
DAN: I'm still fixing
some stuff up.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.620
TREVOR JOHNS: We'll wait till
you have that live then.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.680
I want to make sure our viewers
can see what we're

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.470
looking at.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.060
It's a lot more interesting
that way.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.720
ALEX LUCAS: Otherwise, we're
just staring at a box.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.490
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.486
All right.

00:22:45.486 --> 00:22:47.410
Let's move one to the
next question then.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.690
And this might actually be the
last recorded question.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:56.030
So Skate Benji from Italy asks,
"how do I get only the

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.200
contacts from the phone, not
Facebook contacts or Gmail

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.330
contacts?" I don't think
this is so--

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.780
I'm curious if this
is a developer

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.660
question or a user question.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.220
Well, let's take the user
question first.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.220
If you're in the contacts app,
you can-- on the latest

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.120
version of Android anyway, you
can go to the-- actually I

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.200
think-- yeah, in the latest
version you go to the menu.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.690
In old versions, you click on
the Menu button, and there's a

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.130
Display Options command.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.980
Let me pull it up,
actually, here.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.350
I'll get you the exact value.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.080
But you can go ahead
and click on that.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.960
And it'll let you pick which
contact sources you want to go

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.100
and sort, so it's basically
a filter.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.745
So let's see here.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.920
ALEX LUCAS: And then basically
it gives you the option of

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.470
only displaying contacts with
phone numbers attached.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.950
TREVOR JOHNS: Right.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.440
TREVOR JOHNS: So as a user,
that's how you would do it.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.970
TREVOR JOHNS: Actually, it's
called Contacts Display now.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.910
I think it used to be called
Display Options before.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:49.100
And so I have a thing that says
All Contacts, or Google,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.530
and they list all my
Google accounts.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.420
Or I can pick Google+ if I want
to see my contacts from

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.040
my Google+ circles.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.130
If I had Skype installed, it
would show my Skype contacts.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.240
And then there's a customized
option if you want to go and

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.980
get more specific.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.230
It only selects certain groups,
things like that.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.410
So that's how the People app,
or what used to be known as

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.280
the Contacts app, handles it.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.410
On the API if you want to do
this, the way this works for

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.670
each, if I remember the contacts
schema correctly, for

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:21.640
each contact or each person,
you'll have a overarching

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.970
contact entry.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.140
And then linked to that, you'll
have an entry from each

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.930
of the different content
providers on your system.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.620
So you can go ahead and just
construct a SQL query that

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.610
only gets contacts from the
package name that you desire.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.540
So if you--

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.310
com.Google will show you all
the contacts from Google

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.580
sources, for example.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.700
Or com.Skype would show you
your Skype contacts.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.670
And it's really just a matter
of selecting or adding a SQL

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.635
where clause to only select
that packaging.

00:24:50.635 --> 00:24:51.040
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.810
I don't know what the
package name off the

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.650
top of my head is.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.400
I think it's called com.Google
because of--

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.660
TREVOR JOHNS: For Contacts?

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:58.930
For Google Contacts?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.530
Yeah, for Google Contacts,
it's com.Google.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.490
ALEX LUCAS: OK.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.480
But you explicitly say not
Gmail contacts, which I'm

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.470
assuming you don't want everyone
in your buddy list

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.410
because you don't have
their phone numbers.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.520
So I think it would actually be
a two-part process, where

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.280
you search on the account
type being com.Google.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.950
And second of all, you would
filter on making sure that the

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.140
phone number is not-- no
one actually has a

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.130
value in that field.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.181
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:25:22.181 --> 00:25:23.830
I'd be a little careful
about this.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.430
Because some phones will let
you pick whether or not you

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.520
want to save the contact
to the SIM card

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.740
or to Google Contacts.

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.590
That being said, most
of the Google--

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:38.070
the Nexus devices will only
save contacts to Google

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:42.260
Contacts, at least for new
contacts that you create

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.800
unless you have some other
contact provider

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.300
installed, of course.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.200
It is modular.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.710
But the default behavior is only
to use Google Contacts.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.470
And the reason we do that is
because we want to go and make

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.450
sure everything is synced
to the cloud.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.050
It gives users a really nice
experience, right?

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.170
Whatever new phone
you get, all your

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.720
contacts are right there.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.720
So if you decide that you want
to filter out Gmail contacts,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.270
you might be filtering out every
single contact the user

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.460
has on their phone.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.070
So I think really if you do
want to add some filtering

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.470
here, I think it would be wise
to go and mimic the behavior

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.510
of the People app and give
the user a choice.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.470
Which contact sources do
they want to display?

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.650
Rather than just saying I only
want to show contacts that are

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.240
on the SIM card.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.800
Because, actually, I'd say on
most devices out there, that's

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.350
going to get into trouble, and
you're going to filter out

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.364
most contacts.

00:26:24.364 --> 00:26:25.310
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.470
TREVOR JOHNS: All right.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.185
Any luck, Dan?

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:27.490
DAN: Yep.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:27.935
I'm good.

00:26:27.935 --> 00:26:31.395
Give me one second, I'll put it
up onscreen and our viewers

00:26:31.395 --> 00:26:33.340
can take a look.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.360
ALEX LUCAS: OK.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.340
DAN: Here we go, guys.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.430
ALEX LUCAS: So we're
going to be the--

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.250
we're bringing UI review
to Wednesday right now.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.420
TREVOR JOHNS: It's true.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.640
ALEX LUCAS: OK.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.080
So--

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.980
TREVOR JOHNS: In this case,
there's a spinner on top that

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.870
says one way.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.930
And then underneath
that, what's the

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.650
text under there say?

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.443
DAN: It says "to the airport."

00:26:57.443 --> 00:26:58.190
TREVOR JOHNS: Ah.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.770
And then there's a
button that says?

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.250
DAN:"Next screen, choose
flight time."

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.050
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, gotcha.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.400
So it's like a, say, direction
to the airport app, I imagine.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.140
ALEX LUCAS: OK.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.020
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah so, first
thing I'd do here-- that

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.330
spinner's actually pretty bad.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.390
I'm not a fan of that spinner.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.120
I think your best
option here is--

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.380
look at the way Google
Maps does it, right?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.070
You have buttons there for
one way or round trip.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.340
Yeah, I wouldn't use
a tab or use a--

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:29.680
what's it called?

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.170
ALEX LUCAS: Radio buttons?

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.850
TREVOR JOHNS: Radio buttons
would work.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:33.930
ViewPager is a nice thing.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.360
Tabs and ViewPagers I'd
leave off the table.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.765
I think that's even more
heavy-handed than the spinner

00:27:38.765 --> 00:27:40.153
is right now.

00:27:40.153 --> 00:27:41.950
ALEX LUCAS: Tabs and ViewPagers
should only really

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:48.120
be used when each option would
then change the entire UI in

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.180
terms of what other options
you were presenting.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:50.670
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.390
Now the spinner that you have
right now isn't terribly bad.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.900
The problem is it's
just too wide.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.100
You're using up the entire
width of your page.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.830
But even then, let's say we do
make it smaller and make

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.780
things a little more
streamlined.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.570
The problem you're going to
run into here is that it's

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.540
multiple clicks to pick what
type of transportation you

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.260
want, right?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.870
It's at least two clicks,
actually almost-- it's

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.195
exclusively two clicks.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.570
You're going to click on the
spinner, and you're going to

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:19.620
click on the other option.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.560
And you really just don't have
enough choices here to go and

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.140
justify the overhead
of a full spinner.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.650
It's really just, option
one, option two.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.970
And so this is where radio
buttons or a toggle switch,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.340
which you could implement just
as two buttons side by side,

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.140
would really come in handy.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.400
ALEX LUCAS: Yeah.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:37.820
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.110
I think this is definitely a
good one to bring up as an

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.080
example on Roman's show.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.600
Too.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.870
But I think that pretty much
answers the question of what's

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.390
the best way to do this.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.170
If you do have any more
questions, again, feel free to

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:52.590
pop on to Hangout.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.090
If anybody on Hangout right now
has any questions, I think

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.990
now's the time to speak up.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.780
We are at the end of
our pre-submitted

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.930
questions for the day.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.840
So if nobody else has
any questions--

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.430
anybody signing on there?

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.960
Nope.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.535
All right.

00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:08.490
DAN: We actually have one
unrelated question.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:08.810
TREVOR JOHNS: Oh.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.320
Sure, let's take it.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.930
DAN: "Where's the tortoise?"
Which is, I guess, a reference

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.840
to "Doctor Who."

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.525
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, well,
our tortoise is--

00:29:14.525 --> 00:29:15.610
ALEX LUCAS: Where
is our tortoise?

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:16.850
TREVOR JOHNS: It's
up on the shelf

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.550
DAN: Yeah, it's-- so the answer
is it's still there.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.780
TREVOR JOHNS: It's still there,
just right off camera.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.760
ALEX LUCAS: It's off
camera, yeah.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.600
TREVOR JOHNS: It's
up and to the--

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.120
I guess Alex is on the
right on your screen.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.530
It's up and to the right
behind Alex's head.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.050
And you can still that little
green Android there and the

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:34.620
red Android jelly bean jar
just to the right of it.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.840
It's right next to the
jelly bean jar.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.560
It's still there.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.962
ALEX LUCAS: We had a time
machine question, and we

00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:40.410
didn't even have a
tortoise on hand.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.140
TREVOR JOHNS: It's
still broken.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.290
It still doesn't travel
through time.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.740
We still can't answer
those questions that

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.560
require time travel.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.230
ALEX LUCAS: It's in the
garage right now.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.750
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.400
But, no, it's still there.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.250
As soon as we get it fixed,
we'd love to answer your

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.990
questions about the future.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.610
But somehow I don't think we
have any Time Lords on staff.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.150
ALEX LUCAS: It's a shame.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:54.420
TREVOR JOHNS: It is.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.360
ALEX LUCAS: We keep trying to
hire them, but no one ever

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.130
takes the gig.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.180
TREVOR JOHNS: Well, we
have trouble getting

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:00.660
in touch with them.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.600
They keep floating around
through time.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.360
ALEX LUCAS: Right.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.000
TREVOR JOHNS: Anyway, I think
that's all the time we have

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.240
today for questions given that
we're out of questions.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.680
So if you do have any questions
for next week's

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.800
show, be sure to hop onto Google
Moderator and submit

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.780
them ahead of time.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.190
The earlier you submit
them, the better

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.570
answers we can give you.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.860
We usually reset Moderator
about an hour or two

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.660
after the show ends.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.000
So if you're watching this
pre-recor-- or if you're

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.200
watching this live,
wait a little bit.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.500
If you're watching the recorded
version, it's

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.240
probably already up right now.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.920
You can access the Moderator
page by going to either our

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.860
Plus page--
developer.android.com/plus.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.780
or searching for Google
Developers Live and accessing

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.750
our page from the Google
Developer Live homepage.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.950
So with that said, I think
it's time to say

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:45.890
goodbye for this week.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:46.365
ALEX LUCAS: Yep.

00:30:46.365 --> 00:30:47.460
Goodbye for this week.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.200
TREVOR JOHNS: Yep, all right.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.860
And again, we're every
Wednesday, 2:00 PM Pacific.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.390
Send us your Android questions,
and we'll answer

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.030
them for you.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.470
All right, see you everyone.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:55.720
ALEX LUCAS: Bye, guys.
