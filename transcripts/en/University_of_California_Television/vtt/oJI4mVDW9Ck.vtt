00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.518
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:14.851
bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:21.742
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:25.990
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.307
aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.390
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:34.147
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.585
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.668
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.196
We shape the future

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:46.500
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.334
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:54.501
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.353 --> 00:00:58.086
an exploration made possible

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:01.169
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:18.621
(upbeat techno music)

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:37.966
- Welcome everyone to
Extraordinary Variations

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:42.376
of the Human Mind:
Lessons from Anthropogeny.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:46.712
This meeting is co-sponsored
by two organizations.

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:47.709
This is our first attempt.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.835
It's our first effort at
bringing together these two.

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:53.136
One of the groups is called CARTA

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:55.169
which is the Center for Academic Research

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:57.408
and Training in Anthropogeny

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:59.738
and the other group is The Kavli Institute

00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:03.738
here in San Diego, Institute
for Brain and Mind.

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:09.964
So CARTA is a
transdisciplinary collaboration

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.821
between UCSD and the Salk Institute

00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:15.563
with the mission and interest
to explore and explain

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:19.090
the origins of the human phenomenon.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.774
I'm happy to co-direct this

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:24.565
with Ajit Varki and Margaret Schoeninger

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:27.729
and our associate director Pascal Gagneux.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.657
The Kavli Institute has a
slightly different focus

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:35.065
focusing primarily on the brain

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:39.078
and in particular also an
interdisciplinary approach

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:42.024
seeking to understand
the origins of evolution,

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:44.651
mechanisms of human cognition.

00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:47.615
So you can see how this title
of this topic blends well

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:50.303
between our two organizations

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:54.470
and I co-direct that with Nick
Spitzer and Ralph Greenspan.

00:02:56.214 --> 00:03:00.294
So the oldest questions
for humans, of humans,

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:03.544
are who are we, what are we doing here,

00:03:04.965 --> 00:03:06.937
where do we come from,

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.468
how did we get here,

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.385
and where are we going?

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:14.327
Some of these questions are
really unapproachable right now.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.563
We just don't have methods

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:19.613
or really the intellectual
hardware to deal with them,

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:22.268
but we can address some of them
like where did we come from

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.435
and how did we get here and
that's the focus of our effort.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:31.227
We reinvented or remade
this term anthropogeny

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.809
which is explaining origins of humans

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.317
as a way of focusing on
this last period of time

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:42.021
as humans emerged as a species.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.256
So where did we come from
and how did we get there?

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.708
Anthropogeny, as we see it,

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:50.791
is really an interdisciplinary field.

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:55.416
We have people from humanities,
biological sciences,

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:58.185
engineering, physical sciences,

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.024
and as you look at our website,

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:03.240
you can see a list of the
topics that we've sponsored

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.577
over the last 20 years
that cover the interaction

00:04:07.577 --> 00:04:09.858
of a lot of these different disciplines.

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:10.935
We're particularly thankful

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:13.935
to the Mathers Charitable Foundation

00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:18.377
headed by Howard Chester,
the executive director,

00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:21.824
who sponsored CARTA for many years

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.741
and we hope will continue to do so.

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:29.151
Some of you may have heard
of The Kavli Foundation.

00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:32.775
It's dedicated to advancing
science in a more general way

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:36.457
in ways that promote the
benefits of humanity,

00:04:36.457 --> 00:04:41.298
promoting public understanding
of science research.

00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:44.298
They have multiple areas of emphasis

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.823
including nanoscience and astrophysics

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:50.724
and a strong emphasis on neuroscience

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.316
and our community here

00:04:52.316 --> 00:04:55.258
fosters this interest in neuroscience.

00:04:55.258 --> 00:05:00.064
The leadership acknowledge
Miyoung Chun and Robert Conn

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:04.231
who are the directors and
founders of the foundation.

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.586
I wanna give a special
thanks to Annette Merle-Smith

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:10.097
who for her generous support

00:05:10.097 --> 00:05:12.490
for the Graduate
Specialization in Anthropogeny.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.657
We have a graduate-level
supplemental major at UCSD.

00:05:21.523 --> 00:05:24.980
We have coursework and it's
really quite a fun activity

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.047
and many of them are scattered

00:05:26.047 --> 00:05:28.547
throughout the audience today.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:34.469
James Handelman had been
the director for CARTA

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.660
and was the founding support for us

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.160
through the Mathers Foundation

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:46.097
and he had an untimely death recently

00:05:46.097 --> 00:05:47.047
and we've put together

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:49.759
a James Handelman Memorial Symposium Fund

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.926
to perpetuate the support of
this series of talks and CARTA

00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:57.244
and here are some of
the names of the people

00:05:57.244 --> 00:06:01.059
that have put forth some
funding to help support us.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.626
We also have individual support

00:06:03.626 --> 00:06:06.593
that supplements our activities

00:06:06.593 --> 00:06:08.905
and I'm just putting these
names up to acknowledge them

00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:12.222
and thank them very much
for their continued support

00:06:12.222 --> 00:06:14.798
on an annual basis for our activities

00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:17.886
to allow us to continue
with these presentations.

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:19.239
Finally, I'd like to give a special thanks

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:22.322
to the CARTA staff and the KIBM Staff

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:27.482
for whom the organization
of these meetings

00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:30.946
could not happen without.

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:34.757
We also have terrific
support from UCSD-TV,

00:06:34.757 --> 00:06:38.254
Rich and Matt and Steve and Marci.

00:06:38.254 --> 00:06:42.661
And finally, Kent and Michael
from Salk Media Services

00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:44.610
who help throughout this time.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.083
And finally, Davis Svoboda
for a really wonderful

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:51.409
guitar interlude at the beginning.

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.370
George, George.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.370
(audience applause)

00:06:57.648 --> 00:07:00.815
(upbeat techno music)
