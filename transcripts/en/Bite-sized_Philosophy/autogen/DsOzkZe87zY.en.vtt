but tom the problem is you look at

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970
but tom the problem is you look at
 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.580
but tom the problem is you look at
chimps and they're a fair bit like us

you know barnable is you can look at

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570
you know barnable is you can look at

you know barnable is you can look at
them too and they're they're genetically

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
them too and they're they're genetically
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.830
them too and they're they're genetically
quite related to us and they're quite a

quite related to us and they're quite a
 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.420
quite related to us and they're quite a
bit different than chimps but so we're

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430
bit different than chimps but so we're
 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.130

it's roughly true there's a female
 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.860
it's roughly true there's a female
hierarchy too but the males in the chimp

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870
hierarchy too but the males in the chimp
 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.390

initiators but what the chimps would do
 

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.020
initiators but what the chimps would do
is if they found a chimp from another

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.030
is if they found a chimp from another
 

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.300
is if they found a chimp from another
troop even if that was a chimp that had

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.310
troop even if that was a chimp that had
 

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.610

moved from their troop in the not too

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:03.620
moved from their troop in the not too
 

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.650

they go to other troops if they

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:08.750
they go to other troops if they
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.180
they go to other troops if they
outnumbered them they would tear them to

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.190
outnumbered them they would tear them to
 

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.970
outnumbered them they would tear them to
pieces and it looked like that's why

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:12.980
pieces and it looked like that's why
 

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.940

gangs roughly speaking they're looking
 

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.590
gangs roughly speaking they're looking
for trouble but the point of it is is

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600
for trouble but the point of it is is
 

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.480

wouldn't say they count but they have a

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:26.660
wouldn't say they count but they have a
 

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.700
wouldn't say they count but they have a
rudimentary notion of group size you

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:30.710
rudimentary notion of group size you

when I mean when I say tear apart that's

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.170
when I mean when I say tear apart that's
 

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.210
when I mean when I say tear apart that's

there's no upper limit on the brutality
 

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.010
there's no upper limit on the brutality
and so Goodall discovered that for

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:45.020
and so Goodall discovered that for
 

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.750
and so Goodall discovered that for
first and she didn't tell anybody about

the chimps had been corrupted as a

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040
the chimps had been corrupted as a
 

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.860
the chimps had been corrupted as a
consequence of their contact with human

00:10:59.860 --> 00:10:59.870
consequence of their contact with human
 

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.420

beings and that their natural behavior

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.430
beings and that their natural behavior
 

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.280

had been somehow transformed

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:03.290
had been somehow transformed

you know and that's not it's reasonable

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480
you know and that's not it's reasonable
 

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.090
you know and that's not it's reasonable
to be cautious if you're a scientist

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.100
to be cautious if you're a scientist

chimps do it well what are they

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480
chimps do it well what are they

perverted by their own culture I don't

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040
perverted by their own culture I don't
 

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.450

think so you know I mean there are more

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:25.460
think so you know I mean there are more
 

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.640
think so you know I mean there are more
and less violent chimp cultures and

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:27.650
and less violent chimp cultures and
 

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.230
and less violent chimp cultures and
there are more and less violent baboon

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240
there are more and less violent baboon
 

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.030
there are more and less violent baboon
cultures so there's some cultural

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040
cultures so there's some cultural
 

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.670
cultures so there's some cultural
variation but since Goodall's time this

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680
variation but since Goodall's time this
 

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.590
variation but since Goodall's time this
sort of behavior is being documented on

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600
sort of behavior is being documented on
 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.220
sort of behavior is being documented on
many many chimp troops so that's us in a

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.230
many many chimp troops so that's us in a
 

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.440
many many chimp troops so that's us in a
nutshell
