00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.719
Bones rely on connective tissue made of proteins like

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.320
collagen, to remain strong and resistant to fractures. And,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.860
mutations that affect the way collagen coils into a

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.610
triple helix, can affect the strength and integrity of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.320
bones in such a way that causes osteogenesis imperfecta,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.170
or brittle bone disease. The gene that codes for

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.100
the Alpha one component of type one collagen is

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.260
COL1A1 and it's essential for building the collagen fibers,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.830
like you see here. Normally in the form

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.730
of a triple helix. If you follow the colors

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.870
closely, you can see the red spiralling around

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.280
the structure and the green and the blue doing

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.920
the same thing. The COL1A1 gene can be

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.630
found on chromosome 17 in the human genome. Chromosome

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.000
17 is about 81,000,000 base pairs long and the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.055
COL1A1 gene can be found about halfway down. The

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:58.190
COL1A1 gene spans 51 exons and over 18,000 base pairs of DNA.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.940
After transcription and splicing, the mRNA

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.459
has 4,395 nucleotides of coding region between

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.690
the start and stop codons. And after translation, we get a protein

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.285
with 1,464 amino acids. Remember, we just divided 4,395 by three, and subtracted

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:20.440
one because this last codon doesn't code for

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.430
an amino acid. The stock codon is just empty.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.400
Now most of the amino acids in the collagen

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.250
molecule itself are glycine. Because this is actually what

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.820
allows the collagen to form that beautiful triple helix

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.340
we solve that's sort of turning back on itself.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.950
A lot of glycines make that possible. So, any

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.210
allele that might disrupt the glycines in these positions

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.800
are associated many times with Osteogenesis Imperfecta. But one

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.180
mutation of the COL1A1 gene contains a G to T, a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.720
guanine to thymine mutation at position 1245 of the coding region. Now, using

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.230
the genetic code, which we learned about in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.620
lesson three, and that you can find in

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.730
the instructor's notes on this page, I want

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.330
you to determine the expected amino acid change from

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
the top to the bottom sequence. And then select the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.120
type of mutation that best categorizes this change to the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.380
T allele. If you have any trouble answering this, you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.566
might want to go back and review mutations from lesson six.
