MICHEL DEGRAFF: OK.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.940
So the course is, at its
core, very intensive learning,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.830
so every single
text that we read

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.580
includes at least
two disciplines.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.270
So when we talk about,
say, linguistics,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.340
we look at linguistics from a
very historical perspective,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.010
but also from a very
social perspective.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.790
So basically, we look
at language in society.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.480
We don't just focus
on English, per se.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.040
And we do the same with
writing, with literature,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.030
with anthropology.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.300
There's always a larger lens
that brings in at least two

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.515
or three disciplines.

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:39.670
So-- and plus we also
bring in guest speakers

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.430
from various
disciplines having to do

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.520
with the international
studies, anthropology,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.720
history, of course,
linguistics, my own field.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.610
And also, the students
themselves, they

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.060
come from interdisciplinary
backgrounds.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.290
So some of them are scientists,
but others do women's studies,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.290
anthropology, biology.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.090
So we all, I think,
in the course,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.760
we're primed to look at the
issues of blacks in the US

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
from a very interdisciplinary
perspective.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.440
From the student
perspective, if we

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.540
think of this notion
of interdisciplinary,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.630
I think many of them come
from the science, for example,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.700
so they're engineers--

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.020
I think we have mostly
engineers in the course,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.709
and we have also some
scientists biology, brain

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:24.625
and cognitive science.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.910
And in these fields, often,
they look at particular problems

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.060
from very--

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.620
relatively narrow perspective.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.520
So I think that, for
many of them, indeed,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.650
it may have been the
first course they

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.130
took that exposed them to
a broader range of fields

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.180
within one course.
