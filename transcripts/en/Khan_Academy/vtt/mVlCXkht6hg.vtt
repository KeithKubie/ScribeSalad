00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:02.961
Voiceover:The hottest day of
the year in Santiago, Chile

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.845
on average, is January
seventh, when the average

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:09.036
high temperature is 29 degrees Celsius.

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:10.644
The coolest day of the year has an average

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.595
high temperature of 14 degrees Celsius.

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.750
Use a trigonometric function
to model the temperature

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.157
in Santiago, Chile, using 365
days as the length of a year.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:26.197
Remember that January seventh
is the summer in Santiago.

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:30.583
How many days after January
seventh is the first spring day

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:34.209
when the temperature
reaches 20 degrees Celsius?

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:36.765
So let's do this in two parts.

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.358
First, let's try to figure
out a trigonometric function

00:00:40.358 --> 00:00:43.440
that models the temperature
in Santiago, Chile.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.777
We'll have temperature
as a function of days,

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:50.574
where days are the number of
days after January seventh.

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.055
Once we have that trigonometric
function to model that,

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:54.725
then we can answer the
second part, I guess,

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:56.577
the essential question,
which is, "How many days

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.569
after January seventh
is the first spring day

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:02.987
when the temperature
reaches 20 degrees Celsius?"

00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:06.703
To think about this let's
graph it and it should become

00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:08.447
pretty apparent why
they are suggesting that

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:11.383
we use a trigonometric
function to model this.

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:14.092
Because our seasonal
variations they're cyclical.

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:15.606
They go up and down.

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:17.246
Actually, if you look at
the average temperature

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.948
for any city over the course of the year,

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:20.896
it really does look like
a trigonometric function.

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:25.560
This axis right over here.

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:28.154
This is the passage of the days.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.134
Let's do d for days and that's going to

00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:32.472
be in days after January seventh.

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:36.156
So this right over here
would be January seventh.

00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:40.221
And the vertical axis, this
is the horizontal axis.

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.199
The vertical axis is going to be

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:45.412
in terms of Celsius degrees.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:52.526
The high is 29 and I could
write 29 degrees Celsius.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.606
The highest average day.

00:01:56.056 --> 00:02:00.036
If this is zero then 14, which
is the lowest average day.

00:02:00.618 --> 00:02:02.523
14 degrees Celsius.

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:05.700
So our temperature will vary
between these two extremes.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.598
The highest average day,
which they already told us,

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.953
is January seventh we get
to 29 degrees Celsius.

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:15.924
And then the coldest day
of the year, on average,

00:02:15.924 --> 00:02:19.759
you get to an average high
of 14 degrees Celsius.

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.096
So it looks like this.

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:26.004
We're talking about average
highs on a given day

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.571
and the reason why a
trigonometric function

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:30.986
is a good idea is because it's cyclical.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:33.961
If this is January
seventh, if you go 365 days

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:38.387
in the future, you're
back at January seventh.

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:42.400
If the average high temperature
is 29 degrees Celsius

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.296
on that day, the average high temperature

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.927
is going to be 29 degrees
Celsius on that day.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:49.692
Now, we're using a
trigonometric function so we're

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:52.513
going to hit our low point
exactly halfway in between.

00:02:52.813 --> 00:02:54.290
So we're going to hit our low

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.418
point exactly halfway in between.

00:02:57.418 --> 00:02:59.453
Something right like that.

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.942
So our function is
going to look like this.

00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:03.632
Our function, let me see.

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:06.165
I'm going to draw the low point right

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.834
over there and this is a high point.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:12.848
That's a high point right over there.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:14.975
That looks pretty good.

00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.098
Then, I have the high point
right over here and then,

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.971
I just need to connect
them and there you go.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.888
I've drawn one period of our trigonometric

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:27.011
function and our period is 365 days.

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.582
If we go through 365 days
later we're at the same point

00:03:29.582 --> 00:03:32.994
in the cycle, we are at
the same point in the year.

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:35.408
We're at the same point in the year.

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.194
So, what I want you to
do right now is, given

00:03:37.194 --> 00:03:39.994
what I've just drawn,
try to model this right.

00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:42.958
So, this right over here, let's write

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.849
this as T as a function of d.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.621
Try to figure out an expression
for T as a function of d

00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:51.386
and remember it's going to be
some trigonometric function.

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:53.728
So, I'm assuming you've given
a go at it and you might say,

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.995
"Well this looks like a cosine
curve, maybe it could be

00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.510
"a sine curve, which one should I use?"

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.948
You could actually use either one, but I

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.853
always like to go with the simpler one.

00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:05.505
Just think about well
if these were angles,

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:07.763
either actual degrees or radians,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.731
which trigonometric function
starts at your maximum point?

00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:14.784
Well cosine of zero is one.

00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:16.863
The cosine starts at your maximum point.

00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:21.220
Sine of zero is zero, so I'm
going to use cosine here.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.366
I'm going to use a cosine function.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:27.840
So, temperature as a function of days.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.579
There's going to be some amplitude
times our cosine function

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:35.204
and we're going to have some
argument to our cosine function

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.578
and then I'm probably
going to have to shift it.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.377
So let's think about how we would do that.

00:04:39.687 --> 00:04:41.474
Well, what's the mid line here?

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:43.092
The mid line is the halfway point

00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:44.499
between our high and our low.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:45.936
So our midpoint, if we were to

00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:49.819
visualize it, looks just like so.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.988
That is our mid line right over there.

00:04:53.988 --> 00:04:55.725
And what value is this?

00:04:55.725 --> 00:04:57.983
Well what's the average of 29 and 14?

00:04:57.983 --> 00:05:04.577
29 plus 14 is 43 divided by
two is 21.5 degrees Celsius.

00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:06.333
So that's our mid line
so essentially we've

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:11.212
shifted up our function by that amount.

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:13.982
If we just had a regular
cosine function our mid line

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:17.994
would be at zero, but now
we're at 21.5 degrees Celsius.

00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:21.311
I'll just write plus 21.5, that's

00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.158
how much we've shifted it up.

00:05:23.158 --> 00:05:24.947
Now, what's the amplitude?

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:28.018
Well our amplitude is how much
we diverge from the mid line.

00:05:28.018 --> 00:05:34.312
Over here we're 7.5 above the
mid line so that's plus 7.5.

00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:39.038
Here we're 7.5 below the
mid line, so minus 7.5.

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:42.076
So our amplitude is
7.5, the maximum amount

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:45.102
we go away from the mid line is 7.5.

00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:47.607
So that's our amplitude.

00:05:47.607 --> 00:05:49.390
And now let's think about our argument

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.740
to the cosine function right over here.

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:55.775
It's going to be a function of the days.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.012
And what do we want?

00:05:57.028 --> 00:06:00.277
When 365 days have gone by, we want

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:03.416
this entire argument to be two pi.

00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:06.053
So when d is 365, we want this

00:06:06.068 --> 00:06:08.684
whole thing to evaluate to two pi.

00:06:09.284 --> 00:06:14.299
We could put two pi over 365 in here.

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:16.838
You might remember your
formulas, I always forget them

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:19.066
that's why I always try to
reason through them again.

00:06:19.082 --> 00:06:21.612
The formulas, you want two
pi divided by your period

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:23.526
and all the rest, but I just
like to think, "Okay, look.

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:28.324
"After one period, which is
365 days, I want the whole

00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:30.445
"argument over here to be two pi.

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:33.686
"I want to go around the unit
circle once and so if this

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:38.803
"is two pi over 365, when
you multiply it by 365

00:06:38.803 --> 00:06:42.101
"your argument here is
going to be two pi."

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:45.276
Just like that we've done the
first part of this question.

00:06:45.276 --> 00:06:50.996
We have modeled the
average high temperature in

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:55.618
Santiago as a function of
days after January seventh.

00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:58.240
In the next video we'll
answer this second question.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.240
I encourage you to do
it ahead of time before

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.696
watching that next video
and I'll give you one clue.

00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:04.842
Make sure you pay attention to the fact

00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:08.716
that they're saying the first spring day.
