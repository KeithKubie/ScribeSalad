[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.390
SPEAKER 1: Hi, everyone.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.970
This is our overview session.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.970
So if you're totally new
to all this, hopefully,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:13.990
it'll pique your interest.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.059
Well, Actions on Google
is the developer platform

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.144
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.060
Now, users are already
coming to the Assistant

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.530
to perform over 1
million actions.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.030
And they're performing
these actions

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.280
across a huge range of
devices and context,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.710
from voice-enabled speakers
like the Google Home

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.650
to phones to Android Auto to
TVs, Chromebooks, and more,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.110
bringing the number of devices
where you can reach users

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.790
to over 500 million.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.550
Actions are now available
in 25-plus locales,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.720
with more coming this year.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.820
It still takes some work and
technical know-how to get up

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.320
and running.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.760
And that's why we provide
templates to get you started.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.531
No programming
knowledge required.

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.780
You can create fun and
engaging conversational actions

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.512
like Personality Quiz,
Trivia, and Flash Cards.

00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:51.220
All you have to do is
come to the Actions

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.355
console and follow a
step-by-step wizard

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.730
to get started
with the template.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.082
Then, you just fill out a
Google Sheets spreadsheet

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:57.790
with the content.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.250
Of course, I know most of you
are developers, so that's never

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.330
going to be satisfying enough.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.140
SPEAKER 2: Google
is going to give me

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.110
this amazing tool for natural
language understanding called

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.040
Dialogflow.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.190
It turns that unstructured
natural language input

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.580
into a structured representation
that my endpoint can consume.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.310
Dialogflow sits in the
middle between the Assistant

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.030
and my server.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.430
And it does that for
me with hybrid machine

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.170
learning powered intent
matching and entity recognition.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.670
All right.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.470
So the way Dialogflow
intents work

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.620
is that you train them to listen
for phrases that the user is

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.459
going to speak in
each turn of dialogue.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.500
And then each semantically
similar set of phrases

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.680
is called an intent, right?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.450
So with the power
of machine learning,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.060
when the user says anything
similar to the phrases you've

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.350
provided at any point
in the conversation,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.252
Dialogflow is going
to match that intent.

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:43.210
And how am I going to
account for the variation

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.490
in the way each programming
language is spoken?

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.540
Programming languages
have nicknames.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.680
Well, Dialogflow offers the
feature of designating synonyms

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.000
for each canonical value.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
But now the user
is going to respond

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.080
with a request to know about
some specific language.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.112
Like, let's say they say,
tell me about Kotlin.

00:01:58.112 --> 00:01:59.570
And this time, the
Google Assistant

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.319
is going to hand off
directly to my action

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.150
because the user's already
entered the dialog.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.660
And it's going to handle the
speech-to-text transcription.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.370
And Dialogflow is
going to match the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.830
which language intent
that I described earlier.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.420
But this time,
instead of responding,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.310
it's going to reach out
to my Webhook hosted

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.230
on Cloud Functions for Firebase.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.670
And it's going to
dynamically pull

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.070
information about that language
and present it to the user.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.028
And we're also announcing
something really cool

00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:24.740
that you've asked
for for a long time.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.060
You can create alpha and
beta versions of your actions

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.730
that can be shared with a
limited audience for feedback

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.400
and iteration.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.010
SPEAKER 3: Let's talk about
how built-in intents can also

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.030
help you get discovered.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.580
So as you can see here,
there are a ton of languages,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.980
there are dialects, there
are cultural differences,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.830
there's slang, that all make
a million different ways

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.500
to say the exact same thing.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.750
Built-in intents can provide
a common taxonomy for actions

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.654
across all of our
Google surfaces.

00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:50.320
So in this scenario,
for example, you'll

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.450
see if somebody
says, hey Google, I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.070
want to start
meditating, we can then

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.570
suggest just a few
different actions

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.028
that we know will
service that need

00:02:57.028 --> 00:02:59.115
and are actually
indeed meditation apps.

00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:01.240
So here are some of the
built-in intents that we're

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.150
working on this year.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.191
You'll see the ones that
are starred will be soon

00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:05.660
in developer preview.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.120
So the last tool that I'll
talk about today for discovery

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
is called Action Links,
which is an awesome tool

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.110
to help you promote
your experience.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.080
You'll see it here in
the Headspace example

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.805
that we, Google, will actually
promote these experiences

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.180
in our own Assistant Directory,
where a user can actually

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.960
deep link directly from the
app directory into your action

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.740
on the device of their choice.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.960
Assistant Links is really,
really easy to implement.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.680
You can simply generate a
URL really quickly and then

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.390
share across all
of your channels.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.510
We will soon open up the
ability for app developers

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.000
to sell digital goods
on the Assistant.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.850
This will work across both
phone and voice surfaces.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.830
And we're thinking of
three key use cases

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.300
here as we launch this--

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.800
in-app digital goods,
subscription services,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.680
and lastly, digital
media purchases.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.761
So what we know here is that
people are creatures of habit.

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:52.510
So we've identified
some of these clusters

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.120
and where the Assistant can
actually provide extra value.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.170
This new feature, Routines, lets
users combine multiple actions

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.100
into a single command.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.090
So daily updates are
when Google can actually

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.500
share a notification and pull
an update at a specified time

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.460
each day by the user.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.980
One example of this is you
could get transportation or news

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.650
alerts every single
morning at the same time

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.220
if Google understands
that about you.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.350
Push notifications are
really exciting because they

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.810
could help you do
things in real time.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.330
So things like getting stock
alerts from your favorite news

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.980
publisher.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.050
The value to users is
that it actually-- it

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.240
helps give you access to
relevant information, which

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.400
is immediate, it's content-rich,
and it's specific to you.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.930
What's really valuable to
brands and to some of you folks

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.000
here as developers is
that this can really

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.850
help you enhance your
utility as a partner to some

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.510
of your users.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.830
So thank you, everyone,
so much for having us.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.996
Enjoy the rest of your week.

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:44.638
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:49.262
