- I just don't take
movies that seriously.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.141
I mean, if I did, I'd believe

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.709
that every time I got on
a mother (bleeps) plane

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
there'd be some mother
(bleeps) snakes!

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.414
(laughter erupts)

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:18.585
Which I do, but that serves
me right for flying Spirit.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.286 line:0%
- I thought it was
cool that it did show

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.654 line:0%
what it's like to
come home from war

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.124 line:0%
but the love story was meh.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.560
The female lead in it
was one dimensional.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.963
It was the same scene
over and over again

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
with her being like,
don't go to war,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.366
don't go to war, don't
go to war and it's like,

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.703
bitch, this is the best
shooter in the worlds.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.072
He's gotta go to war.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.473
She was like a broken Roomba

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.642 align:start size:84% position:16%
just banging against
the same wall.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:46.913
- As a sniper, do you think
Lee Harvey Oswald did it?

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.649 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I don't think
he was by himself.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.386
(audience oohs and applauds)

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.490 align:start size:94% position:6%
- There's no way I'm
giving a sniper weak tea.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.026
(laughter erupts)

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.362
Easiest question ever.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.264
Hey America, Larry Wilmore here.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.166
If you like The Nightly
Show on Comedy Central,

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.867
like us on Facebook, too.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:08.902
Just don't poke me.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.970
I do not like being poked.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.805
You can Candy Crush me.
