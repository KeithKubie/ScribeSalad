WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.470
So in 1832,
as we saw at the end last time,

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.590
volar went to uh,
work for,
uh,

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.700
most of a month with [inaudible] and together they worked on the oil of bitter

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.840
almonds,
which is making its way around it's Benzaldehyde,

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.190
which is making its way around here.
Uh,

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.500
so there's the bottle that's coming around.
What did you notice about it?

7
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.913
Where is it?

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.210
<v 1>What do you notice about it?
Devin?</v>

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.193
Yeah,

10
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.120
what does it smell like in almonds there?

11
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.670
Turn it around and look at the,

12
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.490
turn it upside down.
What do you notice?

13
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.460
<v 0>Yeah,
it's half solid.</v>

14
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.370
Benzaldehyde is the oil of bitter almonds,
not the solid of bitter almonds.

15
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.190
What does it say on the label?
Written by hand.

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.700
<v 0>Somebody initials.
J W.</v>

18
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.440
So it was opened in 1995,
13 years ago when it was opened,
it was liquid.

19
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.070
Now it's half solid.
How do you figure that?

20
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.793
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.340
<v 0>Well,
something must've happened.
So what did it react with and the bottle,</v>

22
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 1>you and Joe Oxygen.</v>

23
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.770
<v 0>Okay.
So oil,
a bitter almonds.
They analyzed seven h six o o</v>

24
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360
and they found that it reacted with oxygen to get c seven h six o two right.

25
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.820
They also reacted it with bromine.

26
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:02.270
The halogens were common as we'll see for reagents in those days.

27
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:04.310
He got cs seven h five OBR.

28
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.570
They reacted it with chlorine and also that product with potassium iodide or

29
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:13.340
ammonia or lead sulfide,

30
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.670
and they got all these compounds and what did they do with them when they got

31
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.190
him?
They smelled them.
Right?
What?

32
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.890
What was the main thing they did?

33
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.870
And that's not the way it's true that they probably taste that they tasted it,

34
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:29.060
but that's not the main thing they did.
That gave them

35
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.160
<v 1>unique information.</v>

36
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.150
What about the weight?

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.130
<v 0>What was the main technique that we've been talking about?
All the time data.</v>

38
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
They did elemental analysis,
ultimate analysis of what the ratio of the elements.

39
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.790
So that's what they had,
right?
So big deal.

40
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.470
What do you get from the analysis?

41
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.440
What can you infer here where these guys,

42
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.120
you can now compete with them,
right?

43
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.860
This is what they found out during that month of experimentation and they came

44
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.800
up with a theory that co revolutionized organic chemistry as,

45
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.340
as of that time and for the next 20 years.
So what did they notice,

46
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.970
<v 1>Clara?
Pardon me?</v>

47
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.100
<v 0>Well,
how would you know it's a chain?
The numbers don't tell you it's a chain.</v>

48
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:43.300
What?
Well,
it is.

49
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.020
It's got hydrogen and carbon in it.
That's true.

50
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.830
But they also have oxygen and nitrogen Flory and other things.

51
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.980
What could you make out of this,

52
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.993
<v 1>Ryan?</v>

53
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.461
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:06.110
All of them have at least c seven h five some of them have more hydrogen than

55
00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:06.740
that,

56
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.740
but nothing has less than c seven or less than h five can anybody carry that any

57
00:04:13.101 --> 00:04:13.934
further?

58
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.790
<v 1>Pardon me?
Yeah,
he's 70 years of violence.</v>

59
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.120
<v 0>Yeah.
What would they have called it?</v>

60
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.440
The thing that that you have at there and then it reacts and gives this that or

61
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:31.960
the other thing.
What did Lavoie Z,

62
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.610
I call it the base or the radical,

63
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.751
but can you,

64
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.751
but actually the real radical is more than h five the thing that persists.

65
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.440
What else?
Oh,

66
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.400
so c seven h five o persists through all these transformations.

67
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.450
So it looks like that some sort of a core that gets modified,

68
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.490
die.
But if it's there all the time,
it's like a radical,

69
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.003
<v 1>right?</v>

70
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.780
<v 0>So it was called the benzos wheel radical.</v>

71
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.880
They thought up that name at that time.
And the idea of using the suffix,

72
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:18.670
why l to denote a radical.

73
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.420
So if you did note the Benzo radical by Bz,

74
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.580
you see that you started the oil of bitter almonds is B,

75
00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:28.940
z h and then the acid is BZ,

76
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.060
o h and the acid chloride is BZ cl and br and I on Nh two and two B's,

77
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.180
C's together with ass

78
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.330
<v 1>at the end.
Okay?</v>

79
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.180
<v 0>So a radical can be the base of more than just an acid,
right?</v>

80
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.900
Lovaas had the idea that you reacted with oxygen and you get an acid.

81
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.290
But here you can react it with all sorts of different things and get different

82
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.830
compounds.
But the base is still there.
The right,
the Benzo radical.

83
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.940
So this gave rise to the idea of organic dualism.

84
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.860
Remember we had this dualism last time.

85
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.790
There were positive things and negative things and they could associate and

86
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:08.750
trade partners.

87
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.990
But maybe the difference in organic chemistry is that you have radicals,

88
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.630
things that are Poe plus plus or minus,

89
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.690
but there are more complicated than just single Adams.

90
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.650
There are combinations of elements that function in organic chemistry.

91
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.620
That's what makes us different from inorganic according to this theory.

92
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.660
So then the idea is to find all these organic radicals that make organic radic

93
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.230
organic chemistry special.
So during the 1830s,
the,

94
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.610
these compound radicals were discovered everywhere.
For example,
in Germany,

95
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:45.611
[inaudible] found asset deal and Bunsen in Heidelberg found caca deal,

96
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:51.580
which is named because it smells so awful,
right?
Or buts alias in Sweden,

97
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.060
found Ethel or fire IA in Italy,
got salads,

98
00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:01.010
seal and do mock,
got a whole bunch of them in Paris,

99
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.040
methyl sent Amiel,
Ceto,
ethylene.

100
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.740
All of these radicals were discovered.
So the thought those,

101
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:10.820
this is the way to organize organic chemistry and that theory,

102
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.330
the dualism,
uh,
applied to organic theory.

103
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:19.220
The radical theory survives today in our nomenclature,
right?

104
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.930
So for example,
we talk about ethyl chloride,
that's not one word.

105
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:26.990
It's two words with the space,
right?

106
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.450
And the reason is it's dualistic.

107
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.500
It's a positive Ethel and a minus chlorine,
right?

108
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:36.860
So it's two things that have come together.
Okay.

109
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:40.520
Now the eel part that a volar and,
and uh,

110
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.840
and Leiby thought up comes from a Greek word [inaudible],

111
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
which means wood or matter.

112
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.920
So it's the substance of stuff.
Okay.
So it's the,

113
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:56.921
so now ether was something that had been known for a long time and it came from

114
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:01.190
a Greek root,
which means to shine.
So in the 17 hundreds,

115
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:06.191
it was sort had been applied to the sky that it was transferred from the idea of

116
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.720
shining to the idea that clear sky,
and from that to a colorless liquid.

117
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.300
So when they distilled something out of,
uh,

118
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:19.301
out of alcohol that had been treated with acid and they've got this clear stuff

119
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.250
that was clear as the sky,
they called it ether,
right?

120
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.340
Which we call die ethyl ether nowadays.
So,

121
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.370
so that's where ether came from.

122
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:33.371
So hence f eel was the matter that appears in ether.

123
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.560
So it was like two Benza wheel radicals with sulfur.
Right?

124
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:44.240
You can have two ethyl radicals with oxygen,
right?

125
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.980
And that was then f Eel,
right?
The material of ether.

126
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.320
Okay.
How about methyl?
Well,
methy comes from the Greek word,

127
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.970
meaning wine or spirit.
Right?

128
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.320
And the eel that same route,
but a different meeting this time.
Remember,

129
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:05.100
it can mean matter that was the one before,
or it can mean wood.

130
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.510
And in this case it means would.
So what does it mean?

131
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.980
Math?

132
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.980
Ill if the ill means not the substance of but means would pardon me.

133
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.530
From wood,
from wood.
The spirit from wood.

134
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.040
So you've heard methanol called wood alcohol,
right?

135
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.870
Cause you'd get it from distilling it.
So the EAD,
but,

136
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.020
but the first word was meth.

137
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.720
Ian and Ian is the Greek feminine.

138
00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:40.680
Patronymics it means the daughter of an e.

139
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.510
N.
E.
I.
N.
E.
O.
N.
E.
All of those are like that,

140
00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:47.800
like per Stephanie or uh,
or Antigony.
Uh,

141
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.660
it means the one who goes against her parents and so on.
So Ian was a great,
so,

142
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.940
so what did meth,
Ilene mean?

143
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.770
It meant the daughter of would spirits.

144
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.360
So the theory was that would spirits was that is wood.

145
00:10:04.361 --> 00:10:08.260
Alcohol was a combination of methylene plus water.

146
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.100
So methylene us if out if what alcohol is ch three o h then methyl Ian was ch

147
00:10:17.351 --> 00:10:21.910
two which you,
which then add water and you get what?
Alcohol.

148
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.740
So that's where the name Meth Ian came from.
Right?

149
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.830
So then in 1840,
that was 1835.

150
00:10:29.831 --> 00:10:34.831
So five years later they decided that they needed the radical ch three.

151
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.820
So they named it meth deal from methylene.
Right.

152
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.700
And then,
uh,
ethylene came,

153
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:47.230
that name came in 1852 because it was related to Ethel,

154
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.360
which had already been named the same way that methylene was related to methyl.

155
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.080
Okay.
So that's where these names came from.
It,

156
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.380
they all have their root in the radical theory.

157
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.300
Now that's c one and c two methyl and ethyl.
How about c?
Three and c Ford.

158
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:08.800
You know what they're named
route.
See,
how about c three?

159
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.690
Do you know what c three alcohol is?

160
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.640
Pro Bowl and see for butyl.
So where do those names come from?

161
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.080
Okay.
C three h seven is [inaudible].

162
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.910
And by the same reasoning as before,

163
00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:26.560
c three h six is propylene or protein.
Sometimes it's shortened,

164
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:32.050
okay.
And Beutel and butylene or butane.
Okay.

165
00:11:32.051 --> 00:11:37.000
Now butylene comes the c four acid is [inaudible] acid,

166
00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:41.140
which had already been named because it's the stuff that makes rancid butter

167
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:43.000
smell bad,
okay?

168
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:46.300
So people worked it up and found butyric acid.

169
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.570
So that's where butyl comes from.
But how about pro ball?

170
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:53.140
It has a very much more interesting origin.
Okay?

171
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.670
Protos Means First and pee on means fat.

172
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.150
So [inaudible] was the first fat in what sense?

173
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.270
Well,
these carboxylic acids came from fats,
right?

174
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:10.870
And they were called fatty acids and they'd behave like fats.

175
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.890
They dissolve in organic solvents,
right?
But the very,

176
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:18.280
the ones with the fewest number of carbons with just one carbon,

177
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:23.281
that's formic acid that you get by destructive distillation of ants or acidic

178
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:28.390
acid for vinegar.
Those are miscible with water.

179
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.300
But the c three is the first one that's not freely miscible with water and

180
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:36.580
behaves more like a fat,
right?

181
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.200
So that's the first fatty acid is pro pro propionic acid.

182
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.420
Uh,
so pro bill properly and are the see threes.
Okay.

183
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.610
After that you get into numbers,
right?
The roots for numbers.

184
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.520
So jump Baptiste.
Dante do ma was the successor of,

185
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.430
of uh,
daily sac as the,

186
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.420
as the spokesman for four French chemistry.
You see,

187
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:06.820
he was born on the 14th of July,

188
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:11.800
a reasonable date for somebody to lead French chemistry in 1800.

189
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.870
So for 84 years,
well for part of 84 years,

190
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:21.020
he was the leader of French chemistry.
There he is with some uh,

191
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.490
decoration on,
I'm not sure what it is.
I'd like to find out.

192
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.340
So he was the post and the poliano guardian of the French tradition of

193
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:31.174
chemistry.

194
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.560
The French had a,

195
00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.650
what most people regard as a terrible system,
which is they had chairs,
you know,

196
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:45.040
for professors,
but you can have more than one chair.

197
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.960
So a single individual could tie up three different appointments and you didn't

198
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:54.961
have as many people able to exercise their ingenuity in developing chemistry.

199
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:58.270
So he had the chair of both all at the Sorbonne,

200
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:01.180
also the Ecole Polytechnique in the a call they made scene

201
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.640
and he was a persistent opponent of liebig and Burt's alias.

202
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.560
Uh,

203
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.450
but in 1837 after this radical stuff got going and he had discovered for

204
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:17.110
radicals himself of which he was quite pleased.
Uh,

205
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.500
he and Lee big happened to meet during a speaking tour in England and they got

206
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:26.890
in conversation and do mod decided on the basis of that meeting though not

207
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:30.700
leaving,
that they were now great friends and could collaborate from here on in.

208
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.020
So he wrote this long thing and flowery French in 1837 a note on the present

209
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:39.320
state of organic chemistries.

210
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.630
This is seven or five years after the radical theory began.
He said,

211
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.250
60 years of hardly passed since the ever a memorable time when this same

212
00:14:48.251 --> 00:14:52.910
assembly he was speaking to the,
to the Paris Academy,

213
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.480
heard the first discussions of the fertile chemical doctrine,

214
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:58.720
which we owe to the genius of Love was eight.

215
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:04.510
This short span of time has sufficed to examine fully the most delicate

216
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:06.710
questions of inorganic chemistry.

217
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.240
And anyone can easily convince himself that this branch of our knowledge

218
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.770
possesses almost everything that it can with the methods of observation

219
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.640
available.
So check off in organic chemistry.
We got that now.
Okay.

220
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.350
They're barely remain a few cracks here and there to fill in.

221
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.280
So this is the,
the persistent myopia of leaders of science.

222
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.700
As I mentioned before,
when we were speaking of Lavoie,

223
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:37.520
Zia the certainly persist at Dell today.

224
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.890
Uh,
so we do,

225
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.810
Ma goes on in a word how with the help of the laws of inorganic chemistry.

226
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.920
Incidentally,
this is all one sentence.
Of course,
this is in a word,
right?
So he,

227
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:54.090
he really liked speaking,
right?
Flowery language.

228
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.200
How with the help of the laws of inorganic chemistry couldn't want to explain

229
00:15:58.201 --> 00:16:03.201
and classifies such varied substances as one obtains from organic bodies and

230
00:16:03.451 --> 00:16:06.030
which nearly always are formed only of carbon,

231
00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:10.620
hydrogen and oxygen to which elements nitrogen is sometimes joined.
So if,

232
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.350
if it's all in the analysis of what Adam's are there,

233
00:16:13.351 --> 00:16:15.300
how can you have so many different things?

234
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.353
<v 1>All right.</v>

235
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.280
<v 0>This was the great and beautiful question of natural philosophy.</v>

236
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.280
A question well designed to excite the highest degree of competition among

237
00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:29.560
canvas name too,

238
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.983
<v 1>right?</v>

239
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.880
<v 0>For once resolved,
the most beautiful triumphs were promised to science,</v>

240
00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:38.200
the mysteries of plants,

241
00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:41.500
the mysteries of animal life would be unveiled before our eyes.

242
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.450
We would see as the key to all of the changes of matter so sudden,
so swift,

243
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:50.290
so singular that occur in animals and plants.
More importantly,

244
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:53.680
we would find means of duplicating them in our laboratories.

245
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.860
This would make a good research proposal,
right?

246
00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:58.841
<v 0>Well,</v>

248
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:03.550
we're not afraid to say it and it is not an assertion which we make lightly.

249
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.640
This great and beautiful question is today answered.

250
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.860
It only remains the follow through on all the consequences which the solution

251
00:17:11.861 --> 00:17:15.910
and tails in fact,
to produce with three or four elements,

252
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:19.690
such varied combinations more very perhaps than those which make up the whole.

253
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:20.800
In organic kingdom,

254
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.400
nature has chosen a path as simple as it was unexpected for with elements.

255
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.720
She has made compounds which behave in all their properties like elements

256
00:17:31.721 --> 00:17:35.110
themselves.
That is radicals,
right?

257
00:17:35.111 --> 00:17:40.060
That persists through these reactions and this we are convinced is the entire

258
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.610
secret of organic chemistry.

259
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.570
That's great and beautiful question is answered.

260
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:52.290
It only remains to follow through the consequences compounds which behave like

261
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:52.681
elements.

262
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:57.390
Thus organic chemistry possesses in its own elements which sometimes play the

263
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:59.160
role of chlorine or oxygen.

264
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.740
What does he mean play the role of chlorine and oxygen?

265
00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.210
How come radical sometimes play the role of chlorine and oxygen?

266
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.830
What would that role be?

267
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.570
<v 1>Pardon me?
No.</v>

268
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.800
<v 0>What roles do things play in this theory that he's using?</v>

269
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.553
<v 1>Okay.</v>

270
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.210
<v 0>Lucas plus and minus,
plus and minus.</v>

271
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.940
So sometimes they're like Gloria in her oxygen.
What does that mean?

272
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.820
Sometimes they're negative,
right?
And sometimes on the contrary,

273
00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:37.790
they play the role of metals.
Sometimes they're positive Cyanna,
Jenna,

274
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.570
mid Benzo wheel,
the radicals of ammonia,
of aliphatic,

275
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.200
of alcohol and analogous substances.

276
00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:48.010
These are the true elements with which organic chemistry operates.

277
00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.740
To discover these radicals.
To study them,

278
00:18:50.741 --> 00:18:54.310
to characterize them has been our daily study for 10 years.

279
00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.460
Okay,
so seven plus in their binders sometimes.

280
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:01.420
Nonetheless,

281
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:06.510
our opinions of appeared to defer and then with each of us drawn on by the heat

282
00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:08.290
of our battle with nature,

283
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:12.490
there are rows between us discussions who's liveliness we both regret.

284
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.051
Actually,

285
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:18.040
when we were able to discuss questions which separated this in several friendly

286
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:21.940
meetings,
we soon realized that we were in agreement on the principles.

287
00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:26.830
We then understood that United we could undertake a task before which either of

288
00:19:26.831 --> 00:19:29.080
us in isolation would have recoiled.

289
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.690
We will analyze every organic substance to establish reliably what sort of

290
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:39.490
radical it refers to.
So that is what everybody should do.

291
00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.890
Then you'll know all about organic chemistry.

292
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.170
Each of us has in fact opened his laboratory to all young men who were motivated

293
00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:51.940
by true love of science.
They have seen all understood all we,

294
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.530
we have worked under their eyes and I've had them work under hours in such a way

295
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.610
that we are surrounded by young rivals who are the hope of science and whose

296
00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:05.230
work will be added to ours and mingle with rs four we'll have been conceived in

297
00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:10.030
the same spirit and carried out by the same method,
right?

298
00:20:10.031 --> 00:20:14.440
So if everybody does what we say they should do,
then we got it.

299
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

300
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.970
<v 0>This is not an effort.</v>

301
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:22.971
Can See for personal gain or in the interest of narrow vanity far be it from us.

302
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.610
No.
And in the collaboration,

303
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:29.370
which is perhaps unheard of in the history of science,

304
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:34.050
this is an undertaking in which we hope to interest every chemist in Europe.

305
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.290
So everyone should work on this.
So we'll,

306
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.520
we'll go to the funding agencies and tell them this is the only kind of research

307
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:44.100
you should fund.
Forget these other guys out there.

308
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.420
That's his true love of science and conceived in the same spirit and carried out

309
00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:55.450
by the same method.
So this is Megalomania and doesn't show much imagination,

310
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.990
uh,
now,
but there was a problem with dualism.
So for example,

311
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:04.000
suppose you have benzoyl chloride,

312
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:09.001
which remember was read by reacting Benzaldehyde or benzoyl hydride with

313
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:14.011
chlorine and you get the benzoyl chloride and hcl is the other product.

314
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:19.270
Now hcl is quite clear.
It's h plus and C l minus.
What's Ben's a wheel chloride.

315
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.510
It's obviously Ben's a wheel plus and c l minus.

316
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.880
And what problem does that create?

317
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.650
<v 1>What Russel?</v>

318
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.630
<v 0>Aha,
but how do you get benzoyl hydride plus plus,
right?</v>

319
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.680
So there's something weird going on.
So this is a problem.
Uh,

320
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.240
in 1840 [inaudible] and 1850s,
the French discovered a competing theory,

321
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.360
uh,
or invented,
I should say,

322
00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:51.620
a competing theory called the substitution theory or the type theory or the

323
00:21:51.621 --> 00:21:55.220
unitary theory as opposed to the dualistic theory,

324
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.230
the plus minus idea.

325
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.620
So these began to compete with one another and it started at a ball in the

326
00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:07.310
[inaudible] palace in 1830.
This picture is from 40 years later,

327
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.950
37 years later.
But what happened is the,
they got the ball started,

328
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.880
all the people came dressed up fancy,

329
00:22:13.881 --> 00:22:18.200
and they began to cough and choke because the room was filled with some noxious

330
00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:22.670
gas.
And when they discovered it came from the candles,

331
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.680
they asked do model to look into it.

332
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:29.681
And he identified the culprit is hcl because it turned out that the w the

333
00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:34.070
candles were very white.
The wax had been bleached with chlorine,

334
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.650
and when they were burned,
hcl was given off.
So the question is,

335
00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.890
what is it that holds chlorine?

336
00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:47.690
How did this fat in the candles fix chlorine gas?

337
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.040
Well,
you're in a position to understand that.
Now we can think about mechanisms,

338
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.070
in fact,
two ways that that the,

339
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.530
the hydrocarbon could fix glory.

340
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.780
Now suppose we try and there's chlorine that is being used to bleach the stuff.

341
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.370
Let's try for a homo Lumo approach.
What makes chlorine reactive?

342
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:10.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.840
<v 0>Hi Homo or low Lumo.
What's unusual about chlorine?</v>

344
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.363
<v 1>Pardon me?</v>

345
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.320
<v 0>Why do you say so Claire?
What is the,
what is the low Lou vote,</v>

346
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.430
right?
The sigma star,
CLC l,
which is low because chlorine has big nuclear charge.

347
00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.680
Okay,
now we need a homo to react with it.
Now,

348
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.030
one of the more interesting hydrocarbons in this regard is one that had been

349
00:23:43.031 --> 00:23:45.530
known already for,
uh,

350
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.440
40 years to react with chlorine.

351
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.840
And it was because of that reaction.

352
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:55.841
It was called the old Fiat gas and was by this time known to be [inaudible].

353
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.030
Right?
So we would write it with a double bond,

354
00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:03.290
all of Fiat because Ola oil and find to make,

355
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.230
so it's the stuff that makes oil right and this,

356
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:10.220
and we'll see the reaction that makes oil here.
It's reaction with chlorine.

357
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.780
So what makes the old defiant gas reactive

358
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.933
<v 1>haven't,</v>

359
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.860
<v 0>right.
So poor overlap makes a high homo and remember the name of it.</v>

360
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.560
Pod.
So the Pi electrons because of poor overlap or high homo.

361
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.620
So we can use those electrons to mix with the low Lumo.

362
00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:37.621
And you have one of these make and break situations and chloride leaves and you

363
00:24:37.931 --> 00:24:40.330
get this thing which has a positive charge.

364
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.080
Now that thing itself is reactive.
What do you make?

365
00:24:44.081 --> 00:24:45.790
Where is the low Lumo in this one?

366
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.770
<v 1>Pardon me?
Can I speak up please?</v>

367
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.340
<v 0>Where the positive charges,</v>

368
00:24:54.341 --> 00:24:57.310
there's a vacant adore battle on carbon and atomic orbital.

369
00:24:57.311 --> 00:25:00.930
A carbon that's not shared.
So there's a low luma.
Where's the high homeboy?

370
00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:02.110
You've got that to Virginia.

371
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.533
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

372
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.540
<v 0>Chlorine has unshared pairs,
right?
Bingo.</v>

373
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.370
So in fact,
both those things happen at once.
It's not that one happens.

374
00:25:14.371 --> 00:25:16.920
And then the other,
both those things happen at once.

375
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.840
And you can see it by looking at molecular orbitals.
So there's the homo of the,

376
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.160
of the ethylene or all Phi gas and the Sigma Star Lumo.

377
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.320
So those things mix the blue orbitals overlap and mixed shift electrons toward

378
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:34.770
the other one.
The chloride breaks away,
but at the same time,

379
00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.750
the homo of the chlorine mixes with the Lumo of the ethylene.

380
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.380
So you're making two bonds at once,
two pairs of electrons.

381
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.850
So you make that three membered ring with two new bonds and the chloride is,

382
00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:52.230
we said breaks away.
Okay.
So we've got that,
uh,

383
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.090
that's substance now

384
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.080
and now it itself is reactive.

385
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.860
Can you see what would be reactive about that cat eye and intermediate?

386
00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:07.080
What are you're probably looking at for a Lumo or a homo?
A Lumo.

387
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.990
Angela,
you have an idea of what could be a Lumo here.

388
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.640
It's true that the chlorine has a positive charge.

389
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:19.420
Does it have a vacant orbital unoccupied molecular orbital?

390
00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.280
No,
it turns out it's got to unshared pairs.

391
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.460
So it doesn't have any or it's not like the carbon plus was,

392
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.430
but the plus we'll make orbitals low in energy.

393
00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.120
So what's a vacant orbital of this thing?
Oh,
it's God is sigma bonds.

394
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.593
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

395
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.120
<v 0>Well,
what makes us suppose all you have in your molecule is sigma bonds,</v>

396
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.800
but you want to an unusually low energy,
vacant orbital,
right?

397
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:48.540
The plus charge will help,
but what is,

398
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.160
what orbital will you have sigma star now you've got two choices.

399
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.230
You've got carbon,
carbon or carbon chlorine,

400
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.170
which one's more likely to be low energy?

401
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.403
<v 1>Why</v>

402
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.320
<v 0>say chlorine as a high effective,
efficient,</v>

403
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.210
high chlorine has the high nuclear charge.
So a sigma star,
carbon chlorine,

404
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:11.400
would it be big on carbon or big on chlorine?

405
00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:15.280
Sam Big on carbon because the bonding or,

406
00:27:15.281 --> 00:27:16.770
but it was big on chlorine,
right?

407
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.120
This is the kind of stuff we were talking about.
So Sigma Star and there it is.

408
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.620
Okay.
There is a localized sigma star,
big on chlorine,
the black,
uh,

409
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.570
big on carbon,
the black one,
small on chlorine and anti-bonding between them.

410
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.550
Now what are you going to,
there's the low luma.

411
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:35.190
What do you have for a high homo to react with it?

412
00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.770
You have to think back to what's been happening.

413
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.043
<v 1>Sure.
What</v>

414
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.520
<v 0>the chloride that you had at the beginning that you lost in the first step.
Okay,</v>

415
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.130
so we bring it over here so it'll have good overlap.

416
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:56.880
It comes up and makes a new bond that may can break,
and you get that.

417
00:27:56.881 --> 00:28:01.881
And that was the reaction in 1795 that resulted in ethylene being called the Ola

418
00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:06.990
[inaudible] gas because this is the oil that was made by reacting it with

419
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:10.730
chlorine.
So that was already a very old reaction at this time,

420
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.340
the oil of Dutch chemists,

421
00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:15.960
because it was for Dutch chemists who reported that oil.

422
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.770
Okay,
so there's one way that you can fix chlorine,
make it part of a,

423
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.950
of a mall,
hydrocarbon molecule.
It's addition to an alkane.

424
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:29.700
So if the hydrocarbons are unsaturated,
if they have some double bonds,

425
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:33.300
then you'll react with chlorine to fix the chlorine.
So that's one possibility.

426
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:37.080
But how about if you don't have a double bond?
How about if you have methane,

427
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.220
what's the problem now
in doing?

428
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:42.770
And that analogous reaction,

429
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.690
<v 1>Sherwin,
pardon me?</v>

430
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.570
<v 0>You don't have a pie.</v>

431
00:28:50.571 --> 00:28:55.571
You don't have a low Lumo so you can't do a homo Lumo reaction,

432
00:28:55.761 --> 00:28:57.620
right?
These are our,
our uh,

433
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.920
our model saturated alkanes like methane,

434
00:29:00.921 --> 00:29:04.040
our model of things that aren't unusually higher,
unusually low.

435
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.960
So we have to have another trick.

436
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.660
And here's the trick that the chlorine chlorine bond is weak.

437
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.450
It's only 58 kilocalories per mole.

438
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.490
And one of the reasons for that is that the chlorine has so many unshared

439
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:23.900
payers.
So you mix,
if you were trying to form a Pi orbital in chlorine,

440
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.510
you have two electrons and the p orbital here,

441
00:29:26.511 --> 00:29:30.230
two electrons on the p orbital here,
or they overlap.
Is that going to be bonding?

442
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.220
If you mix these two orbitals,
you'll obviously mix them when you mix two herbal,

443
00:29:36.221 --> 00:29:39.910
as you get a lower one in a higher one,
will it be bonding?

444
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.790
This one will be bonding,

445
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:48.220
but this one is anti-bonding everybody with me on this now.

446
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.330
So Kate,
what would you say?
Is it going to be net favorable or unfavorable

447
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.450
to electrons went down and energy to electrons went up in energy,

448
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.340
but the ones that went up went up a little more than the down went down so well,

449
00:30:03.341 --> 00:30:04.330
that's unfavorable.

450
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.440
So having so many unshared pairs weakens the single bond.

451
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.180
So chlorine has a weak bond.
Now still it's,

452
00:30:12.181 --> 00:30:15.760
it's worth 35 k for 58 kilocalories per mole.
Pardon me?

453
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.550
Which is plenty strong.
It doesn't just break.

454
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.520
You've got to do something to help it to break.
And what you can do is I,

455
00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:27.340
I've made it in this weird color,
which is hard to see.
Why

456
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.110
<v 1>anybody know?
Pardon me?</v>

457
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.920
<v 0>Color of chlorine.
It absorbs visible light.</v>

458
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.150
Now how does it take on energy?
One of the absorbs visible light.

459
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.570
Where does the energy go in the molecule?
It's anybody know

460
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.270
<v 1>data can't hear very well.</v>

461
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.120
<v 0>Electrons go from orbitals to hire orbitals so you can put,</v>

462
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.670
then the next higher orbital is sigma star.

463
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.690
And what happens if you take an electron and put it in Sigma Star,

464
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.833
<v 1>right?</v>

465
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.490
<v 0>Breaks the bond,
right?</v>

466
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:12.430
That's what happened up at the top when the chlorine broke,
right?

467
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:14.470
You put electrons into Sigma Star.

468
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:20.230
So you can do it with light as well as with some homo attacking.
Okay?

469
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:23.440
So we have,
um,
uh,
in fact,

470
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:25.550
I said Lumo when I was talking about athlete,

471
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.200
I've meant homo up above I think some three or four minutes ago.

472
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:34.570
Okay?
So the bond breaks,
but it doesn't break into ions.

473
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:39.490
It breaks one electron going each way because that's easier.
Okay,

474
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.260
so now and notice that we draw curved arrows for that too.

475
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:48.940
But you draw arrows with a single bar rather than a double bar when it's just

476
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:51.120
one electron rather than a pair of electrons.

477
00:31:51.121 --> 00:31:54.670
It's executed the motion we're talking about.
Okay,

478
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:59.500
so now we have to chlorine atoms and now we can do the trick with the chlorine

479
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:04.501
atom because we have this so mo and it can mix with the ch bond to make a new

480
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:10.540
bond.
That is one electron in the ch bond now goes each way.

481
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.930
One goes to complete the pair to make Hcl,

482
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.230
and the other one is left on carbon.
Right?

483
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.540
So it's very much like the reaction above,

484
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.010
but it's single electrons that are doing the moving instead of electron pairs.

485
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.200
And the Nice thing about this is you still have a radical,
and it must be.

486
00:32:29.201 --> 00:32:33.160
So if you start with something with an odd number of electrons and react it with

487
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:35.170
something with an even number of electrons,

488
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.070
you must be left at the end with an odd number of electrons,
right?

489
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
Ch three is such a radical and it can react with something to break another bond

490
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.420
and it reacts with the Weakest Bond.
Chlorine,

491
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.863
<v 1>right?</v>

492
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.920
<v 0>So now you have methyl chloride,</v>

493
00:32:51.921 --> 00:32:55.320
you've incorporated chlorine into the al Qaeda,

494
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.280
and you have a chlorine atom.
Why is it neat that you have a chlorine atom?

495
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.180
What's great about that?
Dana?
What did you say?

496
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.540
That's what you needed at the beginning.

497
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.510
That's why you used light in order to get that,

498
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.600
but you don't need any more light now,
right?

499
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:17.990
That can go back and start over again.
So it's a chain reaction.

500
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:21.740
It's called a free radical chain reaction.

501
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.960
And so you can get lots of products from just one initial photon of light that

502
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:31.160
started this chain along.
So these are two completely different ways.
The first,

503
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:35.600
the top is an addition of chlorine to an alkene and the bottom is called free

504
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:39.760
radical substitution of chlorine for hydrogen and involves,

505
00:33:39.761 --> 00:33:42.530
so Moe's rather than homos and Lumos Chris

506
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:47.540
<v 1>second
from the first.</v>

507
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.053
Yep.

508
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.350
Does it break a second molecule rather than using the other?

509
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.160
<v 0>Because they have to find one another,
right?</v>

510
00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.180
They've gone off.

511
00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.230
It'll take forever before they by chance encounter one another and solution.

512
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.120
They'll react with many molecules.

513
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.040
If you try to generate too many chlorine radical so the concentration gets high,

514
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.330
then their concentration will drop again or not get so high because they find

515
00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:20.250
one another and combined.
But as long as they're rare,
they can survive.

516
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:25.620
You know what the license plate of New Hampshire says on it?
Live?

517
00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:26.970
Free or die.

518
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

519
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:36.360
<v 0>I use that joke later on.
Okay,</v>

520
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:41.340
1830 to 1850s we have this substitution or type or unitary theory.

521
00:34:41.341 --> 00:34:44.370
It doesn't involve the plus minus stuff.
Max.

522
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.310
Is it kind of like what?
I couldn't hear clearly.

523
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.580
Yeah,
they involved.
That's a free radical chain reaction.
The ozone reduction.

524
00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.690
Yeah.
We'll talk about that a little bit later,
I hope.
Okay.

525
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.720
So there's more trouble for radicals for do you mind 1839 and that is that they

526
00:35:08.701 --> 00:35:12.390
had this reverence asset.
Teal radical had been discovered by liebig.

527
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.640
So there was this great element that would,

528
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.210
that would go survive from reaction to reaction.

529
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.430
But here was a reaction with chlorine of this kind that Dubai had been studying,

530
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.020
where you start with a Siddique acid acid,
teal Oah,
react it with chlorine,

531
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.090
and you get a chloro asset deal.
So the element has been changed.

532
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.830
It's been transmuted.
It doesn't go unchanged from reaction reaction.

533
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.260
Right?
And in fact,
that goes even further.

534
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:45.261
It can react again to give die chloro asset teal or try chloro asset deal.

535
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:50.700
All the hydrogens can be substituted as we now know by the kind of mechanism,

536
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:54.090
the Somo mechanism,
we just studied free radical,
uh,

537
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:56.340
chlorination chain reaction.

538
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.290
So hydrogen can be substituted by an equivalent amount of height,

539
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.380
halogen or oxygen,
right?

540
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.980
But all of these things you get when you change a radical into something else,

541
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.410
when you transmute it,
have similar properties.

542
00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:18.040
All of these acids at CDEC acid chloro is CDEC,
dichloride,

543
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.440
Hassidic,
trickler OCT are all acids.
They all taste sharp and so on,

544
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.040
right?
So they're similar.
So what?
Uh,

545
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:30.860
so they don't change the type.
That's where this idea of type theory cave on.

546
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.620
You get the same type of molecule even after you have a substitution.

547
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.060
So by 1853 four types were recognized as prevalent.

548
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.130
One was water,
another was hydrogen,
and other was hydrochloric acid.

549
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.580
And another was ammonia.
So for example,

550
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.210
you could have these structures in this drawing with a curly bracket,

551
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:54.930
like this was the notation used by the people who did type theory.

552
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.130
So you have water,
hydrochloric acid,
hydrogen and ammonia,

553
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:04.290
and you could exchange,
make exchanges for the hydrogen right substitution.

554
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:05.910
So that,
for example,
with ammonia,

555
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.240
you could substitute Ethel for hydrogen and you could get ethylamine or die

556
00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:15.540
ethylamine or triethylamine.
But these were all basic,

557
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.750
why would we say their basic of the sense of acid base?

558
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.630
Why do we say they're,
they're,

559
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.010
they're basically react with acids by true,

560
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.160
yeah.
They all have the unshared para nitrogen we would say,

561
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.450
but they said they're just the same type of molecule.
Okay.

562
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.430
Or you could have ethyl alcohol,
which is of the water type or,

563
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.500
uh,
or the potassium salt thereof,
which they would say is,

564
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:48.180
is the potassium Ethel analog of water or of the HCL.

565
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:53.070
You could have Ethel iodide where you exchanged hydrogen with Ethel and exchange

566
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:56.610
chloride with,
with iodide.
Okay.
But in fact,

567
00:37:56.611 --> 00:38:01.050
these two things could react with one another to give this ether,

568
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:05.580
which is another thing that's still like water clear liquid and so on.
Okay.

569
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.580
Fairly unreactive.
Uh,

570
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.970
so this particular reaction was,
was uh,

571
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:17.210
named for the work in 1850 of Williamson in England.

572
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:20.520
So it's called the Williamson ether synthesis.

573
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:22.230
And we'll talk about that again later.

574
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:28.290
But it's quite an old reaction.
So how about the theory of these,

575
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.490
these types?
So notice it's unitary,
not dualistic.

576
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:35.230
They're just things that,
that are holistic,
right?

577
00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:40.600
Not plus minus do said that molecules are like planetary systems,

578
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:45.601
like the sun in its planets held together by a force resembling gravitation,

579
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.930
but acting in accord with much more complicated laws.

580
00:38:49.931 --> 00:38:53.670
He didn't think it was gravity,
but it was some forest holds this,
uh,

581
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.160
this assemblage together and Williamson,

582
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.950
that Alexander William Williamson,
who we just mentioned making ethers said,
f,

583
00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.370
this is something new.

584
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:07.270
And notice it's because it's a very young guy that has a new idea,

585
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:12.160
not like these,
uh,
imagination starved older people.
I mean,

586
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.380
at this age,
at this time,
Dumas was 40 years old.

587
00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:18.940
He's four sevenths as old as I am,
right?

588
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:23.910
So he was really getting over the hill.
A formula made,

589
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.550
the young guy says,
may be used as an actual image

590
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:33.130
of what we rationally supposed to be,
the arrangement of constituent atoms.

591
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:37.270
This is entirely new formulas.
At least since Dalton,

592
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.590
we're only what the elements were and what ratio is there and not how they're

593
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:45.220
arranged.
Right?
But he said,
we can,

594
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.530
we can think that they're,
uh,

595
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:52.480
that they're like an orrery as which is an image of what we conclude to be the

596
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:57.150
arrangement of our planetary system.
Do you know what an Ori is?
It's,

597
00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.660
it's a thing like this,
you know,

598
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:02.470
where you have a mechanical model of the solar system and you'd turn a crank and

599
00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:04.930
the moon goes around the earth,
the earth goes around the sun,

600
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:09.040
and a bunch of moons go around Saturn and so on.
Have you seen these devices?

601
00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.610
And that was very popular in those,
there was a show of Joseph,
right,

602
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:15.670
of Darby here at Yale last summer.
Uh,

603
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.260
so beautiful bromide,
you remember,

604
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:25.180
is a residue of radical dualism,
right?
Plus butyl minus bromide,

605
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.600
but there's another name for butyl bromide.
Do you know what it is?

606
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.550
You know the other name for butyl bromide?
You've meant we didn't,

607
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:36.730
we haven't talked about systematic nomenclature yet,
so you probably don't,

608
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.930
but it's also called Bromo butane.
But Bravo.

609
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:44.710
Butane is not two words.
It's one word.
Right?

610
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.590
And that's a relic of the unitary theory,

611
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:52.120
the substitution theory that it's butane in which a hydrogen has been replaced

612
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:55.360
by bromine.
Okay.

613
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.290
So Brett's alias in 1838 when these,
uh,
uh,

614
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.980
things came along said by reacting chlorine with ordinary ether,

615
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.800
Dumont produce the very interesting compound,

616
00:41:05.801 --> 00:41:09.910
which he reckoned according to the theory of substitutions to be an ether,

617
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:14.590
in which four atoms of chlorine replace four atoms of hydrogen.
Right?
So,

618
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.670
so do says that in these types you can replace hydrogen by chlorine.

619
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.320
What would parts alias think about that?
What kind of theory is he?
Is He,
uh,

620
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.430
advocating?
Remember we talked last time about pets alias.

621
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.560
He was the originator of dualism plus minus.

622
00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:36.230
What would he of replacing hydrogen by chlorine?

623
00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.160
Lucas?
Right?
So here's what he said,

624
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.340
and element as eminently electronegative as chlorine would never be able to

625
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:50.630
enter into an organic radical.

626
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.040
This idea is contrary to the first principles of chemistry.

627
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.020
Okay.
And in that same paper in 1838,

628
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.620
he talked about tartrate losing an atom of water,

629
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.110
which you mean it's a molecule at 190.

630
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:09.200
But the interesting thing about that is not that transformation,

631
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.560
but that this is the first time the letter r was used to talk about a generic

632
00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:19.880
radical r stands for radical,
right?
So we still use that.
So,

633
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.480
so much of what we do nowadays derives from this period.

634
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.360
Okay.
So the,

635
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.400
the principal journal at that time in,

636
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.970
in chemistry was the analogy dare came on pharmacy,

637
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.680
which was originally a Nolen to pharmacy.
Uh,

638
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.920
but Comey was added and you see who put it out,

639
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.340
it says with the collaboration of Dumas in Paris and Graham in London,

640
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:51.590
and Graham is one of the guys out at the front of the building here,

641
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.600
edited by volar and leaving.
But actually it was leaving.

642
00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.960
He was the one and later the journal came to be called Lee beaks.

643
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.300
I'm Nolen right?
So he was the one in charge,

644
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:09.210
but he'd added these other people just sort of for show.
Okay.

645
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.640
So in 1840 [inaudible] there were a series of papers published.

646
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:16.400
The first of them was by so-called collaborator,

647
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:20.240
do Ma on the law of substitution and the theory of types.

648
00:43:20.241 --> 00:43:24.830
This was a 40 page paper and it begins with this question number one,

649
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:28.790
there can one substitute the elements that play their role in any simple or

650
00:43:28.791 --> 00:43:31.790
compound substance equivalent for equivalent.

651
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:35.870
So could you make a new Adam takes the role of an old atom and you won't be

652
00:43:35.871 --> 00:43:39.560
surprised that in 40 pages he concludes the answer is yes,

653
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.790
but immediately following this is a note from the editor which says remarks on

654
00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:49.520
the previous paper and it's by j l at the bottom,

655
00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:52.220
Eustace liebig and he says begins,

656
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:55.660
I am a far cry from sharing the ideas that monsieur do.

657
00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.170
Maya has linked to the so called laws of the substitution theory.

658
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:05.830
And then there's another paper by another Frenchman Palouse on the substitution

659
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:09.590
law of Monsieur Dumas.
And after that lengthy paper,

660
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.860
there's a letter a on the law of substitution and the theory of types,

661
00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.270
uh,
with a footnote that says it was a letter to use this leak.

662
00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:23.930
And you notice it's dated Paris and it's the only paper that's in French in this

663
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.430
particular issue.
And it's,
there's another page.

664
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:32.010
It's got some curious formulas in them that have a lot of chlorine.

665
00:44:32.011 --> 00:44:33.720
We'll come back to that in just a second.

666
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:40.580
And it's by a chemist that no one had heard of before called s c h vintner this

667
00:44:41.701 --> 00:44:42.660
letter to leaving.

668
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.340
And then the next paper is also on the reaction of chlorine with the chlorides

669
00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:51.780
of ethanol and methanol and several points of the ether theory by [inaudible]

670
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.250
who was a French chemist.

671
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.960
Now this is that letter translated Paris 1st of March,

672
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.433
1840 miss year.

673
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.210
I am eager to communicate to you one of the most striking facts of organic

674
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:06.900
chemistry.

675
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.340
I have confirmed the substitution theory in an extremely remarkable and

676
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.440
completely unexpected manner.

677
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:18.840
Only now can one appreciate the great value of this theory and foresee the

678
00:45:18.841 --> 00:45:21.690
immense discoveries that it promises to reveal.

679
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.091
So it starts,

680
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:29.091
it's got a complicated a description of all the light was used sometimes and the

681
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:33.060
various distillations and crystallizations and the crystals are described.

682
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.890
But he started with Manganese Acetate,

683
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:42.720
which had this formula with the asset deal radical in it and was able to

684
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:45.900
chlorinate to substitute the hydrogens with chlorine.

685
00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:50.310
So there's already a validation to the substitution theory,

686
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.520
but it went further.
A subsequent reaction,
uh,

687
00:45:53.521 --> 00:45:58.521
exchange the O and manganese oxide with chlorine and a further reaction replaced

688
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:02.550
the manganese itself with chlorine.
Uh,

689
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:06.270
and then the final reaction,
the PSD,
Raci stands for place,

690
00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.180
the carbon with chlorine and the oxygen with chlorine,

691
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.320
but still it preserved it's type right?

692
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:15.480
So it was the same kind of substance still,

693
00:46:15.481 --> 00:46:19.320
even though it was entirely chlorine for all I know in the d color eyes,

694
00:46:19.321 --> 00:46:23.040
and that is bleaching action of chlorine and hydrogen is replaced by chlorine in

695
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:26.250
the cloth,
which is now being bleached in England,

696
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:30.720
preserves its type according to the substitution laws,
I believe,
however,

697
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:34.950
that Adam for Adam,
substitution of carbon by chlorine is my own discovery.

698
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.880
I hope you will take note of this in your journal and be assured of my sincerest

699
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:42.570
regards,
et Sch employer.
And there's a footnote,

700
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.970
which is I have learned that there is already in the London shops a cloth of

701
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.050
chlorine thread,

702
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.920
which is very much sought after and preferred above all others for nightcaps

703
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:56.430
underwear,
et cetera.
Now,
this is,

704
00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:01.580
you'll be surprised the pun because that the name is pronounced Schindler or

705
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:05.040
swindler.
So where do you think this came from?

706
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.910
Leaving didn't have enough sense of humor to do such a thing.

707
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.340
Who was the joker?

708
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.700
Volar so Voler had sent this in a letter to parts alias and alias thought it was

709
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:25.701
so fun that he forwarded the liebig and to voters consternation Liebing

710
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:30.790
published it,
right,
which didn't make Duma the happier.
Right?

711
00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:34.930
So this was,
uh,
uh,
leaving at least thought it was funny,
I guess.

712
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.460
Okay.
So at 1849,
uh,

713
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:43.780
Colby prepared the free methyl radical,
the actual element,

714
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:48.010
which had never been prepared before.
Ch three,
he did it by electrolysis.

715
00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.820
So when you electrolyze a CD Cassatt it turns out you can get hydrogen,

716
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:57.240
hydrogen gas and CO2 and what analyzed for ch three.

717
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:02.020
Right?
So he had prepared the actual radical.
Now,

718
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:05.340
of course it was discovered,
uh,
uh,

719
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.510
10 years later that he hadn't prepared ch three,
it had that analysis.

720
00:48:10.511 --> 00:48:15.280
But actually it was c two h six.
It was the dimer of ch three.

721
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.480
Okay.
But at the time it was thought to be justification of the radical theory.

722
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.840
So these two theories were competing with one another,

723
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.850
and ironically,

724
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:30.330
both the theories were supported by reactions that actually did involve

725
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:35.470
radicals.
So the oxidation of Benzaldehyde,

726
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:40.471
the first reaction that generated benzoyl did in fact involve benzoyl.

727
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.580
It was a somo reaction in which a hydrogen atom was abstracted and the

728
00:48:45.581 --> 00:48:49.030
chlorination,
as we've already seen of a,
of a hydrocarbon,

729
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:51.940
like methane involves pulling a hydrogen atom off,

730
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:56.710
and that electrolysis did indeed generate the methyl radicals,

731
00:48:56.711 --> 00:48:57.940
but they were so reactive,

732
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:02.941
they found one another and dimerize to c two h six so it's just sort of curious

733
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.390
that all these reactions did indeed involve free radicals,

734
00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:09.130
but no one was truly aware of it.

735
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.940
So next time we'll see what resolved all this.
