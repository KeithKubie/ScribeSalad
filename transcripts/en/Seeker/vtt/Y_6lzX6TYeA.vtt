00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
Okay, I'm going to say something using only
body language.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.910
Did you get that?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.679
Hi all you body linguists Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.820
Scientists weren't around to ask, but they
believe verbal language evolved as a learning

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.500
aid for ancient human-like ancestors.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.790
Language helped us communicate, coordinate
and cognate (yes! alliteration!).

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.560
what is body language
Before we'd evolved to say, "I'm hungry,"

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
or "I like you," nature devised other ways
to say those things: Nonverbal communication!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.510
Even when not speaking we're sending messages
about our emotions, health, age, and social

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.510
status!

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.310
The way you're standing, your hand gestures,
body tension, facial expressions… all these

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.080
communicate your inner feelings to the outside
world, often without you realizing it, and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.390
some of them are universal.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.390
who decided that's what nonverbals meant?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.500
Charles Darwin first proposed the idea of
universal body languages based on how our

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.670
muscles connected to our facial skin.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.309
100 years later, a series of experiments by
researchers Tomkins and Ekman, found seven

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.360
universal facial expressions: Happy, Surprise,
Contempt, Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and Anger.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.010
In essence, Darwin was right!

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.380
We all have inherent structures and adaptations
in our brain's limbic system to process emotions

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.770
-- and some are universally expressed!

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.380
The amygdalae, which control reactions, self-preservation
and emotional processing do all this work

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.250
for us, subconsciously.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.619
When people shout, "Surprise!" at a party,
these almond-shaped structures deep in the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.900
brain get that message first!

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.420
First the amygdalae make sure these people
aren't about to attack, showing a universal

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.630
fight-or-flight fear-evoked freeze response
while you process the emotion!

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.440
Then after they're like, NO THREAT YOU'RE
GOOD, you go on to feel happiness and amusement.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.730
This happens all the time.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.990
When someone startles you, you trip, or if
your partner unexpectedly pops the question,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.049
you'll probably look scared before you look
happy… thanks amygdalae.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.049
Awkward.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.049
so what body languages are universal?

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.860
We are constantly shouting emotions with our
postures, gestures, and body shifts too.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910
Yes, the fear-evoked freeze is universal,
but so are some others.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.180
A 2008 study in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences found sighted, blind,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.670
and congenitally blind people from more than
30 nations all expressed shame or pride in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.890
the same way, and a 2010 study also in PNAS
added laughter to the list as well!

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.129
In yet another study, researchers found intense
emotions don't even need a facial expression:

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.390
we can guess just from body language!
what about body expressions

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.860
Even though body language is super important,
face+body are better together says study after

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.860
study.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.430
According to 2013 research in the journal
Science, when people were just shown faces

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.459
of people (even displaying "universal facial
expressions,") they only had a 50-50 chance

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.300
of guessing the emotion, and by adding body
language to the picture guesses became quote

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.610
"far more accurate."

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.860
Interestingly, some body language we think
of as universal is not at all.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.450
Winks can mean trust and friendship, or deviousness
and concealment; the context matters.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.310
Additionally, body language is intensely cultural.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.890
For example, in Russia, West Africa, the Middle
East, parts of the Mediterranean and Australia

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.040
there's a gesture which means up-yours, but
in the U.S., it means LIKE!

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.489
Or, in the West, close friends stand close
together, and strangers further apart, but

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.800
a Middle Eastern salesman might stand closer
to show trust.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.770
In the U.K. business world, looking someone
directly in the eye is considered rude but

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.010
in the U.S. not meeting a gaze is untrustworthy!

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.280
In the end, more research, it be needed.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.760
how do we control nonverbals?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.230
Even though they're subconscious, simply knowing
nonverbal cues exist can help you understand

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.720
that secret language.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.849
According to Paul Ekman, "Learning to recognize
facial expressions of emotion in others helps

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.629
you learn to recognize your own emotions…
[and this can] help you manage the expression

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.050
of your own emotions."

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.690
And just remember, if you pop the question
and your partner looks scared, that's just

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.690
their amygdalae…

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.690
Hopefully.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.910
If you still aren't sure how to express your
emotions, there are other culturally appropriate

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.769
expressions some people engage in.

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.909
See what i did there?

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:12.909
Engage in?

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.189
This video was proudly sponsored by Kay Jewelers,
who might have some ideas on how to help.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.219
Every kiss begins with Kay.

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.979
Nonverbal might be the most important part
of language, but it's not the only way we

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:23.979
communicate with each other.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.439
On my other show TestTube Plus we spent a
whole week researching human communication,

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.610
how it shapes your brain, how emoji might
be the future of language, and how klingon

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.300
could be a REAL language.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.930
Check it out here.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:51.379
Are you good at reading nonverbal cues?

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:52.509
Are you going to look for them now?

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.320
Bonus fact, the harder you look, the worse
you get at discerning the emotion, just let

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320
it happen naturally.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.120
Tell me your thoughts in the comments.
