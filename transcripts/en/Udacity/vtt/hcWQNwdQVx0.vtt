What I'd like you guys to do is first

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.000
implement a function make_salt, that returns a string of

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.970
5 random characters. Python has a random module that

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.870
has a variety of functions that can be useful to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.410
you here. So you may have to look that up. But what I want is just a string of,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.120
of, of 5 characters. And every time we run

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.300
this function, we want to get different results. Okay, good luck.
