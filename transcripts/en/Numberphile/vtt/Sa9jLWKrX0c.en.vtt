00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
I'm gonna show you a little bit of a scam, or a trick, that you can try out on people.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.640
So, what I'm going to ask you to do, is to pick a sequence of three coin tosses.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.640
So, you know, heads-tails-heads, or tails-tails-tails.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.980
Brady: "Tails-tails-heads."

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.580
Okay. So, Brady's picking tails-tails-heads.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.260
And I

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.600
will pick heads-tails-tails.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.860
And the game is: we're gonna toss this coin and see who gets that first.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.000
So, let's see who wins. We'll do a best of 5.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.380
Okay? Something like that.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.160
Okay, so,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.640
let's try game Number 1. All right, here we go.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.580
So, number 1...

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.560
All right, let's write down this sequence.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.860
Heads.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.280
Okay, that's pretty good actually; that's good for me.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400
Yeah, it's good for me, not good for you.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.120
All right, heads again.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.380
Heads again.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.820
Ooh, look at this.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.060
We might have to do a different video about how many heads we can get in a row.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.740
Oh look, tails. Alright

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.380
Oooh, tails.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.600
That is a win for me. Excellent.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.960
A James win, brilliant.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Alright, well, best of 5?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.580
Alright, Brady's got a tail. Come on.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.880
Brady: "Ah, now, this is good for me."

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.920
Yes! That's a tail.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.120
Brady: "Yes!"

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.000
- And...

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.060
It's a tail!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.800
Oh no you're okay though

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.420
You're still, you're still in the lead

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.160
Yeah, happy with that aren't you?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.760
Alright, oooh

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.240
Brady: "That's good for me."

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.440
Tails, tails

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.600
Brady: "In fact, I'm definitely gonna win this next one"

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.560
Soon as the sequence breaks, yeah,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.740
you're right.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.780
Well observed, Brady.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.460
Brady does win that, he had to win that after all those tails coming up. Okay,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.440
Brady: "So, It is bad to choose any two consecutives as you start."

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880
It is bad to choose.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.060
Brady!

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.040
Brady: "I realize what I did wrong."

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.820
Ahhh cmon cmon cmon you can still win this

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.140
Have you given up?

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.440
Brady: "I've realized my mistake."

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.300
You've realized what a mistake

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.820
You're less likely to win than I am.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.860
Brady: "So, what would you have done if I had not been stupid and not given consecutives as my..."

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.940
Whatever sequence that you pick

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.760
I can pick a sequence that is more likely to appear before yours.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220
Brady: "What if I pick the most likely of them all?"

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.720
Exactly, what if you pick the most likely of them all?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.480
It goes round in a circle like rock, paper, scissors

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.100
Let's say that Brady picks whatever sequence he does pick

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.660
I'm going to show you what sequence I should pick so that I can beat him.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.060
Right, or at least with a better chance of beating him.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.380
I'm going to show you the cycle of winning. Let's do that.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.880
Right. So let's say Brady picks heads-heads-heads, right? Three heads in a row.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.640
Then what I should pick is tail-heads-heads.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.540
And tail-heads-heads will beat heads-heads-heads.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.760
If Brady had picked tails-heads-heads,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.820
then I should choose tails-tails-heads.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.420
Because that is going to beat Brady.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.060
If Brady had picked tails-tails-heads,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.780
then I should pick heads-tails-tails, that will beat Brady.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.080
Incidentally, if he had picked, instead, tails-heads-tails,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.960
you pick this one here, tails-tails-heads. So it's not quite a circle, this.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.260
It has some spikes coming off the side of it.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.320
If Brady had picked tails-tails-tails, you want to choose heads-tails-tails.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.540
If Brady had picked heads-tails-tails,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.880
then the best choice is heads-heads-tails.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.660
If you had picked heads-tails-heads, I would again pick heads-heads-tails.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.780
If you had chosen heads-heads-tails, Brady, I would have picked tails-heads-heads.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.500
So we have this little circle, but you can see the spikes coming off it as well.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.240
So to read this, Brady's choice would be here, at the pointy end of the arrow.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.100
My choice, the better choice, would be here, so the arrow going towards Brady's choice there.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.660
There is a way to help you to remember this cycle.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.520
The way you do it is, when your opponent picks a sequence, let's say, tails-heads-heads,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.840
what you should do is, in your mind, copy the middle one, so make a copy of that coin,

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.020
so I've got another heads there, I'm gonna put it at the front, and flip it over.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.980
So it would become a tails. And then my choice would be tails-tails-heads.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.040
That's the winning choice.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.920
That little way of remembering it is better than just remembering that cycle.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.220
And that will work. That's your best choice to go for.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.280
I should show you the probabilities for each choice.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.240
If Brady picked heads-heads-heads, I would pick tails-heads-heads.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:58.240
And the chance of beating you is actually pretty good. It's seven eighths. I can tell you that's round about 87.5 percent.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.820
So it's really likely. I'm really likely to win the game.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.300
That's why I did best of five, though, just in case probability let me down.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.240
This probability here, if I wanted to work tails-heads-heads beating heads-heads-tails,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.060
that happens with a chance of three quarters, so it's about 75 percent,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440
really big probability.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.140
If you wanted to do this one here, heads-heads-tails beating heads-tails-heads,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.600
that happens with a chance of two thirds, so that's, what's that, about 67 percent.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.760
And then, actually the others are similar.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.560
This probability here is two thirds, this one here is seven eighths, this one here is three quarters.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.920
There's a symmetry in this.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.920
So you are far more likely to win.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.140
Excellent. Try it out on your enemies, right. So you can beat them.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.380
This is insane, because you think, well, surely there's a best choice.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.760
There's a best choice, and then, all the others are worse than that.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.340
And you can't beat the best choice.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.860
It works in such a strange way that it makes this cycle of probabilities instead.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.160
Just to show you where these come from. These are some of the easy ones, okay?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.600
I'm gonna show you where some of these come from. Well, look, this is an easy one, look at this.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.980
I said this was seven eighths. Yeah, that's actually an easy one to spot,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:23.080
because, well, you could get heads-heads-heads straightaway, which happens one eighth of the time.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.200
But if you don't get heads-heads-heads straightaway, if you've got a sequence,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.120
and somewhere in the sequence it's heads-heads-heads, let's say this is the first appearance,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.860
then it has to be preceded by a tail.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.420
If it's not, if it was preceded by a head, then it wouldn't be the first heads-heads-heads in the sequence.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.900
It has to be preceded by a tail.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.580
Which means it has to have tails-heads-heads coming up before it

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.260
unless

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.420
you get the three heads in a row straightaway.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.940
So, yeah, you're going to lose if you pick heads-heads-heads, most of the time.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:05.860
Yeah, so we go back to our game, what Brady chose. He chose tails-tails-heads, it wasn't the best choice.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:12.320
Brady, if you picked tails-tails-heads, I used my little algorithm, I know what I'm supposed to choose,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:21.440
heads-tails-tails, and I can beat you, appear before yours does, with a chance of 75 percent.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.020
Which is actually the second best thing there.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.880
Really bad choice, Brady. Sorry about that.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.800
Well I might not be making the best coin choices, but I have been learning a lot of new mathematical tricks

They're really extensive, and right up the alley of the sort of people who watch these videos.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.840
There's lots about games, puzzles, probability. I've really been enjoying, just today, some of the videos about probability.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.320
I wish I'd watched them before recording that video with James.

And cheers to the GreatCoursesPlus for supporting this video.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:42.620
This game is called Penney's Game, or penny ante, which I think is a kind of a pun.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.940
Actually, the strange thing is, Penney doesn't refer to coins and pennies, and flipping coins,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:55.000
It's actually the name of guy who came up with the game. He was called Penney.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.020
It's kind of one of those situations when you have a baker called Mr. Baker,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280
Or a mathematician called Dr. Sexy or something like that.
