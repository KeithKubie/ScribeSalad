00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.910
Cuddling...it’s the universal way of showing
affection, whether it’s mother &amp; child,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.080
star-crossed lovers, or me and my cat Mr.
Mittens curled up on the couch binge watching

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.320
Orange Is the New Black.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.490
Hey cuddle bugs, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.090
I don’t know about you, but I’m the type
of person that thoroughly enjoys cuddling!

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.439
In fact, I fancy myself as a competitive spooner.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.070
I can easily switch from little to big spoon
while deftly maintaining my soothing effectiveness.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.960
But did you know cuddling has some pretty
amazing health and relationship benefits?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.170
Physical contact, like cuddling, helps build
bonds and form intimacy between participants.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
Intimacy, in turn, builds trust which makes
for stronger relationships.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.420
The reason being is that touch increases the
release of oxytocin, a neuropeptide, which

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.610
promotes trust, devotion, and bonding.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
In fact, oxytocin is often called the “cuddle
hormone”.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.390
A recent study in England was able to find
the area of the brain that reacts to touch.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.020
Researchers discovered that a light touch
on the arm made the orbital frontal cortex

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.950
light up, like it does when one experiences
other rewarding stimuli.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.410
These findings suggest that cuddling has the
biological ability to build connections!

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.410
A study published in the Journal of Social
and Personal Relationship focused on a sample

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.840
of 397 couples in committed relationships
and found that the initiation of physical

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.490
contact, regardless if it led to nookie or
not, positively affected the relationship.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.700
A University of Toronto study has also shown
that post coital cuddles can be the key to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.040
relationship happiness and success.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.500
Participants filled out a survey about their
foreplay, love making duration, and post coital

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.150
cuddling practices and results found that
what came AFTER the main event seemed to have

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.110
the greatest effect in terms of relationship
satisfaction.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.500
However, cuddling is not for everyone.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.400
Some folks aren’t so keen on snuggling up.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.560
But, take heed, anti-embracers!

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.750
Science says physical touch is actually good
for your health...

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.070
In fact, science even says hugs can stave
off illness while keeping you feeling connected

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.180
to others.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.090
Studies have shown that hugs led to decreased
levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
Sure, some can argue that more hugs mean more
potential contact with pathogens, but because

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.500
hugs help decrease stress that can be more
harmful to your health in the long-run, they’re

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
worth the risk!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
And since cuddling is like one big hug with
your whole body, it’s a perfect way to relieve

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.390
stress.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.300
So science says, go ahead, get your cuddle
on!

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.370
Some people don’t like touch at all.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.160
Autistic animal behaviorist Temple Grandin
was adverse to touch as child.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.280
She suffered from tantrums and didn’t speak.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.200
As she grew older she realized the importance
of touch and hugging as a way to reduce anxiety

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.840
and alleviate her symptoms.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.750
She sought to develop a device that could
help autistic individuals, children with ADHD,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.600
and animals learn to tolerate touch with the
goal of reducing anxiety.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.940
The device she developed was called “The
Squeeze Machine” and was marketed as a ‘hug

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.290
machine’ that provides deep tissue touch.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.010
The device has proved effective in children,
adults, and animals.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.180
Cuddling is wonderful.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.720
And it’s one of the best ways to show someone
you love that you care...and it sometimes

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.790
it leads to a kiss.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.060
But don’t forget, every kiss begins with
Kay.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.830
Touch is a huge part of how we experience
the world, we are touching things constantly

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.900
every single day, but do you get the science
behind touch?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.600
