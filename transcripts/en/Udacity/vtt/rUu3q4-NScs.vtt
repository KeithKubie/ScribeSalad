All right, before we end this lesson,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.540
I want to think about where things like buttons and labels are coming from.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.190
When we make apps for iOS, we can choose from one of many building blocks or

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.720
frameworks that are available to us.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.690
One of these, is called UI Kit.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.850
Let me bring it out.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.640
Now you probably noticed that we imported this framework on the top of our code.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.229
Inside UIKit, we have classes like UIView.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.180
This helps us create a rectangular area on the phone,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.390
where we can create content.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.580
We also have another class called UIButton, this helps us make a button.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.400
And finally we have another class called UILabel.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.660
This helps us create labels.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.800
There are a few links in the instructor notes that will give you a list of

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.400
all classes inside UIKit and the relationships between those classes.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.230
This includes a helpful image, that lists out all the classes, and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.750
how they are connected.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.570
I encourage you to browse through those links now.
