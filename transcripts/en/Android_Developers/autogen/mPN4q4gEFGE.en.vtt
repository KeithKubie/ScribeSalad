just filling out a simple form and the
chances there being a conflict are

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590
chances there being a conflict are
 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.189
chances there being a conflict are
pretty much non-existent yeah very small

to roam free it's a really good idea to

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509
to roam free it's a really good idea to
 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.060
to roam free it's a really good idea to
get a registry yes it's just good

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070
get a registry yes it's just good
 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.010
get a registry yes it's just good
practice yeah all right now we talked a

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020
practice yeah all right now we talked a
 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.140
practice yeah all right now we talked a
bit earlier about Bluetooth and even

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150
bit earlier about Bluetooth and even
 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.670
bit earlier about Bluetooth and even
though you can't use an SD on Bluetooth

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680
though you can't use an SD on Bluetooth
 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.200

give you a better answer and that's
 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.550
give you a better answer and that's

couple reasons for this one of them is
 

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:14.649
couple reasons for this one of them is
that Wi-Fi direct is not going to work

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:14.659
that Wi-Fi direct is not going to work
 

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:16.179

computer programming in general it's a
 

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.930
computer programming in general it's a
pretty fast pace course so we don't have

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940
pretty fast pace course so we don't have
 

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.940
pretty fast pace course so we don't have
a lot of time to go over the basics but

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:16.950
a lot of time to go over the basics but
 

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.340
a lot of time to go over the basics but
that being said if you think you have a

that being said if you think you have a
 

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.019
that being said if you think you have a
pretty solid programming background it

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:21.029
pretty solid programming background it
 

00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:23.269
pretty solid programming background it

worst case that happens is you get
 

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.139
worst case that happens is you get

creating a layered structure consisting
 

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.850
creating a layered structure consisting
of a horizontal scroll view that holds a

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860
of a horizontal scroll view that holds a
 

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.740
of a horizontal scroll view that holds a
linear layout they'll hold any number of

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:06.750
linear layout they'll hold any number of
 

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.040
linear layout they'll hold any number of
textfree children the number of content

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.050
textfree children the number of content
 

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.600
textfree children the number of content
is only known at run time we want all

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:11.610
is only known at run time we want all
 

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.750
is only known at run time we want all
the children to be of equal with

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760
the children to be of equal with
 

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.050
the children to be of equal with
matching the widest how oh boy so this

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:18.060
matching the widest how oh boy so this
 

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.240
matching the widest how oh boy so this
question must have gotten in there

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.250
question must have gotten in there
 

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.440
question must have gotten in there
minutes ago literally because we checked

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.450
minutes ago literally because we checked
 

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.420
minutes ago literally because we checked
all the questions from the show and this

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:23.430
all the questions from the show and this
 

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.220
all the questions from the show and this
was not there so is that a horizontal

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:25.230
was not there so is that a horizontal
 

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.510
was not there so is that a horizontal
scrolling list view yes it yes

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:28.520
scrolling list view yes it yes
 

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.310
scrolling list view yes it yes
or ugly scrolling list view with a

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320
or ugly scrolling list view with a
 

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.380
or ugly scrolling list view with a
linear layout containing textfree

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:32.390
linear layout containing textfree
 

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.660
linear layout containing textfree
children so basically it's a horribly

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:34.670
children so basically it's a horribly
 

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.210
children so basically it's a horribly
scrolling or gift of tax not list view

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.220
scrolling or gift of tax not list view
 

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.710
scrolling or gift of tax not list view
but scrolling okay yes so that's a

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720
but scrolling okay yes so that's a
 

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720
but scrolling okay yes so that's a
really good question because you don't

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:43.730
really good question because you don't
 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.700
really good question because you don't
have any of this at or you don't have

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:45.710
have any of this at or you don't have
 

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:51.040
have any of this at or you don't have
any this until runtime now I what I

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.050
any this until runtime now I what I
 

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.590
any this until runtime now I what I
totally do in this case is when pretty

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600
totally do in this case is when pretty
 

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.480
totally do in this case is when pretty
much any of you gets laid out there's a

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:58.490
much any of you gets laid out there's a
 

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.620
much any of you gets laid out there's a
measure a measure children method call

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:02.630
measure a measure children method call
 

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.050
measure a measure children method call
and so if you override that you can

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:05.060
and so if you override that you can
 

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.730
and so if you override that you can
modify the semantics about how

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:06.740
modify the semantics about how
 

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.740
modify the semantics about how
everything is measured and if you need

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:08.750
everything is measured and if you need
 

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.300
everything is measured and if you need
you can either go and force that to

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.310
you can either go and force that to
 

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.610
you can either go and force that to
return a specific measurement or you

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:12.620
return a specific measurement or you
 

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.840
return a specific measurement or you

of children at that time so this will

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:18.200
of children at that time so this will
 

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.240
of children at that time so this will
get called at runtime but you can fetch

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.250
get called at runtime but you can fetch
 

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.770
get called at runtime but you can fetch
your children then and make sure you

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:20.780
your children then and make sure you
 

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.300

know exactly what the correct item with

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:22.310
know exactly what the correct item with
 

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.250

after a year or one option is actually
to use Google Cloud messaging GCM and

GCM you could just have an alarm manager

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439
GCM you could just have an alarm manager

not sure a lot of your way to use GCM in

not sure a lot of your way to use GCM in
that case that's her today I usually

like to say GCM is really good when you

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:16.189
like to say GCM is really good when you
 

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:18.760
like to say GCM is really good when you
have unplanned events so say in this

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:18.770

should wipe itself right I mean these

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:23.569
should wipe itself right I mean these
 

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.240
should wipe itself right I mean these
aren't things you can account for and so

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.250
aren't things you can account for and so
 

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.539
aren't things you can account for and so
that's where GCM really shines but it's

00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:28.549
that's where GCM really shines but it's
 

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:29.409
that's where GCM really shines but it's
just something that you know should

00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:29.419
just something that you know should
 

00:17:29.419 --> 00:17:31.330
just something that you know should
happen once a day or once a week you

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.340
happen once a day or once a week you
 

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.530
happen once a day or once a week you
know don't go with overhead of GC I'm

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:32.540
know don't go with overhead of GC I'm
 

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.899
know don't go with overhead of GC I'm
just use alarm manager right that's true

00:17:34.899 --> 00:17:34.909
just use alarm manager right that's true
 

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:37.750
just use alarm manager right that's true
yeah k SQ mine to every time you send a

server overhead on your end as a
 

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.240
server overhead on your end as a
developer and on top of that you know it

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.250
developer and on top of that you know it
 

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.280

uses a battery

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.290

necessarily perhaps that's true my mind

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.330
necessarily perhaps that's true my mind
 

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.760
necessarily perhaps that's true my mind
went to GCN because we get this question

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:51.770
went to GCN because we get this question
 

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.210
went to GCN because we get this question
a lot with GCM users I don't want to be

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:55.220
a lot with GCM users I don't want to be
 

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.400
a lot with GCM users I don't want to be

who doesn't even have the app installed

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000
who doesn't even have the app installed
 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.760
who doesn't even have the app installed
yeah that brings up another good

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:00.770
yeah that brings up another good
 

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.220
yeah that brings up another good
question though and so how does GCM

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230
question though and so how does GCM
 

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.600
question though and so how does GCM
handle this right if you uninstall an

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.610
handle this right if you uninstall an
 

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.930
handle this right if you uninstall an
app that uses GCM how does GCM know that

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:07.940
app that uses GCM how does GCM know that
 

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.270
app that uses GCM how does GCM know that
that app no longer exists I mean it's

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280
that app no longer exists I mean it's
 

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.490
that app no longer exists I mean it's
the exact same problem I suspect whoever

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:12.500
the exact same problem I suspect whoever
 

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.750
the exact same problem I suspect whoever
asked this question is probably just

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760
asked this question is probably just
 

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.580
asked this question is probably just
trying to solve but and the answer is

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:15.590
trying to solve but and the answer is
 

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.530
trying to solve but and the answer is
actually that we don't know when you

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:17.540
actually that we don't know when you
 

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.970
actually that we don't know when you
uninstall an app again there's no way to

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:18.980
uninstall an app again there's no way to
 

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.680
uninstall an app again there's no way to
unregister it so what'll happen is the

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:20.690
unregister it so what'll happen is the
 

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.070
unregister it so what'll happen is the
very next time you send a GCM or CT diem

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080
very next time you send a GCM or CT diem
 

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.200
very next time you send a GCM or CT diem
message to the device it'll try and

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.210
message to the device it'll try and
 

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.020
message to the device it'll try and
deliver it the delivery will fail and at

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.030
deliver it the delivery will fail and at
 

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.970
deliver it the delivery will fail and at
that point we mark the device is

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:30.980
that point we mark the device is
 

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.890
that point we mark the device is
unregistered and if you try any more

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:32.900
unregistered and if you try any more
 

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.540
unregistered and if you try any more
messages after that then you'll actually

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:34.550
messages after that then you'll actually
 

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.250
messages after that then you'll actually
get a failure on the server end as well

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:36.260
get a failure on the server end as well
 

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.290
get a failure on the server end as well
right oh it's very much a lazy

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:38.300
right oh it's very much a lazy
 

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.670
right oh it's very much a lazy
deregistration once we realize the

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:39.680
deregistration once we realize the
 

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.200
deregistration once we realize the
device just doesn't exist and we can't

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.210
device just doesn't exist and we can't
 

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.190
device just doesn't exist and we can't
address it anymore yeah so yeah even

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200
address it anymore yeah so yeah even
 

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.930
address it anymore yeah so yeah even
internally we you know we run into those

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:46.940
internally we you know we run into those
 

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.880
internally we you know we run into those
same security considerations and have to

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:48.890
same security considerations and have to
 

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.610
same security considerations and have to
walk around them but at the end result I

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.620
walk around them but at the end result I
 

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.020
walk around them but at the end result I
don't think is actually any worse of a

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.030
don't think is actually any worse of a
 

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.790
don't think is actually any worse of a
user experience it still looks exactly

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:54.800
user experience it still looks exactly
 

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.970
user experience it still looks exactly
as it should yeah so the i guess the

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:57.980
as it should yeah so the i guess the
 

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.280
as it should yeah so the i guess the
summary would be others there's no way

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.290
summary would be others there's no way
 

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.350
summary would be others there's no way
to receive a message when the app is

to receive a message when the app is
uninstalled you can send a heartbeat

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:04.580
uninstalled you can send a heartbeat
 

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.460
uninstalled you can send a heartbeat
from your app and then assume it's been

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:06.470
from your app and then assume it's been
 

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.020
from your app and then assume it's been
uninstalled as soon as you stop

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.030
uninstalled as soon as you stop
 

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.390

the uninstall by itself might not be a

the uninstall by itself might not be a
good enough reason to deregister the

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.090
good enough reason to deregister the
 

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.520
good enough reason to deregister the
user and wipe their data from your

yeah oh it actually go so far as to say
it's possible to design your app such

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:14.560
possible to use n SD and query services
 

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.220
possible to use n SD and query services
over Wi-Fi direct at the same time so

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:17.230
over Wi-Fi direct at the same time so
 

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.350
over Wi-Fi direct at the same time so
yeah that's that's entirely possible NSD

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360
yeah that's that's entirely possible NSD
 

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.650

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.930
will work over any any TCP connection
and Wi-Fi direct is it is a TCP

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:24.940
and Wi-Fi direct is it is a TCP
 

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.090
and Wi-Fi direct is it is a TCP

buzzard collision here yeah there's a

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:46.780
buzzard collision here yeah there's a
 

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.590
buzzard collision here yeah there's a
bit of confusion in that there's network

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600
bit of confusion in that there's network
 

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.390

service discovery works over a network

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:51.400
service discovery works over a network
 

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.370
service discovery works over a network
it's find everything that's on the same

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:53.380
it's find everything that's on the same
 

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.530
it's find everything that's on the same
network as you are separately from that

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:55.540
network as you are separately from that
 

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.630
network as you are separately from that
there's service discovery over Wi-Fi

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:57.640
there's service discovery over Wi-Fi
 

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.880
there's service discovery over Wi-Fi
direct which is find stuff when you're

00:32:59.880 --> 00:32:59.890
direct which is find stuff when you're
 

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.360
direct which is find stuff when you're
not connected to a network now the when

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:03.370
not connected to a network now the when
 

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.550
not connected to a network now the when
NSD comes into play is if you use Wi-Fi

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:05.560
NSD comes into play is if you use Wi-Fi
 

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.490
NSD comes into play is if you use Wi-Fi
direct and you then connect to a network

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:08.500
direct and you then connect to a network
 

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.340
direct and you then connect to a network
or so I use Wi-Fi direct to sort of

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:11.350
or so I use Wi-Fi direct to sort of
 

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.380
or so I use Wi-Fi direct to sort of
create an ad hoc network between a bunch

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:13.390
create an ad hoc network between a bunch
 

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:17.730
create an ad hoc network between a bunch
of different devices at that point n SD

network service discovery comes into
 

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.640
network service discovery comes into
effect because there's a network for it

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:20.650

then you'll use NSD the proper nst that

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.060
then you'll use NSD the proper nst that
 

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.670

outside of Wi-Fi direct if you're on a
normal regular Wi-Fi network you use the

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:42.850
normal regular Wi-Fi network you use the
 

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.390
normal regular Wi-Fi network you use the
