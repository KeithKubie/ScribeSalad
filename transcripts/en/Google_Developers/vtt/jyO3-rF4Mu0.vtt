NOAH FALSTEIN: Hello, everybody.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.180
Welcome.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.250
So this is our Growing
Games at Google session.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.920
I'm glad to see so
many people here

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.650
who are interested in games.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm Noah Falstein.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.210
I'm our Chief Game
Designer here at Google.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.430
I'm also a member of the
Scalable Developer Advocacy

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.930
Group.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.770
I'm here today to
give you a big picture

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.090
of just some of the
many ways that Google

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.900
supports game development.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.946
And also, we have a
couple of my colleagues

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:40.570
here to go a little
bit more into depth

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.580
in some of the areas where we
have some new developments.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.320
And I'll try to touch on some
of the stuff that was also

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.640
covered at the keynote here
at which I will be ad libbing.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.580
So forgive me.

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.260
For those of you who
are coming to see Duncan

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080
Curtis because
you're Duncan's fans,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.660
he's chickened out
for the measly excuse

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.700
that at any moment he
be called away to attend

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.209
the birth of his first baby.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.307
But what the hell.

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:10.650
We still love you Duncan.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.210
So how many of you
are game developers?

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.061
Professional?

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:14.560
Wow.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.270
That's great.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940
Looks like more
than half the room.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.540
And I take it most
of the rest of you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.250
are probably game players?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.797
OK.

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:22.130
Well, you're in the right place.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.240
Let's get going.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.360
I've been a professional
game developer since 1980.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.090
And in all that time,
I've only seen really

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.010
one constant in this industry.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.260
And that's been the change that
it goes through so quickly.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.000
So we've grown from this
tiny little hobbyist

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.960
market where we were putting
floppy disks in Ziploc bags

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.830
with printed out
pages of instructions

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.710
to this huge industry where it
touches on almost everybody who

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.570
uses information technology.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.600
It's just been amazing to
see the growth over time.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.560
And really, there's no
sign of it slowing down.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.650
I've never, in fact, seen as
much promise in the industry

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.720
is there is right now.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.250
If you just think
about everything

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.410
that's going on with consoles,
mobile, web, new growth areas

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.979
like wearables and VR,
everything is thriving.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.170
And we're supporting all
those things here at Google.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.010
But any support
system for something

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.980
as complex and multifaceted as
the games industry has become

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.480
can be a little bit
hard to picture.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.938
You've got a lot
of things plugging

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:27.230
into other things and things
that depend on other things.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.330
So describing what
we do here at Google

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.710
is similarly complex at times.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.160
We've got hardware, operating
systems, software packages,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740
and services to
describe that all

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.510
interconnect in all these ways.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.070
But the nice thing is that
we in the games industry

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.480
have a long history
of having to describe

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.170
these kind of complex things.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.220
You think about build trees
or technology trees, skills

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.050
or magic abilities
that are associated

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.830
with different character
classes, it's the kind of thing

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.360
that we do all
the time in games.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.870
So if you'll excuse me
for going a bit meta,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.020
let me talk about applying
that analogy here to Google.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.570
I think it's really,
generally, pretty appropriate

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.030
because, as game developers,
we're all really on quests

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.252
in the work that we do.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.210
We're trying to build
the game, and in the way,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.290
we have battles with bugs--
sometimes giant bugs--

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.240
and deadline dragons.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.450
We're all after that fabled
golden chest of loot at the end

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.965
and want to survive to be
able to launch our next quest

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:24.530
and keep going.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.560
So think of Google as supplying
the equipment, the armor

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.580
to level up your skills.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.840
And whether you're just a
level seven coder, looking

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.290
for a new API to arm
yourself, or maybe

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.570
you're a level 20 game
producer and you're

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.210
trying to map your
path to the fabled land

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.620
of mobile engagement.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.060
Maybe you're a
demi-CEO and you're

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.120
in search of a
monetization spell.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.250
We can help you here.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.410
So this is a rather
schematic skill tree.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.540
Unlike games, where one thing
directly depends on another,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.840
it's a bit more
complex here at Google.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.730
So I'm keeping it simple.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.710
But if you picture the operating
systems and the hardware

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.200
platforms that run your games
as your choice of a character

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.960
faction or a hero a class,
and the services that we

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.350
offer as skills, or
spells, or power ups,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.850
you'll find it easier to
see which ones of those

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.870
apply to you, and your games,
and your game development,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.320
and be able to mix and
match as you go along.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.279
So let me go through
some of these.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.160
For each of these
services as power ups,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.600
I'm going to be
showing cards here

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.250
that will talk about
aspects of game development

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.200
they help, whether it's
building your game,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.940
growing your audience,
engaging that audience,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.490
or monetizing the game.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.140
So let's start with
the operating systems.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.810
The Android OS.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.380
We give you the API libraries
and the software tools

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.220
necessary to build, test,
and debug your game.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.780
And Android's reach
is just enormous.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.666
Every day, over a million new
Android devices are activated.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.540
With Chrome, you can
build cutting edge games

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.370
for the web that use tools
to make it scalable and easy

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.260
to deploy, able to run
on multiple platforms.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.760
And the Chrome Web Store
helps the interested users

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.630
to find your games.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.320
And then we have all the devices
that these games can run on.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.310
Android phones and tablets are
the largest potential platform

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.510
for games worldwide, with
over a billion installations.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.780
Just think about a
billion installations out

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.270
there will be seeing games
with a billion players

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.470
at some point in the future.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.430
Last year, we
announced Android Wear.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.410
You can include
wearables, like watches,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.630
as part of your game's
notification system.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.100
Or as we saw with some
of the great new things

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.010
going on at the keynote,
watches themselves are really

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.500
an interesting,
standalone device

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.820
to consider running games on.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.150
There's just so much you
can do with them now.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.110
And also to go to a bigger
screen, we have Android TV.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.620
You can engage players with a
variety of hardware solutions

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.120
there.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.610
It's out on a lot of
televisions that are coming out

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.010
in the very near future.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.830
And now, we also are adding
games built for Chromecast

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.500
to join Android's
living room story.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.820
More detail on a moment from
Nathan here about Cast games.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.470
Google cardboard was featured
quite a bit at the keynote

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.650
and very exciting.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.210
I really think that
this as an area

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.890
that we're going to see a lot
of growth in in the near future.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.440
It's our inexpensive VR solution
announced just last year

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.740
at I/O. And now as you've heard,
we have over a million units

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.440
already in the
hands of the public.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.880
And think about that kind
of blue ocean out there.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.650
If you're a small
game developer,

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.130
and you want to
create something that

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.730
goes out to over a
million potential users

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.750
and is inexpensive
to develop for,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.970
cardboard is a great
choice for you.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.740
So you should check out
their talks and their display

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.580
here at Moscone
for more updates.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.260
They've got some great
stuff that they're showing.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.290
And developers
have already begun

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.560
to explore new terrain with
our Project Tango devices.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.320
They use a human scale
awareness of their surroundings

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.299
to engage players with
entirely new types of games.

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:55.840
How many have you have been over
in the Project Tango section

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.548
and seen some of the
games they're doing?

00:06:57.548 --> 00:07:00.660
Well, I hope that all of
you get a chance to catch it

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.850
by tomorrow because they've
got some wonderful games

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.890
and non-game apps.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.730
But Tango is really
going to shine

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.240
for a lot of entertainment
applications there.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.190
So those operating systems
running on our hardware

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.860
platforms can support a really
wide variety of services.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.150
And they're, as I said,
the equivalent of power ups

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.960
to provide that kind of
enchanting Google magic you

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.000
want to put in your games.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.670
So for example, we've
got Google Play.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.850
The Google Play Store--
every month, Android users

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.360
download more than 1.5
billion apps and games.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.130
And the user ratings and
rankings on the Play Store

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.817
can generate buzz to
engage your users.

00:07:40.817 --> 00:07:43.150
You can place ads for your
game right in the Play Store.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.960
And you can sell your
apps in over 190 countries

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.440
and territories worldwide.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.640
So tremendous reach there.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.060
And to go along with
that, Play Games Services

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.480
is a really versatile
package we have that

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.500
helps you build better games.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.960
Just some of the
things it can do

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.850
include achievements,
leaderboards, Cloud Save.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.990
It's got real time multiplayer
and quests for your mobie--

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.060
and that's Android,
or iOS, and web games.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.380
And it lets you track specific
game events so that you

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.500
can analyze micro-gameplay
and patterns

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.199
and tune your game very well.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.490
So as a designer, I find that
particularly interesting.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.950
You can get down to a very
deep level with what Play Games

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.800
Services provides for you.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.860
And a lot of that stuff is
very powerful and easy to use.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.460
Play Games has grown
to 450 million users

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.970
since we launched it
at I/O two years ago,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.669
with 185 million users added
in just the past six months.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.309
And it's the fastest growing
mobile gaming platform

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.382
in history.

00:08:39.382 --> 00:08:41.340
We'll be hearing a lot
more about this from Ben

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.620
in a few minutes.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.480
But until then, let's move on.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.910
I mentioned Google
Cloud Services.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.700
It enables developers to build,
test, and deploy applications

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.686
on our highly scalable and
reliable infrastructure.

00:08:53.686 --> 00:08:55.310
You can choose from
computing, storage,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.110
and applications services
for your web, mobile,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.640
and back-end
solutions with cloud.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.502
Then Google Analytics.

00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:04.960
The best way to
grow your audiences

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.560
is really to know who's playing
your game and on what devices

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.640
and where they come from.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.080
So with Analytics, you
can help your designers

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.450
identify bottlenecks in
flow and improve gameplay.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.230
And the next few
power up services

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.040
specifically focus on
increasing your bottom line.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.540
For example, AdMob and
the Google Display Network

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.320
that can extend
your reach can help

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.690
you place ads in mobile
apps and on sites

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.946
across the web to more users.

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:33.320
You can earn revenue with
advertising from over a million

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.000
Google advertisers, or
grow your in-app purchasing

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.870
by bringing your
best users back.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.800
And DoubleClick.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.870
It's another chance to let you
take your in-game advertising

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.090
to the next level, across all
the screens with ad management

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:46.770
tools.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.740
You can integrate
with top ad networks

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.900
to maximize revenue and
create a gamer friendly ad

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.580
experience with things like the
TrueView skippable video ads

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.280
that give a better ad
experience for the gamers,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.500
and also that means higher
monetization for you

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.200
because they're having more
fun and not as frustrated.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.990
Advertising with
AdWords allows you

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.210
to reach new players
at the precise moment

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.050
that they're searching
for your games.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.760
And last, but
definitely not least,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.080
we've got YouTube that satisfies
gamers' hunger for video.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.550
You've got 95% of
gamers who turn

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.340
to YouTube for entertainment
and information in the moments

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.710
that matter to them.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.110
And you can drive engagement,
grow your player base

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.640
with YouTube by allowing
players to easily upload

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.160
and share their
game capture videos.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.940
So that's it for now.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.760
We're adding more
services all the time.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.720
And I really haven't even
hit everything in depth.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.500
We offer a really
thorough and varied set

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.030
of platforms and services that
can help build your games,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.420
grow your audience, engage
them with these great features,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.510
and monetize your content.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.820
So here's a link,
developer.google.com/games,

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.510
that gives you more information
on how you can start to play

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.420
with these power ups and win
at this meta-game of game

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.470
development.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.370
And now I'm not going
to test your patience

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.340
by going into depth in
each of these things

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.530
or testing you on what I've
just been talking about,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.904
but we are going
to tell you more

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:08.854
about two very specific areas.

00:11:08.854 --> 00:11:10.770
We're going to start
with the Nathan Camarillo

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.160
here from the Google Cast team.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.034
He's going to tell you
about the new services

00:11:14.034 --> 00:11:16.230
available to developers
from Google Cast.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.014
Nathan.

00:11:18.014 --> 00:11:21.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.940
NATHAN CAMARILLO: Thanks Noah.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.660
Hi, everybody.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.560
And Hello, everybody on the
internet that's watching.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.670
I'm here today to talk you guys.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.090
Modern mobile devices are
amazing tools for gaming.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.512
They give you this great
experience right on the screen.

00:11:37.512 --> 00:11:39.220
And they have a ton
of sensors to capture

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.830
your touch and gestures to
enhance your gaming experience.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.480
With all this technology
that you have,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.063
wouldn't it be great
if you could just

00:11:46.063 --> 00:11:48.860
experience the fun of playing
a game in the same room

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.300
as your friends?

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.230
With Google Cast games, you
can recapture that magic

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.284
of sitting down in
your house and playing

00:11:55.284 --> 00:11:56.950
a game in the same
room as your friends,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.200
all on your own devices
connected to a really

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.930
big screen with great audio.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.980
My name is Nathan
Camarillo, a Product Manager

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.752
on the Google Cast team.

00:12:05.752 --> 00:12:08.210
And today, I want to tell you
more about these technologies

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.870
and some of the great
improvements our team has

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.620
made recently to enable new
experiences in the living room.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.930
Goog Cast is designed to
use your mobile device

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.880
to drive experiences on
home entertainment devices.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.240
For example, we see a 45%
increase in YouTube watch time

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.390
upon a Chromecast activation.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.620
And Chromecast is
really easy to use.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.310
You just pick the content
using the apps you already

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.030
know and love, you
tap the Cast button,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.675
and you enjoy the
content on your TV.

00:12:37.675 --> 00:12:40.220
It's pretty easy.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.500
Our first product
was the Chromecast,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.600
which has sold over
17 million units,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.970
and was the top selling
streaming device, including

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.610
streaming boxes, in 2014.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.780
We're building a larger
ecosystem of devices,

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.250
from televisions
to set-top boxes

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.370
and streaming devices for audio.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.740
This year, we rolled out
audio devices powered

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.580
by Google Cast for audio.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.420
And Chromecast continues
to see tremendous success.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.030
Here at I/O 2015,
we'll show you how

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.546
we're improving
the Cast experience

00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:11.420
by unlocking even more
opportunities for game

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.250
developers.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.840
And what does that mean for
you as a game developer?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.130
Across Google Cast,
when games and apps

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.760
are connected to the TV, we see
increased engagement, stronger

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.050
monetization, and
because the living room

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.210
is inherently social, you have
multiplayer games that result

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.140
in more downloads for you.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.800
Because you can utilize the
power of a mobile device,

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.740
all the power of that
platform, like payments,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.130
already exist and
are available to you.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.240
Just a few months
ago, in November 2014,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.390
we released our first wave
of games for Google Cast.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.480
These games are really
fun, and we worked closely

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.460
with some great partners
to make those games happen.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.043
Some of those partners
are here today,

00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:50.459
which I'm very happy about.

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:53.000
I want to take a little bit of
time to talk about these games

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.155
because they're really
great examples of how

00:13:55.155 --> 00:13:57.530
to design a Cast game, in case
you didn't get to try them

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.674
yourself.

00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:02.520
If you played any of these
games, especially Just Dance

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.460
Now by Ubisoft,
I've expect you've

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.750
got some good moves by now.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.790
As for the Cast team,
well-- as a group

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.179
we're better at dancing than
we were a few months ago.

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:14.470
But this is a game that really
uses your mobile devices

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.510
sensors to detect
how you're moving,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.010
or whether you're just standing
there and pumping your fist,

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.593
or you're like really
getting involved

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:23.280
in using your whole body.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.480
Classic family fun
is also a great theme

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.844
for Google Cast games.

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:28.510
That's why we worked
closely with Hasbro

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.960
to bring adaptations of some
of your favorite board games

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.324
to the big screen.

00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:35.365
If dancing isn't your
thing, maybe SCRABBLE Blitz

00:14:35.365 --> 00:14:37.170
is more your speed.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.730
It's fast.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.487
It's intense.

00:14:39.487 --> 00:14:41.570
And guess what, you actually
have to spell things.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.070
There's no AutoCorrect
here to help you out.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.510
We also have other
classic brands

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.152
like CONNECT 4 Quads, Monopoly
Dash, and SIMON Swipe.

00:14:49.152 --> 00:14:51.110
You should check out some
of these great games.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.982
They really are
fun for all ages.

00:14:53.982 --> 00:14:55.690
And game shows are
really fun too, right?

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.090
You guys like game shows.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.640
If you think about it,
almost every great game show

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.750
has some sort of big
board full of fun

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.497
and prizes and surprises.

00:15:03.497 --> 00:15:05.330
When we worked with
Sony Pictures Television

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.030
on Wheel of Fortune,
we saw how much fun

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.120
that could be to use
your TV as the big board

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.000
while controlling the game
with your mobile device.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.410
By using a game show
format for your design,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.670
you too can play at home.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.425
You might not win a
giant bundle of cash

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:19.340
or win a lifetime
supply of shaving cream,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.950
but you will have a lot of fun.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.102
We also had developers
making games on their own

00:15:24.102 --> 00:15:25.560
and publishing them
to Google Play.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.550
It's really that
easy to make a game.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.987
We noticed a game called Emoji
Party for Chromecast by Troido

00:15:30.987 --> 00:15:33.320
And we reached out to them
and worked with them directly

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.380
to fully utilize
the Cast experience.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.370
It's a fun game where these
movie titles pop up on the TV.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.479
And they're all
encoded in Emoji speak.

00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:42.770
You compete with your friends
to see who can guess them

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.061
first and earn the most points.

00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:46.240
And in this game in
particular, ten players

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.765
are connected at the same
time through one television.

00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:51.610
Can anybody guess
what this one is?

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.110
Yeah, okay.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.130
This is a easy one.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.220
Planet of the Apes.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.306
These types of
games go a long way

00:15:58.306 --> 00:16:00.180
toward fulfilling a
dream for game developers

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.230
to enable people to
play games on their TVs

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.350
without expensive game consoles.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.739
These games are great for
Cast-- all these ones I just

00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:07.280
talked about.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.320
They're social, they utilize
the phones and tablets

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.770
people already love
using, and they're

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.620
surprising in the fun way
that they achieve game play

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.379
with simple, accessible design.

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:20.920
If you're interested in learning
more about the core concepts

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.820
and principles of designing
great games for Google Cast,

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.830
check out the talk
that I'm giving called

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.210
Designing Games for Google
Cast here at I/O tomorrow

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.134
at 9:00 AM in alcove two.

00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:32.550
And all the games
I just discussed

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.820
were made using the Google
Cast SDK we released last year.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.460
They use a model we call
a Receiver Cast Game.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.040
An app running on the sender,
which is your mobile device,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.730
connects to a
receiver device, which

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.560
is any device like a
Chromecast, and passes along

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.160
the information the
receiver needs to load

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.300
the game from the cloud.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.980
In a typical
Chromecast application,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.355
like a video on demand app, this
is a really simple transaction.

00:16:56.355 --> 00:16:57.730
But when you make
a game, there's

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.370
a lot of interaction
that's going on.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.180
And it's going to happen
between multiple devices or web

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.282
browsers.

00:17:03.282 --> 00:17:05.740
During our partnership with
the titles I mentioned earlier,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.339
we found one big
way that we could

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.200
and help to improve
the game development

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.215
experience for developers.

00:17:12.215 --> 00:17:14.589
That's why here at I/O, we're
announcing the game manager

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.660
APIs for Google Cast.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.990
The game manager APIs
make it faster and easier

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.810
for game developers,
like yourself,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.619
to Cast-enable their apps across
all the devices we support,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.020
which is Android, iOS,
and Chrome browsers,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.660
and get those devices connected
to a Chromecast or Android TV.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.620
All the synchronization
between players

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.530
is handled through
the Cast receiver,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.650
which is the Chromecast.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.730
It acts like a
server for the match,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.230
and will store all
the game state,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.660
and take the role of pushing
notifications to the devices

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.997
when new information
is available.

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.080
We're excited to see what
kind of innovative games

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.750
you'll create and build
using the game manager

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.110
APIs for Google Cast.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.290
And now it's even faster and
easier than it was before.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.665
If you want to
hear more details,

00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:55.998
check out the box talks we
have going on tomorrow called

00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.535
Game Manager APIs for Google
Cast, where our engineers will

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.840
walk you through the
implementation of Google Cast

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.789
Managers APIs.

00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:05.580
Also be sure to check
out our sandbox booth

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.010
on the third floor to check
out demos of the games I just

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.940
mentioned and some other ones
that we have in development,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.590
Catch Phrase by Hasbro and
Tricky Titans by MediaMonks.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.360
In Catch Phrase,
the classic game

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.210
comes to Cast as two player
stand in front of the screen

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.871
and everyone in the room can
see the catch phrase on the TV.

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:26.120
I don't know if you saw us
playing this earlier today.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.505
Everyone goes crazy shouting
clues at the guessers

00:18:28.505 --> 00:18:29.880
and points are
scored by pressing

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.449
a button on the mobile device.

00:18:31.449 --> 00:18:33.240
You can expect this
one to be fun and loud.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.350
So please come play
it with us upstairs.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.900
MediaMonks created
a fun game called

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.600
Tricky Titan with great visuals
and strategic turn based

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.480
game play.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.300
These giant titans are
sitting on top of villages

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.240
and they use large shovels
to scoop up houses and people

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.810
and throw them at each other.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.831
It's really clever.

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.330
Both games are in development
and are using the Game Manager

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.506
APIs already.

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:57.880
Now you might be
asking yourself,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.070
we have this giant
TV, a Chromecast,

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.940
and an amazing
computer in our pocket.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.600
Couldn't we do a
little bit more?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.000
Well, of course we can.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.339
That's why we created the Remote
Display APIs for Google Cast.

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:11.630
There are millions of mobile
devices with powerful GPUs

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.130
and sensors ready to send
amazing interactive content

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.250
to the largest
screen in the home.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.140
With the Remote Display
APIs for Google Cast,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.650
this is now possible.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.390
Remote Display for
Android and iOS

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.700
allows app developers
to take full advantage

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.814
of the multiscreen
Google Cast model.

00:19:27.814 --> 00:19:29.480
This is really important
and it supports

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.050
one of our key principles
of cross platform

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.050
compatibility for Google Cast.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.784
Whether you and your friends
own an Android device or an iOS

00:19:37.784 --> 00:19:39.450
device and they come
over to your house,

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.560
you can all play
together and have fun.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.030
So integrating
Remote Display means

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.810
you can harness all of those
increasingly powerful CPUs

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.940
and GPUs in your phone and
build dual display games

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.170
were you use the phone to
render both a local display

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.490
and a virtual one.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.790
And we handle sending the
virtual display directly

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.300
to the large screen
via our Cast protocol.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.770
As a developer, that means
bigger games, more screens,

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.900
and more fun.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.210
With a remote display,
you trigger the experience

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.354
directly from within
your game or app.

00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:09.770
It follows the
same simple model I

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.220
discussed earlier of all our
Google Cast interactions.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.480
Just tap the Cast button and go.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.854
It increases the
discoverability of the feature

00:20:16.854 --> 00:20:18.270
and it's a big
difference compared

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.790
to competing technologies.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.370
You don't have to rely on the
player to exit the app or game

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.310
and turn on some
system level feature.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.680
They can have the experience
you intended them to have.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.410
For example, in Ubisoft's
racing game, Driver Speedboat

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.760
Paradise, you can blast
through dangerous waves

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.520
and jump off ramps to
fly through the air

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.380
and perform impressive stunts.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.730
The team uses cutting edge 3D
graphics, Triple A effects,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.750
and HD textures on a mobile
device sent across the room

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.770
to your screen.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.470
And speedboat racing
is a lot of fun,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.460
but maybe you'd like
a nice game of tennis.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.900
Rolocule has this
fun casual tennis

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.290
game called Motion Tennis.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.630
You hold the phone in
your hand like a tennis

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.838
racquet and swing your arm
to choose the type of shot

00:20:55.838 --> 00:20:57.610
to make next.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.490
It's fun, intuitive, and
great for multiple players,

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.610
but you need to hold
on to your phone tight.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.530
If you're an inventor,
you might want

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.624
to consider making some
really cool phone strap

00:21:07.624 --> 00:21:09.790
technology or something
because in the coming years,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.590
I think the screen
repair guys are going

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.360
to love this remote display
technology as things

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.430
fly across the room.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.930
And we've all heard
the phrase, when

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.650
pigs fly, and for many
of us, myself included,

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.080
that's especially true
about going to the gym.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.090
Now with Fitflap!

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.522
by BreakFirst,
you can play games

00:21:25.522 --> 00:21:26.730
and get fit at the same time.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.850
And this really works.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.124
I was in some pain
from testing this game.

00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:31.540
The game is really
cool because it

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.760
uses image recognition
and the front

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.160
facing camera on the
phone to control the pig.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.930
You really flap your
arms and make the pig fly

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.240
and collect coins while
dodging obstacles.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.040
And I could tell you everybody
at the office had fun laughing

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.270
at me when I demoed this
to them for the first time.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.640
And you really have to get your
pig, which is me, in shape.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.000
So in between flights, you
can go dance with your pig

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.870
or run in place while your
pig runs on the treadmill.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.450
And just like these games,
your real creative genius

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.310
shows itself when you combine
great social multiplayer

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.722
with the power of mobile
devices and the big screen.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:06.180
Come check these games out on
the third floor in the Google

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.740
Cast area.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.550
You can create new games or
even extend your existing games

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:14.610
and applications with the
Google Cast Remote Display APIs.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.380
When you do it all right, you
have an entirely new living

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.810
room experience
and players really

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:19.864
get involved in the game.

00:22:19.864 --> 00:22:22.030
We've seen this happen with
several great Cast games

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.529
already.

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:24.320
And we want yours to be next.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.120
So visit
developers.google.com/cast

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.680
to learn more as we roll this
out on all platforms over

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.184
the next few days.

00:22:31.184 --> 00:22:33.600
Be sure to check out our three
sequential box talks, which

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.560
will be repeated
two times tomorrow

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.520
called Designing
Games For Google Cast,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.145
Game Manager APIs
for Google Cast,

00:22:39.145 --> 00:22:41.650
and Google Cast Remote
Display for Games

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.470
starting at 9:00 and 3:00
PM tomorrow in alcove two

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.654
on the second floor.

00:22:46.654 --> 00:22:48.070
On our developer
site, we're going

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.620
to provide you with
the receiver SDKs,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.420
the sender SDKs for
Android, iOS, and Chrome,

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.870
sample games that help you get
started, game debugger apps

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:01.050
and debug UI for the receiver,
UX guidelines for Cast games,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.110
and all the SDK
documentation and reference.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.740
So we really want
to help you out.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.250
Make sure to check out all the
demos that I mentioned before

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.600
because there's so many
unexplored games just waiting

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.750
to be created to inspire and
excite millions of gamers.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.870
After I/O, please go
make something awesome.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.136
Thank you.

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:21.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:22.545 --> 00:23:24.170
NOAH FALSTEIN: Thanks
very much Nathan.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.300
And next up is Ben Frenkel
from Play Games Services

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.830
to tell you what's
new in that area.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.740
BENJAMIN FRENKEL:
Thank you Noah.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.460
So I'm Ben Frenkel, Product
Manager on the Play Games team.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.950
And my focus is on
developer experiences.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.370
And I'm going to cover three
exciting topics for you

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.160
in the next 15 minutes.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.880
So first of all, I want to cover
the mission of the Play Games

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.810
Services team.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.270
Two, what services we
provide developers.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.450
And three, the impact
of those services.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.650
And to help you better
understand the Play Games

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:04.950
mission, I want to start with
the story of Eric Froemling.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.079
Eric is, in fact, here
today in the audience.

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:09.370
And I will embarrass him by
pointing him out over here.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.825
So just wave to the crowd, Eric.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.900
And Eric is the archetype
of the type of developer

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.630
we want to help with
Play Games Services.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.260
He's a one man army that
does literally everything

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.680
for his game BombSquad.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.720
And like all great
game developers,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.630
Eric has a passion for making
awesome player experiences.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.260
That's what is gift is.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.510
But to turn that passion into
a sustainable, successful

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.550
business, he needs to
think about BombSquad

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.730
as an ongoing service
he delivers to players.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.420
And when we look for inspiration
from the large, successful

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.180
developers who already manage
their game as a service--

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.740
well, in addition to
making awesome games, which

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.780
is a prerequisite to
any type of success,

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.750
we observe they do five
things exceptionally well.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.730
They have cost efficient
ways to acquire players.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.600
They think of their business
as a day to day battle.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.530
And they rigorously set
and manage their business

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.840
to daily revenue targets.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.300
They're advanced
users of analytics

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.370
that help them identify hotspots
in their business metrics

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.130
so they know what
to focus on, what

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.374
metrics they need to improve.

00:25:29.374 --> 00:25:30.790
And they have a
deep understanding

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.980
of what's working and not
working for their players.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.320
And almost without exception,
large, successful developers

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.180
who manage their
game as a service

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.730
have made major
investments in tools

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.240
that allow them to dynamically
make changes to their game

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.320
and deliver new
content to players.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.000
And large studios will
have an army of people

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.570
to support each of
these functions.

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.730
So here's an example.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.390
They'll have large
teams of developers

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.180
to focus on game
development, obviously,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.260
data scientists to work in
analytics, live operation

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:13.600
support teams, marketing and
UA specialists, and so on.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.690
So our mission is
to bridge the gap

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:20.510
between what the large studios
can do with an army behind them

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.590
and what the Erics of the world
can do, possibly just a one man

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.880
army.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.820
And we've made significant
investments and progress

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.240
towards this goal.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.260
Today, Play provide
services across the board,

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.110
from pre-registration, which
I'll talk about in a bit,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.890
to help with user acquisition
to business management

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.640
tools in the developer
console, like Player Analytics,

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.340
to our suite of
core game services,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.960
like quests, and achievements,
and leaderboards,

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.990
and multiplayer to keep players
engaged with new contents

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.710
and goals.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:02.230
And these services have had
a major impact on developers.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.560
And today, I'll just go
through a couple of examples

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.760
to show you.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.230
So let's start with
Player Analytics.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.890
It's a set of reports
in the developer console

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.795
that we launched at GDC
earlier in the year.

00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:17.920
And throughout the development
of Player Analytics,

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.710
we worked very
closely with Eric,

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.350
the developer of BombSquad,
who I mentioned earlier.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.890
And as we integrated over
different prototypes,

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.800
we discovered we needed
a deeper understanding

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.640
of BombSquad's in-game economy.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.300
So we developed something called
the Sources and Sinks Report.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.590
The Sources and
Sinks Report helps

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.170
developers understand
the relationship

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.300
between the rate at which
players earn a premium

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.300
currency, like gold coins,
or emeralds, or tickets

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.760
in Eric's case, and the rate
at which players consume that.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.020
In an ideal world,
the rate at which

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:58.050
a player earns currency and
consumes currency roughly

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.875
nets out to zero.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.520
And when we shared
this report with Eric,

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.850
he discovered that he
was giving away tickets

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.110
at a higher rate than
people could consume them.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.960
And with that
information in hand,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.550
he identified a
number of changes

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.030
that would bring his game
economy back into balance.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.420
And after he made those
changes, the impact

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.890
could be seen almost immediately
in the Sources and Sinks

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.670
Report, which you can see here.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.960
The ratios flipped.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.100
And a few weeks later, average
revenue per daily active user

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.590
more than doubled.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:39.160
And average revenue per paying
user grew by almost 70%.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:45.670
That's almost unheard of impact
in such a short period of time.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.440
And in Eric's own
words, "Player Analytics

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.960
has helped me home in on
BombSquad's shortcomings, right

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.900
the ship, and get to a point
where I can financially

00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.230
justify making the
games I want to make."

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.440
And what we launched at
GCD is just the start.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.340
We're going to
continue to invest

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.990
with new reports, new players
segments, new metrics,

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.300
new event types to make Player
Analytics even more powerful

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.740
for developers.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.140
But we all know that
insights by themselves

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.550
don't move the needle
for your games.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.180
You actually need to be able
to make updates to your game

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.590
to improving engagement,
retention, and monetization.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.870
And that's why we
launched Quest last year,

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.450
which provides developers a
way to dynamically deliver

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.290
new content to players without
requiring those players

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.640
to update their games.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.510
And that brings us
to our second case

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.140
study about concrete software.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.030
In fact, we have another
special guest here today,

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.450
Keith from Concrete Software.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.632
Wave your hand everybody.

00:29:52.632 --> 00:29:54.090
Also a round of
applause for Keith.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.182
And Concrete software
is another great example

00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:03.640
of the type of developer we
want to support with Play Games

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.870
Services.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.180
They've been making mobile
games for over a decade,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.890
and they've seen great success.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.200
But they're still
a small company.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.780
And every minute they spend on
server infrastructure, server

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.060
side code, hosting,
and maintenance

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.620
is a minute they could
be spending on the things

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.930
that they are most passionate
about, which is making games.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.190
And that's where Games
Services comes in--

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.720
and Quest in particular.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.100
And Concrete has an
exemplary implementation

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.530
of Quest in their flagship
title, PBA Bowling they

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.910
follow all of our best practices
to a t to great effect.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.800
And they've made
Quest an integral part

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.710
of their live
operation strategy.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.530
And to help you understand
the degree to which they've

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.545
incorporated quests in to
their day to day operations,

00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:54.210
I'd like to show
you and walk you

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:57.510
through the calendar promotions
from earlier in the year.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.760
So as you can see here,
Concrete launches new content

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.600
multiple times a week
to keep players engaged.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.560
And Quest played a critical
role in each of these launches.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.920
For example, on January 7
here, a new bowling ball,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.730
the Hammer Black
Widow Legend, which

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:22.340
is a very impressive, possibly
even scary bowling ball,

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.180
was launched.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.120
And along with the ball,
they ran an ad in the game,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.470
they promoted it
through social media,

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.265
they pushed notifications,
and, very importantly,

00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:35.640
they had a Quest to support
the launch of the new content

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.720
as well.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.730
And the reason why they've made
Quest such an integral part

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.910
of their live
operation strategy is

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.990
because Quest produced a
measurable, material impact

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.890
on player engagement.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.700
They found users, on the
day that they accepted

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.270
a Quest, played close
to 15% more sessions,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.240
and that the impact was sticky.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.260
And they observed close to 4%
more sessions in the following

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.590
days.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:07.360
And Quests are just the
start of our live operation

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.790
strategy on the Play
Games Services team.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.390
We're going to
continue to invest

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.390
in tools that support dynamic
content updates, to make

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:17.080
your game feel more
alive and engaging,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.250
tools to allow you to respond
to changing player needs,

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.720
and tools that allow you
to create more personalized

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:28.180
and fun user experiences
tailored to every player.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.660
And everything I
just mentioned is

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:36.530
available for free to anybody
that integrates Games Services.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.980
Finally, making
a successful game

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.600
is still really,
really hard to do.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.500
It's a lot of work.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.780
No doubt about it.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.030
But with services like
Player Analytics and Quest,

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.770
integrating Play Games
Services is a great first step

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.570
to success.

00:32:56.447 --> 00:32:58.030
So to learn more
about Games Services,

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.886
you go to our-- I won't touch
that microphone anymore.

00:33:02.886 --> 00:33:04.260
You can go to out
developer site.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.210
And on our developer
site, you can find out

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.050
SDKs for Android, iOS.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.520
We have a cross platform
C plus SDK as well.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.550
We have a Unity plug-in.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.277
So whatever tool
you use, you'll be

00:33:15.277 --> 00:33:16.860
able to integrate
Play Games Services.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.020
We have samples, best practices
guidelines, more case studies,

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.440
and all the SDK
documentation references

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.670
you could ever possibly want.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.220
So now I'm going to switch
gears and talk about something

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.250
called pre-registration.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.070
This is what Duncan was
supposed to talk about.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.160
But I will be
talking about it now.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.940
And I will do it in
an Australian accent.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.447
No, no I will not-- because
Duncan is Australian.

00:33:42.447 --> 00:33:43.530
It has a back story there.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.590
So whether we talk to
developers, large or small,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.450
user acquisition is
really, really hard.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.870
And doing it well is considered
essential to success.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:59.470
And generating day
one buzz for your game

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.820
is in turn critical to a
successful user acquisition

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.420
strategy.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.890
And that's where
pre-registration comes in.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.210
It's a system that
allows players

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:12.800
to sign up to be notified
when a game is available.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.699
It's a powerful user
acquisition tool

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:20.710
that allows developers to
create large day one releases.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.489
And in markets like
Japan and Korea

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.830
that pioneered this
practice, we've

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.420
scene pre-registration result
in millions of day one users

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.770
of the game, instantly
bootstrapping

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.370
the game's ecosystem,
it's community,

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.510
and providing a huge boost
to store rankings right out

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:38.600
of the gate.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.250
And here is how
pre-registration works.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.139
So players will be driven
to a marketing landing

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.179
page of some sort.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:52.810
For example, game
developer, Glu,

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.510
has created this landing page.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.100
And for their upcoming game,
Terminator Genesys Revolution,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.660
which is based on the
movie of the same title.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.660
I think there's old Arnold
in it, and new Arnold,

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.873
and robot Arnold, and all
the types of Arnold's you

00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:09.100
could want.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.630
But the game is
not available yet.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.530
So the call to action
here is to pre-register.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.150
And from here, I would tap
on this pre-registration link

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.070
and be taken to the
Play Store listing.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.990
There, I will see a gorgeous
pre-registration page,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.470
where I can pre-register.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.410
And once I've clicked on
the pre-register button,

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.300
I'm informed that I will
get a notification the day

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.810
that Terminator
Genesys launches.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.455
I cannot wait.

00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:39.830
And now that I'm
pre-registered I

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.538
can explore other
content about the game.

00:35:41.538 --> 00:35:43.260
I can watch a YouTube video.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.970
I can read more
about the details

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.700
of the back story of the game.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.060
And as I scroll
down the page, I see

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.710
that I can share the
game with others,

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.960
and see other games
from Glu, in this case.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.870
I can also see that if I install
the game by June 4-- next week,

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:07.290
I think-- I get a very welcoming
welcome package that includes

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.020
grenades, and rocket
launchers, and so on-- exactly

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.565
the types of things
that I think about when

00:36:13.565 --> 00:36:14.440
I think of welcoming.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.900
At last, it's launch day.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.830
The game is ready to play.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:23.150
I get a notification
on my device.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.190
And when I tap it, I'm taken
to the game details page.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.930
And from there, I can install
the game, get my reward,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.260
my bounty of weapons, and
of course, very importantly,

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.221
save humanity from a never
ending wave of killer robots.

00:36:39.221 --> 00:36:42.520
That's victory.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.440
So what's next?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.990
If you're interested in
using pre-registration

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.720
for an upcoming
game or an app, you

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.020
can contact your
BD manager, or you

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.610
can go to this link here, which
will be available in the slides

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.460
later on.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.496
With that, I'll hand things
back to Noah to close us out.

00:36:59.496 --> 00:37:00.370
NOAH FALSTEIN: Great.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:01.800
Thank you very much, Ben.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.420
I just want to
remind you to give us

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.632
your feedback, ways that we
can improve these sessions.

00:37:11.632 --> 00:37:13.090
If we don't hear
from you, we don't

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.173
know what you're going to
want to know more about.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.440
We've got just a few
minutes left here.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.060
If people have any questions,
we've get some microphones

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.340
in the center aisle.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.500
So please feel free to line up.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.020
We've got time for, I think,
just one or two more questions.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.450
And then we should
be able to go.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.100
And I'm sure, come
on, some of you

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.030
have to have at least
a few questions.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.530
All right.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.820
Some of these brave
souls coming up here.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.470
SPEAKER: Willing victims.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.330
AUDIENCE: How does
Cast and Google TV

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.980
play nicely with each other?

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.480
Because it seems
like you can have

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.980
a game which is
broadcasting the Cast,

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.580
or you could have
a smart TV and have

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.600
your game running on the TV.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.460
So how does that interaction
work between the two of them?

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.074
NATHAN CAMARILLO: That's
a really good question.

00:38:00.074 --> 00:38:01.490
Everybody at home
heard that, too.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.900
I'm sure I don't need
to repeat the question.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.720
So the nice thing is, if
you're an Android developer

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.222
and you're really familiar and
comfortable with developing

00:38:09.222 --> 00:38:11.680
native Android apps, Android
TV is a great platform for you

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.640
to develop for.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.380
Cast is also a very
good option for you

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.970
to develop and
create your games.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.070
Every Android TV is also
a Google Cast endpoint.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.460
So the great thing is, as
phones and TVs get more and more

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.780
powerful, the Android TV
set-top box that you buy now

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.934
becomes a really powerful
device for Cast content

00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:32.600
into the future.

00:38:35.235 --> 00:38:36.860
AUDIENCE: So the
pre-registration thing

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.640
is a great thing for
business-- getting

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.275
users up-front is fantastic.

00:38:40.275 --> 00:38:41.900
You don't have to
worry that much about

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.360
growth in the early stages.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.110
But the problem
is is there a way

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.460
to use something like the staged
rollout or the beta release

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.430
along with this
pre-registrations

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.910
that you ensure that when
five million people install

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:01.470
your game on the first day you
don't have a 50% crash rate?

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.580
BENJAMIN FRENKEL:
The answer is, yes.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.580
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.880
NOAH FALSTEIN: That's
good and succinct.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.757
Well, we're just
about out of time.

00:39:09.757 --> 00:39:11.340
It looks like you're
out of questions.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.830
So thank you very
much for coming

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.490
and enjoy tomorrow at I/O.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.840
