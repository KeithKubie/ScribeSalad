00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.420
Welcome back.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.050
I'm sorry.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.470
I actually had to take a
five-second pause because

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.560
something came up, but
let me continue.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.180
Problem number 10.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.530
So let's see, they say that
this is x degrees.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.260
So there's a formula for the
angles inside of a polygon,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990
but what I'm going to do is
derive it for you, because

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.320
frankly, on an exam you can--
well, later in life, it's very

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.570
easy to forget everything.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.560
So what I do is, we know that
all of the angles are

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.290
congruent, right?

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.390
So if we know that this is--
let's call this angle y, then

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.890
this angle is going to be y,
this angle going to be y, that

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:49.950
is y, that's y, that's y, that's
y, that's y, that's y,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.950
that's y, right?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.030
All of these angles
are the same.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.580
And what do we know about
these angles here?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.930
Let's called these
z, z, z, z, z.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.545
There are five of these z angles
and what are they going

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.470
to add up to be?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.350
Well, they go around
in a circle, right?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.470
So these five z angles
are going to have to

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.316
add up to 360 degrees.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:15.660
So we could say 5z is equal
to 360 degrees.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:25.370
z is equal to-- let's see, 5
goes into 360, 7, 35, 10, 72.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.960
So z is equal to 72 degrees.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.480
So each of these z's
is 72 degrees.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.760
That angle of 72 degrees,
what are the y's?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.560
Well, y plus y plus z has
to be 180, right?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.530
So you have y plus y plus 72
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.350
2y plus 72 is equal to 180.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.430
2y is equal to what?

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.166
108.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.670
And actually we could
solve for y.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.330
y is 54.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.580
But really we just want
to know what 2y is

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.430
because look at this.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.656
We're trying to solve for x.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:11.850
x plus 2y is 180, right?

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.912
How did I get that?

00:02:12.912 --> 00:02:15.280
x is supplementary
with y and y.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.710
This is 2y right here and
altogether they are

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.480
supplementary.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.650
So that's where I get
x plus 2y is 180.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.650
We know what 2y is.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.236
It's 108.

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:28.868
x plus 108 is equal to 180.

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:32.940
x is equal to-- and actually,
it's interesting. x is going

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.800
to be equal to z, right?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.250
x is 72 degrees.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.160
And that is choice C.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.590
And that actually is
interesting that x

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.410
is the same as z.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.130
And actually, when you think
about it, it makes sense

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.460
because y plus y plus z is 180,
and here, y plus y plus x

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.570
has to be 180.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.320
So x is going to
be equal to z.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.660
You say there are 360 degrees
in the circle.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.760
Divide by the number of z's
there are, one, two, three,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.050
four, five, you get 72.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.300
Next problem.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.360
Problem 11.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.090
The length of a drawing of a
tool is 3/8 of the length of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.190
the actual tool.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.630
OK, if the length of the drawing
of the tool is 6

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.600
inches, what is the length in
inches of the actual tool?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.860
OK, 6 inches is equal to 3/8
times the actual tool.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.360
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.830
reciprocal of this right here.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:49.090
So let's say 8/3 times 6 is
equal to 8/3 times 3/8a.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.190
This, of course, cancels out.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.420
That's why I multiplied
by the reciprocal.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.190
And this becomes a 2,
this becomes a 1.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.530
8 times 2 is 16.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530
So the actual tool
is 16 inches.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.290
And that's choice C.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.590
Next problem.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.555
Problem 12.

00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:07.020
I might have space
to do it here.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.779
If x plus 3/2 is an integer-- so
they're saying x plus 3 is

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.360
divisible by 2, right?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.269
Because in order for this to be
an integer-- and so what do

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.010
we know about x?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.130
Well, x plus 3 has to be
even number, right?

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.830
Because it's divisible by 2.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.510
So that must mean that x has
to be an odd number.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.300
How do I know that?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.270
So I know that x
plus 3 is even.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.080
If x plus 3 is even, then
I know that x is odd.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.060
Why is that?

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.680
Because 3 is odd.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.480
The only way, if I had one
number plus an odd and I get

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.500
an even, this number has
to be odd as well.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.670
2 odds added together equal
an even, right?

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.210
For example, 5 plus 3 is
8, or 11 plus 3 is 14.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.330
So an odd plus an
odd is an even.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.850
So x has to be odd.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.100
So when we look at the choices,
we have choice E.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.100
x is an odd integer.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.390
That's the only thing that we
can really assume based on

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.370
this, and that's because x
plus 3 has to be even.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.230
And anything plus an odd and
you get an even, that thing

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.050
you added to the odd has
to be odd as well.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.420
And you can try it
out with numbers.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.670
Next problem.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.610
Problem 13.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.000
All right.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.230
In the x, y plane above, points
q and s are the centers

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.140
of the circle.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.190
Which are tangent
to the x-axis?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.670
Let me see if I can draw this.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.530
So this is the y-axis.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.420
This is the x-axis.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.930
And now they draw a
couple of circles.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.035
A small one and a big one.

00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:06.210
Let's see if I can draw it.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.800
The small circle looks
something like that.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.390
And the big circle doesn't
touch the small circle.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:25.000
So the big circle looks
something like that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.766
Fair enough.

00:06:26.766 --> 00:06:31.650
Let's see, this is point Q.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.786
This is point S and those
are the centers.

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:41.686
And they tell us that this point
right here is 3 comma 6,

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:47.305
and this point up here
is 11 comma 10.

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:48.400
And what else?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.060
This is point R.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:58.590
this is point P, QS, oh, and
then one last thing, I'm

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.270
drawing this line here
and a line here.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.500
In both cases, they say this
is a perpendicular.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.350
Let's do the problem.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.790
In the x, y plane above, points
Q and S are the centers

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.880
of the circle, which are tangent
to the x-axis, right?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.260
They just barely touch the
x-axis right here.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.620
That's the x-axis.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.870
What is the slope of line QS?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.490
So what is the slope
of this line?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.510
Line QS?

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.233
And it could go further out like
that, go further in this

00:07:32.233 --> 00:07:34.670
direction like that.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.850
So we really just have
to figure out the

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.640
coordinates Q and S.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.190
So Q is the center of this, so
it's tangent to the x-axis.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.070
This entire diameter has what?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.680
Has height what?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.100
Height 6.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.190
So this the point 3.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.330
This is 3, 6, so what's
this Q going to be?

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.060
The x is definitely going to
still be 3 and the y is going

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.030
to be halfway to
this top point.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.230
Well, what's halfway to 6?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.200
3.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.950
Similarly, this is point 11
comma 10, so the x-coordinate

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.130
is 11 and this y-coordinate
is to 10.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.320
So what's the coordinate
of S going to be?

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.520
The x-coordinate is, of course,
still going to be 11.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.550
And the y-coordinate is going
to be halfway to 10.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:24.340
What's halfway to 10?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.360
It's 5.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.220
So what's the slope?

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.040
Slope is change in y
over change in x.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.640
So let's take the y's.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:41.520
It's 5 minus 3 over
11 minus 3.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.770
That equals 2/9.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.740
No, sorry, 2/8.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.880
I always mess up
on that stuff.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.420
11 minus 3 is 8.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.800
So 2/8 and that equals 1/4.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.534
And that is choice D.

00:08:57.534 --> 00:09:00.320
I'll see you in the
next video.
