00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.920
My book is trying to puts facts and to put
history and to put data in one of the most

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.610
controversial issues in history, which is
the issue of inequality and unequal income

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.660
and wealth and you know this is an issue about
which people have been fighting for centuries

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.000
in particular during the twentieth century
with the very violent fight between capitalism and communism, et cetera.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.600
Instead of looking at only
one country, I look at over twenty countries

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.579
in the world, and I look at wealth and not
only at income so I can look, you know, I

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.000
study the distribution of who owns what and
not only who earns what.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.659
Societies of the past were really based on wealth in the sense that inequality was primarily inequality between

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.870
those who own wealth and those who only own
their labor. One of the economic law to the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.350
extent that there are laws in economics is,
indeed, R bigger than G. So the rate of return

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.350
to capital tends to be bigger than the growth
rate. It means that whatever wealth was accumulated

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.840
in the past is now being recapitalized faster
than the growth rate of the economy, which

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.610
is also the growth rate of labor income. And
therefore basically you better start with

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.490
some initial wealth. You know, if you just
try to enter the game only with your labor

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.490
income, well this has to be a very high labor
income. Now, there is another type of society

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.929
and another type of model of inequality that
has been emerging particularly in the United

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.929
States over the past few decades where you
have a huge rise of the top labor income and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.119
in particular the top compensation that managers
in large corporations are getting.

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:05.429
Now of course the problem is that if you are neither
a top manager nor a top inheritor

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.720
then you lose on both grounds. So the good news is
that about the future is that when we read

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.980
the past in this way we can see that, you
know, there are several possible futures.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.980
You know, it’s not as if inequality has
to rise indefinitely or inequality will reduce naturally.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
You know, there’s nothing natural
in the history of income and wealth distribution

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.440
and there’s nothing natural in the history
of economic facts more generally.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.640
I think we need to reopen, you know, the black box
of inequality in our industrial societies

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.920
and to look you know in a very crude way at
what the market economy is able to do and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.720
what the market economy is not able to do.
So the market economy is great at producing

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.689
new wealth, but sometimes it can be quite
bad at generating distribution of wealth that

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.549
is equitable in the long run. So you know
its great to have entrepreneurs, it’s great

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.360
to have new wealth being formed, but this
has to be compatible with the size of the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.970
world economy. If the top of the distribution
is rising three or four times faster than

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.940
the world economy, if you have that during
the next fifty years basically all the wealth

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.680
will belong to a very small international
elite and basically there will be no wealth

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.099
middle class anymore, and there will be a
level of inequality which is simply not compatible

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.899
with our democratic and meritocratic values.
