00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
There it is, that's hard to get.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.400
I don't know if your camera is fast enough to catch that.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.540
I'll do it until you cry "Uncle".
There you go.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:17.980
So for many people -- me in particular, viscerally -- this is as close to a random phenomena as I know.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.800
And yet you can think about it, if you knew when the coin leaves your thumb

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.940
( faint ringing sound )

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.840
if you knew how fast it was traveling,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.980
and if you knew how many times a second it was turning over

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.240
Newton tells you, if you know the speed,
how long it takes you to come down

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.280
and that if you know how fast it's turning,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.080
you know whether it will come up heads or tails.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.300
Coin tossing is a deterministic process.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.700
So what's random about it?
But first of all,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.380
let's try doing a little of the math of tossing a coin.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.800
I'm going to say feet per second,
I know that's unpopular.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.660
And here's revolutions per second.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.840
So a dot on this plane is a coin toss.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.800
A dot on this plane is how fast it's going,
and how many times a second is it turning.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.320
So for example, a dot here near the axis,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.100
the speed is high
but the revolutions per second is not so much.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.060
So that means it's going up like a pizza.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.060
It's kind of doing this,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.280
and not really turning over.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.260
If it's close enough,
it might be just kind of slowly turning.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.160
So it might be that it doesn't turn over at all.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.020
Similarly a dot here, very near the axis up here,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.480
is a coin which was thrown
with a lot of revolutions per second

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.000
but very low speed, so it never gets very far.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.960
( faint ringing sound )

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.680
So there's a region like this, of initial conditions
where the coin never turns over at all.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.480
Any place in here the coin never
turns over at all, there's some region.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.720
And we can figure out what this curve is.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.760
It's just, you know, a first course in physics.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.280
And then there's a region
where the coin turns over once.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.160
Initial conditions here, the coin just turns over once.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.360
And then there's a third region 
where the coin turns over twice.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.340
And then there's a fourth region
where the coin turns over three times,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.260
which is the same as turning over once.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.820
And these regions alternate.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.180
When you do the math what you find is 
these regions get closer and closer together,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.300
so that small changes in initial conditions make for the difference between heads and tails.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.540
And for most of us that's what makes coin tossing random.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.720
Now you can ask, when real people
flip real coins, where are we on this picture?

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.460
I want to know how fast is the coin going when it leaves my hand?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.740
Is it going 5 miles an hour?
Is it going 20 miles an hour?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.140
Is it going 40 miles an hour? 
It makes a difference.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.260
So I got a friend with a stopwatch, and I went:

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.960
"1, 2, 3, flip!"
"1, 2, 3, flip!"

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.940
and we got sort of synchronized,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.560
and so he could tell how long it took the coin to come down,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.020
and from that I could tell how fast it was going.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.720
Now, it took three hours to get that data,
if you think about it.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.600
To get the data about how fast is the coin turning

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.220
I had a good research idea which is the following:

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.280
I took a coin and I took a piece of dental floss,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.500
you know the tape type dental floss,
about three feet long,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.460
like that,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.360
and then I flip the coin up,
and then I could unwind the dental floss

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.240
to see how many times it had turned
until it was flat again.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.460
( faint ringing sound )

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.980
The floss twists around.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.900
Now, it's true

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.380
that a coin flipping in the air with a piece of dental floss

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.420
is different than the coin
just flipping in the air unimpeded.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.840
So as with any measurement process the measuring interferes with the randomness.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840
But you hope it's a third order effect.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.260
Based on those kinds

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.900
of experiments and a lot more of that,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.960
I know where we are on this picture.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.040
What was funny is how fast the coins go.
A typical coin flip lasts,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.700
comes up and lasts about half a second.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.440
When you translate that,
that means the coin is going up and back

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.060
about five and a half miles an hour.
That's how fast this coin is traveling.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.100
Now I have to say where we are on this picture.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.020
This dot where we are in this picture is about 5,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.090
this is 1.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.350
And in the units of this picture

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.750
five and a half miles an hour
comes down to very very close to zero,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.080
but the revolutions per second
were 40 units up in the picture.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.240
So this picture says nothing about real coins,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.680
but the math behind the picture tells you

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.920
how serrated you are
up there where you can't see.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.610
It seems to be true that coins

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.270
the way we flip them are fair to 2 decimal places
but not to 3.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.600
It's not perfectly 50/50.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.640
In work with Susan Holmes and Richard Montgomery

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.180
we showed that coins the way real people flip them

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.820
it's about .51, so one in a hundred off.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.620
And it's not .51 to "heads or tails",

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.320
it's .51 that it comes up the way it started.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.720
That is, if you started heads up
it spends more time heads up.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.000
And I don't care how hard you flip the coin,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.420
you can flip it to the moon.
That bias is a provable stable bias.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.200
And it's not a "I think" or "from experiments",
this is a theorem.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.500
When real coins flip, when we get your
high-speed camera, you'll be able to see

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.270
that they don't turn through
their axis of symmetry in that way,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.710
through this plane, they precess

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.510
and they do pretty complicated things.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.220
And because of the precession
it's not just the simple two parameter business.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.760
The real analysis of flipping a coin, it's 12 parameters.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.760
Actually describing a moving coin

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.800
is a 12 dimensional problem.
It's not something I can draw a picture of.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.760
We did the analysis in the 12 dimensional space

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.300
and put in some data from
real people flipping real coins.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.390
We had to measure the distribution of angular momentum when real people flipped real coins.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.830
And that was quite challenging, but we did it.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.110
So based on all of that analysis, when people,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.280
when you flip a coin it's about .51
to come up the way it started.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.200
So it's better if you see its heads, 
it's better to guess heads.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.540
It is also true that if you take a coin
out of your pocket,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.640
or jiggle it in your hands,
that probably makes the start random.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.220
And then physically flipping a coin
won't destroy that randomness.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.180
It's not as if the coins have a predilection to kind of favor heads when they come.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.380
Brady Haran: This video was made at
the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.360
Now you might be wondering,
is it more fair to catch the coin
or let it drop to the ground?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.470
You also might be wondering,
is it more fair just to spin a coin on a surface

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.080
rather than tossing it through the air
in the first place?

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.620
Well Professor Diaconis has discussed both of these with us,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.350
and depending on when you're watching this,
that video is coming very soon.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.570
Or, maybe it's already uploaded. 
So check those out, and thanks for watching.
