[music playing]

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.210
NARRATOR: Humans have been
mesmerized by the moon

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.330
since the dawn of man.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.710
And although many theories
have been proposed,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.670
scientists cannot
say with absolute

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.380
certainty how this celestial
object came into being.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.080
When I was a
student, nobody really

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.830
knew where the moon came from.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.580
But because it's so relatively
big, this was a real problem.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580
And I think that
there is a tendency

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.420
to think that moons get somehow
captured by the parent planets.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.880
If you've got one body here
and another body coming along,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.330
it can't just get trapped
into orbit like that.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.920
The difficulty there
is just basic physics.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
So this remained a puzzle
until about 20 years ago,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.750
when another theory came along.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.880
And that is that
proto-Earth was, very early

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.920
on in the history
of the solar system,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.170
hit by a Mars-sized
body, hit obliquely

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.250
that this Mars-sized body plowed
into the center of the Earth

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.620
and became the Earth's core,
and a lot of the outer material

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.380
got stripped off by this
gargantuan collision

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.960
and coalesced to form the moon.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.210
Now, they had to come up with
a very bizarre theory for how

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.120
the moon came into being because
all the conventional theories

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.620
don't make any sense.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.380
The best theory of
the moon's formation

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.750
is phantasmagorically
catastrophic collision

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
of two things, you know,
at just the right angle

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.620
to form this belt of debris
that then formed the moon.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.250
But the moon, its exact
size is such that it

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.460
gives us total eclipses.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.460
Its disk exactly covers the sun.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.750
And the chances
of that occurring

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.750
are so literally astronomically
small, it's very disturbing.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.920
NARRATOR: The sun's
diameter is 400

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.000
times greater than the moon.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.830
And coincidentally, the sun also
happens to be nearly precisely

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.920
400 times further away.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.830
This is the reason that
the sun and the moon

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.000
appear the same size
in the Earth's sky,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.080
and why we on Earth can
experience eclipses of the sun.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.290
DAVID CHILDRESS: It's just
perfectly in that orbit

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.040
to eclipse our sun.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.710
The odds of the moon
being in that orbit

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.540
accidentally are
a zillion to one.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.210
So that right there is
evidence that our moon

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.790
is in a perfect orbit around our
planet that's not accidental.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.500
MIKE BARA: In order to
have a solar eclipse,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.880
the moon has to be exactly
the size that it is,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.000
which is 2,160 miles.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.500
Not 2,161, not 2,159, but
2,160 miles at its equator.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.290
And there are people
out there that actually

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.000
think that's a coincidence.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920
The fact is is that
that is by design.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.540
NARRATOR: Throughout
our observable galaxy,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.000
this relationship and others
have not been duplicated.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.170
Other moons are sizeably
smaller by comparison

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.420
to their mother planet.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.040
Earth's satellite not only
orbits closer than it should

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.830
for its size, it is
also the only moon

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.920
in the solar system that has
a near perfect circular orbit.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.250
And no other lunar
bodies are known

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.880
to have such a stabilizing role
as the moon has with the Earth.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.250
WILLIAM HENRY: Recent
computer simulations

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.750
have shown that, without
the moon's presence,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.170
the Earth's axis tilt
would be completely

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.960
different than it is today.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.460
We might not even have seasons
as we know them presently.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.540
Without the seasons, it could
be very difficult for life

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.750
on Earth.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.380
So the moon is
actually performing

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.120
an incredible function.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.620
It's life-sustaining.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.120
Without it, we
might not be here.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.080
ALAN BUTLER: There are so many
peculiarities about the way

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.290
the moon has affected the Earth
that one might be forgiven

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.790
for believing that there
is intelligence behind it,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.580
that something made it that way.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.580
The moon is so strange,
so odd in terms

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.380
of what we find elsewhere
in the solar system,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.620
and particularly in terms of
what it does for the Earth,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.000
having made the Earth
into a haven for life,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.460
that one feels obliged
to ask the question,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.000
could such things have
come about by chance?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.170
Was it placed
there deliberately?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.790
Was it engineered,
maybe by aliens?

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.120
And therefore, is our whole
existence a planned event?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.330
