Narrator: WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU'RE UNDERWATER

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.607 line:0%
AND YOU WANT TO FRESHEN UP
YOUR MOUTH?

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.645
THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY
GOING ON.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.348
HOW CAN HE LET THOSE FISH
INSIDE HIS MOUTH?

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.584 line:0%
Narrator: THIS IS DIVE MASTER
MICHAEL MILNER

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.887 line:0%
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RED SEA
IN EGYPT.

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.359
SO, HOW DOES MICHAEL TURN FISH
INTO FLOSS?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.795 line:0%
THESE FISH ARE
BLUESTREAK CLEANER WRASSE,

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.599 line:0%
AND THEY OPERATE THINGS
CALLED CLEANING STATIONS

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.166 line:0%
ON CORAL-REEF ENVIRONMENTS.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.602 line:0%
THEY'LL ACTUALLY EAT
THE DEAD SCALES AND SKIN

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.071 line:0%
AND MUCUS AND PARASITES
OFF OF OTHER ANIMALS.

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.040 line:0%
THEY'RE CALLED
"OBLIGATE CLEANERS."

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.308 line:0%
IT'S JUST WHAT THEY DO.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.010 line:0%
IT'S HOW THEY GET
THEIR FOOD.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.312 line:0%
IT'S ACTUALLY
THEIR ENTIRE SOURCE OF FOOD.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.514 line:0%
Krishna-Pillay: THEY'RE NOT AT
ALL FUSSY ABOUT WHAT THEY EAT,

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:51.317 line:0%
AND THEY CAN CONSUME UP TO
1,200 PARASITES A DAY.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.287
NOW, THIS IS A MUTUALLY
BENEFICIAL THING FOR THEM TO DO.

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.623
ANOTHER FISH
GETS TO BE FREE OF PARASITES,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.625
AND THEY GET TO EAT
SOME PARASITES.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.826
Narrator: BUT MICHAEL'S
NOT A FISH,

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:03.663
SO WHY ARE THESE WRASSE
DOING MOUTH MAINTENANCE?

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.800
MICHAEL MAY HAVE ATTRACTED THE
SERVICES OF THESE CLEANER FISH

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.835
BECAUSE HE HAD
RECENTLY EATEN A MEAL

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.203
AND, CLEARLY,
HE DIDN'T BRUSH OR FLOSS,

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.972
BECAUSE THE FISH WERE ATTRACTED

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.175
TO THE SMELLS
COMING FROM HIS MOUTH.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.412
Narrator:
AND THAT'S HOW YOU CLEAN YOUR
"TEEF" WHEN YOU'RE ON A REEF.
