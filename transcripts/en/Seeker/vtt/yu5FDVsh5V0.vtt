00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.300
Awkward silence, it's a...

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:16.309
Hi, welcome to DNews, I'm Ross Everett.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
Silences.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:18.309
They can be awkward.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.090
You know that moment where you say something
in a group of your friends and it's met with

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.600
a deafening...

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.859
That moment that makes you want to grab someone
and shake them saying "I TAKE IT BACK!

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.189
WHATEVER I DID TO MAKE YOU HATE ME I JUST
WANT TO UNDO IT!

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.810
COME BACK TO ME.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.339
And while they feel like they last eons, turns
out the amount of time it takes to make a

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.020
silence awkward is just four seconds...

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.910
Of course on an Internet video four seconds
seems even longer.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.269
Case and point: skippable pre-roll ads.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.339
My beard grows in by the time the skip button
shows up.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.450
?
But what exactly happens in those four seconds

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.600
that makes us willing to be anywhere else?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.059
Well, a social experiment, or as Facebook
calls it: a new feature, was conducted at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.680
the University of Groningen in the Netherlands,
that showed the importance of conversational

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
flow.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.490
When a conversation is going strong, or riffing
as I like to call it, we experience positive

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.070
emotions, social validation, and a sense of
belonging.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.160
So it only makes sense that when it's brought
to a screeching halt, or stiffing as I call

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.500
it, we're flooded by feelings of rejection
and ostracism.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.080
They found this out by having a group of sixty
undergrads watch one of two six-minute videos

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.300
of a conversation.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.380
In both videos one person makes a controversial
remark.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.070
In one of the videos, the conversation continues
smoothly and moves onto a different topic.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.650
But in the other video, eeeeerp- the conversation
stops.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.100
For four seconds of silence, after which the
conversation continues.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.040
And while the conversation continues the exact
same way in both videos, the silence in between

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.750
made all the difference.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.430
It disrupted the flow enough to make those
that watched the video with the pause feel

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.190
"more rejection, more negative emotions, and
less positive emotions" which seems a little

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.860
redundant but I wanna give you all the facts.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.170
You never disrupt the flow.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.509
Unless, of course, you're aiming to create
one of those silences that's, well... awkward.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.189
So, what do you guys do during an awkward
silence?

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.500
Let me know in the comments down below.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.189

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.730
1..2..3..4..
