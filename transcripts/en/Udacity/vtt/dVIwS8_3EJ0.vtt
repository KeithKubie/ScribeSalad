00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.160
So in this study there's far more concordance in

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.090
the monozygotic twins than there is in the dizygotic

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.460
twins. Which indicates a strong but not complete genetic

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.070
influence. Now I know we've been over it a couple

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.770
times now, but I really hope you understand this

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.910
important connection. When you have a strong correlation or concordance

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.870
with monzygotic twins, and you don't see as much

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.740
with dizygotic twins, that's when you know there's a stronger

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.750
genetic component. When the monozygotic twins and the dizygotic

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.530
twins are closer together in their concordance or correlation rates,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.460
that's when you can't say it's because of genetics.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.240
And that's more to do with the environment. Now I

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.400
use numbers from one particular study of bipolar disorder,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.050
but there are multiple different studies out there. And these

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.230
numbers can change over time so don't take these

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.760
as a fact of bipolar. This is, this being the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.950
final say or anything. Science constantly re-evaluates its

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.690
conclusions based on the given data. And this could

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.700
change in the future, but for our purposes

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.010
right here, this study indicates a strong genetic influence.
