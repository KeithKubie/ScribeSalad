the greatest strategy in the world but
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.320
the greatest strategy in the world but
we'll develop a habit for doing so and

we'll develop a habit for doing so and
 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.790

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.010
bottles of wine I could buy 3 gallons of
 

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.830
bottles of wine I could buy 3 gallons of
milk right we just don't think like this

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:05.840
milk right we just don't think like this
 

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.540
milk right we just don't think like this
we compare wine - wine and milk - milk

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:07.550
we compare wine - wine and milk - milk
 

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.120
we compare wine - wine and milk - milk
and beer - beer but in fact it's how we

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.130
and beer - beer but in fact it's how we
 

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.770
and beer - beer but in fact it's how we
want to think now it's very hard to do

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:11.780
want to think now it's very hard to do
 

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.650
want to think now it's very hard to do
it in an extensive way but when you face

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:14.660
it in an extensive way but when you face
 

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.600
it in an extensive way but when you face
something you could say what else could

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:16.610
something you could say what else could
 

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.570
something you could say what else could
I get if I didn't get this and which one

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:19.580
I get if I didn't get this and which one
 

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.890
I get if I didn't get this and which one
of those is giving me the greatest

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:20.900
of those is giving me the greatest
 

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.680
of those is giving me the greatest
pleasure now it's not always that we

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:23.690
pleasure now it's not always that we
 

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.540
pleasure now it's not always that we
always need to save more and spend less

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:25.550
always need to save more and spend less
 

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.070
always need to save more and spend less
I think the question is are we

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.080
I think the question is are we
 

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.050
I think the question is are we
allocating our money correctly across

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.060
allocating our money correctly across
 

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.270
allocating our money correctly across
into different categories money is a

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:31.280
into different categories money is a
 

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.430
into different categories money is a
great way to get happiness right lots of

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440
great way to get happiness right lots of
 

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.720
great way to get happiness right lots of
wonderful things you can do with money

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:34.730
wonderful things you can do with money
 

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.850
wonderful things you can do with money
the question is are we really optimizing

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:36.860
the question is are we really optimizing
 

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.660
the question is are we really optimizing
on that so if you think about getting

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:39.670
on that so if you think about getting
 

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:44.020
on that so if you think about getting
lattice and getting cable which one of

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.030
lattice and getting cable which one of
 

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.340
lattice and getting cable which one of
those is actually giving your great

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.350
those is actually giving your great
 

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.290
those is actually giving your great
greater happiness and if you had to cut

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.300
greater happiness and if you had to cut
 

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.000
greater happiness and if you had to cut
on one of those which one would you

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.010
on one of those which one would you
 

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.590
on one of those which one would you
would you cut and so I think thinking in

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600
would you cut and so I think thinking in
 

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.330
would you cut and so I think thinking in
terms of concrete in concrete terms

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:55.340
terms of concrete in concrete terms
 

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:01.189
terms of concrete in concrete terms
would would help us a great deal

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199
 

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.229
there's another thing we call the pain

00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:03.239
there's another thing we call the pain
 

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:12.199
there's another thing we call the pain
of paying

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:12.209
 

00:14:12.209 --> 00:14:14.639
there's another idea called the pain of

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:14.649
there's another idea called the pain of
 

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:16.560
there's another idea called the pain of
paying this was proposed by George

to my cash register now it's going to be
a very efficient way to eat because

right why because it turns out that this

00:14:59.850 --> 00:14:59.860
right why because it turns out that this
 

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.720
right why because it turns out that this
simultaneity of eating and consuming or

simultaneity of eating and consuming or
 

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.600
simultaneity of eating and consuming or
enjoying and paying actually makes

enjoying and paying actually makes
 

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.400
enjoying and paying actually makes
things less happy here's another example

things less happy here's another example
 

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.379
things less happy here's another example
imagine you go on a cruise to Alaska and

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:10.389
imagine you go on a cruise to Alaska and
 

00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:12.540
imagine you go on a cruise to Alaska and
you can either pay six months in advance

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:12.550
you can either pay six months in advance
 

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.870
you can either pay six months in advance
or the moment you get off the ship it's

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880
or the moment you get off the ship it's
 

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.180
or the moment you get off the ship it's
much more reasonable economically to pay

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.190
much more reasonable economically to pay
 

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.250
much more reasonable economically to pay
the moment you get off the ship but how

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:20.260
the moment you get off the ship but how
 

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.930
the moment you get off the ship but how
much would you enjoy the last day of the

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:21.940
much would you enjoy the last day of the
 

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.579
much would you enjoy the last day of the
cruise it will be kind of miserable

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:23.589
cruise it will be kind of miserable
 

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.019
cruise it will be kind of miserable
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:25.029
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay
 

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.629
knowing that tomorrow you have to pay
all this money so what happened is that

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639
all this money so what happened is that
 

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:29.670
all this money so what happened is that
this simultaneity is very important and

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680
this simultaneity is very important and
 

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.680
this simultaneity is very important and
we can use it in two ways we can think

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:34.690
we can use it in two ways we can think
 

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.600
we can use it in two ways we can think
about how we reduce the pain of paying

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.610
about how we reduce the pain of paying
 

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.579
about how we reduce the pain of paying
so for example credit cards are

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:38.589
so for example credit cards are
 

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.590
so for example credit cards are
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain
 

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.600
wonderful mechanisms to reduce the pain
of pain if you go to a restaurant then

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:42.610
of pain if you go to a restaurant then
 

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.230
of pain if you go to a restaurant then
you pay in cash

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240
you pay in cash
 

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.509
you pay in cash
you would feel much worse than if you

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519
you would feel much worse than if you
 

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:47.550
you would feel much worse than if you
pay in a credit card why you know the

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560
pay in a credit card why you know the
 

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.590
pay in a credit card why you know the
price there's no surprise but if you

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600
price there's no surprise but if you
 

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600
price there's no surprise but if you
find cash you feel a bit more guilt it's

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:51.610
find cash you feel a bit more guilt it's
 

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.100
find cash you feel a bit more guilt it's
a bit more difficult it's kind of more

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.110
a bit more difficult it's kind of more
 

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.559
a bit more difficult it's kind of more
painful to part with your money with the

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:55.569
painful to part with your money with the
 

00:15:55.569 --> 00:15:59.430
painful to part with your money with the
creditors there it's another time so you

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440
creditors there it's another time so you
 

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.930
creditors there it's another time so you
can think about this is good or bad if

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:00.940
can think about this is good or bad if
 

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.519
can think about this is good or bad if
you want to spend more money in

restaurants use credit cards more than
 

00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:06.900
restaurants use credit cards more than
cash if you want to spend less use cash

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:06.910
cash if you want to spend less use cash
 

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:11.430
cash if you want to spend less use cash
more than modern credit cards but in

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440
more than modern credit cards but in
 

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.290
more than modern credit cards but in
general we can think about how to use

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.300
general we can think about how to use
 

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.150
general we can think about how to use
the pain of paying and how much if we do

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.160
the pain of paying and how much if we do
 

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.680
the pain of paying and how much if we do
we want and I think we have like a range

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:16.690
we want and I think we have like a range
 

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.689
we want and I think we have like a range
credit cards have very little pain of

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:18.699
credit cards have very little pain of
 

00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:21.030
credit cards have very little pain of
paying debit card have a little bit more

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040
paying debit card have a little bit more
 

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.100
paying debit card have a little bit more
because you feel like today at least

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.110
because you feel like today at least

and cash has much more but you can even
 

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.579
and cash has much more but you can even
do better than cash imagine that you had

it's a question of what categories we

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:55.779
it's a question of what categories we
 

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:57.509
it's a question of what categories we
want to spend more on and what

00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519

I don't think so I think we'll have lots
 

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.560
I don't think so I think we'll have lots
of solutions but I think we're kind of

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:50.570
of solutions but I think we're kind of
 

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.620
of solutions but I think we're kind of
at the start of developing some software

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:52.630
at the start of developing some software
 

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.780
at the start of developing some software
some pre-commitment devices some more

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:55.790
some pre-commitment devices some more
 

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.890
some pre-commitment devices some more
awareness and I'm actually optimistic

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:56.900
awareness and I'm actually optimistic
 

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.140
awareness and I'm actually optimistic
that we will become better and better at

00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.150
that we will become better and better at
 

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:02.390
that we will become better and better at
this

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400
 

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.860
there's another question about how

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:03.870
there's another question about how
 

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.529
there's another question about how
people decide what loans to pay first so

00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539
people decide what loans to pay first so
 

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.820
people decide what loans to pay first so
we're assuming right now in this

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.830
we're assuming right now in this
 

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.560
we're assuming right now in this
discussion people have money and it's a

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:09.570
discussion people have money and it's a
 

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.330
discussion people have money and it's a
question of saving versus spending what

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340
question of saving versus spending what
 

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.799
question of saving versus spending what
happens to people who have lots of loans

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:12.809
happens to people who have lots of loans
 

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:15.080
happens to people who have lots of loans
so we recently did a study that asked

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:15.090
so we recently did a study that asked
 

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.700
so we recently did a study that asked
the question of how do people decide

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:16.710
the question of how do people decide
 

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.820
the question of how do people decide
what loans to pay first and sadly what

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:19.830
what loans to pay first and sadly what
 

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.500
what loans to pay first and sadly what
we found out is that people paid these

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:21.510
we found out is that people paid these
 

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.240
we found out is that people paid these
small loans before they pay the big loan

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.250
small loans before they pay the big loan
 

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.880
small loans before they pay the big loan
so imagine you have six loans small to

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:25.890
so imagine you have six loans small to
 

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.990
so imagine you have six loans small to
huge people want to close loans and

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000
huge people want to close loans and
 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.450
huge people want to close loans and
because of that they they pay off they

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460
because of that they they pay off they
 

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.220
because of that they they pay off they
try to pay off the small loans but

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.230
try to pay off the small loans but
 

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.840
try to pay off the small loans but
that's not the right strategy the right

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:35.850
that's not the right strategy the right
 

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.370
that's not the right strategy the right
strategies of course to pay the longer

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380
strategies of course to pay the longer
 

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.260
strategies of course to pay the longer
the highest interest rate people make

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.270
the highest interest rate people make
 

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.419
the highest interest rate people make
this mistake and it cost them lots and

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:41.429
this mistake and it cost them lots and
 

00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:42.470
this mistake and it cost them lots and
lots of money it's a very expensive

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480
lots of money it's a very expensive
 

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.409
lots of money it's a very expensive
mistake because interest rates are

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:44.419
mistake because interest rates are
 

00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:46.159
mistake because interest rates are
accumulated and become very very

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:46.169
accumulated and become very very
 

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:47.320
accumulated and become very very
expensive very quickly

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.330
expensive very quickly
 

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.120
expensive very quickly
we also found in our experiments that

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.130
we also found in our experiments that
 

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.649
we also found in our experiments that
too many people these days when they

00:20:51.649 --> 00:20:51.659
too many people these days when they
 

00:20:51.659 --> 00:20:53.480
too many people these days when they
have cash they keep too much cash in

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.490
have cash they keep too much cash in
 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.669
have cash they keep too much cash in
reserve and it actually looked like a

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679
reserve and it actually looked like a
 

00:20:55.679 --> 00:20:58.159
reserve and it actually looked like a
stew two-stage process people decide how

00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:58.169
stew two-stage process people decide how
 

00:20:58.169 --> 00:21:00.889
stew two-stage process people decide how
much cash to keep kind of for a rainy

00:21:00.889 --> 00:21:00.899
much cash to keep kind of for a rainy
 

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:02.930
much cash to keep kind of for a rainy
day and then the rest they allocate

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:02.940
day and then the rest they allocate
 

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.850
day and then the rest they allocate
between loans and all the time they

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:04.860
between loans and all the time they
 

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.950
between loans and all the time they
learn a little bit about how to allocate

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960
learn a little bit about how to allocate
 

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.779
learn a little bit about how to allocate
the loan so that they pay first the big

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:08.789
the loan so that they pay first the big
 

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.669
the loan so that they pay first the big
the big the high interest rate they

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679
the big the high interest rate they
 

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:11.960
the big the high interest rate they
don't learn perfectly but a little bit

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:11.970
don't learn perfectly but a little bit
 

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.659
don't learn perfectly but a little bit
but they still keep paid too much in

00:21:14.659 --> 00:21:14.669
but they still keep paid too much in
 

00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:16.580
but they still keep paid too much in
cash and interestingly these two

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:16.590
cash and interestingly these two
 

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.409
cash and interestingly these two
mistakes are connected the people who

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419
mistakes are connected the people who
 

00:21:18.419 --> 00:21:20.539
mistakes are connected the people who
keep more cash also turn to be more

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:20.549
keep more cash also turn to be more
 

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:23.419
keep more cash also turn to be more
mistaken in how they allocate loans and

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:23.429
mistaken in how they allocate loans and
 

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:25.250
mistaken in how they allocate loans and
this is I think a couple of really big

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260
this is I think a couple of really big
 

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.600
this is I think a couple of really big
mistakes first of all people should

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:26.610
mistakes first of all people should
 

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.990
mistakes first of all people should
figure out very quickly how to pay loans

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000
figure out very quickly how to pay loans
 

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.730
figure out very quickly how to pay loans
fast and they should do it well because

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740
fast and they should do it well because
 

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.240
fast and they should do it well because
it's so expensive to have loans the

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:35.250
it's so expensive to have loans the
 

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.549
it's so expensive to have loans the
second thing is I think that this a time

00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559
second thing is I think that this a time
 

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:39.919
second thing is I think that this a time
in history mu is so uncertain about

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:39.929
in history mu is so uncertain about
 

00:21:39.929 --> 00:21:41.600
in history mu is so uncertain about
everything and everybody gives us advice

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:41.610
everything and everybody gives us advice
 

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.299
everything and everybody gives us advice
about keep six months salary in cash

00:21:44.299 --> 00:21:44.309
about keep six months salary in cash
 

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:46.519
about keep six months salary in cash
this is good advice to some people but

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:46.529
this is good advice to some people but
 

00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:47.899
this is good advice to some people but
it's not good advice for people who have

00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:47.909
it's not good advice for people who have
 

00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:50.120
it's not good advice for people who have
loans because if you have loaned the

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.130
loans because if you have loaned the
 

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.320
loans because if you have loaned the
first thing you want to do is to say

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:51.330
first thing you want to do is to say
 

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.180
first thing you want to do is to say
look I have a credit card if I really

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:53.190
look I have a credit card if I really
 

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.580
look I have a credit card if I really
need to borrow I have this emergency

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:54.590
need to borrow I have this emergency
 

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.440
need to borrow I have this emergency
money that I can I can get but for now

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.450
money that I can I can get but for now
 

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.630
money that I can I can get but for now
there's no reason for me to keep cash at

00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640
there's no reason for me to keep cash at
 

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.580
there's no reason for me to keep cash at
0% interest rate and at the same time

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:01.590
0% interest rate and at the same time
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.240
0% interest rate and at the same time
pay all of this all of this money out so

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.250
pay all of this all of this money out so
 

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.350
pay all of this all of this money out so
I think people need to figure out

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360
I think people need to figure out
 

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.200
I think people need to figure out
quickly how to pay loans and how much

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:09.210
quickly how to pay loans and how much
 

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.970
quickly how to pay loans and how much
cash they should really keep

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:12.980
 

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.170
so I was

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:15.180
so I was
 

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.980
so I was
forever basically I was in grad school

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:18.990
forever basically I was in grad school
 

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.200
forever basically I was in grad school
for seven almost seven years I got two

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.210
for seven almost seven years I got two
 

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.880
for seven almost seven years I got two
PhDs in the process but I was addressed

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:22.890
PhDs in the process but I was addressed
 

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.650
PhDs in the process but I was addressed
in for a long time and I got used to the

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:24.660
in for a long time and I got used to the
 

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.000
in for a long time and I got used to the
lifestyle of a grad student and when

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.010
lifestyle of a grad student and when
 

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.550
lifestyle of a grad student and when
when I finished and I moved to Boston we

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:31.560
when I finished and I moved to Boston we
 

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.540
when I finished and I moved to Boston we
moved to Boston the biggest mistake I

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:35.550
moved to Boston the biggest mistake I
 

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.750
moved to Boston the biggest mistake I
did was that I was so used to living on

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760
did was that I was so used to living on
 

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.350
did was that I was so used to living on
a PhD student salary that I couldn't

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360
a PhD student salary that I couldn't
 

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:48.020
a PhD student salary that I couldn't
stomach the idea of getting getting an

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.030
stomach the idea of getting getting an
 

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.460
stomach the idea of getting getting an
apartment in the size that would

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:49.470
apartment in the size that would
 

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.970
apartment in the size that would
actually be good for us so the problem

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980
actually be good for us so the problem
 

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.010
actually be good for us so the problem
is we we moved from North Carolina to

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020
is we we moved from North Carolina to
 

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.100
is we we moved from North Carolina to
Cambridge for the first two months we

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:58.110
Cambridge for the first two months we
 

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.330
Cambridge for the first two months we
couldn't believe these were the prices

00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340
couldn't believe these were the prices
 

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.010
couldn't believe these were the prices
of houses right we were used to paying

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020
of houses right we were used to paying
 

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.200
of houses right we were used to paying
North Carolina prices they were taking

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.210
North Carolina prices they were taking
 

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.970
North Carolina prices they were taking
us to all these things with for sure

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980
us to all these things with for sure
 

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.740
us to all these things with for sure
they're hiding something these are kind

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:06.750
they're hiding something these are kind
 

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.140
they're hiding something these are kind
for tourists right tourist traps took us

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.150
for tourists right tourist traps took us
 

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.210
for tourists right tourist traps took us
two months to realize what what the

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220
two months to realize what what the
 

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.220
two months to realize what what the
price that really were of houses and we

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.230
price that really were of houses and we
 

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.540
price that really were of houses and we

this and even the gas even energy prices

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:21.980
this and even the gas even energy prices

dramatically but it was the pump that

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:28.820
dramatically but it was the pump that
 

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.139

got people so approach now why I think

00:27:32.139 --> 00:27:32.149
got people so approach now why I think
 

00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:33.340

there two reasons one is that we all

the second thing is we see it all the
 

00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:44.289
the second thing is we see it all the
time I mean do you even know how much a

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:44.299
time I mean do you even know how much a
 

00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:46.930

it's hard to tell because we don't see

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:48.500
it's hard to tell because we don't see
 

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.950
it's hard to tell because we don't see
it but you stand next to the pump you

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960
it but you stand next to the pump you
 

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.780
it but you stand next to the pump you
fill it up there's nothing else to do

two things happen you know how much it

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:56.810
two things happen you know how much it
 

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.440
two things happen you know how much it
cost and you buy multiple units every

00:27:59.440 --> 00:27:59.450
cost and you buy multiple units every

200% recently but when we buy bread we
 

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.890

much so now the question is what do we

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:45.920
much so now the question is what do we
 

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.730
much so now the question is what do we
do with electricity at home how do we

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:48.740
do with electricity at home how do we
 

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.640

increase it by one degree and we just
 

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.000
increase it by one degree and we just
don't know these numbers but I think
