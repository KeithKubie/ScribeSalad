00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
hey what's up guys welcome back

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.720
now in a previous video I showed you how we can

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.220
take those little party poppers and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.049
convert them into an extremely powerful

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.420
confetti cartridge these are basically

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.160
just water bottles charged with hydroxy

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.870
gas packed tight with colored dots

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.429
punched out of construction paper and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.500
held in place with fire resistant party

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.480
streamers I got from the dollar store

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.160
if we try touching an open flame to the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.660
stream or you can see it really doesn't

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.130
burn and that's good because we're going

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.900
to have a live match going off inside of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.609
there you can see that no matter what

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.080
direction the bottle is in for the most

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.240
part the confetti stays near the top and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.489
that's what we want now for this video I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.020
thought it'd be fun to make a trip wire

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.579
trigger board for setting these things

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.860
off remotely or safely from a distance

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.989
this is the basic idea of how our trip

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.280
wire trigger board is going to work

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.800
simply remove the safety switch position

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.750
the trigger any direction you want

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
when this switch gets tripped that's when all

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.539
the fun begin it's quite a bit easier to

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.920
make that it look so let's dive right in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.120
and I'll show you how

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.940
for our booby trap

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.980
mounting board I went to the hardware

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.609
store and found a scrap piece of pine

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.170
common board and cut it so it's eight

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.390
inches long and five inches tall now if

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.710
you want to get fancy just throw it on

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.390
your wood router and route the edges

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.470
that give it a really clean and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.360
professional look and if you want to go

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.830
the extra mile you can even give it a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.450
camouflage paint job that just makes it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.229
look really clean and professional

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.970
wherever you put it now for

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.229
functionality I'm going to start off

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.790
with our lantern battery I'm going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.650
place it right in the center of the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.540
board here but before we secure this in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.799
place it's a good idea to take our

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.450
trigger mechanism and make sure that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.950
there's enough clearance to clear that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.479
lantern battery because this will give

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.310
us the option to place it down up or

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.140
even sideways depending on what setting

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.250
and what you were going to use it for

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.439
aside from that we're bringing back the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.150
hydrogen generator to split water into

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.280
hydrogen oxygen gas filling up a water

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.020
bottle and mounting all these components

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.119
to this board let's go ahead and put it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.190
all together now

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.500
now you're going to need some kind of an

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.420
insulated copper cord I just went down

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.710
to the thrift store and bought a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.660
cell phone charger for about a dollar cut the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.400
head off split it down the center

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.680
and just like that we've got two insulated

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.040
copper wires that would be perfect for this project

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.720
okay that looks preety awesome using one of the bottle caps I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.890
going to rig up a system that allow us

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.020
to easily swap out igniters so this

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.520
system we're reusable and you won't have

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.140
to keep hot gluing igniters and every

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.850
time you use it the way to do that is to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.710
poke a small hole through the cap run

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.270
both wires and then hot glue it from

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.860
both sides and we're going to hot glue

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.630
the wires as well so they keep a little

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.860
bit of a distance from each other and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.630
they don't accidentally short out inside

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.280
the bottle I'm also going to be using

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.020
some of these homemade igniters we made

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.580
it in one of our rocket projects that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.650
use the match and one thin wire tonight

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.810
with electricity and all triggered by

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.250
one of these clothes pin tripwire

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.390
mechanisms that will show you how to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.100
make another future project

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.600
so theoretically this is how the system is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.920
going to work we've got a six volt

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.630
lantern battery that can set off a match

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.220
by itself but we've rigged it up with

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.540
the circuitry so that our two broken

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.370
circuits as long as the circuit is open

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.170
there's no way that match can light but

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.540
once we close that the only switch left

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.770
waiting to be activated is the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.660
clothespin when the centerpiece gets

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.100
pulled out these electrical contacts

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.750
will slam shut shooting electricity

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.250
through the igniter which will flare up

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.480
light off the gas and make a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.400
surprisingly powerful explosion which

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.930
will make a huge mess that somebody's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.550
going to have to clean up now if you've

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.900
ever used a firearm you know there's a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.430
safety feature that will block you from

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.260
pulling the trigger prematurely in the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.940
same respect I've added a safety feature

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.680
to this where a pin has to be pulled out

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.630
first before you can actually initiate

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.340
the trip wire from here all we have to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.260
do is remove the cap insert the igniter

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.180
set it in the system and it's pretty

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.500
much charged and ready to go at that

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.230
point

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.580
so now that we've got this beautiful

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.019
contraption built there's a lot of

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.280
different ways that we can integrate in

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.840
fact the imagination is probably your

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.010
only limitation you could use it

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.379
anywhere one of these worked up in a

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.060
break room works great for pranking one

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.769
of your fellow employees ring this

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.269
contraption through the microwave hide

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.769
it in the wastebasket and when they go

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.140
to grab their lunch they're going to be

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.960
in for a majors

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.800
another idea is to mount

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.060
this contraption on the doorframe in the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.680
bathroom or some other room that doesn't

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.299
get used very often use something like

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.980
double sided sticky tape to stick it to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.540
the wall rig the fishing line to the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.700
back of the door and very carefully set

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.380
the trigger the next time someone walks

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.000
through that door unsuspectingly they're

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.160
probably gonna end up making a huge mess of their own

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.440
guys its important to

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.340
remember this is actually a really

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.109
really dangerous project these are not

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.400
the kind of pranks you want to play on

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.930
your coworkers these are more of the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.580
kind of jump scare prank you'd play on

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.949
me but this concept could easily be

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.810
adapted to make a trip wire alarm an

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.400
airsoft grenade you could use this

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.199
system to light fireworks safely from a

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.030
distance or even make a zombie perimeter

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.560
breach so you get a heads up on when

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.360
they're coming so there you have it guys

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.099
that's how to make a booby-trapped

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.580
tripwire trigger board

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.950
stay safe and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.260
I'll see you in the next project video

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.100
talk to you then.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.860
BOOM!

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.900
I forgot my earplugs (Guy in background: I did too) .dang it hahaha that hurt a lot
