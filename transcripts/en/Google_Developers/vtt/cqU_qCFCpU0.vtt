00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:01.790
DON DODGE: Hi.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.770
I'm Don Dodge.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.660
And this is Google
Root Access.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.990
Today I'm in London at the
Google Campus, a startup

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.380
facility here for many,
many startups.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.020
And I'm here today with
Eze Vidra, the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.750
manager of the campus.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.180
EZE VIDRA: Hi, Don.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.940
Thanks for having me.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.430
My name is Eze Vidra.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.260
And I'm the head of Campus
here in London.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.380
And it's my pleasure to
introduce you to the Campus

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.950
London community.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.270
DON DODGE: So, Eze, tell me
about Campus London and how it

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.880
got started and what it is.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.560
EZE VIDRA: Sure.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.759
Usually the way that I describe
Campus, if there was

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.260
an equivalent between real
estate and software, Campus

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.690
would be an open source
building.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.300
It's like an API for startups,
which means it's a seven story

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.980
building in East London that's
filled with startups.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.200
Like any operating system or
open source system, it would

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.030
be boring if one company
did all the apps.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.010
So we work with multiple
partners and with the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.680
community to power the startup
ecosystem in London.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.450
DON DODGE: So incubators and
accelerators are pretty common

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.920
around the world.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.440
Is there any difference
here in London?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.220
Or is it about the same?

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.260
EZE VIDRA: I would say that
generally, the accelerators

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.810
follow the same program
or the same template.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.570
There's many startups
that apply.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.800
Some of them get selected.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.050
And then the lucky ones
receive mentorship and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.600
investment and support.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.570
We have seed camp.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.860
We have springboard.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.960
We have [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.570
ventures, Entrepreneur First.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.970
There's an explosion of programs
coming out of London.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.320
And I'm happy to say that
they're going really well.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.920
So there's lots of them
involved in Campus as

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.500
partners, and you can see them
rotate every three months on

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.980
the third floor.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.010
DON DODGE: And what is Google's

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.150
involvement in Campus London?

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.820
EZE VIDRA: So we run several
programs and initiatives to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.160
support startups and help them
get visibility, mentorship

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.790
skills, and education.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.400
Our umbrella program is called
Campus EDU, and it has three

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.390
sections to it.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.190
One is office hours, where every
Friday, Googlers come to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.040
campus to provide mentorship
for the startups.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.890
We've been doing it for the
last 10 months, and we had

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.750
over 350 startups that receive
mentorship and over 200

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.670
Googlers that mentored.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.090
This is anything from Android
to recruiting to technical

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.990
advice, et cetera.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.210
And it's been going
really well.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.320
The second part is inspirational
talks, bringing

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.220
thought leaders like Eric
Schmidt, Jimmy Wales, or Guy

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.130
Kawasaki to inspire the startups
in different talks

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.180
that we hold for the residents
and members of Campus.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.730
And finally, we're launching
in May the classes part in

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.100
collaboration with different
universities and corporate

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.340
partners, giving startups the
education that they need when

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.840
they need it.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.770
And also mixing these two
groups that they're very

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.000
important for one another.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.410
One is the students
on one hand.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.760
And the other one is the
startups in the field.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.800
DON DODGE: So Google purchased
this building in East London?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.710
Is that right?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.290
EZE VIDRA: We took a
long lease on this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.120
building in East London.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.610
Yeah.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.210
DON DODGE: OK.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.180
And Google's providing the
building for this?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.260
And the startups come
here for free?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.240
Or how does that work?

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.515
EZE VIDRA: Sure.

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:55.400
So Campus is the not for profit
activity for Google.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.250
I run a P&amp;L. But I always
jokingly say that it's mostly

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.440
L.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.590
And what we did is we took a
long lease on the building, we

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860
renovated it, and then we
partnered with multiple

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.990
partners to operate different
parts of the building.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.760
So on the lower floor, we have
a cafe that's an open space

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670
for entrepreneurs,
with fast Wi-Fi.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.360
Any entrepreneur can sign
up and work from

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.900
the cafe for free.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.220
And that's essentially like a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.670
Starbucks filled with startups.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.890
There's over 12,000 people that
have registered to work

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.840
from the cafe.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.740
That's operated by
Central Working.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.540
And then we have two floors of
co-working space operated by

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.190
our partner TechHub
where startups can

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.750
simply rent a desk.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.910
Then we have accelerator
programs that we rotate every

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.790
three months.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.150
And then we have Seedcamp
startup weekend and Kodak,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.980
which is a union trade for
startups, if you will.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.500
DON DODGE: Great.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.010
Yes, so I saw Seedcamp was
here, and TechHub .

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.080
They've been ongoing
for a while.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.400
So they joined into Campus
to do their programs?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.670
EZE VIDRA: Yeah, so we decided
on a partnership approach when

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.070
we launched Campus to leverage
the experience and the

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.420
goodwill of basically the
partners that have been most

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.180
active in the scene in London.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.730
So rather than dropping in on
East London and trying to

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.370
reinvent the wheel, or compete
with local players, we

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.120
partner with them.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.570
And it's been going
really well.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.490
Actually, what we're seeing
is that as an open source

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.089
building, we not only generate
all the community activity

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.510
from our own events and our
own networks, but we also

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.110
bring in all of this experience
and passion from

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.680
other people.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.940
So you can see events from any
of the partners and from the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.510
community, ranging from
community meetups, like tech

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.810
meetups on PHP or big data to
hack-a-thons over the weekend.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.910
And it's just incredible
to see that range.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.760
We had over 60,000 people
in year one

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.770
attending the events alone.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
And we hosted 868 events
in year one.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.070
DON DODGE: Wow.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.410
That's a lot.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.900
How many companies are
actually here?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.770
EZE VIDRA: So we've helped
over 1,000 startups since

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.820
we've launched Campus
a year ago.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.320
There's over 100 startups
working from Campus everyday.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.800
And that's ranging from the cafe
to the co-working areas

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.720
to the third floor to Seedcamp
startups, et cetera.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.270
So it's very fluid because every
now and then you would

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.300
see a delegation of startups
doing a pilgrimage to Campus

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.250
just to pitch on the
Campus stage.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.100
So at any given point, you can
have 20 startups coming from

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.670
Belgium or from Korea simply
to get involved with the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.060
Campus community.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.980
DON DODGE: So that's an
interesting point.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.260
Campus is sort of a catalyst
to bring together investors

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.640
and startups and resources
and mentors.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.060
So how many events are you
doing every month?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.620
EZE VIDRA: So in February alone,
we hosted 133 events.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.990
In April, now, we're celebrating
the Campus one

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.820
year anniversary.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.550
And every day there's a
major event going on.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.020
So today, for example, it was
a pleasure to have you speak

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.760
at the Investor Open Day, which
attracted the whole VC

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.670
community and angel community
in London, to come and see

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.090
what we're doing
at the Campus.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.350
So it's quantity, but it's also
the quality of events.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.090
I think it's unparalleled
anywhere in the world the

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.750
number of entrepreneurship and
startup events we do here on a

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.560
daily basis.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.500
DON DODGE: And I think today you
announced a new thing to

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.420
bring in investors.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.940
How often are you going
to do that?

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.600
EZE VIDRA: That's correct.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.400
So we identified that investment
is a key part, a

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.170
key interest, of the
startups at Campus.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.830
But we haven't done anything
actively to attract investors

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.115
until now, although 50% of the
Campus residents told us that

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:26.880
they met with investors
at Campus.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.720
So today, we launched the Campus
Capitol Office Hours,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.430
bringing investors every two
weeks for office hours, and

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.750
then having them essentially
using meritocracy,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.100
participating, mentoring the
startups and giving them

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.460
inspiration and skills.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.930
And then the investors that
participate in the office

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.090
hours will get invited to a
Campus Demo Day periodically,

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.120
twice a year, where they
can see a bunch of

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.170
companies in one go.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.140
Similar to Y Combinator, except
it doesn't have the

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.600
program around it.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.880
DON DODGE: So if I have an
idea and I'm working with

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.300
another engineer putting
it together, how

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.850
do I get into Campus?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.570
Should I submit to Seedcamp
or to TechHub?

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.430
What's the process
for getting in?

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.960
EZE VIDRA: So as an API for
startups, there's multiple

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.910
ways, multiple calls you
can make to the API.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.660
Most people start
from the cafe.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.670
It's full everyday.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.190
It's free.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.700
All you have to do is register
on CampusLondon.com, and you

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.250
can work for free in the cafe.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.420
If you have a little bit of
money, you can rent a desk and

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.470
essentially participate
in a co-working space.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.310
Rather than getting your own
office and try to kit it with

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.880
internet connection, printers,
et cetera, you can simply rent

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.940
a desk for a nominal fee, and
you're surrounded by a

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.240
community and you're
in business.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.250
Shared conference rooms,
et cetera.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.100
Other people apply to
Accelerator programs.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.020
It really depends on the
stage of your startup.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.605
If you're in the early days of
the startup, and you're a

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:47.690
first time founder, Seedcamp
or one of the Accelerator

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.540
programs are a great way to
receive this mentorship and

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.180
avoid some typical mistakes that
can cost you the startup.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.560
And then if you're not really
sure that you want to be an

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.020
entrepreneur, I would recommend
that you join a

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.580
hack-a-thon or a startup weekend
event, where you can

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.220
really feel the teamwork, the
creativity, and the time

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.990
pressure of building a startup
in 54 hours without

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.700
quitting your job.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.950
So there's many ways that
people can participate.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.340
And we see it every day.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.580
DON DODGE: So you've
seen hundreds of

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.550
startups already at Campus.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.995
Are you seeing any trends or
things you're interested in?

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:21.430
EZE VIDRA: You know, that's a
really interesting question.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.980
The majority of the startups at
Campus are early stage web

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.260
and mobile, mainly consumer
applications.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.190
We've been seeing an increase
of hardware startups.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.190
For example, there's a startup
that's making a mobile phone

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.140
touch screen made of bamboo.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.250
It uses Android as an
operating system.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.600
But the casing of the phone
is made of wood, and it's

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.539
ecologically friendly,
et cetera.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.750
There's another hardware startup
that's created a bike

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.410
light for bicycle riders
to prevent

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.110
the blind spot problem.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.220
So if you're a bus, you probably
couldn't see the bike

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.890
coming next to you.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.490
And it causes lots of deaths
every year in London.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.490
Now with this light, it projects
a laser on the floor,

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.690
and the bus driver is able to
see the bike from far away.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.810
These startups are raising
funding through Kickstarter,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.260
which has really changed all
the hardware landscape, I

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.740
would say, for consumers.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.270
And then other trends include
advertising technology.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.680
Lots of the big agencies
are here.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.760
And we're seeing some
destructive Ad-Tech companies.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.540
For example, there's a
multi-device startup that's

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.560
just raised a million in seed,
part of the Entrepreneur First

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.950
accelerator program that we
hosted for three months.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.720
[? Avocarot, ?]

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.010
that's trying to basically fix
the problem of display

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.840
advertising on mobile and
do context-specific ads.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.510
So when you finish a run,
it'll show you an ad for

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.230
Lucozade, or for some sort of
drink, versus showing you the

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.260
ad for an online game.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.850
So I would say advertising
technology, definitely.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.410
Financial technology is another
big trend in London.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.550
But generally speaking, I think
the startup ecosystem in

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.890
London is in a stage where
we're throwing a lot of

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.290
spaghetti on the wall, and
we're seeing what sticks.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.910
But I think that eventually
we'll converge to Fin Tech, Ad

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.340
Tech, fashion in the areas of
London as an industry has very

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.580
strong presence.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.110
DON DODGE: So Financial
Tech, advertising

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.690
technology, and fashion.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.425
Those are three that seem
to be pretty big here?

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:12.760
EZE VIDRA: Yeah.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.860
And gaming also has a big
presence, although there's

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.840
other pockets of gaming
in Europe

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.940
that maybe are stronger.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.690
You know, in the Nordics
or in the north of

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.370
Scotland, as well.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.760
DON DODGE: Any companies
that you've seen--

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.520
you mentioned a couple--

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.330
that you're interested in, that
you think are leading?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.370
EZE VIDRA: I'll tell you one
company that I'm excited about

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.910
and one company that has an
interesting story from Campus.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.640
So one that I'm excited about
is called Eyetease.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.440
And they're putting Wi-FI
into London cabs.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.740
And the way that they're paying
for it is by installing

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.790
an LCD screen on the roof of the
cab that enables you to do

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.850
real time geo-located
advertising.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.950
So when the cab is passing next
to a McDonald's, you're

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.130
able to show them a very
specific ad for that moment.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.020
So as a user, I'm really excited
to have Wi-Fi in cabs.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.320
And that's why I'm excited
about this startup.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.640
There is a company called
Subscrib, where the founders

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.800
actually met in the cafe and
they were thinking about--

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.740
at the cafe at Campus-- and they
were thinking about, how

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.830
can we improve the loyalty
between brick and mortar

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.310
retailers and their customers?

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.240
You know,when you go to an
e-commerce site, they

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:16.970
know who you are.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.560
They are able to email you
and call you back.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.190
But when you go to a physical
store, you just pay cash and

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.620
you're anonymous to them.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.380
So they created a
loyalty scheme.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.960
They managed to implement it in
the cafe downstairs, where

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.340
users pay 40 pounds at the
beginning of the month, and

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.750
then they get 50 pounds value
in products in the cafe.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.730
They did really well.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.270
They rented a desk on TechHub.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.530
They spent a couple of months
in the co-working space.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.810
They applied to Seedcamp.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.370
And in four months, this company
now has a product,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.870
revenues, customers.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.480
And they would never be where
they are today if it wasn't

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.990
for Campus.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.700
So I really like that story.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.000
DON DODGE: All right.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.890
Great story.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.220
Another story, Babelverse.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.210
I saw them--

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.500
I think they were a Startup
Weekend company.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.750
And I saw them at Tech Crunch
Disrupt last year.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.270
And I saw them here today.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.400
I was kind of surprised.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.690
EZE VIDRA: Yeah.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.370
Babelverse is an interesting
one.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.540
As you mentioned, it's a Startup
Weekend company.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.920
The founders met in
a Startup Weekend.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.980
They actually come from
very different places.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.830
They met in a Startup
Weekend in Greece.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.400
But none of them is Greek.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.880
And they are providing a
marketplace for interpreters,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.030
for real person interpreters.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.870
So it's a founding team of three
people, but they have

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.450
thousands of people around the
world collaborating with them

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.920
in a crowdsourcing way.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.750
And right now, they're spending
six weeks at Campus

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.070
as part of a competition we
ran, offering startups at

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.440
Campus six weeks of free office
space on the third

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.270
floor between programs, between
Accelerator programs.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.080
So I'm really excited about
having them here.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.785
Also sharing their experience
from the different stops they

00:12:46.785 --> 00:12:48.790
did around the world and
participating in all the

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.860
activities we offer.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.000
DON DODGE: Another company,
Summly, has

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.350
been in the news recently.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.740
It's a UK-based company.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.010
A 17-year-old high school kid
started the company and Yahoo

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.540
just acquired it.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.660
So that's not a Campus
London story.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.400
But it's a London story.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.260
EZE VIDRA: Yeah.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.830
You know, it makes me feel
bad about what I was

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.700
doing when I was 17.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.200
But they don't drop out
of college anymore.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.870
They're dropping out of high
school to start companies.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.620
But Nick D'Aloisio
is the founder.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.190
And it's a really interesting
story because I think it's a

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.100
reminder that exits, or
disruptive technology, can

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.320
come from anywhere
and from anyone.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.310
So Nick D'Aloisio created this
app that enables you to

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.520
summarize text by shaking
your phone.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.370
So you can take any article, you
shake the phone, and then

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.840
you receive a short
summary that's

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.610
the gist of the article.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.570
And I guess with Yahoo's focus
on content in advertising,

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.190
it's core to their strategy.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.920
And the startup after a year and
a half of operation in a

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.120
small seed investment from
[? Horizon's ?] ventures, as

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.190
far as I know, and maybe a
couple more VCs, just exited

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.360
for $20, $30 million.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.510
So not huge, but still a
reminder that entrepreneurship

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.340
is a career choice for graduates
and college students

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.360
and high school students.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.750
And also that exits can come
out of London, as well.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.950
DON DODGE: So you had a great
first year at Campus London,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.350
created it from nothing a year
ago, and now have hundreds of

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.090
startups here and thousands
of events.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.740
What's next?

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.570
EZE VIDRA: It's a
great question.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.250
You know, when we established
Campus, there was lots of

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.640
suspicion and conspiracy
theories of, why is Google

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.540
doing this?

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.560
And we're doing this to
invest in startups.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.230
We're doing is to buy
startups for cheap.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.920
And that's not the reason
for doing Campus.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.200
We're doing it to help
the ecosystem grow.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.360
And I would love to see us
continue that mission,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.230
focusing on education
and community.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.710
So, so far we've been great for
the physical community.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.580
People if they're able to come
to the building and take

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.470
advantage of the facilities
and the

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.130
services that we provide.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.820
And next, I would like to level
the playing field and

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.920
offer these sort of mentorship
and skills to entrepreneurs

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.740
around the world.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.230
So we are in the process of
installing cameras in the

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.330
event spaces.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.640
With the Campus EDU program, we
will record each event and

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.230
made it available on the
Campus YouTube channel.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.020
And I hope that with time, we
will be able to bring together

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.710
entrepreneurs, regardless of
where they're physically

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.910
located, and serve as thought
leadership or brain trust for

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.280
them to bounce ideas, to talk to
each other, and to get the

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.010
access to mentorship,
inspiration, and skills.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.790
DON DODGE: So Google is doing
this as a public investment

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.140
just to stimulate the
startup ecosystem

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.810
and support the economy?

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.440
EZE VIDRA: Absolutely.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.200
And I think that's the right
way to look at it.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.600
This is not CSR.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.520
We didn't just put the building
and said, here you

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.210
go, community.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.000
Just have it.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.960
It's an investment.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.800
And we're putting a lot of
resource and support in making

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.190
this work, and helping the
startups get traction,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.360
visibility, and mentorship.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.410
Last year, or two years now,
we established Google for

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.760
Entrepreneurs as an umbrella
organization to support

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.720
entrepreneurs wherever they
are around the world.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.940
And Campus is maybe the biggest
manifestation of

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.920
Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.090
It's a seven story building in
East London that supports the

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.880
local startup community.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.180
But I think more and more, we're
seeing these communities

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.330
bind together.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.640
Two months ago, we launched
Campus Tel Aviv.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.960
We're doing initiatives in
Berlin and in Paris to support

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.810
partners who are running these
sort of initiatives.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.930
And I would like to see more of
that collaboration across

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.470
countries, between
entrepreneurs.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.320
That they're trying to solve a
problem, disrupt technology,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.290
and change the world with it.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.040
DON DODGE: Excellent.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.010
Well thank you very much for
being with me today and

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.400
telling us the story
of Campus.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.570
And be with us again next week
when we talk about another

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.850
topic of interest to startups.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.920
Thanks.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.170
EZE VIDRA: Thank you.
