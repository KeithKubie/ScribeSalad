00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.556
The answer is 5 to the 12th. Great job if you got it. For 5 to the 8th, we would

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:10.226
write a 5, 8 times. And then we're going to write a 5, 4 times. Here are 8 5's.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:14.511
And here are 4 5's. I have them multiplied all together, so I could use an

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:19.261
exponent to represent this repeated multiplication. I have 5 to the 12th.
