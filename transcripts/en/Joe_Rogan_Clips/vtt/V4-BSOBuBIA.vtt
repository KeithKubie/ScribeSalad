00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.630
You know,
if you do a podcast and,
and the thing about the podcast with Jack,

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:05.520
it's not even,
like I said anything bad,

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:09.210
it's what I didn't say that that was upsetting to so many people.

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.530
But that's such a loaded thing.
And because of that podcast,

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.930
now there's,
there's negative to it that blow back.
There's a lot of,
you know,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
toxic anger and all that.
But the positive is what I like,

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.840
the positive that came out of it is me forced to reexamine how I do podcasts,

8
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:31.110
reexamined the significance of each individual guests and especially someone

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.450
that comes with as much baggage,
you know,
without lack of a better term,
uh,

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.970
as Jack that you're,
you know,

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
you gotta think that there's people listening and there's some questions that

12
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.990
you really have to work at.
You have to,
you have to push through.

13
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.160
And even if he's,
he's dancing and pure wedding,
I should have went back to,
okay,

14
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.030
why is Kathy Griffin on your platform?
Yeah.
Like if doxing is bad,
you want,

15
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.940
you don't want a docs,
you don't want threat to violence.
When someone says,

16
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.850
I want names.
Okay.
What are you going to do with these fucking names,
right?

17
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.680
What are you gonna do with them?

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.540
What are you gonna do with a 16 year old kid and his names?

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.460
And then when you see the actual,
the actual video of what actually happened,

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.750
and there's so many people that are still not walking it back still.
No,
I know.

21
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.210
Doubling down.
A lot of people doubled down.
Fuck him.

22
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.320
And here's another little piece of insight.
My friend Matt,
uh,

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.910
lived in DC and those hats,
those mega hats,
they're fucking everywhere.

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.010
There's these little,
where these kids were,
that area.

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.470
There's these carts that sell these hats.

26
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.930
So these kids bought those hats that day.

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.120
It's not like they're these mag of kids.

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.530
They'd probably just be an assholes right there,
unsupervised teenage boys.

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.010
Their frontal lobe is not fully formed and they're all together,

30
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.610
feeding off each other like a pack of Gremlins.
Yeah.
I was a teenage boy.

31
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:48.330
You were a teenage boy.
You know how fucking stupid used to be.
I mean,

32
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:52.950
I was probably way more stupid than you,
but I was a mess.
I had my moments.
Yeah.

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.930
Um,
no,
I'd be just,
you get a hundred teenage boys together in a crowd,
you know,

34
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:02.490
on a school trip and you get some native elder drumming in one of the one in

35
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:07.140
some guys face.
Yeah.
You know,
it was amazing what didn't happen.
Exactly.

36
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.650
So violence,
no violence,
the way he handled it all.
He did a smile.
Yeah.

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.590
So I mean,
listen,

38
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:18.591
I'm as biased as anyone against a Catholic school kid wearing a Maga hat.

39
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.100
Yes.
Like you know,
like given,
given my backstory is like yeah,
I'm totally poised.

40
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.950
I think this guy is an asshole and this likely always to be an asshole.

41
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.530
But what people read into an uncomfortable smile,
right?

42
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:36.360
I mean just like the,
the,
the,
the shots of his face with the tweets that said,

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.870
you know,
this is what white privilege looks like.
This is,
you know,
this is,

44
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.880
this is everything that's wrong in our society.

45
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.970
It's just we have to slow down.

46
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.090
How about raise a road if you ever seen them more Andrea punchable face.

47
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.680
Come on man.
You want to punch him?
Yeah.
Cause he's smiling,
which is call me.

48
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:57.270
Start on razor calls for violence from the left are so fucking disturbing to me

49
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.980
because my parents were hippies when I grew up.

50
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.070
I always thought of the left and we always,
I've,
you know,

51
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:04.000
I've been called right way.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.360
I've never voted anything but democratic in my life except for Gary Johnson.

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.360
Gary Johnson was the only time I've voted independent or whatever the fuck you

54
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.150
was libertarian.
Right.
But that was just because he did my podcast.

55
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.480
I'll Tulsi Gabbard cause she did my podcast.

56
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.990
But the th th th th the left was always very considerate.

57
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
Well read.
They were,
there were the people that were more openminded,

58
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.860
there were supporting of gay people and minorities.

59
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.690
That was the left and there were nonviolent.

60
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.180
They were the people that are protesting Vietnam when I was a kid.

61
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.210
We're also just supportive of the virtue of speech and free speech and self

62
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.620
criticism.
Yes.
Right.
Like the,
the,

63
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.070
the disadvantage of the left against the right has always been there's this self

64
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:53.080
scrutiny and willingness to wonder whether or not I'm wrong.

65
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.790
That isn't mirrored if you go far enough.
Right.
And,
uh,

66
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.990
it has,
there has been,

67
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.750
so there's been kind of an asymmetric war between left and right.
You know,

68
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:03.880
politically from,
for much of our lifetime.

69
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.550
But you go far enough left now and you're,

70
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.670
you're meeting a kind of totalitarian resistance to speech and it's,

71
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:16.660
um,
yeah,
it's very,
I mean I'm just,
it'll be interesting to see how the,

72
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.090
the 2020 campaign plays out.

73
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.270
I'm certainly worried that we could totally blow it with some leftist social w

74
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350
uprising.
Yeah,

75
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.710
that would be unfortunate because I think they would just double down the other

76
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:32.770
side.
We,
we'd be better off with some sort of a reasonable centrist.
Right.

77
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.020
Someone who has just made sense.
And you know,

78
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.440
one of the things that I liked about Tulsi is that she's a veteran and you know,

79
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.410
I mean like she's,
she seems very reasonable to me,

80
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:46.411
but except that I haven't followed her career closely,

81
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:51.280
but it just seems like she's not making the right noises on things like Syria

82
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:54.280
and Assad and yeah.
I don't know enough about that to comment.

83
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.550
I don't know enough about Assad and the controversial,

84
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.220
whether or not he'd gassed is whether,
I bet that that is,
I think,

85
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:03.100
uncontroversial in terms of what she,
I mean,

86
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.000
that that is uncontroversial with which,
in terms of what she is saying about it,

87
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.490
about him,
I mean,
she's capable of putting both feet in her mouth on that.

88
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.090
And she's saying he's not an enemy of America.
Right.
So,
yeah,
I mean,
again,

89
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.810
I'm not close enough to it and it,
but I would,
you know,

90
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.650
be very circumspect about endorsing her going forward.

91
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.430
And we could do a little homework because I think her candidacy is not going to

92
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.390
age well.
That's a.
