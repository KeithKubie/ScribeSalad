00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.900
BOB HARRIS: Thanks, Jay.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.372 --> 00:00:03.844
JAY: All right.

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:04.316
BOB HARRIS: Give
it up for Jay.

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.204
Give it up for Jay, everybody.

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:09.140
Ah, Jay.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.870
Hi.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.770
Thank you for being here.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.305
And if there are any technical
problems during the course of

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.490
the presentation, I'm the
only one here who

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.470
doesn't work at Google.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.030
It's my fault.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.770
Anything that goes wrong,
it's all on me.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.740
Just know that right
from the start.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.630
I just want to take
a second to just--

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.880
let's just look at this young
lady for just a second.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.030
Now, we're incredibly good as
human beings at just glancing

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.260
at somebody else and getting
a vibe of who they are.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.500
Somebody gets in the elevator.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.900
In about 15 seconds, you wind
up making some sort of

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.880
judgment that if you were to
talk to them for an hour, 80%

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.450
of the time, you actually have a
pretty good sense, just from

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.150
body language and stuff.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.210
And this woman could
have been a--

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.630
depending on how the birth
lottery works out, could have

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.310
been a grad student somewhere
here, or maybe she's the lady

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.510
who takes your blood in the
hospital, or she's the doctor.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.370
Or who knows?

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.610
She could be anything.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970
Unfortunately, this
is in Cambodia.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.700
She's standing in front of
her home near Siem Reap.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.050
That corrugated tin
is her home.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.620
And she works insane hours.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.970
I doubt-- and I know people at
Google work really hard hours.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.740
I doubt there's anyone in
here who works longer

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.490
hours than she does.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170
At the time I met her, she's 29
years old, married to a guy

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.060
the same age.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.650
Between the two of them,
they have four jobs.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.000
She has a roadside kiosk where
she sells gum and sundries and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.150
so on to passersby for about six
hours in the morning, and

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.200
then she goes in and works a
full-time job as one of the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.600
people in the tourist hotels,
the fancy ones near Siem Reap,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.700
where tourists come and go and
take the big tour of the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.880
Angkor Wat.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.800
And the little kiosk that she
has is funded with microloans.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.670
And she makes a small but
regular profit at this kiosk.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.020
And with that and her husband's
jobs and so on,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.390
they're trying to
build a life.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.720
She's not getting rich doing
this, but it's helping her

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.320
build her life.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.240
It's really cool.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.630
And I was honored to-- when I
met her, she opens the door,

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.560
says, hey, come on in.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.150
Super cool.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.150
I sat down on the carseat, the
front car seat that's the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.449
couch on the porch.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.699
And we hung out and had
a wonderful day.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.400
This was actually very typical
of a lot of the people I met.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.360
Now, I want to back up a little
bit and give you just a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.360
quick thumbnail of how
I came to this.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.240
I want to make it really clear,
I don't work for Kiva.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.310
I don't speak for Kiva.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.840
They're just a charity I really
like, that I've written

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.520
a book about.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.960
And when I first came in the
front door, I really didn't

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.450
know, does this work?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.120
Is this great?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.240
Is it wonderful?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.400
What am I getting into?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.250
And I found a lot of good stuff
here, but I want to tell

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.370
you a little bit about
myself, too.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.550
The main thing that I--

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.290
I have had an insanely
lucky life.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.110
I won every lottery
there is, I think.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.740
I grew up middle class,
don't get me wrong.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.670
But I've gotten to do
stuff like that.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.800
And I wrote for "CSI" and for
"Bones." And I've done TV.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.430
And I've made aquatic friends.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.763
And I've had just a wonderful
opportunity to go

00:02:58.763 --> 00:02:59.410
out and see the world.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.600
I've kissed the Blarney Stone,
a couple times, actually.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.480
It and I got on real well.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.520
I've rocked the actual kasbah,
which is, it turns out, a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.190
really great place to play beach
soccer, which is neat.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.620
The countries in red are
the ones I've had the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.220
opportunity to visit.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.760
As you can see, I
suck at Africa.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.500
I need to catch up there.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.970
Central Asia is a definite
weakness.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.390
But I've had the opportunity
to see the world.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.640
I was a travel writer
for a while.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.030
And as you travel enough, I
mean, on the surface, there's

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.760
like all these different
cultures and languages and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.890
customs and so on.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.700
But eventually, and maybe it's
just user fatigue from the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.540
world or something.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.630
But for me, as I watched people
playing their music and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.600
hanging out, it just turns into
this beautiful pageant of

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.690
people where stuff that looks
different on the surface all

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.180
starts feeling like a coat of
paint you could scratch off

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.190
with a fingernail.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.860
I mean, the truth is,
everybody's just trying to put

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.540
food on the table.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.230
Everybody's just trying to
take care of their kids.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.960
I mean, we're in Santiago,
Chile, in this photo here, and

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.330
these are Goth kids in Santiago,
Chile, who are

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.680
demonstrating how different they
are from everyone else by

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.400
dressing exactly like
Goth kids in every

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.900
other part of the world.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.570
That's kind of a wonderful,
isn't it?

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.690
So I don't know what those
guys were doing.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.190
And we blow on our blowers,
and we ride around on our

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.260
giant contraptions, and we
dance, and we play, and we

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.380
beat each other up.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.300
And it just turns into this--

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.660
just, I don't know, festival
as I was traveling.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.700
I just wound up making friends,
like every single

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.900
place I ever went, over and
over and over and over,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.180
including places that I just
didn't think I'd necessarily

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.040
be welcomed.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.160
This is Egypt in 2004 as the
United States was invading

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.620
Iraq, and the Middle East
was supposed to

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.370
be very, very dangerous.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.450
And there's anti-American
sentiment.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.310
And I got gang befriended just
walking around the streets of

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.950
Alexandria.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.510
People would find out I was an
American, and they didn't

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.650
blame me for what the American
government was doing because

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.100
Egyptians have some experience
with the government not doing

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.120
what they want it to do.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.180
So they didn't blame me
personally, and I was just

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.540
gang befriended everywhere
I went.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.110
Put microfinance aside.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.870
No matter what we might talk
about with Kiva or whatever,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.210
if you have to leave, if there's
any takeaway that I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.170
would want people to have from
this, it's that if you walk in

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.430
with an open heart, you would
have been befriended exactly

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.710
the same way, too.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.940
It's a cool planet.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.620
There's a couple of dozen
dangerous places that I

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.630
wouldn't want to go to, but
just a couple of dozen.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.030
And at the end of the day, we
knock off from our job.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.560
We put our arm around
somebody we love.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.440
We take good care of our
children, and we go home.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.930
But that view of the world
is not one that's

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.740
very common in America.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.140
This is in Australia.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.960
These are actual paid cricket
seats at a cricket match.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.820
Not the best seats I've
ever been in.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.220
There's a thing-- that big wall,
it's a sight screen.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.220
It rolls back and forth.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.960
It's so that the batter on the
other side of the wall has a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.670
clear background
as the pitch--

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.970
as the boulder delivers
the ball.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.470
And they'll roll it right
in front of you.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.000
If the batsman needs it
there, it's there.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.430
And suddenly you can't see.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.510
And for me, this is very much
a metaphor for watching

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.360
American news when it broadcasts
about-- when it's

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.200
talking about international
affairs.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.610
You really can't see much if
you're watching American news,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.230
because the rest of the
world is blowing up.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.940
It's on fire.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.070
There's bad things happening.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.260
People are oppressing each
other in the streets, and

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.110
that's kind of all you see.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.820
You don't see all that wonderful
stuff I just showed

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.940
you, which you, your own
experience, I'm sure as you

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.540
travel, you have the same--

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.300
a very similar experience.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.300
This is what we get in the
media, is fresh wave of terror

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.490
feared, which is an actual
headline in Belfast.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.870
And I have to tell you, how do
you not fear a wave of terror?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.310
It's a wave of terror.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.060
You'll fear it.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.550
I mean, it's kind
of hardwired.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.890
And by the way, does Belfast
in Northern Ireland really

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.350
need alarmism in the media?

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.320
Is that helping?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.630
Do they really need that?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.630
So anyway, in the course of all
of this crazy luck that

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.160
I've had, in 2008, I lucked out
some more, and I wandered

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.100
into a job doing
luxury travel.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.430
I worked for Forbes Traveler,
writing reviews of the finest

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.160
accommodations on Earth.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.380
Now, again, let me back up.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.410
I'm middle class.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.700
My dad worked for General Motors
for 37 years, came home

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.660
exhausted at the
end of the day.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.340
My mom worked in a
five and dime.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.970
My grandfather was
a coal miner.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.220
I can go full Loretta Lynn
on you if you need.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.640
And suddenly, I'm jetting around
the world, going to the

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.155
South of France, to the English
countryside, and I'm

00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:33.900
eating things I can't
pronounce.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.305
And it's my job to walk in
with the white glove.

00:07:37.305 --> 00:07:39.620
And I kept waiting every second
for some waiter to

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.250
just, no, sir, you are
not part of this.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.970
And it was fun.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.590
It was super fun.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.040
So my byline winds up on things
like, "Europe's 50 Best

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.630
Hotels." I didn't even have
to choose the hotels.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.430
They'd already done it for me.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.800
I just had to show up
and verify that

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.010
the beds were comfy.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.330
And I'd write a little piece
saying, yep, beds don't suck.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.100
That was my job.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.250
I got paid to take the trip
of a lifetime that

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.890
people would want.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.480
I went all over the
world doing that.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.440
That's pretty cool.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.820
But the thing is, it
gets really boring.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.150
Because wealth without
purpose is

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.820
purposeless, kind of built-in.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.820
And I was bored out of my
mind, surprisingly.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.940
It took a few weeks.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.730
Don't get me wrong, it
took a little while.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.230
But after a while, it's
completely purposeless.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.370
And I was just losing my
mind with the boredom.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.010
I was seeing beautiful things.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.410
I mean-- oh, I don't know
how that got in there.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.530
This is another one of those
articles, "Italy's 25 Best

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.309
Hotels." It looks so much
like the other article.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.240
You'd be bored just even reading
what I was writing.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.620
I was bored writing it.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.270
How many synonyms for
"comfortable" are there,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.630
really, in the English
language?

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.930
There's just not much
you can do.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.880
So I'm traveling around.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.480
I'm seeing all this stuff.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.230
And finally, I'm in
the Emirates.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.740
And the United Arab Emirates,
as you know,

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.060
have a little money.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.170
And this is the Emirates Palace
in Dubai, which at the

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.380
time, was the most expensive
hotel in the world.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.990
$3 billion luxury
accommodation.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.660
And I should tell you, that is
not the Emirates Palace.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.920
That office building size thing,
that's the entrance

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.900
gate to the Emirates Palace.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.250
I'm standing on the steps of
the Emirates Palace looking

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.620
out at the entrance gate.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.330
It's actually best viewed
by one of your

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.690
products, Google Earth.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.970
The triumphalist entrance
gate, that's this little

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.470
building right here.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.780
That's the Emirates Palace,
which actually has as much

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.560
floor space as the Pentagon.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.730
There's a kilometer of private
beach and they have--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.940
it was insane.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.880
And this is where heads of
state come and stay.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.980
And by the way, the
beds are comfy.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.320
It was a fantastic time.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.990
Now, you can live in this kind
of wealth and feel fairly

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.680
stable and guilt free and so
on in the South of France.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.350
You don't have poverty
right in your face.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.600
You don't see the
rich and poor.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.520
But in the Emirates,
it's right there.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.270
This is a couple days later.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.380
I'm in Dubai.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.890
And who's building
these places?

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.130
Essentially, indentured
servants.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.460
It's people from South Asia.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.690
There's some Southeast Asians,
East Africans.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.930
And they're getting paid at the
time, depending on whose

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.360
reports you're believing at
the time, $6 a day, $7,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.880
whatever, to work 12-hour days
in 105, 110-degree heat.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.445
And then they're shuttled off
back to camps in the desert

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:15.770
that aren't even on any tourist
map or whatever.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.520
They're just totally
hidden away.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.690
And they're the ones building
all these magical, wonderful

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.820
paradises that they'll never
see the insides of.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.490
And my dad worked
his butt off.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.590
And Cleveland, where I'm
from, doesn't get

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.080
as hot as the Emirates.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.660
But if the guy had worked two
shifts in a 12-hour day, and

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.570
it was 90 and humid, and he's
sitting on the front steps of

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.430
our house when I'm 12 years old,
and it's a hot August.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.020
And he's sitting there with a
beer in his hand just trying

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.740
to rally himself for another
goddamn day of this.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.720
I remember just-- you're a kid,
and you can just remember

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.960
being around it and how
painful that was.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.130
And I looked at these guys, and
I don't know why it hit me

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.940
here of all places,
but it did.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.750
I couldn't not see my dad.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.400
And then I find out that the
reason they take these gigs--

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.210
and they' ve got to go and stay
for years at a time on

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.580
their contracts--

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.850
is because they can send of that
$6 a day, maybe $3 a day

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:14.140
home to Nepal, or to India, or
wherever they're from, and

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.080
help take care of their kids.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.115
They're in this hell because
they love their families.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.680
How am I going to take this
money that I'm getting paid by

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.500
Forbes and just put it in my
pocket, and fly home, and go,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.320
well, that was spiffy?

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.150
How could I do that?

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.350
I got to do something with it.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.770
So this is where I kind of
decided that I needed to-- and

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.030
I'm seeing the world.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.130
And there's parts of the world
where that's a real modern

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.710
thing you'll see.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.510
It's like a trip back in time
in some parts of the world.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.490
And I was seeing kids
like that in India.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.250
And I just-- "Changed Priorities
Ahead." That's a

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.910
real sign, by the way.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.970
That's at Gatwick Airport
on the way out of

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.440
the rental car counter.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.690
And sure enough, the guy in that
black car up there pulled

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.538
over and started spending more
time with his family.

00:11:56.538 --> 00:12:00.180
So it's a real sign.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.910
And I passed through
that sign, and I

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.830
needed to do something.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.460
And Muhammad Yunus had won
the Noble Peace Prize.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.550
That got my attention.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.170
And I'm thinking about
these guys and

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.500
thinking about these guys.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.530
And I came across Kiva.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.715
Kiva, as you know, is
a web platform.

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:17.620
It allows people to support
microlending by putting money

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.100
in that supports the loans that
have gone out to people

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.980
in the field, small
entrepreneurs.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.990
But does it actually work?

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.060
Does the money actually
get there?

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.560
Does it actually make
any difference?

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.490
That's a big question.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.340
That matters.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.640
And there's been some
controversy about that.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.030
There's been some questions
about that.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.930
OK, well, I'm a writer.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:34.720
I need a job.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.510
What can I do?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.400
I went out to go look.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.160
I wrote a book.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.460
Let's go out and go
meet some clients.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.320
Let's meet some clients,
shall we?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.540
Our first contestant.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.440
This is a lovely woman,
Zorka Yokich.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.220
Now, by the way, meeting the
clients if you're a Kiva

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.070
lender, is not easy.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.210
This is not--

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.940
MFIs are not travel agencies.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.550
Microfinance Institutions.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.670
This took time.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.960
I had to-- and the book
goes into all of it.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.830
Basically, Kiva didn't know what
the heck to make of me

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.770
when I showed up at first.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.660
They get people all the time
saying, hey, I'd like to go

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.410
visit my clients.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.610
And they're like, yeah, you and
a million other people.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.780
But I just kind of stuck with
it, and I had a lot of travel

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.390
experience.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.190
And I'm persistent.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.120
And so a little bit of
the back story here.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.010
The MFI--

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.910
the Kiva partner in Bosnia and
Herzegovina at the time was a

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.030
branch of an international
women's organization called

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.820
Women for Women International
that do amazing work in some

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.580
of the most difficult
environments in the world.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.230
They're in Afghanistan and
Rwanda and Bosnia.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.190
And I mean, you name it.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.160
You look at their website,
Women for Women.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.710
These people rock, right?

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.380
And so in Bosnia,
after the war--

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.760
and without getting into
anything grim.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.320
But if you know what happened
during the Bosnian war, some

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.520
of the incredibly violent,
horrible things that were done

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.860
to women during that war, the
women of Bosnia need--

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.710
there's training and education
and personal support.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.420
Some of these women don't
even have counseling.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.960
And just going to a Women for
Women meeting is the first

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.920
opportunity they've had to sit
in a room together and cry, or

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.860
talk, or be hugged.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.000
I mean, they do amazing stuff.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.840
And microfinance is just
one aspect of what

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.390
Women for Women do.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.980
So I'm sitting in the office
in Sarajevo with this

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.420
wonderful woman Seida who
runs Women for Women.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.560
We're talking about this
whole project.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.580
And I mentioned--

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.080
and at this point, I'm kind of
thinking, I don't know if I'll

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.720
ever even meet any clients.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.090
And I mentioned that I've made
some loans through Kiva to

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.210
some of the clients.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.480
And she goes, oh,
you have names?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.900
And she's just going to
hook me right up.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.700
And I'm like, well, yeah,
I can tell you

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.770
who I lent to, sure.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.400
here.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.530
The next day I'm in a car.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.300
I drive up to Tuzla.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.460
Unlike Hillary Clinton,
I didn't

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.020
make a corkscrew landing.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.180
I drove to Tuzla.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.890
And the next thing you
know, I'm sitting on

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.400
Zorka's front porch.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.090
And she reminds me a heck of a
lot of my own mother to tell

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.090
you the truth.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.840
And as you can see, she's
in the pig business.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.340
She buys them and finances the
large expenditure with

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.080
microloans, then brings
them back, cuts

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.280
them up, sells them.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.320
She also has poultry and
does some other stuff.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.560
And so we're sitting on her
porch, and we're having

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.210
coffee, and we're hanging out.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.830
And in the course of the--

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.630
I'll show you this
is me with her.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.570
She was smiling the
whole time.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.030
When we took out the camera--
and this was really common.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.630
People's teeth aren't very
good in a lot of

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.320
parts of the world.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.090
So when you whip out a camera,
they kind of close up the

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:24.850
mouth a little bit.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.960
But she was a total sweetheart,
I promise you.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.940
And she's bugging me
to call my mom.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.290
When was the last time you
spoke to your own mom?

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.930
I get out the phone.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.195
I call my mom.

00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:37.460
Mom, hi, I'm in Bosnia.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.390
Yeah, Bosnia.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.040
Yeah, look it up.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.880
Yeah, anyway.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.910
So we're sitting there on the
porch and we're a short drive

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.000
from where, in the living memory
of everyone on that

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.290
porch, massacres had taken place
between Catholic Croats

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.990
and Bosnian Muslims.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.430
And we're sitting on the porch
and Women for Women

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.160
International is run primarily
by Bosnian Muslims.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.370
It's almost entirely
Bosnian Muslims.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.850
It mostly serves the Bosnian
Muslim community.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.640
My translator was a Bosnian
Muslim named Isla.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.460
So I assumed she was a Bosnian
Muslim, forgetting the giant

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.880
pig in her Kiva photo.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.670
So I just assumed she's
a Bosnian Muslim.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.840
And so I speak--

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.010
I ask some question that
presumed Islam.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.320
And Isla, my translator, turned
to me and without

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.120
translating, she said, Bob,
she's not a Muslim.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.330
She's is a Croatian.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:25.950
She's Croatian Catholic.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.050
Oh.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.700
Oh, well, let me rephrase.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.360
And we continued on.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.990
But the thing is-- and
this is some of the

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.640
tragedy of the war.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.680
It's really hard to even
tell who's who.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.760
They kind of have to
self-identify.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.840
And so then we went
on with our day.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.330
And I'm sitting there marveling
at the little bits

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.370
of business that are
starting to knit

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.360
together the community.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.430
This is something that doesn't
show up in research studies.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.700
It doesn't show up--

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.335
how do you quantify this
academically, that people can

00:16:50.335 --> 00:16:54.250
sit together and money brings
people together like this?

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.350
Another microfinance institution
there in Bosnia

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.040
named Partner I visited.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.680
They're not a Kiva partner.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.670
But one of their executives
told me--

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.050
and sometimes when English
is your second language,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.020
sometimes you have to speak
simply enough that wisdom

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.440
comes out almost accidentally.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.690
And she said, Bob, the money
has no religion.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.780
And I thought that was kind of
a cynical thing to hear.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.260
But then as I'm sitting on the
porch with Zorka, and they're

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.890
doing business with each other
regardless of religion,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.630
regardless of ethnic tension--

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.240
oh, wow, that's incredibly
useful.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.270
That's really good knowledge.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.030
OK.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.500
So that's one of the little
side effects.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.760
And this isn't something you'll
learn on the Kiva

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.750
website or in any of Kiva's
literature, or whatever.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.140
This is something you had
to actually go and

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.240
physically sit to see.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.550
And there's a bunch of
this sort of stuff.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.310
Let's go to the Philippines.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.340
I'll take you around
the world.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.620
We'll do a travelogue.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.540
This is a woman named Jennifer
whose loan I financed through

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.640
Negros Women for Tomorrow
Foundation in the Philippines.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.780
And Jennifer is on the island
of Seibo, which is kind of a

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.020
boom town island.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.640
If you make a phone call to--

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.460
jeez, Cathay Pacific, I think.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.120
Or I'm not sure.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.960
Like a lot of airlines, their
call centers are in Seibo with

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960
people on the phones.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.130
But you get out of the main
town, and you're just out in

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.120
rural villages again.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.490
And Compostela is one of
those rural villages.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.490
And this is what they call
a sari-sari store.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.080
It's a convenience store that
she runs out of her own home.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.200
Again, talk about work ethic.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.040
There are images of the poor
that we have so deeply

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.910
ingrained in American society,
that poor people are lazy or

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.645
they're unmotivated.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.950
Or that poor people are
uneducated or aren't

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.310
interested in educating
themselves.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.590
Or that poor people--

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.900
whatever.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.490
And then these stereotypes all
explode the minute you go

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.110
spend time with working poor
people here and overseas.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.290
This woman works harder than
probably anybody I ever met.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.220
And what I'm going to tell
you I still have

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.400
trouble believing myself.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.330
I had to ask the translator
three times to make sure I got

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.660
this right.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.300
The story I got, and that
everyone there was telling me.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.490
This woman, she lives
next to a quarry.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.440
And so her business is primarily
selling to the

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.060
workers from the village who
walk past her home on their

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.360
way to work in the quarry.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.970
And so as they're going to go
by and have their breakfast

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:05.890
starting at dawn, so they're
going to be wanting to eat

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.120
around 5:00 in the morning.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.010
That means she's got to be up
at 3:00 in the morning to

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.290
start cooking hot meals, which
she serves through that little

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.690
window there.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.510
And she'll have 10
or 12 meals.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.190
And when I was there, there was
still remnants of a lot of

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.270
these meals sitting out.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.950
And she sells them a nice,
hot breakfast.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.160
Now, some of them come later,
so breakfast is still being

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.880
cooked and served.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.460
And then, some guys
are heading back,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.190
and they need snacks.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.080
Somebody needs smokes.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.200
Somebody-- whatever.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.030
So that convenience store keeps
operating, and she gets

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.840
a little rest in the afternoon,
but she finally

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.630
knocks off at about 10
o'clock at night.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.630
That's a 19-hour day.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.710
That's not even physically
possible.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.320
She gets a couple hours in
the middle of the day.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.530
Her mom helps her out.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.670
OK, I can kind of see it.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.130
I buy it.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.500
And why do they do it?

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.300
Because of that little boy
there, that little boy with

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.440
his dad's head of hair.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.320
That is the best hair on a
little kid I think I've ever

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.220
seen in my whole life.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.882
I love that kid.

00:19:56.882 --> 00:20:00.190
And that's when I went and
visited them there.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.860
And that sari-sari store is
successful enough, largely

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.240
because of location.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.020
Not every sari-sari is nearly
this successful.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.950
It's a very common thing in the
Philippines, very common

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.290
business model.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.720
That sari-sari store is doing
well enough that they were

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.610
starting to hire other people
in the community to act as

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.960
delivery people.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.940
The business was expanding.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.610
It was actually creating
other jobs.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.440
Again, something
you don't see.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.510
You just even as a casual user
of the Kiva website, you don't

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.480
necessarily see that.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.090
It doesn't always show up in
academic studies because in a

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.480
whole village, how many
jobs get created?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.430
But this is a very successful
example.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.770
Here's a wonderful model.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.750
This is in Kenya.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.210
This is a guy named Symon.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.670
And by way, it says ended with
loss, currency exchange loss.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.210
The Kenyan shilling dropped
during the course of the loan.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.460
I had $25 in the guy's loan.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.150
I think I was down $0.14,
or something like that.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.170
That's what that means.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.490
Pretty trivial.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.440
But Kiva billboards.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.670
You lost $0.14.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.260
So Symon here purchased and
insured a dairy cow.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.340
This is my favorite form
of loan that I saw

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.970
anywhere in the world.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:11.770
I love this.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.920
This works.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.990
There's a company called Juhudi
Kilimo in Kenya that is

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.490
a for-profit organization.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.170
Not every Kiva partner
is not-for-profit.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.630
Some of them are very profitable
organizations.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.540
What they do--

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.770
and when I say very profitable,
I mean sustainably

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:27.270
profitable.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.140
I don't mean they're
getting rich.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.400
Don't get me wrong.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.855
Juhudi Kilimo basically
pioneered the cow loan.

00:21:34.855 --> 00:21:36.500
You know how we buy car
and we pay it off?

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.740
Suppose you're a cab driver, and
your car is your primary

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.770
business asset.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.300
And after you've paid it off in
five years or however long

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.720
your loan is, now you own the
car free and clear and you can

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.300
use it to make a profit.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.380
Now, the native cows in Eastern
Kenya are desert cows.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.905
They don't really create
a lot of milk.

00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:54.230
You can't have a dairy.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.550
But if you live in the highlands
in the middle of

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:01.530
Kenya, which is great dairy
land, cows are rock and roll.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:02.640
They're fantastic.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.300
Bring in a good Western Guernsey
and that cow, you can

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.510
use the milk.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.980
You can produce so much milk
that in the first year, you

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.330
pay that cow off.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.480
And then you've got that cow
free and clear, creating

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.330
income for as long as
that cow lives.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.340
And they even fold
a little bit of

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.570
insurance into the loan.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.990
This produces wealth.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.500
And they have a whole
pattern set up.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.770
You get one cow.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.890
Then after that cow, your second
purchase is what they

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.680
call a zero grazing unit, which
is a means of sustaining

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.370
and feeding and caring for the
cow without needing a giant

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.770
amount of pasture.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.670
And then you get the second
cow and on and on.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.260
They've got this whole path
set up that really works.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.330
I met a bunch of cow farmers
in Kenya, and they talked

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.890
about their cows
the way that--

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.480
like if I showed off a Ferrari,
that's kind of like

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.200
how they were showing
off the cow.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.540
They were so into this.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.210
That cow's name, by the way, was
Grace, I believe because

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.920
she has none.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.730
This photograph does not
capture the amount of

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.760
staggering and struggling that
was required in order for

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:06.360
Symon and Jen to get that
particular photo.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.840
And that cow loan is
really working.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.160
Now, this brings up
other problems.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.700
Success means you have new
and different problems.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.840
If everybody's producing dairy,
well, crap, now we've

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.530
got a lot of milk.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.380
What do we do about that?

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.140
Now you got to develop a better
dairy supply. chain.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.010
And sure enough, Juhudi Kilimo's
working with that.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.020
And they're working
with the Kenyan

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.950
government to get that done.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.520
But that's a great sign.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.860
So this stuff is, frankly,
honestly amazing.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.940
And some of these folks
know what they're

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.490
doing so well that--

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.970
this guy was so ingenious
that I frankly--

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.620
I was tempted to--

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.020
I joked when I was there
that I'm going to

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.030
ask him for a job.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.280
And it's looking like less
of a joke sometimes.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.300
This particular Simon--

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.500
this is also in Murang'a, Kenya,
same place, same loan,

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.650
same company.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.830
He actually financed cows
because he put together enough

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.010
cows to get cash flow in order
to finance his coffee

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.250
business, which he just needed
seed money for the coffee.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.740
This guy had a whole plan.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.080
And I've been in touch since,
and it's working kind of

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.400
beautifully.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.160
So he's got increasing
amount of land.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.300
Anyway, I could bore
you with all these

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.100
different little details.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.690
The most important stuff,
though, is that kind of

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.470
personal connection thing.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.040
And I want to share with you
something that I learned as my

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.950
biggest takeaway from
all of this stuff.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.770
Because the fact of the matter
is technology's changing

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:21.500
constantly.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.990
The way microfinance is being
done is going to change

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.530
constantly.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.680
People are constantly learning
some loan products

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.510
don't work that well.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.830
Some work fantastically well.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.140
Let's do more of those.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.190
The technology is advancing
now in terms of mobile

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.150
banking, that even the means
by which it's done may be

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.280
radically different in
unpredictable ways in just a

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.690
couple of years.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.780
So to get back to just human
stuff that I really want to

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.140
share with you and that's
ultimately the thrust of the

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.660
book, when I went to Lebanon--

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.940
I'm from a suburb in Ohio.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.260
People from suburbs in Ohio are
usually just genetically

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.800
not comfortable.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.480
I grew up watching Tom Brokaw
telling me that the Middle

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.380
East was a scary place.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.900
Things blew up again today.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.820
OK.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.550
So I get a plane ticket.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.330
I fly into the Beirut.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.760
I've got a hotel reservation.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.960
OK.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.530
And I get to know the local MFI,
and they're lovely and

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.460
they're sweet.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.180
Lebanon--

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:18.300
and things are getting bad
in Syria right now.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.810
I don't recommend visiting
right off.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.720
But I had an amazing
time there.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.720
People were so welcoming
and cool.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.900
And come have a party.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.900
Come sit with us.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.160
I have beer.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.790
I loved it.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:34.190
And one of the clients that I
met was this guy Hasan, who

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.010
has a little barber shop.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.010
And when I went to college,
the idea of having--

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.180
being surrounded by Muslims in
Lebanon, one of whom has a

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.650
straight razor that he's going
to put at your throat, was a

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.290
terrifying thing.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.885
This was wonderful.

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:49.290
He gave me an amazing shave.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:49.950
We sat there.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.010
Euro music was playing.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.690
It was totally different
from any of my

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.220
expectations of how it was.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.660
He was a wonderful guy.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.020
And everybody I met, at
least in West Beirut--

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.570
I didn't get to see the whole
city, or whatever.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.770
Younger people particularly
are so fed up with the

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.740
sectarianism and everything,
and they just really

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.660
appreciated that anybody
who could see

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.720
past all that garbage.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.150
The welcome I got
was constant.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.820
This isn't intended to be a
reading, but there's a thing

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.320
that I wrote on one page
of this book that is--

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.130
I said it better in the book
than I probably will ever come

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:30.040
up with it off the
top of my head.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.775
So I just want to share one page
of the book, because it's

00:26:31.775 --> 00:26:34.310
the most important thing I heard
in all of the travels.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.270
And then we'll do
a little Q&amp;A.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.010
And by the way, I understand
that there was a guy here at

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.450
some point in the past, who was
talking a bunch of stuff

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.980
about how microfinance is bad
and evil and doesn't work.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.440
And if there's questions that
came out of that, I'm more

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.330
than happy to address
any of those--

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.280
very happy to.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.860
But let me share with you the
most important thing that I

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.180
heard while I was traveling.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.150
Now, the people I was
visiting was--

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.270
Al Majmoua was the microfinance
institution.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.610
And they facilitated
a bunch of visits.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.940
And let me just vouch for
everybody they met as--

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.440
I mean, they were cool and
kind and creative.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.390
It was actually the driver, a
loan officer from Al Majmoua,

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.910
that I met on one of the trips
that said the five most

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.330
important words that I heard in
Lebanon, and I, honestly,

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.070
am starting to think the five
most important words I've

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.940
heard in my whole life.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.790
Now, Ahmed didn't always
work for Al Majmoua.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.480
He enjoys it there very much.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.270
And by the way, I'm going to
speak with a slight accent

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.620
here to indicate him.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.080
I can't do a Lebanese accent.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.180
I don't pretend to.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.760
I'm just trying to designate
that it's him.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.450
And the broken English is the
best that I could transcribe

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:42.030
in a bumpy car while the Three
Tenors are singing on the

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.970
radio while we're careening
around the Beiruti streets.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:50.470
But to the best of my ability to
share with you, Ahmed says

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.530
he enjoys Al Majmoua.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:52.970
"It's good.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.300
Everyone equal, like family.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.656
Christian, Muslim, everyone
love the same, you know?"

00:27:57.656 --> 00:28:00.700
And the radio has got the Three
Tenors and then REO

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.120
Speedwagon.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.560
And the radio is cycling through
and we're having a

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.170
nice conversation.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:08.750
And Ahmed goes on to tell
more of his story.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.230
"I asked God to bless
my family.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.530
I am rich man.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.850
Beautiful wife." He's got
two young daughters.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.620
For 16 years, he had a large
and very popular

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.230
restaurant in Beirut.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.600
And like a lot of Beirutis,
he stayed

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.390
completely out of politics.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.890
I mean, like a lot of people
everywhere, all he's trying to

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.610
do is just make a really good
living and the politicians are

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.470
going to do what they're
going to do.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.560
And Ahmed's restaurant
flourished, welcoming clients

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.220
of all faiths.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.960
"Shia, Sunni, all same.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.290
Television splits us.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.390
Politics.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.330
People love God, love each,
other, all same." He said this

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.380
I don't know how many times.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.920
But in July 2006, Hezbollah
unilaterally launched rocket

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.280
strikes against Israel, and
they kidnapped Israeli

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.710
soldiers near the border.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.880
And that touched off an
escalating conflict that

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.490
eventually led to Israeli air
strikes on Beirut itself.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.400
And in one of those
strikes, Ahmed's

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.340
restaurant was destroyed.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.210
Through no fault of his
own, his entire

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.910
livelihood was gone.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.970
So now Ahmed works as a loan
officer at Al Majmoua,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.630
rebuilding his own life while
helping others to do the same.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.570
And to help put his daughters
through school, he also works

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.130
on weekends, but now in someone
else's restaurant.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.360
He greets people.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.270
He seats people.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.330
He washes dishes.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.730
It's a huge step down.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.510
So I ask him if he's bitter.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.730
I would be.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.010
Somebody blows up my
house, I'm ticked.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.210
If going from being the owner of
a restaurant to just being

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.175
the hired help, has that made
him angry at the Israelis, or

00:29:33.175 --> 00:29:36.560
at Hezbollah, or God, or--

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.900
are you angry?

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.320
"No no, no," as if he was
talking to a child.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.240
"Everything is clear for me.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.000
When my God is with me, I don't
care about something

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.320
like that, no."

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.110
And he didn't pause here while
he was speaking, but in my

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:51.400
memory, he did because I've
thought about these next five

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.750
words, honestly, every single
day ever since.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.610
The next five words that came
out of his mouth were this--

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.390
"You love more, you win.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.190
You don't stop thanks for
God." And then again for

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.360
emphasis, "You love
more, you win."

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:13.510
Now, Ahmed didn't say that at
some yoga retreat in Berkeley.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.980
He didn't say that in some
philosophy class or as some

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.080
abstract notion.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.100
It's not something he learned
from a book, of any book.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.330
It's just who he was.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.110
It's what came out
of this heart.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.230
And it was a choice he was
making every single day in

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.040
West Beirut after having
his life blown up.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.590
And he could say it, and mean
it, and struggle with it in

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.420
the same moment, and then
resolve himself to do it

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.050
again, over and over
and over again.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.200
You know, I don't think I have
anything in the world I'll

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.840
ever say as important as what
Ahmed said to me that day.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.470
And so now I'll just try to
share that with you a little

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:46.050
bit and hope you walk out of
here carrying that with you.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.160
So that's pretty much the
shindig about the book.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.430
And this was spray-painted on
the wall in West Beirut.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.910
This is one of the graffiti
right there in Beirut.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.210
Somebody had put that up.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:04.620
That's what, I'm sure, motivated
Matt when he founded

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.420
Kiva to be so passionate
about creating it.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.250
I know that's where Kiva lenders
come from when they

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.650
are trying to reach around
the world that way.

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:15.130
That's why the clients are doing
it, is for their kids.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.610
And even the people who are
critics of microfinance,

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.500
they're doing it out of concern
for the clients, too.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.490
It's all coming from
a place of love.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.500
And that's a really wonderful
thing to hang onto.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.720
So anyway, that's pretty
much my spiel.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.610
And by the way, my own loans--
you can look them up.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.180
It's online.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.760
You can poke around the
Kiva website and you

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.680
can find my own loans.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.750
This is as of February.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.850
My original $20,000, which was
the amount of money that I'd

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.950
put in, in February, it
had recycled around

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.500
almost seven times.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.290
And it had worked out to get
repaid to me personally over

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.300
99% of the time.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.240
Kiva-wide, it's 99%.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.160
So it's pretty much as reliable
as a savings account.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.960
I mean, how much money do
you get on a savings

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.860
account right now?

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.020
Like nothing, right?

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.440
You put it into a savings
account, you get like a

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.720
fraction of 1%.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.430
So if I put $25 into Bank of
America, and then a year later

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.890
come back, I've get $25 and
a couple of pennies.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.350
Or I can put it in Kiva, and a
year later, on average, I've

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.690
got $25 minus a couple
of pennies.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.280
And for that price, this little
stack of pennies that

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.300
big, that money gets to be off
in Nicaragua helping some

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.223
bicycle delivery guy
or something.

00:32:18.223 --> 00:32:19.290
That's a pretty good deal.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:19.950
I'll go with that.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.130
So that's part of why
I like this stuff.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.690
So anyway, that's the spiel.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.191
Thanks for coming
to work today.

00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:31.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.630
BOB HARRIS: I'll set this
up for the cameras.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.890
And if you guys have questions
or answers--

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.800
if you have answers,
please, bring them.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.110
I'm more than happy-- if there's
a microphone or you

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.480
can just stand up and
squeal, whatever.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.830
I'm happy to answer anything.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.595
All right, we have our
first contestant.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.550
Well, there are situations
where charity is

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.470
a much better option.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.760
But it depends on
the situations.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.045
I think for anybody--

00:32:59.045 --> 00:33:01.580
I think when microfinance went
through its big vogue around

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.410
the time of the Nobel Peace
Prize to Grameen and to

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.740
Muhammad Yunus, and people were
talking in such grand

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.660
terms about how microfinance
is going to end

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.430
poverty and all that.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:14.410
That, actually, only makes
logical sense if the sole

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.200
cause of poverty was a lack
of financing in a

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.310
lot of these places.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.630
And if you've got an earthquake
in Haiti, you need

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.430
to bring in aid.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.090
I mean, aid is like
the first and best

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.330
option in a lot of cases.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.510
But if aid alone was the thing
that was going to change the

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.440
world, how much aid has been
poured into Africa without

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.650
careful planning, without
careful oversight?

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.900
Look, if you bring a bunch
of rice in, that's great.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.100
But what about the
rice farmers who

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.010
were already there?

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.000
And all of a sudden,
you may have

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.430
driven them out of business.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.220
Economic dislocation can be
caused by aid as much as it

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.400
can be relieved by it.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.350
So what has to be done is--

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.410
what's most important more than
anything is actually the

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.230
ability to listen to the
local people and

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.790
say, what do you need?

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.770
And we, as Westerners, very
often kind of have this--

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.900
we're the ones who will figure
out and solve the problems.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.580
When a lot of times, the folks
on the ground, they know

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.420
exactly what they need,
and you just ask.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.130
One of the things that I found
most appealing about Kiva is

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.750
that Kiva is people saying,
OK, this is what

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.520
I want on my farm.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.620
I want a cow.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.610
It's not some guy from the World
Bank or from some big--

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:17.989
whoever.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.189
Some foundation coming
in and saying, you

00:34:19.189 --> 00:34:20.090
know what you need?

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.690
It's a giant hydroelectric
dam.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.150
It's a guy saying, hey,
I want a cow.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.690
This is going to fix things for
me in my time frame and

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:27.960
with my work.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.900
And that sort of bottom-up
approach, I think is, at

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.719
minimum, equally as important
and I think probably much more

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:40.030
important than simply throwing
aid at a circumstance.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.570
In my book, I even get into
circumstances that are really

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:47.960
quite famous, where people put
their money into a charity

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.850
thinking, hey, this is
going to be great.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.271
And it didn't work out the
way that we'd hope.

00:34:53.271 --> 00:34:58.350
You remember Live Aid and USA
for Africa in the 1980s, which

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.370
did wonderful stuff.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.670
And to their everlasting credit,
that was the first

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.350
global event where you
really had people

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.340
all over the world--

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.250
anyone with a television--

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.406
aware of the ability
to reach out and

00:35:09.406 --> 00:35:10.370
reach around the world.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.760
That's an amazing cultural
impact, regardless of what

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.930
happened after that.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.320
And they did save a very
large number of lives.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.460
But the dictatorship in Ethiopia
that was largely

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.430
responsible for the problem--
it wasn't a weather thing.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:23.390
It wasn't just drought.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.230
There was a horrifying
dictatorship in Ethiopia that

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.380
was doing--

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.680
collectivizing the farms, which
we know what that did in

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.490
China and Russia, which was busy
essentially trying to put

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.410
down rebellions all
over the country.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.360
They were the ones who wound up
being in charge of where a

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.700
lot of the aid went.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.080
And while it saved some lives,
a lot of lives, and there's

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.730
different estimates, there's
also estimates, even at the

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.320
time while it was happening,
that it was also leading to

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.910
helping empower that
central government.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.110
So I don't think it's ever going
to be fair for anyone to

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.580
just say, well, aid
is the answer, or

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.170
microfinance is the answer.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.820
There's never one answer.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.570
And I think it just needs
to be taken on a really

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.460
sophisticated level,
listening closely.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.080
Experts from this part of the
world need to be listening to

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.600
the experts there.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.370
That's my feedback.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.620
Hope you enjoyed it.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.390
Three positives about Kiva.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.020
Well, one, I mean--

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.665
for me, the people in the
pictures are never just going

00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:26.170
to be people in the
pictures anymore.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:28.860
I mean, I'm in an exceptional
situation in that--

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.760
I mean, any time I lend to
somebody in Seibo in the

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.780
Philippines, I remember
the place now.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.560
And if I don't know that
specific person, I know what a

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.270
sari-sari is.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.991
So there's that thing.

00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:45.800
There's a huge educational
component, too, that I think

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.600
is wonderful.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.935
Schools are starting to use
Kiva in classrooms.

00:36:52.935 --> 00:36:55.460
A kid gets involved
with it and--

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:55.820
I don't know.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.140
I heard a story about
a classroom where--

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.400
I think there was some village
in Nicaragua that makes really

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.690
great hammocks.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.480
And the kids in the class
we're like, really?

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.810
And they got really fascinated
with the hammock making.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.450
And they, as a result just from
an extension of that, got

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.125
more interested in Nicaragua,
and then Central America, and

00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:13.960
it builds from that.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.980
You find one point
of interest.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.860
So I think that's a really
wonderful thing.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.495
Another wonderful thing, there's
these things called

00:37:19.495 --> 00:37:22.070
lending teams they have at
Kiva, which are affinity

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.460
groups, self-selected.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.590
The two biggest ones are the
Kiva Christians and the Kiva

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:33.090
atheists, who are essentially
having an ideological argument

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.460
over whether or not you need a
deity to foment generosity.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.550
And so far, at least on a
statistical level, the

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.180
atheists are winning,
rather strongly.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.120
And so the Christians get
right back in there.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.300
And you know, if you're going to
have a theological debate,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.080
this is one of the best
ways to do it.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.010
It's a fight over generosity.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.320
That's kind of wonderful.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.880
And those lending teams can
be really powerful.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.780
I didn't know how much.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.010
There's a team on Kiva right now
that I can't take, really,

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.700
any credit for called Friends
of Bob Harris.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.800
It's 1,100, 1,200 people--

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.460
I don't know the exact
number, who--

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.620
I don't know how
this happened.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.050
They're the fourth biggest
team on Kiva.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.780
They passed Team Europe.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.910
They passed Team Australia.

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:14.830
We passed the gays.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.060
We passed like--

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.110
so far there's the Christians,
the Atheists, and there's one

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.870
other team.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:22.580
And then Friends
of Bob Harris.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.950
And I'm just this dude.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:25.930
I mean, that doesn't
even make sense.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.640
And what it is, it's just a
very fun team that kind

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.280
gathered momentum.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.480
There's a discussion
board aspect to it.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.210
And people get on, and they're
playing with everything.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:38.740
There's a spirit there.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.940
These are just funny, charming
people who found each other.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.810
And I'm just sort of--

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.740
I have very little
to do with it.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.510
If there's a big thing of cotton
candy, sugar is just

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.900
swirling around, and somebody
puts a stick down in there,

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.930
and you come out with cotton
candy, I'm the stick.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:52.920
But I'm not that.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.310
I'm not that candy.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.130
And so these people have the--

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.790
you go on the Friends of Bob
Harris team, and they just

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.510
decided to have a summer
road trip.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:04.060
And so they went through all
these loans on Kiva finding

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.660
people who sold stuff that you'd
want to buy along the

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.060
side of the road, or people who
sold tires, or people who

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.720
sold anything related to
a summer road trip.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.140
And that was how they
fundraised.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.130
I had nothing to do with
that, but on it went.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:19.110
And that team's raised $3.4
million in lending funds.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.220
And I'm--

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.790
honored?

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.300
I don't know what
I am about it.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.710
It's cool.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.040
So those are three aspects
I would think of-- the

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.520
educational aspect, the
sense of connection,

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:36.880
and the social aspect.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.010
A bad thing about Kiva?

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.550
There's a few things that I'd
like to see done differently,

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.800
to be honest.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.630
The one thing that some people
point out is that you can't

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.550
see the interest rate for the
specific loan that you're

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.640
investing in.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.890
That would be nice.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.940
I can see how long it lasts.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.800
I can see that it's
six months.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.010
But I also understand that to
just put that number in a

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:08.440
vacuum, well, what's the local
interest rate comparatively to

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.210
what banks avail?

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.480
And then you got put
that information.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.980
And what's the local
inflation rate?

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.680
OK, that information
has to be there.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.330
And if you're going to have full
transparency, then you've

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.430
got to get into transparency
of context.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.880
And that starts becoming
a really complex task.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.380
But that's a discussion I think
that's worth having.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.150
There's a couple of
other things.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:31.470
There are kinds of loans that
I sometimes see that I think

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.920
need a little bit
better labeling.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.620
For example, if you make a loan
into India, your money's

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.190
not coming back for three
years, even if it's a

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.830
six-month loan.

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.890
Now, they billboard that.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.700
They put that up there.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.010
That's really obvious.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.970
Some of the educational loans
that can be up to 11 years.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.150
There's a university
in South Africa.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.910
I've seen a number of cases
where people made the loan,

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.440
clicked Lend $25, and didn't
realize they weren't going to

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.270
see that money back
for 11 years.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.620
That's a tiny complaint,
really.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.430
That's easy to fix.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.850
They can go and fix that
and billboard that

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.570
harder by this afternoon.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.640
So I would say that most of my
quibbles with Kiva are more

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.200
along the lines of quibbles
about information being made

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.460
maybe a little more
visible or usable.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.710
That's my best answer.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.910
Well, I should correct-- the
question if everybody could

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.630
hear it was the challenges that
the clients had before

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.210
they came to Kiva.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.310
Well, they actually didn't
come to Kiva.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.140
They go to their local
microfinance institution.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.850
And when they walk in the door,
they may not have any

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.430
idea that Kiva even exists.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.580
I mean, they don't know who's
funding that institution.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.600
They're just trying to get
a loan to buy a cow.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:44.440
And so when they walk in, then
the nice man that did the loan

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.810
thing, they say, oh, by the way,
your loan's going to be

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.200
funded with Kiva.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.300
We need you to pose for picture,
and they do a little

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.210
bit of that stuff.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.510
But for the clients themselves,
most of their

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.990
experience is primarily just
with the local microlender.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.080
That said, on the rare occasions
when I did talk to

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.520
clients who were aware of Kiva
or knew that there was some

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.110
crowd funding aspect to their
loans, they love that.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.870
They just think that's--
the idea.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.320
I met a guy in Nicaragua, again,
who when he realized

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.040
that there were people from
like 20 countries who'd

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.710
invested in his business,
that's just like--

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.750
my god, that must feel cool.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.610
As far as the challenges they
have beforehand, almost

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:24.770
everybody that I met had--

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.700
you got to scramble to make
a living here in the West.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.610
I mean, everybody in here has
got college educations, and

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.690
we're all scrambling and
figuring out, god, what the

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:32.960
hell am I going to do?

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.060
I'm going to change my career in
three years, or I just came

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.150
from something else.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.170
And if you're living at the $6
a day level, just multiply

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.480
that by a huge factor.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.280
Everybody I think I met had
been in five different

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.280
businesses prior to the
one they were doing.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.990
And maybe this one's working
now, so they're

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:48.280
sticking with it.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.650
There were some-- and I mention
this in the book.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.550
There were some where the
business didn't quite work

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:54.490
out, and then they try
something else.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:59.060
There is kind of a humorous one
in the book where I met

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.740
this woman, who I called Mercy
in the book because I don't

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:08.220
want to embarrass anyone, who
made charcoal-flavored yogurt,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.170
which is the local flavor.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.570
It's Western Kenya.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.920
It's the bark of a tree,
and it's the flavor.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.900
And it tastes really like
charcoal-flavored yogurt.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.770
And I had the intestinal
equivalent of an international

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.350
incident after consuming
this charcoal yogurt.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.790
I think the next morning they
could hear me in Uganda.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:32.710
And her business, strangely
enough, she didn't sell enough

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.070
of the charcoal-flavored
yogurt to

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:35.530
really stay in business.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:36.190
Now she's OK.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.980
Her husband's a cop,
and they're fine.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:38.840
They're economically fine.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.280
But I followed up afterwards
meeting clients.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.440
Is this person still
in business?

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.340
Is this person still in
business, and so on to see.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.590
The majority were.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:48.690
Nobody was getting huge rich.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:49.545
Some people were pretty
successful.

00:43:49.545 --> 00:43:51.250
A lot of people were skating,
and there were a couple that

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.730
didn't work out, just like
everywhere else in the world,

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:59.460
really, if that makes
any sense.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.780
All right, so let's hit
the Lend button.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.480
It's pretty easy to find the big
giant green Lend button.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.050
Oh, wait.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.250
I don't know how much
I have to lend.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.010
Do I have anything
in the kitty?

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:10.230
I didn't see it.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.730
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:13.060
BOB HARRIS: Let's see.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.700
OK, all right.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.060
That's enough for five loans,
if I don't tip Kiva.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.310
I'll tip Kiva.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.050
All right, let's make
five loans.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:23.540
Where do we want to loan?

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.310
Here's a list of countries.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.490
Is there anybody I haven't?

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.280
I haven't lent to
Thailand yet.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.410
I keep looking to see if
Thailand comes up.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:30.390
Somebody shout out a country.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.953
We'll make a loan there.

00:44:31.953 --> 00:44:32.839
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:32.839 --> 00:44:33.725
BOB HARRIS: What was that?

00:44:33.725 --> 00:44:34.170
AUDIENCE: Zimbabwe.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.630
BOB HARRIS: Zimbabwe.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.620
And I heard another one.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:35.990
AUDIENCE: Vietnam.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.430
BOB HARRIS: Vietnam.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:37.570
Vietnam and Zimbabwe.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.852
All right.

00:44:38.852 --> 00:44:42.550
We'll click for Zimbabwe, and
we'll click for Vietnam.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.000
And I'll close that.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.570
And here's Zimbabwe
and Vietnam.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.330
There's 33 loans available.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:52.300
And OK, here's a woman who's
going to buy a greater variety

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.800
and quantity of pork
pies and salted

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.930
shredded meat to satisfy--

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.020
it looks like she's upgrading
her stock in an existing

00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.460
established business.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.325
This looks like somebody
who knows what

00:45:00.325 --> 00:45:01.010
the heck she's doing.

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.360
I mean, I'm buying that
as a business model.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.370
And by the way, I don't just
throw the money around.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.690
I want to make sure that
they're doing stuff.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.410
OK, these people are going
to buy winter clothes.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.110
That's not really a
business model.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.970
So I don't necessarily feel
like I'm investing in--

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.770
but at the same time, they're
trying not to

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.330
freeze in the winter.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.940
So OK, this first Zimbabwe loan,
I'm feeling compassion,

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.680
not necessarily a business
investment.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.010
But I'm OK with that.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.594
If I think about it,
I'm OK with that.

00:45:28.594 --> 00:45:30.050
Oh, already funded.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.010
Interesting.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.610
All right.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:33.230
OK, this woman's definitely
all up into

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.960
the business thing.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.140
Let's see who else
we got here.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.350
New shampoo chair to better
satisfy her customers.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.510
Apparently the one she
has is pointy.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:44.010
So apparently she wants a
soft chair or something.

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.050
That's a functional business.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.640
All right.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.350
She's just reselling clothes.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.200
You get a lot of those
businesses.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.360
I haven't seen anybody like
really flourishing or getting

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.830
rich, but a lot of times, a lot
of loans wind up getting

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.370
used in what's called income
smoothing, which I don't have

00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.870
a problem with.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.100
Sometimes people have
problems with it.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.810
Well, that's not really
flourishing as a business.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:06.010
Income smoothing is where you
just use a loan to do exactly

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:06.830
like what it sounds like.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.520
You smooth your income.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.890
Maybe your income is
seasonal and--

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.110
anybody's who had credit cards
and had to juggle them knows

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.810
what income smoothing is, or had
to figure out, aw, jeez,

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:16.800
this month sucked.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.535
I thought it was going
to be so much better.

00:46:18.535 --> 00:46:21.720
I'll be better next month,
and you smooth.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.800
And there's a lot of people
who criticize microlending

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.830
because, well, some people are
just income smoothing.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:28.840
Yes, they are.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.860
I'm fine with it.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.920
OK, we'll hit her.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.340
And let's see, is there
another Zimbabwe one?

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.450
OK, she makes bedspreads and
curtains and seat covers.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:39.280
I'm in.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.000
All right, there's
a bunch of loans.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.280
OK, hit my basket.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.960
And we're going to tip Kiva
$15 in the kitty for Kiva.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.540
Continue.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.210
Complete Order.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.580
There, I just made four
loans that went to--

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.680
one to Asia, one to
Southern Africa.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.700
Now, in full disclosure, those
loans already had been made to

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.220
the clients.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.990
They're what they call
predispersed.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.930
Clients already have
the money.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.010
It's the only way the
thing can work.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:09.260
Let's say, for example, that--

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.840
nobody is sitting around
waiting for me.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.620
When is Bob going to send
that $25 to Zimbabwe?

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.990
I can't buy blankets
till Bob sends $25.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:23.610
No, the way it works is that the
microlender actually gives

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.420
the money first, then
it gets refilled by

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:28.120
us on the back end.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.040
And then from that point on,
it repays just like the

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.500
conventional bucket brigade.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.380
That's the only way the
model would work.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.490
If it was tried any other way,
it wouldn't be feasible.

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.390
And I like it that way.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.110
One of the first loans I saw
on Kiva was for a guy named

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.580
Victor in Paraguay, who
was in the middle of a

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.390
dengue fever epidemic.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.990
Dengue fever's a nasty
tropical disease.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.710
I've had it myself.

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:51.400
It's not fun.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.890
And it kills kids.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.120
And it's mosquito-borne.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.650
And Victor wanted to buy a bunch
of strips of leather and

00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.640
some Citronella.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.120
Dip the leather in the
Citronella, make anti-mosquito

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.640
bracelets for the kids,
sell them cheaply,

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.080
and kids don't die.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.100
I want his loan funded
as fast as possible.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.850
I don't want him waiting
around for me.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.000
Does that make sense?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.400
So that makes perfect sense.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.460
So how long did that take?

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.930
That was two minutes,
three minutes?

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.160
Once you have an account,
it's very, very easy.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.735
I want to make really clear, I
don't totally speak for Kiva

00:48:27.735 --> 00:48:28.420
in my response.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.500
I think I have an accurate
response here.

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.260
Bennett from Kiva's here, so if
I get something wrong, you

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:33.960
correct me.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.480
Just jump right in.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.780
Those go to operating expenses,
overhead, stuff like

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.030
that, to my understanding
of it.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.120
And Kiva's annual report is
right on the website.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.270
They're totally transparent
about where the money comes

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.270
from and where it goes.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.350
And I don't remember exactly
what percentage of their

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.720
operating expenses come
from that 15% donation

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.320
along with the loan.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.110
What is it?

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.610
BENNETT: Actually, that's 65%.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.300
BOB HARRIS: 65% of the
operating expenses

00:48:59.300 --> 00:48:59.770
come from the tips.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.290
So without people doing those
tips, Kiva goes belly up.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.440
Or Kiva, at least, has to
shrink dramatically.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.960
So if I like Kiva, I should
probably contribute

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.770
occasionally to the operating
expenses.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.910
Now, in all honesty to you,
I don't always do

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:11.760
it when I make loans.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.750
Sometimes I'm just not feeling
that generous.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:19.040
I have my days where I'm just
kind of like, yeah, you know.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.920
And if you've been to the Kiva
office, it's not extravagant

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.640
in any way.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.240
And actually, the salaries
of the--

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.020
I'm not going to disclose
anything here, but it's

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:27.850
publicly disclosed.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.800
The salaries of all of
the senior staff are

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.360
in the annual reports.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.460
Ain't nobody getting rich.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.600
If I were to-- like after the
presentation's over, I can

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.420
tell you what you can find.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.920
I've mentioned it to a few
people and they go, how does

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.010
anyone live in San Francisco
on that?

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.380
And that's the senior people.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.740
By the way, Bennett, how
does anyone live in San

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.300
Francisco on that?

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.670
I mean, it's really not a ton.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.520
So I don't see anybody
making bank.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.160
I think the money gets
used pretty well.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.530
I think that's actually a very,
very general question.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.140
It's a little hard to answer
because of how general it is.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.430
I think it would be much easier
to measure, OK, how do

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.610
we measure the impact of
the cow loans in Kenya?

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.040
I could answer that question
because there's going to

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.230
specific statistics about
a specific program.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.150
How do we measure--

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.720
and then we could go into
lots of details.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.820
And then to measure the impact
of Kiva, then we would have

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.450
to, on aggregate, have
all of that data.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.310
I don't have it.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.700
So to a certain extent for me,
you could argue that there's a

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.440
certain active faith
thing going on.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.800
But in my case, I've actually
been in the field to a bunch

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.640
of these places, and I've
seen them working.

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.700
I've only been to a couple
places that weren't.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.980
And they weren't Kiva
partners, so things

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.130
look good to me.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.610
I think that the other way to--
one of the measures of

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.910
it, too, is that if it
wasn't working--

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.650
and this is also true of
microfinance in general.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.450
When people talk about
microfinance as being

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:55.640
something that hurts the poor
or the real negative stuff

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.360
that's said, almost always--

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.940
I mean, I don't think I
can think of a case--

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.840
it's made as a grand statement
addressing not just a specific

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.990
situation, but then it's
overgeneralized

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:08.430
to the whole field.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.870
Andhra Pradesh, India, horrific
tragedy caused by

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.580
microfinance institutions who
were much more concerned about

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.570
profit than they were the
welfare of the client.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.280
Extremely clear, extremely
horrible, and the fact that

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.320
nobody's in prison over
that is an outrage.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.140
But does that have anything
to do with

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.120
Juhudi Kilimo in Kenya?

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.630
No, just nothing.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.270
And does it have anything
to do with Kiva?

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.340
No.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:33.770
And some of this actually
is the problem of the

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.180
microfinance industry itself
has done this to itself by

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.650
using such inaccurate
terminology.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.020
I would like to see the word
"microfinance" abolished from

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:45.950
the English language, because
it's such a broad term.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:49.620
I don't know of any other field
of human endeavor where

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.460
one word is used to blanket
describe so many diverse

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.610
activities.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.610
It's a word like sports.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.360
If I say sports, am I talking
about baseball, football,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.460
hockey, whatever?

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:01.430
Now those endeavors--

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.930
I'm going to rant here for a
second, but think about it.

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.900
Baseball, football, hockey,
basketball, they're four

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.170
completely different
endeavors.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.490
But they're all done
for profit.

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:13.020
They're all done with a certain
demographic of people

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.840
for a certain demographic of
people, with a certain set of

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.520
advertisers.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.000
They're the same exact business
model, and it's the

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
same exact people, just behaving
slightly differently.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.310
And yet, we have very precise
words for those, and we would

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.080
never confuse something that
happened in hockey with

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.800
something that happened
in basketball.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.620
Now let's look at
microfinance.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.600
You have international
IPO things like

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.520
SKS that are massive.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.940
And you have little places on
the corner in Nepal that are

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.990
actually funded out of
somebody's back pocket.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.470
You have people who
are for profit.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:42.950
You have people who are
not for profit.

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:46.550
You have people who are offering
education, and health

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.250
care and health training, and
AIDS awareness and all sorts

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.930
of different personal things.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.910
And you have loan mills
that exists simply

00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:54.280
to try to make loans.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:59.200
You have a massively diverse
set of activities that have

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.720
nothing in common with each
other at all, except the

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.800
stated goal of ultimately
helping an end user who is

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.060
economically micro by
local comparison.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.590
That's nuts.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:13.940
But if we use that terminology,
inevitably when

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.780
something goes wrong in one
part of it, and it's

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:20.180
microfinance, everybody
catches the flak.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:25.130
And that's part of the reason
that any misbehavior at any

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:28.310
part of the field gets
so generalized.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.540
I don't know if that makes
any sense, but I hope by

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.510
addressing that just slightly,
that will help us think more

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.700
critically when people start
saying, and microfinance does

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.620
this bad thing.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:38.890
Really?

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:39.400
Which part?

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.040
Which specific part where?

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.270
And then that becomes
a very important

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.870
next question to ask.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.080
Did that clear anything up?

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.466
Yay, good.

00:53:47.466 --> 00:53:48.560
Oh.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:55.840
[APPLAUSE]
