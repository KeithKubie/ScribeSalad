00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
Congratulations on building your new,
robust Mad Libs generator.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.250
Now, if there are other words you want
to prompt our user to fill in the blanks

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.050
for, all we need to do is add the word
to our list parts_of_speech, and

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.080
our Mad Libs generator
will work as expected.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.312
However, there's one last step that
we need to take in order to build

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:20.840
the Mad Libs generator you saw Andy and
I play in the beginning of stage two.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.654
Which is to replace the words that are
found in parts_of_speech with user input

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:27.500
rather than the word corgi.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Now, like I said, we'll just have
to add one line of code to do this,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.610
which we'll do by using
a function called raw_input.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.280
Here's an example of
the raw_input function.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.772
If we were to run this line of code,

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.310
we would be prompted with the message,
Type in a word.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.910
If I follow those directions by typing
in let's say Udacity and then press

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.810
Enter on my keyboard, user_input will
now be set to the string Udacity.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.280
Simple enough.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.190
So the string you put in parentheses
is the prompt the user or

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.890
player will receive.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.280
And whatever they type on their
keyboard, followed by Enter,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.490
will be the variable's value.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.510
We use raw_input in our Mad Libs
generator by prompting a user for

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.200
the part of speech we want
them to fill in the blank for.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.260
And use that as a replacement
instead of corgi.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.430
But where in our code do we use this?

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.190
So if this was the part of my code that
replaces the part of speech with corgi,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.050
which you built in the last quiz,
my code will now look like this.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.300
By adding this line of code and
by swapping the string corgi

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.530
with user_input, we now have a fully
functioning Mad Libs generator.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.740
In the download section there will be
a file that contains all the code you've

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.780
written up until now,
including this added line of raw_input.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.210
I've added a few strings near the top of
the file that you can play around with,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.190
but I encourage you to write your
own Mad Libs sentences, add your

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.440
own words to the parts_of_speech list,
and run your Mad Libs generator on them.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.880
The following videos will step you
through the process of running this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.780
program locally so you can play
Mad Libs with your friends and family.
