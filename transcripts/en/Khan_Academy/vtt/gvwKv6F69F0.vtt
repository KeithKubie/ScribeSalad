00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.540
Welcome to the presentation on
finding the equation of a line.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.410
Let's get started.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.345
Say I had two points.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:12.360
Let's say I have the point 1
comma 2, and I have the point 3

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360
comma 4, and I want to figure
out the equation of the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360
line through these points.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.640
So let's at least figure out
what that line looks like.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:32.490
So 1 comma 2 is here,
and 2, 3; 3, 4.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.130
3 comma 4 is here, and if
I want to draw a line

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.050
through them, it'll look
something like that.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.375
So what we want to do is figure
out the equation of this line.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:53.440
Well, we know the form of an
equation of a line is y equals

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.840
mx plus b, where m is the
slope, and that tells you how

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.620
steep the line is, and
b is the y-intercept.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.430
And I don't know why
people chose m and b.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.980
We'll have to do some
research on that.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.270
b is the y-intercept and the
y-intercept is just where does

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.250
it intersect the y-axis.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.050
And this problem, you could
actually look at it and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.940
figure it out, but let's
do it mathematically.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.390
So the equation for the slope
m: it's rise over run.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.640
Another way to view that is
for any amount that you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.680
run along the x-axis,
how much do you rise?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350
Well, let's do
that numerically.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.430
Rise is the same thing as
change over y, and run is the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.800
same thing as change over x.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.570
Delta, this triangle, means
change, change in y.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.650
Well, change in y, let's
take the starting

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.280
point to be 3 comma 4.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.980
Let's say we're going from
3 comma 4 to 2 comma 1.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.080
The change in y is 4 minus 2.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.830
We just took this 4 minus
this 2 over 3 minus 1.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.550
My phone was ringing.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.760
And that's just this
3 minus this 1.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.560
So if we just solve for it,
we get 4 minus 2 is 2, and 3

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.280
minus 1 is also 2, so we get
the slope is equal to 1.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
And that makes sense because
when we move over 1 in x,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.270
we go up exactly 1 in y.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.790
When we move to the left 1 in
x, we move down exactly 1 in y.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.490
So now we know the equation is
y equals 1x plus b because

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.880
we solved the m equals 1.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.580
And this is, of course,
the same thing as

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.200
y equals x plus b.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.760
Now, all we have left
to do is solve for b.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.550
Well, how do we do that because
we have three variables here.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.460
Well, we could actually
substitute one of these pairs

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.780
of points in for y and x, and
that makes sense, because

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.510
these points have to
satisfy this equation.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.600
So let's take this first
pair. y is equal to 2.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.360
2 is equal to x,
which is 1 plus b.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.160
It's a pretty easy
equation to solve.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.180
We get b equals 1, so that
tells us that the equation of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.070
this line is y equals x plus 1.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.490
That's a pretty straightforward
equation, and it makes sense.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.360
The y-intercept is 1, which
is exactly here, 0 comma

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.100
1, and the slope is 1, and
that's pretty obvious.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.690
For every amount that we move
to the right, we move the same

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.150
amount up, so the slope is 1.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.110
Let's do another problem.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.200
Let's say I wanted to find the
equation of the line between

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.350
the points negative 3 comma
5 and 2 comma negative 6.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.260
Well, we do the same thing.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.690
m is equal to change in
y over change in x.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.630
So let's take this as
the starting point.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.955
So say negative 6 minus 5.

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:08.300
So we just took negative
6 minus 5 over 2

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.840
minus negative 3.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.650
You've got to be real careful
to get the signs right.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.840
So it's 2 minus negative 3.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.485
Negative 6 minus 5 is minus 11,
and 2 minus negative 3, well,

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:26.350
that's the same thing as two
plus plus 3, so that's 5.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.370
So we have the slope is
equal to negative 11/5.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.450
And notice that if on the
numerator we use negative 6 as

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.630
the starting point, that in the
denominator, we have to use

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.940
2 as the starting point.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.090
We could have done it
the other way around.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.240
We could have said 5 minus
negative 6 over negative 3

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.070
minus 2, in which case we would
have gotten-- this would have

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.570
been 11 over negative 5.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.305
So as long as you-- if you use
the negative 6 first, then you

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:00.840
have to use the 2 first, or if
you use the 5 first, then

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.885
you have to use the
negative 3 first.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.080
I hope I'm not completely
confusing you guys.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.500
Well, anyway, we know the slope
is negative 11/5, so the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.680
equation of this line so far is
y equals minus 11/5x plus b.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.410
Now we can take one of these
pairs on the top and substitute

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.090
back and solve for b.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.760
Let's take the first pair.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.390
So 5 is y.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:33.320
So we say 5 equals negative
3, so it's negative 11/5

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.750
times negative 3, right?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.220
I just put the x
in for x plus b.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.450
So just simplifying that, I get
5 is equal to 33/5 plus b, or b

00:05:48.450 --> 00:06:01.840
is equal to 5 minus 33/5, and
this equals 25 minus 33/5.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.460
25 minus 33 is minus 8/5.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.580
So the equation of this line,
and this one wasn't as clean as

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.340
the other one, obviously, is--
let me do it in another color

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:23.800
for emphasis-- y equals
minus 11/5x minus 8/5.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.530
Hopefully, those two examples
will give you enough of an idea

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.570
to do the figuring out the
equation of a line problems.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.820
And if you have problems with
this, you might just want to

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.750
try just the slope of the line
problems or the y-intercept

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.170
problems separately.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.160
I hope you have fun.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.460
Bye.
