features that can really help

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
features that can really help
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.680
features that can really help
differentiate those apps from their

nonetheless um what you'll find in fact

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390
nonetheless um what you'll find in fact
 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.450
nonetheless um what you'll find in fact
if I jump a step back that's gonna make

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460
if I jump a step back that's gonna make
 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.160
if I jump a step back that's gonna make
it easier for us and if you want to just

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170
it easier for us and if you want to just
 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.270
it easier for us and if you want to just
switch that off for a second so you can

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280
switch that off for a second so you can
 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.830
switch that off for a second so you can
see it straight away that the the layout

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840
see it straight away that the the layout
 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.150
see it straight away that the the layout
isn't clustered and what we've got here

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160
isn't clustered and what we've got here
 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.410
isn't clustered and what we've got here
is alongside each of the of the options

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420
is alongside each of the of the options
 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.640
is alongside each of the of the options
on the screen you can see that there's a

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650
on the screen you can see that there's a
 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.560
on the screen you can see that there's a
little drop-down which is in fact going

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570
little drop-down which is in fact going
 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.330
little drop-down which is in fact going
to allow you it gives you a hint that

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340
to allow you it gives you a hint that
 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.920
to allow you it gives you a hint that
clicking on any of them is actually

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930
clicking on any of them is actually
 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.500
clicking on any of them is actually
going to to do something it's going to

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510
going to to do something it's going to
 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.180
going to to do something it's going to
let you choose your options differently

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190
let you choose your options differently
 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.220
let you choose your options differently
and this is really useful because

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230
and this is really useful because
 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.260
and this is really useful because
straightaway it gives me hints as to how

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270
straightaway it gives me hints as to how
 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.670
straightaway it gives me hints as to how
I'm going to be able to use this app in

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680
I'm going to be able to use this app in
 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.520
I'm going to be able to use this app in
the right way so straight away sort of

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530
the right way so straight away sort of
 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.440
the right way so straight away sort of
you know that clicking on stuff is going

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.450
you know that clicking on stuff is going
 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.170
you know that clicking on stuff is going
to you give me options to change things

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180
to you give me options to change things
 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.760
to you give me options to change things
and then in fact that's exactly how it

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770
and then in fact that's exactly how it
 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.470
and then in fact that's exactly how it
works and so if I click on any of those

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480
works and so if I click on any of those
 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.120
works and so if I click on any of those
options what I get straight away is a

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130
options what I get straight away is a
 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.770
options what I get straight away is a
list of alternative things that I can

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780
list of alternative things that I can
 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.240
list of alternative things that I can
look at so whether that be looking at

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250
look at so whether that be looking at
 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.590
look at so whether that be looking at
calories consumed rather than distance

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600
calories consumed rather than distance
 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.940
calories consumed rather than distance
traveled or any of those sorts of

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950
traveled or any of those sorts of
 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.680
traveled or any of those sorts of
options and the same thing goes for the

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.690
options and the same thing goes for the
 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.350
options and the same thing goes for the
workout style on the workout activity

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360
workout style on the workout activity
 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.810
workout style on the workout activity

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150
click the drop-down and see oh actually
 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.270
click the drop-down and see oh actually
I'm rolling and when I click on those I

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280
I'm rolling and when I click on those I
 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.890

activities rather than pop-ups and this

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:40.850
activities rather than pop-ups and this
 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.850
activities rather than pop-ups and this
is kind of important because it makes it

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860
is kind of important because it makes it
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.470
is kind of important because it makes it
really simple for me to be able to to be

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:47.480
really simple for me to be able to to be
 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.030
really simple for me to be able to to be
able to make those choices without being

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040
able to make those choices without being
 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.920
able to make those choices without being
overly distracted which is really really

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.930
overly distracted which is really really
 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.170
overly distracted which is really really
useful and that's really the way that

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.180
useful and that's really the way that
 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.780
useful and that's really the way that
the whole UI design for the app works is

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
the whole UI design for the app works is
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.730
the whole UI design for the app works is
that is it is that it's you know it's

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:00.740
that is it is that it's you know it's
 

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.560
that is it is that it's you know it's
really intuitive it's really fast to get

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.570
really intuitive it's really fast to get
 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.230
really intuitive it's really fast to get
started which is a real benefit so I'm

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240
started which is a real benefit so I'm
 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.170
started which is a real benefit so I'm
going to spin this around

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:07.180
going to spin this around
 

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:13.439
going to spin this around
we hold it real tight gets yeah I think

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:13.449
we hold it real tight gets yeah I think
 

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:19.620
we hold it real tight gets yeah I think
it's the movement on the device a little

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:19.630
it's the movement on the device a little
 

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:29.610
it's the movement on the device a little
bit you know it's the issues with MHL so

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:29.620
bit you know it's the issues with MHL so
 

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.930
bit you know it's the issues with MHL so
if there are any miracast

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940

that's hugely disappointing that's

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.050
that's hugely disappointing that's
 

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.420
that's hugely disappointing that's
working out that way but nonetheless I

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:45.430
working out that way but nonetheless I
 

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.000
working out that way but nonetheless I
will I will continue on we do have

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.010
will I will continue on we do have
 

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.540
will I will continue on we do have
screenshots for most of it so the other

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:51.550
screenshots for most of it so the other
 

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.100
screenshots for most of it so the other
important thing is that this yeah let's

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.110
important thing is that this yeah let's
 

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.390
important thing is that this yeah let's
just kill that because that's just way

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:54.400
just kill that because that's just way
 

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.230
just kill that because that's just way
too annoying so again it's really

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240
too annoying so again it's really
 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.810
too annoying so again it's really
important that you likely to be using

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:00.820
important that you likely to be using
 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.030
important that you likely to be using
this phone this app outside in direct

to use as possible and basically
everything in the app goes along those

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.130
everything in the app goes along those
 

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.220
everything in the app goes along those
lines it's really simple to use really

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:17.230
lines it's really simple to use really

different elements within the UI which
 

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.530
different elements within the UI which
is great well it seems that our

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:28.540
is great well it seems that our
 

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.910
is great well it seems that our
technical difficulties have scared off

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920
technical difficulties have scared off
 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.430
technical difficulties have scared off
most people which is a shame but

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440
most people which is a shame but
 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.010
most people which is a shame but
nonetheless so that's basically how

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.020
nonetheless so that's basically how
 

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.320
nonetheless so that's basically how
everything goes one of the nice touches

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.330
everything goes one of the nice touches
 

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.170
everything goes one of the nice touches
as well that we had and if we if I drop

it's going to start up Google music now
one of the really nice things about this

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.300
one of the really nice things about this
