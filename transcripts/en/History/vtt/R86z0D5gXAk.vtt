00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.070
[music playing]

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.870
NARRATOR: The weather's
intensifying fast

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.800
over the White
Mountains, where Marty's

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.600
pushing deep into cat country.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.270
Boy, it's shaping up
to be a miserable day.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.030
NARRATOR: Fighting biting winds
gusting up to 40 miles an hour.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.100
Real bad flat light.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.900
There's new snow, and
the wind's howling.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.470
The last time I ran this
line, it was beautiful.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.000
The machine fairly
idled through here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.370
It was just hard packed,
real easy to see trail.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.230
And now it's drifted, gone.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.700
Wow.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.200
Huh.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.570
Well, you have good days,
and you have bad days.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.900
Nobody said it was
going to be easy.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.600
And there might be
fur, so here I go.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.430
[engine starts]

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.830
Look at this mess.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.200
NARRATOR: The dense terrain
is treacherous to navigate

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.430
but also prime for
the lynx he's chasing

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.000
to cap off a killer season.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.230
Because it's so
thick in there,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.170
this is just a cat trail.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.000
It funnels the lynx in here--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.830
like a cat highway, kind of
following those brushy little

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.870
draws, hunting bunnies.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.900
Good deal!

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.870
Pretty cool.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.370
[music playing]

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.300
I got a big lynx here--

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.400
a big male.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.130
Yeah, that's a pretty
big cat, pretty big.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.600
NARRATOR: Marty's
perseverance pays off.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.430
A cat this size is worth
$200 and is a good sign

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.800
that there may be more to come.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
Now I continue on.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.330
Boy, the snow is deep
up in the hills here.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.670
[engine starts]

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.570
Oh!

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.030
Wow.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.470
Damn it!

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800
[music playing]

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.600
NARRATOR: Deep in Alaska's
storm-battered White Mountains,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.700
Marty's snowmobile is hung up.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.100
Dang it.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.070
NARRATOR: Tangled
in a web of brush.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.930
Well, I tried to
blast through this

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.600
but got balled up around
my ski, and I'm stuck.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600
You got to dig it out.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.400
I hope I didn't break anything.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.200
[music playing]

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.130
I can't even get it.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.000
[sighs]

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.600
NARRATOR: It's 10 degrees
below zero and dropping.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.430
The worst case scenario, we'll
walk, and it will be miserable.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.070
I got lucky.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.930
If you clip a tree with
a ski, lots of times,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.470
you'll be stuck for a while.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.800
And I need to try and
get back to the cabin

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.170
before I get stuck so
bad I can hardly dig out.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.430
[engine starts]

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.300
Today was hard, but it
was a pretty good day.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.530
It's exciting to
catch any fur animal,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.200
especially lynx, which is why
I live to fight another day.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.130
