00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.700
These dice are rather unusual. They are marked not like ordinary dice, 1 through 6, but in various peculiar patterns.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.620
For example, this is three everywhere. Three, three, three, three, three, three.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.020
This one has four, four, four, four and zero, zero.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.160
Okay, so four, four, four, four, zero, zero against a three everywhere

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.960
And we play the following game. Two players role them against each other

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.600
and whichever number comes up higher wins.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.200
In this case, this won, this lost. Had it been like this, this would have lost, this would have won.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, we try to rank the dice. Compare the dice and see, say which is stronger, which is weaker.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.560
and here is the definition.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.380
We say that one die is stronger than the other die if that die has a higher probability of winning against the other die

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.800
which means that it wins more frequently against the other die.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.880
and conversely, one of them is weaker than the other if it looses more often.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.320
Let's note that we are not comparing the average scores. We are comparing the probabilities

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.800
For example if you had three everywhere and the other die, instead of four, four, four, four, zero, zero

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.540
had, let's say, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, and 10 gazillion

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.580
of course every three wins more often, but one that has 10 gazillion has a higher average score

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.000
but that's not what we are talking about

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420
we are comparing probabilities of winning.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.340
Okay. So which one of these is stronger?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.080
You can see that this has four, four, four, zero, zero

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.460
and this is three everywhere

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.660
so clearly this wins four out of six times and looses two out of six times

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.480
So this wins more often against this one so this is stronger than that one

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.120
Thus the beginning of the totem pole ranking is like this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.420
This is stronger than that one

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.200
Lets keep the stronger of the two (winner) and compare it against this newcommer

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.960
This newcomer has five, five, five, and one, one, one

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.940
Okay. Five, five, five, one, one, one against four, four, four, four, zero, zero.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.180
Which one is stronger?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.780
Well... It looks like we will have to do arithmetic that would be a bit ugly

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.620
Arithmetic may not be so difficult but we don't want to mess around with calculations

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.940
Fortunately, there is a very nifty way of arguing qualitative and seeing which one is stronger

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.180
We argue as follows:

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.400
You see this one is half of the time it comes up five. So suppose that it comes up five, which happens half of the time.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.840
Well in that case, whatever the other die does, this has won already

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.620
because the other die has only fours or zeros. So this wins already half of the time.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.260
But even if it shows up one. Well it still has some non-zero residual positive probability of winning  if the other one were careless enough to show zero

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.920
So it wins fifty percent plus change so this is strictly stronger than that one

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.520
and this is why this one is stronger than the other one

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.840
Well, this is a very nice argument because in the definition, we don't really are by how much you win

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.060
all you have to know is which wins more often

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.400
So we don't have to calculate exact probabilities if you can say whether this wins more often than that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.780
that's the end of the story

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.820
So the totem pole continues like this. This one beats this one, and this one beats this one

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.020
Okay. Now let's compare this winner with the newcomer.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.360
The newcomer has six, six, and two, two, two, two.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.040
Two, two, two, two, and six, six.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.840
Whereas the previous champion was five, five, five, one, one, one.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.220
Which wins more often?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.920
Again, it looks like a matter of arithmetic and we wanted to avoid arithmetic.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.300
Fortunately, there is a nifty argument which qualitatively decides which one wins more often

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.520
And it's the same argument as before but we apply it to the looser this time

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.960
Let's say that this has shown one, this came up one.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.440
In which case, it has already lost, whatever the other die does because the other die has only sixes and twos

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.340
Okay, so this one has already lost half of the time, at least half of the time

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:01.940
But even if it shows up five, it still has a non-zero positive residual probability of loosing against the other one if the other one were careful enough to show a six, instead of two

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.180
So this one looses fifty percent of the time plus change, so it looses more often than the other one

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.400
so this is weaker than the other one. That is why this is weaker, this is stronger so this beats this one.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.680
So far then, we have seen the following ranking. This beats this, this beats this, this beats this.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.000
This beats this, this beats this, this beats this.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.360
But now let's compare the two ends.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.380
This one has six, six, two, two, two, two.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.000
This was three everywhere. Which one wins more often?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:44.620
Of course this one because this one wins four times out of six when the other one shows up two, and looses only two times when the other one chooses six out of six

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.520
So, the situation is that this beats this, this beats this, this beats this, but this beats this.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.320
There is a cycle. And we call this a non-transitive cycle in probabilistic comparisons

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.580
I think that this phenomenon, which has been known for quite a long time, but deserves to be known to everyone. Really all citizens!

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.280
What we are saying it that if you are comparing the performance of three drugs of something like that,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:19.860
and then you say "A cures more people than B" in some statistical sample. And in another statistical sample "B cures more people than C"

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.180
You cannot necessarily conclude that A is better than C. You know, A better than B, B better than C

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.840
does not necessarily, when you're doing probabilistic comparisons, [mean] that A is better than C

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.700
It might happen to be true, but we are saying that is not the logical necessity

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.960
and in fact this example shows you cannot conclude that.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.300
Again, I'd like to emphasize that as long as you're comparing the average scores, this kind of phenomenon will never occur

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.620
of course because all the average scores can be ranked in a linear fashion

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.340
But if you are comparing which one is more often, there is a lot of conditioning going on

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:00.880
and that is why you cannot so carelessly conclude that A better than B, B better than C, means that A is better than C

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.820
That's not necessarily true.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.960
This is called a non-transitive dice. This kind of situation is called non-transitive probabalistic comparision

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.760
When you compare probabilities, you have to be quite careful and it occurs in all sorts of serious and interesting situations

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.140
...have to be fair. Whereas your ordinary cube has excessive amounts of symmetry, you could say.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:32.960
I mean there's extra symmetries like; this think is the same shape but it's still face two...
