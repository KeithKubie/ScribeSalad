through the school of analytics I knew

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
through the school of analytics I knew
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.300

defender trying to stop him Kobe's worst
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960
defender trying to stop him Kobe's worst
case scenario and my best case scenario

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
case scenario and my best case scenario
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.260
case scenario and my best case scenario
was to make him shoot a pull-up jumper

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
was to make him shoot a pull-up jumper
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.039
was to make him shoot a pull-up jumper
going to his left hand all right

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049
going to his left hand all right
 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.190

the average possession of the Los

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
the average possession of the Los
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.179
the average possession of the Los
Angeles Lakers in 2008 was generated

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
Angeles Lakers in 2008 was generated
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.840
Angeles Lakers in 2008 was generated
point nine eight points per possession

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
point nine eight points per possession
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
point nine eight points per possession
0.98 so he took the average possession

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
0.98 so he took the average possession
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.109
0.98 so he took the average possession
of the Lakers they were going to score

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
of the Lakers they were going to score
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539
of the Lakers they were going to score
0.98 points every time they had a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
0.98 points every time they had a
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.060
0.98 points every time they had a
possession and so Kobe Bryant only shot

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
possession and so Kobe Bryant only shot
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.570
possession and so Kobe Bryant only shot
the left-handed pull-up jumper at a 44%

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
the left-handed pull-up jumper at a 44%
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.070
the left-handed pull-up jumper at a 44%
clip so every time that he went left he

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
clip so every time that he went left he
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.970
clip so every time that he went left he
shot that pull-up jumper

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980
shot that pull-up jumper
 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.420
shot that pull-up jumper
he was generating 0.88 points per

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
he was generating 0.88 points per
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890
he was generating 0.88 points per
possession well that's a tenth of a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
possession well that's a tenth of a
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140
possession well that's a tenth of a
point less than the average Laker

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
point less than the average Laker
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.009
point less than the average Laker
possession and so if I could make him do

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019
possession and so if I could make him do
 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.289
possession and so if I could make him do
that time and time again which is a lot

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
that time and time again which is a lot
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.130
that time and time again which is a lot
tougher to to do than to say I'm shaving

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
tougher to to do than to say I'm shaving
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.500
tougher to to do than to say I'm shaving
off a tenth of a point every single time

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
off a tenth of a point every single time
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.400
off a tenth of a point every single time
I'm actually making him detrimental to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
I'm actually making him detrimental to
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.490
I'm actually making him detrimental to
his team and the way you have to look at

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
his team and the way you have to look at
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.369
his team and the way you have to look at
it is all these tenths of points all

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379
it is all these tenths of points all
 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.800
it is all these tenths of points all
right add up they add up here they add

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810
right add up they add up here they add
 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.759
right add up they add up here they add
up here at up there

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
up here at up there
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.170
up here at up there
I'm sudden those tenths of a points

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
I'm sudden those tenths of a points
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.360
I'm sudden those tenths of a points
become points and in NBA as we all know

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370
become points and in NBA as we all know
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.220
become points and in NBA as we all know
the margin between wins and losses is

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
the margin between wins and losses is
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.500
the margin between wins and losses is
very very thin so those tenths of points

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
very very thin so those tenths of points
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.360
very very thin so those tenths of points
matter and that's all it really is it's

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
matter and that's all it really is it's
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280
matter and that's all it really is it's
no different than them play in the stock

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
no different than them play in the stock
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.830
no different than them play in the stock
market you're trying to shave percentage

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840
market you're trying to shave percentage
 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.619
market you're trying to shave percentage
points off you're off your risk and if

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629
points off you're off your risk and if
 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.390
points off you're off your risk and if
you can accumulate enough guess what

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400
you can accumulate enough guess what
 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.039
you can accumulate enough guess what
you're going to do very well and so

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049
you're going to do very well and so
 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.550
you're going to do very well and so
guarding a guy like Kobe Bryant

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560
guarding a guy like Kobe Bryant
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.780
guarding a guy like Kobe Bryant
understanding exactly who he is what his

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
understanding exactly who he is what his
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.750
understanding exactly who he is what his
weaknesses made me a much better

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
weaknesses made me a much better
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.479
weaknesses made me a much better
defender taught me to stick around the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489
defender taught me to stick around the
 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.079
defender taught me to stick around the
NBA for for 13 years
