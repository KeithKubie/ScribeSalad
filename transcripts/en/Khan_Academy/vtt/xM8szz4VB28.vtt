00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.033
For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.974
it's easy to forget that throughout human history and even today

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:13.553
the amount of humans or human population has been limited by our ability to get calories

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:19.144
or get human consumable food from the land, so what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:22.729
a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:28.102
calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:32.698
that can live in any given area, or the population density of humans.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:38.890
So right over here you have some gentlemen looking for food, they are hunter-gatherers.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.808
I'll say HG for short, and the H part, the hunter part that they might actually find some animals.

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:48.472
I think these guys are trying right over here are trying to trap some rabbits

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.371
and the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food

00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:59.804
maybe they find fruit of some sort, or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans

00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:04.369
so literally just walk around either try to kill things or find things they can consume.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.223
So I'll call this right over here stage one.

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:12.392
So this is hunter-gatherers, this is what most humans

00:01:12.392 --> 00:01:15.974
have done through most of human history.

00:01:15.974 --> 00:01:18.221
And just to give us a little bit of a framework

00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:20.301
for how much they could get from the land,

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:25.062
I looked in some of the best sense of studying HG populations

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.109
in land like this maybe they can get about 200 calories.

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:35.895
I'll make this a whole column, this whole column is the amount

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:42.722
that they can get in terms of calories per square kilometre per day.

00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:44.968
Now it's obviously going to be hugely dependent

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.226
on the number of animals that live there,

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:50.642
the type of land that's there, if they're next to a stream

00:01:50.642 --> 00:01:52.809
where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:54.435
this number would be much higher,

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:55.727
if they were in some type of desert

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:57.217
this number would be much lower.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.227
But this is actually fairly in line with

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:01.710
some of the studies of HG cultures.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.226
Now if this the number of calories that they can get

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:06.810
from each square kilometre per day,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.306
how many humans can live in a square kilometre per day?

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:10.975
What is the density of humans?

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:13.813
Well, to figure that out we have know on average

00:02:13.813 --> 00:02:17.227
how many calories does a human need to survive,

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:19.801
and for the sake of this video I'm going to make the assumption

00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:26.557
that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:29.642
to survive in a non-malnourished state.

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.722
And obviously it's hugely dependent on

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:35.055
how activ this person is or how large they are.

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.550
And one other note: this whole I will be using

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.477
Calories with the capital C.

00:02:39.477 --> 00:02:42.218
The Calories with the capital C are the calories

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:44.638
that people are used to refering to when you go to the gym

00:02:44.638 --> 00:02:47.052
and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burnt

00:02:47.052 --> 00:02:50.074
or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories.

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:52.440
These are tha calories I'm talking about.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.526
They're slightly different notion than the calories

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:56.969
that you encounter in your chemistry class.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.728
Those calories are calories with a lower case c.

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:05.729
And just so that you can be optimally confused it turns out that

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:16.453
1 Calory with an upper case C is equal to 1,000 calories with a lower case c.

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:20.556
And the lower case c calories are the amount of energy

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:25.136
needed to heat 1 gramme of water 1Â°C.

00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:27.057
So this is what you see in your chemistry class

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:29.969
but this is not what we are going to be talking about in this video.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.141
We're talking about the capital C Calories

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.143
that dietitians are always talking about.

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:39.144
So with this assumption that the average human eats 2000 Calories a day

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:41.971
to not get malnourished, and obviously man would eat more,

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.137
women would eat less, children would eat even less,

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:48.097
but with this assumption, what is the density of humans

00:03:48.097 --> 00:03:50.807
that could be supported by this culture right over here?

00:03:50.807 --> 00:03:56.804
Well, 200 Calories is 1 tenth of the average daily human requirement

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:58.387
if you believe this assumption.

00:03:58.387 --> 00:04:05.305
The the population density, humans per square kilometre

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:10.303
you can always support 1 tenth of a human with this Calory output!

00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:15.311
So you can only support 0.1 of a human per a square kilometre.

00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.308
So 1 human would actually need 10 square kilometres

00:04:18.308 --> 00:04:23.394
to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves!

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:26.058
They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometres

00:04:26.058 --> 00:04:28.476
to support an entire family,

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.562
so they could wander around and kill the animals

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:33.559
and find whatever they need to find on that land.

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.309
Now let's go to kind of you can view as maybe the next stage

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.894
although it's now always the case that herding is going to be

00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:41.392
more productive than HG, especially with that case

00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:42.811
with the fish jumping out of the water,

00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:45.309
but let's go to the scenario right over here.

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:51.149
So this is, we can call this a pastoral life-style.

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.136
So this is 2, I'll call it pastoral.

00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:55.976
And over here is the realisation that,

00:04:55.976 --> 00:05:00.471
look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume

00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:03.724
but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation

00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:10.372
and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by humans

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:13.141
and, namely, the calories are themselves!

00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:14.770
So this gentleman right over here

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.081
after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat,

00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:21.310
he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.098
so one way to think about this cattle or these sheep right over here

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.556
by herding them and letting them eat this grass

00:05:29.556 --> 00:05:36.100
he is turning non-human-consumable calories into human-consumable calories.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.723
And for the sake of our thought experiment let's tell we got

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:44.470
10 time increase in the human-consumable calories per square kilometre.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.309
So now instead of 200 we're up to 2,000.

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:56.558
And so instead of one human per square kilometre per day to support one human ...

00:05:56.558 --> 00:05:59.895
oh sorry, instead of 0.1 we can now support 1 human.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.808
So in that 10 square kilometres we can now support 10 people,

00:06:02.808 --> 00:06:06.366
in 100 square kilometres we can now support 100 people.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.224
Now the next stage - and I'm skipping a bunch of stages

00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:12.060
because we have things like subsistence agriculture

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.474
and various forms that are not going to be equally productive,

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:18.628
it depends what the land is like, it depends what tools at disposal,

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.561
but the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.769
we can call traditional agriculture.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:29.298
So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture.

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:34.031
And that's this one over here as well, so both of these I'm going to call traditional agriculture.

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:36.975
For the purposes of this video the difference between

00:06:36.975 --> 00:06:39.069
traditional agriculture and modern agriculture -

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.560
in traditional agriculture you didn't have mechanisation,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.562
so you had very primitive mechanisation,

00:06:45.562 --> 00:06:48.474
you definitely didn't have fossil fuel based engines,

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.638
you didn't have modern pesticides,

00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:54.823
you didn't have modern genetically engineered crops,

00:06:54.823 --> 00:06:58.226
but you have some of the basic science of breeding crop

00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:01.228
and irrigating and using animals as tools.

00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:04.805
So in this stage right over here, and once again,

00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:07.637
it completely depends on where you are on the planet,

00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:10.807
how fertile the land is, how good your tools are,

00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:12.561
what crops you are actually producing.

00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.228
Let's assume that we've got a hundredfold increasse in the productivity.

00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:19.366
And looking in some of the historical records it looks like, it's depending on

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:22.479
once again where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility.

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:28.229
So you have a hundredfold increase, so insdead of 2,000 calories per square kilometre per day

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:33.310
you can get 200,000 calories per square kilometre per day,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.469
and now you can support 100 humans per square kilometre - if you wanna to!

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:41.035
So you might not have 100 humans,

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:44.142
one on all of the land, you might not be able to farm from,

00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:50.057
or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be,

00:07:50.057 --> 00:07:53.226
but the important thing is to think about this upper bound.

00:07:53.226 --> 00:07:57.219
In this traditional you are able to get type of productivity from your land

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:01.774
and you are able to in theory support 100 people per 1 square kilometre,

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:04.768
that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there,

00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:06.765
they maybe every once migrate to this land

00:08:06.765 --> 00:08:08.432
because it seems as specially fertile

00:08:08.432 --> 00:08:10.055
or there are really small farmers living there,

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:13.142
then all of a sudden not everyone is going to get 2,000 calories a day,

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:16.770
some people might get malnourished, other people might actually starve.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.699
There is this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:24.642
based on how productive the land actually is.

00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:27.224
Now let's move over to modern agriculture

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:32.397
and we want to talk a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture.

00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:36.475
You have machines like this combine over here

00:08:36.475 --> 00:08:38.432
that does a lot of the human labour.

00:08:38.432 --> 00:08:42.708
One human can... I'll talk about the different dimensions

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:44.433
because there are actually two dimensions here:

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:47.057
how much calories can you get from the land,

00:08:47.057 --> 00:08:53.058
and how much energy and labour can one human input into the land

00:08:53.058 --> 00:08:55.054
using tools at their disposal.

00:08:55.054 --> 00:08:57.891
So in this case cattle, these oxen pulling this plough,

00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:00.978
or in this case this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels.

00:09:00.978 --> 00:09:04.560
But in modern agriculture, because all of the things,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.558
you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops,

00:09:07.558 --> 00:09:11.724
you have modern pesticides and ... not everyone is a fan of all of these things,

00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:15.102
but they have hugely increased our productivity.

00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:18.363
So you have modern agriculture.

00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:21.563
Let's say that you have another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture.

00:09:21.563 --> 00:09:26.561
so now you can get 2,000,000 calories per square kilometre per day,

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:34.149
or you can support 1,000 humans per square kilometre.

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:38.725
So once again this right over here is an upper bound.

00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:43.305
And just to give a sense, I picked these numbers just so that nubmers would be clear

00:09:43.305 --> 00:09:46.142
I looked in some historical records, these are completely out of line

00:09:46.142 --> 00:09:49.056
with what it looks like human have been able to do in the past,

00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:53.230
but to give you a sense of what human populatin densities look like right now

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:57.891
and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct,

00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:07.684
in a place like the U.S. the population density is 30 people per square kilometre,

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:11.895
in a more dense country or a significantly more dense country like India

00:10:11.895 --> 00:10:17.561
the population density is 300 humans per square kilometre.

00:10:17.561 --> 00:10:21.048
And in the most population dense country in the world,

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:25.040
which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.730
but where some of my ancestors came from,

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.725
which is Bangladesh, so there's a lot of people like me, I guess,

00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:41.398
Bangladesh has population density of 900 humans per square kilometre!

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:44.816
To some degree this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else,

00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:48.772
but this is pretty near the limits depending on

00:10:48.772 --> 00:10:51.768
agricultural productivity in what now on the land

00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:55.142
of modern technology, so it really makes you think

00:10:55.142 --> 00:10:56.638
if you don't get population under control,

00:10:56.638 --> 00:11:01.558
you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios.

00:11:01.558 --> 00:11:04.308
And so the last thing I want you to think about

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:06.477
and this is why I reffered to a little bit more,

00:11:06.477 --> 00:11:09.481
is just think about those two dimensions

00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:11.640
because sometimes it get a little bit muddled.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.434
One is the kind of the productivity of land

00:11:17.434 --> 00:11:23.398
and at the other there is productivity of labour.

00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:28.895
So right over here in HG, they're not getting many calories from their land

00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:31.709
so they're right over there, and the humans have to do all the labour,

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:34.130
they don't have animals helping them in any way,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.961
they definitely don't have robots or any types of engines helping them in any way,

00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:42.981
and so there have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labour

00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:45.807
doing the work, getting that productivity from the land.

00:11:45.807 --> 00:11:50.150
But as progress with things that aid humans,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.645
so for example if you all of a sudden have cattle helping you

00:11:54.645 --> 00:11:57.227
or you have other tools that help you,

00:11:57.227 --> 00:12:01.147
you get more human productivity, so less and less of human labour

00:12:01.147 --> 00:12:03.431
has to be used to get that productivity from the land

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.814
so maybe other humans can do other things

00:12:05.814 --> 00:12:08.313
like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever,

00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:13.145
and in this direction you get higher productivity per unit of land

00:12:13.145 --> 00:12:17.707
and so that comes from moving from HG to a pastoral life-style

00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:20.898
to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming.

00:12:20.898 --> 00:12:26.816
And so in this graph kind of tools for the individuals move us up,

00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:28.975
getting productivity from the land moves us right,

00:12:28.975 --> 00:12:32.226
modern argriculture gets us right over here.

00:12:32.226 --> 00:12:36.140
So we're getting mach more calories per unit land

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.231
and we're getting much more calories per unit labour.

00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:44.223
So you need much smaller percentage of the human population

00:12:44.223 --> 00:12:47.226
actually involved in the farming.

00:12:47.226 --> 00:12:50.726
Anyway, I let you go there, hopefuly that gives you at least an undesrtanding

00:12:50.726 --> 00:12:53.891
of that food doesn't just come from nowhere,

00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:57.891
it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population.
