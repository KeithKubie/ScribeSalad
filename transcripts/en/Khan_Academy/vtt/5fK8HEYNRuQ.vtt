00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
Silvia is growing tomato plants
and studying their heights.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Here is her data.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.440
So the beefsteak tomato type
had a height of 3 and 1/4 feet,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.960
Roma 2 and 7/8 feet,
cherry 3 and 1/2 feet.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.620
And they ask us, what
is the difference

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.150
between the heights
of the beefsteak,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.070
so that's that one
right over there,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.750
and the Roma tomato plants?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.041
So they want us to find the
distance between these two

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:30.540
heights.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.010
So this cherry tomato height
was really unnecessary

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.990
for the sake of this problem.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.050
So we want to find the
difference in these two

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.550
heights.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.829
So we want to subtract
the smaller of these

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:40.870
from the larger of these.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.760
So we're really trying to
evaluate what 3 and 1/4

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.030
minus 2 and 7/8 is.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.790
Now, the first thing that I like
to do is convert both of these

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.727
into mixed numbers.

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:01.310
Sorry, they're already
mixed numbers--

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.870
to convert both of these
into improper fractions.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.400
So 3 and 1/4 is
the same thing as 3

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.840
plus 1/4, which is the same
thing as 12/4 plus 1/4.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.130
That's the same
thing as 3 and 1/4.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.210
And from that, we're going
to subtract 2 and 7/8.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.420
2 and 7/8 is the same
thing as 2 plus 7/8.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.130
2 is the same thing
as 16/8 plus 7/8.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.630
So this is essentially what
we are trying to figure out.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.820
Now, what is 12/4 plus 1/4?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.370
It's 13/4, 13 over 4.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.220
And then, what's 16/8 plus 7/8?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.850
Well, that's 23/8.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.160
So this is going to be
minus 23 over eight.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.697
Now, we're subtracting
one fraction from another.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.155
But we have different
denominators.

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:58.010
So we can't make
sense of this until we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.240
have the same denominator.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.040
And so what is the least
common multiple of these two

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.920
denominators, of both 4 and 8?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.740
What is the smallest number that
is divisible by both 4 and 8?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.410
Well, 8 is divisible by 8.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.360
And 8 is also divisible by 4.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.640
So if we can rewrite 13/4 as
having 8 as a denominator,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.710
then we are all set.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.570
So let's try to do that.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.489
So we're going to write
both of these with 8

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.280
as the denominator.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.670
This one already has it.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.370
So 13/4, I'm going to have
it with 8 as the denominator.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.310
So to get from 4 to 8, we have
to multiply the denominator

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.924
by 2.

00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:37.090
So in order to not change
the value of the fraction,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.465
we have to multiply
the numerator

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:40.370
by that exact same value.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.750
We've got to multiply it by 2.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.610
So this becomes 26/8.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.350
And from 26/8, we're
going to subtract 23/8.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:59.600
And so this is going to be
over 8-- 26 minus 23, which

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.770
is equal to, and we deserve
our drum roll now, is 3.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.820
So it's 3/8.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.330
So the difference between
the heights of the beefsteak

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.136
and Roma tomato plants-- 3/8.

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:13.760
And everything we've
been doing insofar

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
has been in feet,
so 3/8 of a foot.
