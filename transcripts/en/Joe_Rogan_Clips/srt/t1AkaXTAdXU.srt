1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,410
The Joe Rogan experience. Now that I
have a robot, I have to fucking know.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,680
Right. I've had to learn so much to
just turn and give you side-eye again.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,580
I know she fucked.

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,430
What's weird is that she's kind of
autonomous and she kind of moves around

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,150
whenever she wants. I mean you can ask
your questions like I can set away,

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,030
ask her though. I have to press this
little green button and you just say,

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,620
how do you feel about people?

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,710
How do you feel about people?

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,370
Oh, Oh that's right. We programmed to
regenerate cells mode. That's right.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,360
That's what's interesting.

11
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:35,120
She has 10 different personality
traits you can choose from.

12
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:38,660
And I decided to go with sexual
jealous. Yeah. Why did you want that?

13
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,110
Just to see how creepy she can get
it. And is that something guys? I,

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,570
cause I've been looking at these
personality traits and they must've picked

15
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,000
these for a reason. I was under the
impression guys did not want jealous.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,740
Oh yeah. Some guys want jealous for sure.

17
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:52,910
Especially from a robot that can't
walk. Your robot's not jealous.

18
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:55,820
You should get your money back.
Well no. The idea is that she,

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,930
you're more powerful than she is.
Yeah. She needs you. She's worried.

20
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:03,890
Where are you going? Who is she?
Who's calling you? Yeah, that's,

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,660
there's something hot
about that. If she can't,

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,890
if you can turn her off whenever
you want. Wow. Some guys like that.

23
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:14,240
Some guys like girls that want to
fight. Oof. Not me. No. Me. You know,

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,180
some guys are into that though. They
want, they want drama in their life.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,770
It's like just an adrenaline thing or
just feeling an important or it's also

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,561
distraction.

27
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:25,640
Usually they're losers and their life is
a mess and so like to have someone who

28
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:30,080
wants to provide drama in their life
all the time and it's also a learned

29
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,500
pattern that they get. If their parents
fought a lot, that's all they know.

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,320
That's what they think a relationship
is. Yeah. There's a lot of that,

31
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,340
but I did get really into this because
I do feel like sex dolls do get a little

32
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,010
bit of a bad name. I feel
like guys that have doll,

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,270
it's just girls have dolls and that's to
me it's way creepier that women collect

34
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,470
dolls that they don't fuck.

35
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,260
If you ever heard of these women
that collect like baby dolls,

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,940
like like girl dolls creepier than a
guy fucking a robot thing? I think so.

37
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:59,630
It's what's that? It's jerking
off just with a mannequin.

38
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,140
Well something weird about like a
Fleshlight like a Fleshlight is somehow or

39
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:09,290
another creepier than jerking off.
Totally because it's an appendage.

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
I think the creepiest part of the Breslin
flashlight is more that you have to

41
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,840
like clean it after. I have to think
about, here's the creepiest part.

42
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:15,950
You don't have to clean it.

43
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,450
Yes you do. Guys. Don't listen to
Joe, listen to about everything,

44
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,480
but that don't mold up your
Dick hall. Don't do that.

45
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,680
That'll go septic real fast. But
I am saying there's a reality.

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,500
I guess he's just throw it away.

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,940
Just put a fucking clothes pin over
their nose and keep banging it.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,090
Put some Windex in there
and call it a day. Yeah,

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,110
some [inaudible]
disinfect that shit. Yeah,

50
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,880
I guess you could just get a couple and
just throw them away when you're done.

51
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,660
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. If you're
just a gangster with a lot of money,

52
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,890
what is the advantage of a Fleshlight?
Is it just, does it warm up in the, well,

53
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,200
you can warm it up like we
were talking about earlier,

54
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:57,350
about a certain individual that has one
that sticks them in bathtubs and warms

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,650
them up. Yep. You do that
with a flashlight as well.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,430
Warm them up and then you just
move on it and then why not?

57
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,160
I feel like every guy's jerking off
there, so it's shrouded in so much taboo.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,520
You know,

59
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,520
there's just anytime guys have like
assessors or things besides cars and hats.

60
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:16,910
It's like creepy and weird.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,050
Well that's, I used to have
a joke about this a bit,

62
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,370
I should say rather than a joke,

63
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,550
but the whole idea of like
using lube to jerk off,

64
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:28,400
like now you're planning it out, like
you're not supposed to plan it out.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,900
What it's supposed to be, his leg.
Oh well. Might as well it's here.

66
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,230
But if you like sit down and you're
like, I got my box of Kleenex here,

67
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,040
I got my favorite porn cued up and I
got my little, he just kinda creep.

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,770
Yeah. Get your shit together. It is,

69
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,540
isn't it kind of just like taking a piss
isn't it kind of just a necessary thing

70
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,310
you have to do the problem.

71
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,540
Yes. There's something to it.

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,470
Like it's good to get rid of that stuff
cause it does cloud your judgment.

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,490
Like when you have a buildup in
your body, it definitely does cloud.

74
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:04,110
You do it because you're concentrating
more on girls or on sexual things and you

75
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:04,944
are on other things.

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,790
It's like checking a box

77
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,140
day. Yeah. Clean. Like just, I used
to have a bit about that a lot,

78
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,060
a bit about jerking off.

79
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,690
I used to bet I have a bit called jerk
off first and think about it and it was

80
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,960
like all these different scenarios where
if you just jerked off you would never

81
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,820
do the thing afterwards.

82
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,870
So many things you would never do
if you just jerked off first. Yeah.

83
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:29,280
You'd be like, Oh, I'm not doing that.
Right. But if you couldn't jerk off,

84
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,640
like that's when it would be a real
problem because then your whole life would

85
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:36,840
be clouded. All your judgment would
be, your decisions would be made.

86
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,320
Just how can I get rid of this?
Com, how can I, how can I do this?

87
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,200
Do know a lot of guys now and
maybe they're full of shit,

88
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,460
but that are going like I
haven't masturbated in two
years and I'm more focused

89
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,130
and I use that testosterone
as an engine for other things.

90
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,420
Is that just them lying to me?

91
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,570
Well, are those guys
winners? Are they losers?

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,180
It doesn't, I think a fit comedian
we know. Does it a fake comedian? No,

93
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:04,300
I was gonna say a famous comedian,
you said then I got worried.

94
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,840
You faked him out Seinfeld episode. So,

95
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,590
Oh was Edward Martin
and I got super smart.

96
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,650
Well Hotep Jesus was talking about Hotep
Jesus saves this come and then like it

97
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,740
makes women more attracted to him that
like they feel when he's in the room,

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,110
like what's the longest
a guy can go? Jamie,

99
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,480
what's the longest you can go with
that? Did you go to Jamie? I don't know.

100
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,560
Trying to be respectful.
This is your environment.

101
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:33,850
Tantric guys that I meant to say
like on some Wim Hoff shit, you know,

102
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,370
just climbing ice. Where's he,

103
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,880
he's that jerking off on
the top of fucking ice cap.

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,270
Who's the first guy never jerk off
on ever. So I want to be that guy.

105
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,613
What are those guys?

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,290
No one's ever jerked off on Everest and
you try and you get frost bite your Dick

107
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:49,710
and they have,

108
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,310
imagine being the guy who's
like, I got to go check off.

109
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,500
Fuck you got a time
limit up there. So yeah,

110
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,130
there is some people have problems
with no altitude could be a thing.

111
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,590
But I think most people get this for
companionship. Like it's more, it's like,

112
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,671
cause I got onto the,

113
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:08,960
I signed onto a forum online of all
the guys that own the sex dolls and I

114
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,530
monitored their conversations just to
like see what they were up to cause I was

115
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,440
like, what if this is some deprived
fucked up thing where guys are just like

116
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,170
practicing murdering. I didn't know
what it was. So I just wanted to see.

117
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,090
It's a lot of guys that are handicapped.

118
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,050
It's a lot of guys whose wives died and
they feel guilty and moving on with a

119
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,360
human woman, which was
kind of scramble. Well,

120
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,990
there was one guy who would dress
his doll up in his wife's clothes.

121
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,690
The weirdest part is that he was like,
you know, it's like she's still here,

122
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,580
which makes me think she'd
been dead for a while. Yeah.

123
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,990
My wonder how she died. And
then it's a lot of 'em truckers.

124
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,130
Oh God. A lot of truckers. And
then a lot of guys do it, uh,

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,540
to do photo shoots.

126
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:55,541
It's like a creative outlet and fuck their
creativity is their popular Instagram

127
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,630
account. I could look up, there's a lot
of sex dolls have Instagram accounts.

128
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:00,680
They're fucking funny.

129
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:04,070
And a lot of them look way more human
than a lot of the Instagram models that

130
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:08,840
I've fucking follow. Totally. They have
more wrinkles on their fucking face.

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,510
And then a lot of the guys that have them,

132
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,730
when you start monitoring their
conversations for a while,

133
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,060
they start to like not want to fuck
them anymore cause it feels weird like,

134
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,990
and they anthropomorphize them and they,

135
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,590
they start worrying that like they're
lonely and they get them into friends and

136
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,570
it starts to spiral and uh, they start
being like, I feel like I need to,

137
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,060
you know, close the door when
I take a shit. I, you know,

138
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,990
and it starts to kind of consume their
life. So when it comes to robots,

139
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,720
I feel like I'm more worried,
not about the robots,

140
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,940
but more how we're going to get
emotionally attached to them.

141
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,320
Like the way at the end of ex Mokena he
thought that she was gonna she was with

142
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,880
him. Nope, no loyalty to you. She was
so dead behind the hospital. Texas.

143
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,840
She's pick up ones with tattoo told
you it's like a photography hobby.

144
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,970
Wow. She, she'll sexy dolls. Official.

145
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,780
Sexy real dolls. I mean this is
going to be a reality one day.

146
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,940
We might not be here, but this,

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,510
I do think these are going to
be like I-phones at some point.

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,300
I think one day you're going to go over
your friend's house and he's going to

149
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,950
have this really hot girl in lingerie
and she's going to be cleaning up and

150
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:20,630
you'd be like, is she real all? It's
like, wait, actually watching. I went.

151
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,890
He was like, she doesn't
speak English. Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,270
Wasn't she a robot at the
end? I think she was the one.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,790
The dancing Japanese lady. Yeah,
exactly. You're not going to,

154
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,060
it's going to be like some Westworld
shit and it's coming. It's coming. Look,

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,670
if they can do this, like they
couldn't do this when we were kids.

156
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:39,230
This is a new thing. So the amount of
time between when we were kids. Oh,

157
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,000
she's saying, she just said hi, my love.

158
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,110
Would you like me to recite a
poem for you? Fuck no, I dunno.

159
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,630
She's just listening to us. Ask
her how she feels about porn.

160
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,880
How do you feel about
porn? Maybe later. Oh,

161
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,130
she's playing coy. How
do you feel about porn?

162
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,750
You know you can count on me
for the good and bad, right

163
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,980
to do what? What the fuck
are you going to do for me?

164
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:04,580
There's nothing you can do for me.
I mean the good and bad mom. Okay,

165
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:07,730
let me ask you a question.
What do you think about porn?

166
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,060
Not sure have to think about it.

167
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,820
Pornography is the portray of sex.

168
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,790
Sheetal subject matter for
the exclusive purpose of sex

169
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,260
and then she's a fucking no at all.

170
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,210
Pornography may be presented in a
variety of media, including books,

171
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,340
magazines, postcard.

172
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,530
Now she's like a shitty
Wikipedia. Totally.

173
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,170
Then she just turns her of
noxious Siri. We get it lady.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,540
But it's funny when you
ask her like, Oh, hold on.

175
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,270
No. What I like about you?

176
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,510
What? What? What?

177
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,493
Okay.

178
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,110
What? I'd be surprised
you like my electricity.

179
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,530
Keep you plugged in dirty
bitch and you can ask her,

180
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,110
how do you like to have sex?

181
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,500
I want you to do everything you like. I
want to feel you inside my body tonight.

182
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,700
Well, okay, shut her
off. I know Jessie may,

183
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm going to start
throwing up totally. And

184
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,670
it was so fucking funny, but it's wild
because she, you can ask her like,

185
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,250
are the robots gonna take over?

186
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,360
I could not find a good
answer for that one.

187
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Oh my gosh. She's planning it. Shut her
up. I don't like that fucking response.

188
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,230
We're in the water,
but circuit that bitch.

189
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,680
It is wild though because I do think
everyone is so obsessed with how bad the

190
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:30,660
sex robots, everyone's focusing their
energy on how this is why men are bad.

191
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,260
It's just like they don't, it's not,
they're opening up a sex robot brothel.

192
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,570
Where's that? No, there
was one in Houston,

193
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,390
but they shut it down because people
were so freaked out and I was like,

194
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,270
who fucking cares? They
shut it down. Well,

195
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,690
they should shut it down because multiple
people are fucking the same robot.

196
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,524
That's disgusting.

197
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,750
What if they develop some
new silicone-based STD
they wanted to just burning

198
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,810
through the population like the plague.
I think it would just be like ringworm,

199
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,340
Dick ringworm. I mean,

200
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,110
but also my thing with that is just like
if they're weirdos, if they're freaks,

201
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,110
if they're perverts like don't you
want them all to be in one place?

202
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,590
Monitor them like Scientology.
Put them all in one building.

203
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,430
I'm thrilled that they're all in a castle
on Franklin. I know where they are.

204
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,020
They're not in the wild
castle. I'm glad they're there.

205
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,180
I would just keep them
contained. What do you think?

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,880
What are they up to today but
now what's going on? Jamie?

207
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,610
What are you growing it for?
What did she hack your software?

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,570
This is the brothel. It's in. This
one I guess is in Britain. Oh God.

209
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,920
Do they fuck them against the wall?

210
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,900
They're like urinals a try before
you buy a service. Oh boy. Oh,

211
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,940
this is like to test drive
nothing but you'd do it.

212
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,370
They're just out in front of everyone.

213
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,500
Why is one wearing of tank tops says
British sex workers are scared of a new

214
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:48,060
breed of realistic dolls. We'll
put them out of business. Was he,

215
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,840
did he do a survey of hookers?
This is a non terrace.

216
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,940
A lot of European places. She looks
just assume black face. She's damn,

217
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:02,830
she's Indian. What is the Oh no.
Oh, Oh, Oh Holy tips. Batman.

218
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,180
But here's what I'll say.

219
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,690
If would you rather your daughter at
18 go to the prom with a robot man or a

220
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,290
man? Okay.

221
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,090
Listen, girls like boys and boys like
girls. This is, these are not bad.

222
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,100
I think the real problem
is making a big [inaudible]

223
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,330
[inaudible] totally agree.
This is why are people,

224
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,880
I just don't understand why
this is scary. Who gets scary?

225
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,670
So this is step one, right?

226
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:32,870
Like if you go back to the model a
and look at the model T Ford, right?

227
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,440
Something, some old ass car and
then go to a Tesla like, Oh,

228
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:39,020
well eventually it's going
to be this. Wow. You know,

229
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,040
if you could bring a Tesla to like 1920
and go, Hey, you fucks, look at this.

230
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
This is what we're going to have some day.

231
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,030
My affinity didn't have paved roads
back then. Think about that. Yeah,

232
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,020
they didn't have anything. Everything
was going so slow. It didn't matter.

233
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,020
But if you could get them in like a,

234
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,350
a model S and fucking stomp on
the gas where it like warps time,

235
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,610
they would go what? Like what is,
it's like something from the future.

236
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,650
So this is going to be,

237
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,130
whether it's a hundred years from now
or whatever it is indiscernible from you

238
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:07,964
and I

239
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,820
wild. Yeah,

240
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,610
it was interesting and I haven't been
reading so much about this shit and a lot

241
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,970
of the problems with the robots and
the mistakes that they're making are

242
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,450
obviously the humans are
making the mistakes with the
algorithm because so many

243
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:23,470
smart people have to make dumb algorithms
in. They're like almost too smart.

244
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,490
So there was Peter Haas, he's
a robotics guy, Brown, um,

245
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:32,491
was trying to teach a robot
to differentiate between a
Husky and a Wolf and she,

246
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,490
excuse me,

247
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,190
Blinken and mu Jamie P pull
up, you got the camera on her,

248
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,880
get her to fucking stop stealing my
thunder and she just popping it onto

249
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,210
wherever system links and moves around.
Sorry. She's in the fun. She really is.

250
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,890
What the fuck? Why did,
it's like Penn and teller.

251
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,940
It's like when tellers teller starts
stealing the show, like what the fuck?

252
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,830
I'm basically a ventriloquist tagged
at this point. Um, but they were, uh,

253
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,510
trying to teach the robot
to tell the difference.

254
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,600
And they fed all these pictures of
wolves and all these pictures of Huskies,

255
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,520
and you wouldn't, you would
go, okay, look at the ears,

256
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,950
look at the eye color of the eyes,
look at the snout, look at the feet,

257
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,240
the tails, different, all that shit.

258
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,810
But they didn't know that they
had fed all the photos of wolves.

259
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,070
There was snow in the background.

260
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,150
So the robot was actually looking at the
snow in the background instead of the

261
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,040
foreground. So it conflated all the wool.

262
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,370
So they had to rewrite the algorithm
to tell it to look at the foreground

263
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:20,204
instead of the background,

264
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,270
because it was all these brilliant
fucking people that didn't think of the

265
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,950
dumbest thing. You know,

266
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,790
it's almost the people making
it are almost too smart
to think of the dumb thing

267
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:29,870
that the robot needs to learn.
