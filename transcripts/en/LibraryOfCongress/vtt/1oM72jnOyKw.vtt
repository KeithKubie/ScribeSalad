00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.400
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: OK.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Good morning.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.090
In the interest of time and to
respect those of you who are here

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.980
on time, I'd like to
begin our program.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.760
We're being videotaped and so
I would like also to make sure

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.090
that we can get the full benefit
of the resources available to us.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.720
I'm Sandra Charles, the library's
physician and Chief of the Office

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.590
of Occupational Medicine
and Health Services.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.210
And through the core activities
of that office, we exemplify

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.370
and give support to the library's
strategic objectives empowering the

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.280
workforce, capitalizing
on collaborations,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120
and leveraging the strength of
diversity in the library's staff,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.700
collections, and constituents.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.670
And I say that because
today's program is sort

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.550
of a coalition of all those things.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.330
Our health and wellness program
is one of the core activities

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.910
that we have, one of the
more pleasant core activities

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.210
that we have.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.510
And we see it as a
public health function

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.230
where we're serving a
population, the library staff,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.240
and we focus on enhancing
staff engagement,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.000
wellness, and productivity.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.080
We're not a very large staff.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.660
There are about seven of us and if
there are any health services staff

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.310
in the room would you please stand?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.650
Please? OK.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.780
And I think they're only
two missing [laughing].

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.620
But all that being said,
though we are a small staff,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.480
we have strong support from
our divorce partnerships

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.240
that we have both within
and outside of the library.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.750 position:56%
And here in the library, the Library

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.010
of Congress Professional
Association, LCPA,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.080
and other staff organizations
as well

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.910 position:56%
as our two year old wellness advisor
committee have been really strong

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.080
supporters not to mention
several other office and staff --

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.880
offices and staff from
across the service units.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.290
For example, we have our chair of
the wellness advisor committee,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.310
Wauneta Lyle, a cancer
survivor and a staunch

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.210 position:56%
and passionate advocate of wellness.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.160
She'll be giving our closing.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160
And the series that we
advertise, the Brown Bag Series

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.190
for Living Well, that we do jointly
with LCPA, was her brain child.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.910
We also have with us
today and the person

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.750 position:56%
who will be introducing our
speaker is Maureen Cohen Harrington,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.850
an associate general
counselor here at the library.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.900
She's also a member
of the advisory board

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.760
for the Congressional
Vegetarian Staff Association,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.500
which is also represented
here today.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.120
Adam. And she's an
avid in-line skater.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600 position:56%
So I thought she's a perfect role
model for the emphasis we're putting

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.250
on both eating well and good
nutrition and physical fitness.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.740
And I must say, before I
ask Maureen to come forward,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.890
that I see this coalition as
what really makes us strong.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.390
So I would say we are a small,
but mighty force for health

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.470
and wellness, or, in
Jamaican parlance,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.090
we're little, but tallawah.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.060
So [laughing] without
further ado, Maureen,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.140
which you come forward please
to introduce our speaker.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.290
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington:
There is a dignified way to get

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.670
up to the stage and
I [inaudible] it.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.010
Thank you.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.560
Thank you, Dr. Charles
and, to clarify,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.040
I'm Assistant General Counsel.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.490
You gave me a promotion,
but thank you [laughing].

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.010
Um, I am thrilled to
welcome Dr. Neal Barnard here

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.930
to the Library of Congress.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.330
Many thanks to all of you for
joining us especially to those

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.060
of you who had to walk
a few buildings over.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.770
Um, Dr. Barnard is Adjunct
Associate Professor of Medicine

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.270
at the George Washington
University School

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.450
of Medicine and Health Sciences.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.610
He's President of the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.340
He's founder of the non-profit
Barnard Medical Center here in DC.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.460
He's the author of more than
70 scientific publications

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.980 position:56%
and 18 books including several on
the New York Times Best Seller List.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.820
And he's got a stockpile of other
accomplishments too numerous

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.570
to mention here or
even in the program,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.530 position:56%
which does go into some more detail.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.300
But what I admire about Dr. Barnard
is that he's at the forefront

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.020
of a groundbreaking
and, in some ways,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.010
very simple approach to medicine.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.430
His work shows that
our diets can prevent

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.820
and sometimes even reverse many
serious health conditions including

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.920 position:56%
heart disease and some of the others
that he'll be discussing here today.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.200
We at the Congressional Vegetarian
Staff Association have been lucky

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.490
to have Dr. Barnard at some of our
events so I can personally vouch

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.470
for what a terrific speaker he is.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.360
In case you're wondering how I
ended up on the advisory board

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.940
of the Congressional
Staff Association,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.820
the CVSA decided a few years
ago to welcome its members --

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.960
among its membership library staff.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.720
So, if you're interested in
learning more about the group,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.390
please speak with me or to Adam
Sarvana, our President, over there.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.540
And now it's my pleasure to
turn this over to our wonderful

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.040
and distinguished speaker,
Dr. Barnard.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.070
[ Applause ]

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.960
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Thank you.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.060
Thank you.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.360
Well, thank you.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.660 position:56%
And thanks to all of you for coming.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.670
You know, when I was a
medical student at GW,

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.840
we talked about heart disease,
but it was a one way street.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.370
You know what I'm talking about?

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.070
You'll get this disease,
you'll never get rid of it,

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.970
and it wasn't just heart disease.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.710
Diabetes was that way.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.580
Once you had diabetes,
you'll always have diabetes.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.130
And what problems were
like that too.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.700
You might lose a little
bit of weight,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.860
but overall these things were
regarded as progressive conditions

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.000
that just don't get better.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.190
But we've started to see that
there's a very different way

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.120
of dealing with these diseases

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.850
and that's why I've called this
lecture Reversing Heart Disease.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.980 position:56%
Just so that we're all on the same
page about what we're talking about,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.840
garden variety heart disease is
in the coronary arteries so --

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.210
they're called coronary arteries
because they crown the heart and,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.090
if you look -- can you see this OK?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.170
OK. So the coronary arteries are
there to provide blood and oxygen

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.420
for the heart muscle and the heart
muscle can't work unless it gets a

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.740
good blood supply.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.230
But over time, for a lot of
people, this nice wide open artery

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.920
at the top gets gradually clogged

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.500
and these blockages can
rupture and cause blood clot.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.300
And that's like a cork
in a -- in a bottle.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.710
It just stops blood flow.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:19.630
And back in 1990, Dr. Dean Ornish
-- is that a familiar name?

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.980
Dean Ornish won -- he was -- he was
quite a young doctor at the time.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.780 position:56%
He said, "I want to see if we can
actually make this disease go away."

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.100
In other words he didn't want
to just try to prevent it

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.400
in people who didn't have it.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.200
He went into hospitals in
the San Francisco Bay area,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.950
he brought in people
who had heart disease,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.360
and wanted to see what he could do.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.870
So he -- he used an experimental
program, had four parts.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.520 position:56%
The first part was vegetarian foods.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.540
Now, why would you use
vegetarian foods in heart patients?

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.660
Why? Why would you do that?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.760
OK. Low fat, high in
fiber, no cholesterol.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.060
That's right.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.530
OK. Secondly, half
hour walk every day.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.060
Third, manage stress, which
is why he didn't do the study

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.360
and Washington, D.C.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.660
[ Laughing ]

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.960
Avoid tobacco.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.260
And that was the whole program.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.850
There was no medication
used, no surgery, nothing.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:17.310
And he had a comparison group that
followed regular medical advice.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.170
And after a year, their total
cholesterol dropped 24%.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.040
LDL, is that familiar?

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.820
Bad cholesterol.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.330
Dropped 37%.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.570
That's the kind of thing
that we use medications for.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.270
It happened just from diet change.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.710
But what got everybody's
attention was

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.130 position:56%
that they lost 22 pounds on average.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.220
If they were already skinny,
they didn't lose any weight,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.930
but if they were heavy,
they lost a lot of weight.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.600
And the average what loss
was 22 pounds in the year

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.420
without even counting calories.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.820
However, what made medical
history was something different.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.780
Everyone had an angiogram.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.540
An angiogram is a special
x-ray of the heart.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.670
It shows the little
trickle of blood that gets

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.610
through to the heart muscle.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.670 position:56%
And they compared the results at the
end to the results at the beginning,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.270
the angiogram at the beginning.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.700 position:56%
And you could see that the arteries,
instead of getting narrower

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.130
and narrower, were
actually opening up again.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.540
And the patients felt it because
their chest pain was gone usually

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.520
within four or five, six weeks.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.780
And at the end of a year, you
could see miserable changes

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.170
in 82% of the participants.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.470
No surgery.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.590
No drugs. Just these simple, cheap,
low-tech interventions with diet

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.030
and exercise and so forth.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.200
And then what got the insurance
companies' attention was,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.820
do you have to go back
to the hospital?

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.470
Do we need to operate on you?

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.550
Or do you die?

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.540
And the control group,
not doing so hot.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.970
But the intervention
group had a dramatic drop.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.780
So this really changed
medical history.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.250
And now Medicare says,
"You want this program?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.290
We'll pay for it," because it --

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.330
it's the best investment
that they can make.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.330
So heart disease is
not a one-way street.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.680
It's a two-way street.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:03.210
But it won't be a two-way street
unless we make the kinds of changes

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.750
that it takes to actually
take those clogged arteries

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.270
and open them up again.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.260
We thought that was kind
of a heroic thing to do

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.980
and it is unless you
follow the simple things

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.160
that your body needs
to regain its health.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.080
OK. So are there other parts of the
body that need healthy arteries?

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.430
Are there?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.720
Like? Oh, the brain!

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.360
Yes. This underused organ, um, does
need some -- I mean this year --

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.250
but the carotid artery
goes up and then it splits.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.880
Part of it goes to the outside
and part of it goes inside

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.230
and you can have blockages
there too.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.190
Meaning, you may not have a heart
attack, you might have a stroke.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.850
OK? Um, do we have
arteries elsewhere?

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.450
Sure we do.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.290
Um, the lower back.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.030
You know anybody who's
got chronic back pain?

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.970
Um, researchers in Scandinavia
did the most amazing thing.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.850
They started looking at
autopsies of people who had --

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.960
who had died after having had back
pain for a long period of time.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.610
And they found a couple of things,
that -- let me show you this.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.730 position:56%
If you have back pain, you've got --
do you see the bony vertebrae there?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.400
That's the tan part.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.180
Those are bones that --
one on top of the other.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.880
And between them, the purple
part, those are disks.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.980
They're like little
cushions between.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.560
So they keep the bones from
bashing into each other.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.140
Well, those cushions, at
the top, that's normal.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.440
But you see, if you look down here,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.470
you see that kind of
thing ballooning out?

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.770
That's that cushion.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.420
It's like the stuffing's coming
out of that cushion and it presses

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.380
on a nerve and that nerve is
running all the way down your leg

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.300
and so you get what
they call sciatica.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.730
My -- my back is killing me.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.030
My legs are killing me.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.860
And it's pressure on that nerve.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:55.200
The Scandinavian researchers
found, if you looked at smokers,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.160
they had a lot more of
these degenerated disks.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.080
Why? Smoke -- cigarettes
aren't heavy.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.270
OK? So it couldn't be that.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.570
What is it?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.300
And they decided here's what it is.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.460
If you look at the arteries
-- this is the aorta.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.900
There's the heart and the aorta
comes off and then it loops down

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.690
and it goes all the way down
and right in front of your spine

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.370 position:56%
and it gives off vertebral
arteries to every vertebral segment.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:26.330
And the very first place where
the arteries are damaged,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.020
right where they -- where
they start to narrow,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.220
is the vertebral arteries
right in the abdominal aorta.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.810
So you could be 18 years old
and your heart's maybe OK,

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.340 position:56%
but you start losing those arteries.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.910
And so the lower back isn't
getting blood supply anymore --

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.650
or not getting very much.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.430
And so then if you have a
trauma on the football field

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.340
or you got rear-ended
in your car or whatever,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.990
the back can't heal anymore.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.450
And those disks become fragile and
they start to herniate and it's

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.590
because of a lack of blood flow.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.760 position:56%
Normally your back should be able to
have a little bit of wear and tear,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.060
but it can't anymore because
of a lack of blood flow.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.480
Is this making sense?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.890
So, researchers now think that
lower back pain is, in many cases,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.000
not just trauma or bad luck,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.330
but in some cases it's a
sign of bad blood flow.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.630
OK. Surprising?

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.070
Um, are there other parts of the
body that need good blood flow?

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:29.130
One of the most popular pills
at the pharmacy is this one.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:36.340
All Viagra does -- the only
thing it does is cause arteries

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.140
to open up a little bit.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.730
And the reason is that the
male sexual anatomy is sort

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.810
of a hydraulic system that
needs good blood flow in order

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.470
to work properly if you
catch what I'm getting at.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.150
And so we see, in our research
center, a lot of people

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.330
with erectile dysfunction.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.060
But when they follow the Ornish
type of diet, plant based diet,

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.090
blood flow opens up again in
the heart and after two or three

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.080
or four months, I cannot
tell you how many men come in

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.050
and say, "My nature is back."

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.750
So. Anyway.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.500
A lot of people are going vegan
because it's this macho diet.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.800
Right? So, anyway.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.100
There you go.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.550
OK. So we talked about getting
away from the animal products.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.310
Animal products are the
only source of cholesterol.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.070
There's no cholesterol in a bean
or a grain of rice or a sprig

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.920
of broccoli or an apple or
-- plant foods don't have it.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.120
But there's a lot of it in
meat, dairy products, eggs,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.700 position:56%
and they also have the bad fat,
saturated fat, that causes your body

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.820
to make more cholesterol.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.020
OK? Which leads us to the
question of, OK, I believe it.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.150
You know. I'm sure if I
were vegan, I'd do great.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.450
I'd be slim.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.750
I'd be healthier.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.210
But, wait a minute.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.590
Can I do this?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.260
Do any of you feel that
sometimes foods might be a little

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.580
bit addictive?

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.480
You know, there's -- even if
we'd like to change our diet,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.780
we think, I don -- I don't know.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.110
I'm not sure I can do it.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.410
What is the most addictive food?

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.830 position:56%
At the University of Michigan, 2015,
researchers asked this question.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.250
What is your most addictive food?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.870
And what they meant was which
foods give you a problem?

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.310
You've already eaten enough,
but you just can't resist.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.290
They had 384 people.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.260
Which foods do you just
find yourself eating more

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.560
than you want to?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.860
You can't cut down.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.160
You lose control.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.460
Well, number five was ice cream.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.690
You know what I'm talking about.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.240
I'm not hungry, but I
just want the taste.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.730
Number four, cookies.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.880
Number three, chips.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.180
Number two, chocolate.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.480
And number one --

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.040
&gt;&gt; Cheese.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.340
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Pizza.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.640
And who said cheese?

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.470
I'm going to say it's
not the olives.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.250
Right? I don't think it's
the sun dried tomatoes.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.060
I don't think it's even the crust.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.000
I think it's that half
inch of yellow asphalt

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.680
over the top of our -- cheese.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.340
Is this making sense?

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.650
Um, we love cheese.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.330
It doesn't love us back, but
people get hooked on this.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:09.060
And I am going to argue
that cheese is fattening,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.990
that it is a little bit addicting,
and causes health problems.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.750
And I'd like to just spend a couple
of minutes on -- on some of this.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.840 position:56%
Um, what causes our weight problems?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.120
Um, a lot of people say it's this.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.420
Right? Sugar.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.020
I'm going to raise a
question mark about that.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.320
I'm going to suggest for a
second that soda is health food,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.380
but if you look at the trend over
time, sweeteners went up until 1999

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.910
at which point people
discovered bottled water.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.510
And that started cutting
into the sweeteners --

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.410
the soda market in a serious way.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.520
And sugar consumption has been
dropping for almost 20 years.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.610
But cheese has been going up.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.910
And where's obesity?

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.870
It's going right along with cheese.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:04.390
OK? So back in 1909 when the USDA
started tracking America's cheese

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.890
consumption, we really did
not eat very much of it.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.770
It was kind of a European thing.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.160
And in Perioria, you know,
we're not going to eat more --

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.710
we couldn't eat more than four
pounds of cheese in a year.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.010
But two things happened.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.860
Fast food chains found that
burgers had to have cheese on top.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.540
And so cheese started
making more and more inroads

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.540
and then pizza chains came in and,
at first, it was a sprinkling.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.840
Then it was a layer.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.140
And then it was a couple layers.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.260
And now, actually I should
update this, in 2017,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.250
the average American consumes
35 pounds of cheese every year.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:45.050
That's 60,000 calories worth
of cheese every single year.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.540
Am I cheering you up?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.900
Um, it's loaded with calories.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.200
And where are the calories?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.110
This will be -- this will be
on the test -- very important.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.360
For -- a gram of sugar
has only four calories.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.300
And that's true not just of
sugar, but any carbohydrate.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.950
So you have friends who
say, "Don't eat potatoes.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.250
They're fattening."

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.730
Right? Any carbohydrate,
whether it's potatoes or bread

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.690
or fruit sugar, has only
four calories in a gram.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.100 position:56%
But a gram of fat has nine calories.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.870
So if a person's trying to lose
weight, skipping the chicken fat,

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.170
and the beef fat, and the cheese
fat causes weight loss much faster

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.330
than trying to not eat bread.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.100
OK? All right.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.320
Um, the leanest beef
is about 29% fat.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.420 position:56%
Chicken is not a lot different, 23%.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.760
Fish are -- they vary,
some lower, some higher.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.260
But then if you look at something
like broccoli or beans or rice

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.940
or sweet potatoes, not only do they
have no cholesterol, they are very,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.150
very low in fat and
that's why people

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.640
who consume these foods
tend to be slim.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.290
They tend to lose weight.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.590
All right.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.890
Cheese, however.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.390
Seventy percent fat.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.520
If it were any worse,
it would be Vaseline.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.490
Very, very high in fat.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.700
And there is Coke Zero, but
there is no Cheddar Zero.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.480
So there is really no
super dietetic cheese.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.550
Um, sodium content is
an interesting thing.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.010
People are concerned about
sodium for a couple reasons.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.440
What -- what does sodium
do in the body?

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.810
OK. So your blood pressure
will go up.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.110
It also cause you to lose
a little bit of calcium.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.640
But if you have a lot of salt in
your diet, you'll keep water weight

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.870
and you'll feel bloated
and boggy and crummy.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.890
So an orange has about
a milligram of sodium.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:37.170
An apple has two and a brown rice
has 20 and a potato has about 13.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:45.510
Potato chips, 330, two ounces
of cheddar, 350, Edam, 500,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.240
and Velveeta, 800 milligrams
of sodium!

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.200
They add it.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.750
They add it in the -- in the
dairy because they add more sodium

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.710
and that stops the bacterial
action from over fermenting cheese.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.560
So it's a very, very,
very high sodium food.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.510
And so why is it fattening?

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.600
It's high in calories.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.700
The food fat adds to body
fat -- I didn't mention this.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.890
Um, if you eat carbohydrate, like
bread, in theory you could make fat

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.750
out of it, but it's really
hard for your body to do.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.700 position:56%
If you eat bread, your body takes
the bread and pulls the carbohydrate

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.410
out and breaks that into sugar
molecules that go into the blood

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.240 position:56%
and those sugar molecules power your
brain and they power your muscles.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.850
They don't go to fat.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.010 position:56%
But you eat two slices and three
slices, you eat half the loaf, well,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.570
eventually your body will say,
"I don't need this much sugar,"

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.180
and it will store it in your liver
as something called glycogen.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.480
Have you heard of this?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.720 position:56%
People who run marathons, they eat
lots of carbs leading up to the race

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.880
because they want to have glycogen
in their liver and their muscles.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.550
It's like spare batteries.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.850
It's not fat.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.150
It's energy.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.450
And you say, "OK.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.750
I'm going to eat two
loaves of bread.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.050
Can I eventually get
fat out of this?"

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.350
Yes, you can.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.190
If you eat way more than your
body can store, you'll make fat

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.160
out of it, but even doing,
to turn a bread molecule

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.850
into a fat molecule burns up about
a quarter of all of its calories.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.690
So it's very hard to gain weight

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:18.270
on a high carbohydrate diet unless
you add the cheese and the meat

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.700 position:56%
to it because your body can take the
fat out of those and put it straight

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.370
into your body fat with
almost no conversion.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.700
All right.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.040
So fat slows down your metabolism.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.680
It doesn't have any fiber at all.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.720
Cheese has no fiber to control
your appetite and it's got a lot

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.780
of sodium, which adds water weight.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.730
OK. Um, researchers have
studied seventh-day Adventists

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.630
for a long period of time.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.490
And when I got involved in
research I couldn't figure

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.310
out why are you studying
seventh-day Adventists?

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.670
And the reason, as
some of you may know,

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.130
is that it's a very health
conscious population.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.210
And by their church principles
you're supposed to avoid tobacco

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.200
and avoid alcohol and avoid
caffeine and avoid meat.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.830
And almost all Adventists are very
good at the first three of those.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.810
Um, so you got a huge number
of people who are non-smoking,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.490
health conscious teetotalers,

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.490
but some of them eat meat
and some of them don't.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.090
Perfect natural experiment.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.960
So, uh, in 2009 the American
Diabetes Association published

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.260
these data.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.970
They looked at -- at
body mass index.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.520
Is that a familiar term?

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.070
Body mass index is your --

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.890
your weight, but it's
adjusted for how tall you are.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.970
And they had almost 61,000
people and they split them

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.590
into five groups depending on
the diets that they followed.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.630
And the first group
was non-vegetarians,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.940
normal, typical American diet.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.390
And their body mass index was not
below 25 as we would like it to be.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.380
It was in the overweight
range, 28.8.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.350
And the next group
was semi-vegetarian.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:52.010
These were people who ate meat,
but less than once a week.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.330
A little slimmer.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.150
And then pesco-vegetarian,
what's that mean?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.760
OK. So no meat except for fish.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.620
And they're a little
slimmer, but -- um --

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.630
but not as slim as the
lacto-ovo-vegetarians.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.670
Lacto meaning dairy products,
milk products, ovo for eggs.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.300
OK. And then vegans, not
people from the planet Vegas.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.430
Um, the vegans were the -- they
don't eat any animal products

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.440
and they were the only group
that was smack in the middle

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.980
of the healthy body mass
index range, just on average.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.570
But then if you compare these last
two groups, I'm going to argue

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.480 position:56%
that the difference between a person
following a lacto-ovo-vegetarian

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.680
diet and a vegan diet is mostly
dairy, especially cheese.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.770
And if you do the math, that's,
what, a 15 little bit difference

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.600
from the cheese that these people
are eating just on average.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.840
So it's really true.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.660
When your diet is loaded with
vegetables and fruits and beans

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.400
and whole grains and you set
the animal products aside,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.540
people have a really easy time
maintaining a healthy body weight.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.380
OK? But I'm hooked on this.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.680
I'm really hooked on this.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.980
What's this about?

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.280
So, why do we get hooked?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.580 position:56%
The first thing is the salt content.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.880
We -- we love salty foods.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.080
People love potato chips
and French fries and things.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.290
The other thing, though,
is it's fatty.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.170
There's something about a
fatty, salty food, onion rings,

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:21.050
French fries, potato chips, that
combination tends to get us hooked.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.190
But there is a third thing.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.780
Anybody heard of casomorphins?

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:33.230
The dairy protein is called casin,
C-A-S-I-N, and casin protein,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.190
like all proteins,
if you looked at it

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.730
under a powerful microscope,
it's a string of beads.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.120
Each bead is an amino acid and
your body breaks those beads apart.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.690
It goes into your blood and
your body uses these protein

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.290
building blocks.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.400
Except casin is different
from other proteins.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.040 position:56%
That -- the milk protein casin, when
you ingest it, your body pulls some

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.100
of the amino acids out
and uses them for protein.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.780
But other little collections
of amino acids come out as --

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.920
as little chains of
molecules called casomorphins.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.330
Casin derived morphine-like
compounds that go to the brain

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:15.370
and attach to the very same
brain receptors that morphine

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.870
or heroin what attach to.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.060
And when researchers discover
this, the question was,

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.860
"What the heck are
they doing there?"

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.970 position:56%
And they've looked at many different
species of milk that -- a nursing --

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:34.510
a cow giving milk to her baby or
a goat or a horse or any mammal,

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.130
that milk contains protein, it
contains sugar, locates sugar,

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.610
it contains fat, it contains
a fair amount of hormones,

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.880 position:56%
but it also has these little opiates
in it that we believe may be part

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.830
of the biological substrate
of the mother-infant bond.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.920
Look -- look at a nursing baby.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.020
They have this look of
tremendous intensity.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.610
And then they collapse into sleep.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.200
And you think, "Isn't
that beautiful."

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.160
You know, the mother-infant
bond is so wonderful.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.960
I hate to say it, you --
you drug the kid basically.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.970
Um, we now believe
there are opiates in --

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.650
well, we know there are
opiates in cow's milk.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.720
We know they attach to
the -- to the brain.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.380
So when I take milk, which has
a little bit of opiate in it,

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.900
and I turn it into cheese,
everything is concentrated.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.450 position:56%
It's the most concentrated source
of casomorphins you can get and some

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:24.530
of us call it dairy crack,
um -- be that as it may,

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.510
we believe this is why people
tend to get hooked on cheese

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.240
and especially on piazza.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.890
Now, many people, when
they're gaining weight

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.130
and having trouble
will say, "All right.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.720
I'm with you.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.020
I'm going to go online.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.220
I'm going to get the Atkins diet
and that's what I'm going to do."

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.420
And let me caution you about that.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:46.680 position:56%
Um, these books have been very, very
popular because they say the reason

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.620
that we're heavy is because
we're eating too much rice

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.990
and too much bread
and too many potatoes

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.290
and too many carbs in general.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.790
And if you stop eating all those
things, you'll lose weight.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.080
And that's true because carbs
are half of what we eat.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.450
And if you throw out all the
potatoes and all the bread

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.980
and all the rice and all the
cookies and all the cakes

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.560
and all the fruit,
you will lose weight.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.310
Unless you eat more of other things

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.310
so that your calorie
intake doesn't fall,

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.350
in which case you don't
lose any weight at all.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.020
There's a whole lot of
frustrated dieters out there.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.150
So, I'm going to suggest
that bread is not the issue.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.280
Um, so a big problem with
this kind of dieting is

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.150
that these are the
foods that are left

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:29.460
when you're leaving out,
uh, the healthy foods.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.690 position:56%
And so if you tuck into these
things and your calorie content ends

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.190
up going up, you aren't going
to lose any weight whatsoever.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.770 position:56%
But even when people do lose weight,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.850
they very often end
up with heart disease.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:44.400
And this, uh, was sent to me by
a young man named Jody Gerand

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.520
who said that, "I want to tell
people what happened to me."

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.030
He happened to be in the hospital
and he had a scan of his heart

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.370
for -- that he didn't really need.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.090
He didn't have heart disease,
but they did this scan as part

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.930
of a special physical exam
that he -- that he had.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.210
And I'm not going to ask you
to read this, but bottom line,

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.980
he had no heart disease whatsoever.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.280
He was fine.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.960
And he was just a little
bit overweight,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.750
less than 10 pounds overweight.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:14.020 position:56%
But low-carb dieting was such a fad,
he thought, "Let me do it that way."

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.080
So he threw out all the bread
and he followed it very --

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.920
you know, very religiously.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.040 position:56%
He was eating gravy and heavy cream,
but no bread, no rice, no potatoes.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.760
And one day he was
walking in New York

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.910
and an elephant sat on his chest.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.210
He had crushing chest pain.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.700
He went into the emergency room
and he was having a heart attack.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.950
And they did an angiogram and,
see, there's a little place

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.440
where it's all white where it
should be a -- a good artery.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.910
He had a 97% blockage in his heart.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.910
And his doctor said, "What
have you been doing?"

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.500
And he told them what
he had been doing.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.300
And his diet was so high in
cholesterol and animal fat,

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.530
it's just a recipe
for heart disease.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.080 position:56%
Now, normally, when you lose
weight, your cholesterol should fall

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.930
and that often does happen.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.940
But on about 1/3 Atkins dieters,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.240
even though they may
be losing weight

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.230
because they're eating fewer
calories, their cholesterols go

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.260
up sometimes just absolutely
through the roof.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.720
So he said, "Forget that,"
went on a plant based diet,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.680
has had no trouble
keeping a healthy weight,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.340
and his arteries opened up again.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:24.590
In Australia researchers found
something that shocked all of us

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.740
who felt maybe we can
change our diet in mid-life

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.400
and we're going to be OK.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:36.800
Um, they measured the thickness of
the artery wall, which you can do

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.170
in an adult and you
can do it in a baby.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.740 position:56%
And if you look at, say, the carotid
artery, which goes up to your brain,

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.420
and you do a simple
non-invasive test,

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.810
you can see how thick
the artery wall is.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:56.250
And they brought and 23 women
and their brand new babies.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.340
Within the first week of
life, it turned out that

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.930
if the mother was eating extra
food and she was overweight,

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:07.900
her baby was already getting
arterial thickening in the womb

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.230
that you can measure at birth.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.240
And then if those same foods are
then part of the family's culture,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.360
by the time that child is
18, he or she will have lost

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.140
at least vertebral artery.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.970
And by the time the
child is in mid-life,

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.420
virtually all of them will have
standard atherosclerotic heart

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.560
disease, which we had thought
was just part of human biology.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.990
And we now know that it's related
to food, smoking, and other aspects

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.050
of lifestyle that we can control.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.510
So let me shift gears
just a little bit.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.490
One of the big contributors
to heart risk is diabetes.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.990
And if you don't mind I'd
like to spend just a couple

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.220
of minutes on -- on diabetes.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.320
Uh, because it's a
major contributor,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.030
not just to heart disease,
but many other issues.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.700
In 2003 the National Institutes

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.300 position:56%
of Health gave our research team a
grant to test a plant based diet not

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.830 position:56%
for heart disease, but for diabetes.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.750
And the idea was to do
a head-to-head test,

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.880
a vegan diet versus what
we called an ADA diet,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.240
American Diabetes Association
diet that meant counting calories

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.390
and limiting carbohydrate
and that kind of thing.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.930
Twenty-two week study.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.510
And the test that we use

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:20.570
for measuring blood sugar
control is called A1C.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.440
If you have diabetes, you
know what I'm talking about.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.610
Hemoglobin A1C is a measure

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.440
of how good your blood
sugar control has been

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.110
for the preceding three
months or so.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.230
And it should be below seven.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.680
At least that's our target.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.310
But, at the start of the study,
our people were not below seven.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.940 position:56%
They were all hovering around eight.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.060
And the people on the ADA
diet, that's the red line,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.940
they had an OK drop
of about 0.4 points.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.240
That's good.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.410
But the blue line was
the vegan group.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:52.660
They had a drop in
absolute percentage terms

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.350
of 1.2 absolute percentage
points, which was bigger

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:01.290
than any oral diabetes medication
marketed just on average.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.590
And it was huge.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.250
And then we followed them
over a year and the people

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.540
in the control group ended up
getting back to where they started.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.970
And the people in the vegan group,

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.040
some of them didn't follow
it perfectly, but on average,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.760
they were still way better
than at the beginning.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.850
And we had some people where
their diabetes simply went away.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.960
And then we just looked
at their body weight.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.670 position:56%
And we found there wasn't a
dramatic difference between the two.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.350
The red line is the ADA
folks and they lost weight.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.650
And so did the vegans.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.300
The vegans lost a little
bit more weight.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.000
But the -- the important
thing here is

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.840
that the vegan group wasn't
trying to lose weight.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.630
They were free to eat as much
spaghetti as they wanted to.

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.180
There was no calorie
limit whatsoever,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.800
but the red line was the people
on the ADA diet where they sit

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.030
down with a dietitian
who says, "All right.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.940
You're eating 1,800
calories a day now.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.280
Here's your menu.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.360
It adds up to 1,300."

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.430
"Aren't I going to be hungry?"

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.350
Yes. But it's calories
in, calories out.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.070
You got to cut your calories
if you're going to lose weight.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:58.720
"How long do I have
to stay on this?"

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.690
"Until you reach your ideal
body weight, which is never."

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.300
And the patient leaves
with this menu

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.560
and this gets old by
about Wednesday.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.460
And you're ready to eat the sofa.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.990
And then you start berating the
patient, "You're not compliant!

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.290
You're noncompliant!"

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.600
Who is going to be compliant

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.100
with being hungry every
single day of their life?

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.400
And instead, with the people
on the plant based diet,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.060
they were free to eat chili.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.330
It was just not meat
chili, it was bean chili.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.120
There's so much fiber
in it, it's filling.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.240
And you push away from
the table a little sooner

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.750
so your calorie intake,
it actually does fall.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.620
But you're totally unaware of it.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.710 position:56%
Totally satisfied and the weight
loss is greater on that kind of diet

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.830
that doesn't cause hunger at all
than on a person who's trying

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:47.270
to muscle through it and use
discipline and wheel power.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.030
When we want to help our
patients comply with it,

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.870
we don't use wheel power at all.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.330
You just set up a structure
that they can't fail.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.250
And they don't have to worry.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.300
Is this making sense?

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.040
OK. All right.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.200
Oh, and LDL, low density
lipoprotein, drops like a stone.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.500
You're not eating any
animal fat at all.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.800
It always falls.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.450
OK. This is my most important
slide for anybody with diabetes.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.480
I want -- I want to just
walk you through this

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.410
because I guarantee your
friends don't know about this

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:14.060
and your doctor does
not know about this.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.100
Diabetes means there's too
much sugar in the blood.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.950
That sugar is glucose.

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:20.250
And glucose is not bad.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:21.550
Glucose is good.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.850
Glucose powers your brain.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.020
It powers your muscles.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.050
The problem in diabetes is that
you've got glucose in your blood,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.520
not inside the cells
where it can do some good.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.930
It's building up in the
blood and you can test --

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.510
your blood tests show it.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.160 position:56%
You think, "If it would only go into
my cells, I wouldn't have diabetes."

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.430
And that's true.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:43.000
Researchers at Yale
University used a special kind

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.070
of test called MR spectroscopy
where they scanned people's muscles

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.010
and their livers and
they found something

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.780
that completely revolutionized
our approach to diabetes.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.210
This is a muscle cell.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.130
OK? And muscles are
where most of the glucose

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.480
in the blood is trying to go.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.150
And so you've got glucose.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.450
It's there.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.850
Those little dots trying
to get into the cell.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:07.340
You've got insulin --
insulin's a hormone.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.810
It's like a key.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.720
It opens that cell up.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.800
OK? So the glucose
needs to get inside,

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.520
but you need the insulin to do it.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.850
So the insulin signals
these channels to open up.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.150
And there's the glucose.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.260
It's not going in now because
insulin let it in the cell.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.570
But there's something
else in that cell.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.160
See those yellow globs?

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.810
That's fat.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:32.140
Fat droplets inside the cell.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.360
And they build up based
on what I've been eating.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.520
Doctors hate words like, "Fat."

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.440
It's got one syllable,
three letters.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.290
So we refer to it as
intramyocellular lipid, but it's --

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.720
it's fat inside -- intra- means
inside, myo- means muscle,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.050
cellular means cellular,
lipid means fat.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.410
If you eat -- this comes
from food that you're eating.

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.140
So you eat chicken fat and it
goes inside the muscle cells

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.860
with very little conversion
to anything else.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.560
You eat cheese fat or
dairy fat or fryer grease

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.620 position:56%
or whatever, it's inside the muscle.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.970
And as it goes in there, it
stops insulin from working.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.870
The reason a person
develops diabetes is not

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.450
because they were eating
rice or eating potatoes.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.210
It's because fat built
up inside the cell

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.860
and it makes your insulin
no longer work.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.690
And if the insulin doesn't
work, the glucose builds

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.010 position:56%
up in the blood and you can test it.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:31.540
And your doctor says, "You've got
too much glucose in your blood.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.860
You need to start medication."

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.600
Well, diabetes is not
a metformin deficiency.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.480
All these drugs do is they try
to stimulate more insulin release

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.250
or make the cell react more.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.000
And until the Yale researchers
scanned patients with diabetes

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.720 position:56%
and found fat inside their cells,
we weren't able to tackle the cause.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.460 position:56%
So why did our research participants

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.320
who had diabetes do
better on a vegan diet?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.110
Because there's no animal
fat in the diet at all.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:03.160
And if you keep the
vegetable oils low,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.930
do you know what happens
inside that cell?

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.530
The fat starts dissipating.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:07.860
The insulin starts working again.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.720
And you've got a shot of
getting rid of your diabetes

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.680
or having it improve dramatically
and needing less medication,

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.460
sometimes none at all, because
you're tackling the cause.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.230
OK? So if you know anybody who's
got diabetes and they're saying,

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:22.950
"I'm not going to eat any
bread," take out a napkin

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.610
and start drawing my cell and
showing the fat globs inside

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.470
and that is your target, a low
fat vegan diet will cause diabetes

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.810
to start turning around.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.110
Weight comes down.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.410
Cholesterol comes down.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:35.710
Blood sugars come down.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.010
In some cases they are never
going to know they had it.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.940
We, uh, did a study
recently with people

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.490
who have late stage
diabetes where, as you know,

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:44.790
diabetes attacks the eyes.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.960
It attacks the kidneys.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.220
It attacks your feet.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.250
So that your nerves
aren't working well.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.020
You get numb or sometimes
you get pain.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.320
And the -- the nerves
of the hand, same story.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.450
One of our participants
was a jazz bass player

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:04.170
and he had neuropathy in his hands.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:07.350
And after about one or two
songs, he -- he had to stop.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.370
He would turn his back to the
audience and just shake his hands

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.430
out to try to get his
nerves working again

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.840
and then he could play
another song or two.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.410
Then he'd have to stop.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:19.920
He came in to our, uh, research
center, went on a plant based diet

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.630
and a plant based diet,
keeping oils low too,

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.080
what does that do to the cell?

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.630
It causes that fat to come out,
the insulin starts working again,

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.090
it brings his blood sugar down,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:33.050
suddenly the nerves
aren't being attacked

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:36.350
by that persistent high blood
sugar and narrowed arteries.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.720
And after about two or three
months he said, "I can play again."

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:41.710
And he could play through a
whole set without any problem.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.180
Two months after that
he came in and said,

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.070
"My erectile dysfunction is gone!"

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.550
So, high fives all the
way around the room.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.850
Anyway. It's really true.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.660
You know, that does not happen
by just filling a prescription.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.960
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.260
Don't fire your doctor.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.580
And there are times when
medicines are really important

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.010
and sometimes lifesaving.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.600 position:56%
But if you are not tackling the
cause and the cause relates to diet,

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.670
we just go one arm
tied behind our back.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.670
OK. So plant based diets, they
improve cholesterol levels.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:08.970
They improve body weight.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.270
They improve blood pressure.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.970
They improve diabetes.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:18.210
And so this is the graphic
that we developed back in 2009

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.520 position:56%
to summarize what a healthy diet is.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.840
So it's fruits.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.140
It's grains.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.440
It's vegetables.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.740
It's legumes.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.720
And, by the way, we brought
this to the USDA, um, and said,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.020
"Why don't you scrap the pyramid?"

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.200
Because in 2009 there
was the pyramid.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.660
And the pyramid wasn't
terrible, but it had a meat group

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.290
and a dairy group and the
people who don't eat those

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.950
at all are healthier
than the people who do.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.840
So, we said, "Get rid of them."

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.320
And, by the way, people
eat off a plate.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.690
Give them a plate.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.520
And we didn't hear back from them.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.250
Um, so in 2011 we actually
filed suit against the USDA.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.690
Um, just to compel response.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:59.100 position:56%
And I don't know if you saw what the
USDA came out within 20- -- 2011.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.690
Um, I'm not taking
any credit for this,

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.680
but it does look remarkably
similar to what --

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.820
this is now called my
-- this is My Plate.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.790
And it's fruits, it's
grains, it's vegetables.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.490
They call it the protein
group, which could be meat,

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.810 position:56%
but it could also be beans or tofu
or nuts or other high protein foods.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.120
Doesn't have to be meat.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.250
And there's the dairy
group, but to their credit,

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.900
they said soy milk counts.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.410
Veganite is good.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.140
So this is now -- that's My Plate.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.680
This is now US Government policy.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.810
So it's not perfect, but
it's definitely going in --

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.560
very much in the right direction.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.270
Um, OK. Let me skip this.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.570
I already showed you that.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.690
So by now you might be saying, "OK.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.990
Great. Sure.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.290
I -- I love it.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.340 position:56%
This -- this is really going to work
great, but if I do this vegan diet,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.070 position:56%
I'm going to have to live in the
garage because my family isn't going

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.540
to want me around and nobody's
going to invite me out to dinner

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.840
and this will be impossible
and what am I going to do?"

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.020
So we break this diet
change into two steps.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.550
I want to share it with you
and encourage you to try this.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:00.730
I have never seen anyone
unable to do it.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.030
Very, very easy.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.090
The first step is don't
change your diet.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.270
For the first seven
days all we're going

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.300
to do is check out
the possibilities.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.300
So whatever you're eating, try
out things that happen to be vegan

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.600
and see if you like them.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.940
So I take a sheet of paper and I
write, "Breakfast, lunch, dinner,

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.540
snack," on the paper and, for
the next week, you just write

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:24.640
down things that work
and test them out.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.940
So, I haven't had oatmeal
since I was a kid.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.030
Maybe with some cinnamon
and some strawberries

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.230
and blueberries maybe
it would taste OK.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.010
Um, blueberry pancakes?

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.830
I guess I could do that
without the butter.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.130
That's not so hard.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.270
Um, I haven't tasted almond milk.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.200
Hey, have we tasted almond milk?

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.500
Is it good?

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.800
All right.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.100
OK. Fair enough.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.400
So you know that.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.700
You might try oat milk or
hemp milk or something else.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.000
Just try these different things.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.300
Same thing for lunch.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.600
I never had a pizza without cheese.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.900
How is it?

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.200
I don't know.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.500
Let's see.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.800
Um, so all we're doing for week one
is checking out the possibilities.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.010
We go to an Italian restaurant
and the chef is more than happy

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.930
to serve you angel hair pasta
with a spicy tomato sauce

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.130
and wild mushrooms and
artichoke hearts and so forth

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.530
and pasta fazol and,
um, healthy things.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:13.180
Mexican restaurant, beans and rice,
bean burritos, veggie fajitas, ah,

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.430
Chinese, they got dozens of
things, vegetable dishes,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.370
rice dishes, tofu dishes.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.020
Ah, extra points for Japanese
because it's often delicate and low

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:27.160
in fat so the veggie sushi or the
salads and so forth are great.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:32.940
Um, and if you're at Subway, can
I get a vegan sandwich at Subway?

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:36.860
Sure. Ah, they put on the lettuce
and tomatoes and onions and olives

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.480
and pickles and so forth and
spinach and little red wine vinegar

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.430
and they'll toast it for you
and call it veggie delight.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:47.730 position:56%
And Taco Bell is not the pinnacle of
culinary art, but they will be more

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.190
than happy to give
you a bean burrito,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.490
hold the cheese, and all right.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.790
So, fair enough.

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.090
So, for the first week, I'm just
checking out the possibilities.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:59.670
And then after that do three
weeks all vegan all the time,

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:04.460
but only 21 days because
you're just testing this diet

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.030
out to see what you think.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.110
At the end of 21 days two
things will have happened.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.750
First is you are physically
changing and you will feel it.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.670
You'll have lost weight
without trying.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.270
If you have diabetes,

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.700
you'll discover your glucose
numbers are improving.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.000
Your energy is better.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.060
Your digestion sorts itself out
usually within about 24, 48 hours.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.800
You just feel dramatically
different.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.100
Your energy is better.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.230
Um, anybody watch the Super Bowl,
Tom Brady, as you probably know,

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.860
he threw out the cheese
a long time ago.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.780
Aaron Rodgers at Green
Bay, same story.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:37.150
They're doing this not because they
want to have a healthier figure.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.410
They're doing this for energy
and to stop inflammation.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.160
Um, but you -- you
will feel this even

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.210
if you're not a pro
football quarterback.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.360 position:56%
You discover all those -- my joints.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.660
I'm better.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.960
I feel better.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.890
So that happens in about 21 days.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.320
Um, the second thing that happens,
though, is your tastes change

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.870
and you didn't expect this.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.170
But let me ask this group.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:00.970
How many of you ever switched
from whole milk to skim milk?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.570
Let me see hands.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.580
OK. When you did, what was the
skim milk like at the beginning?

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.930
Watery? Doesn't even look right.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.390
It's got a blue color.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.980
How many of you adapted
to it and got used to it?

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.720
OK. Did you ever go back
and taste whole milk again?

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.110
What was that like?

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:20.410
It's like cream.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.710
It's -- it's thick.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.010
Well, wait a minute.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.310
Your whole life it was fine.

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.660
But when you get a short
break of even a few weeks,

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.110
your taste buds physically adjust.

00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:30.630
They no longer want the fatty
taste, but you will never have

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.740
that experience if you have a
vegan meal on Monday and then one

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.850
on Thursday because in
between you're reawakening

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.170
that fatty desire in
your taste buds.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.780 position:56%
If, just for a short period like
three weeks, you say, "I'm not going

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.360
to have it," it's like a
smoker not having cigarettes.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.310
You forget -- you finally
forget about it,

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:48.480
but you crave today
what you had yesterday.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.670 position:56%
And you give yourself a 21 day break

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.260
and it gives you power
you didn't have before.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.040
So that's why we say just do it
for three -- for three weeks.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.520
There are transitional
foods like veggie bacon,

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.920
veggie sausage, if you want.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.930
It's kind of like a
meat eater's methadone.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.400
Um, you can have it if you want.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.700
You don't have to have
it, but it's there.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.750
Um, we have a program for you.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.700
I want to walk you through
a couple of resources

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.000
and I'll finish with this.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.500
At the physicians committee
we started

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.400
with something called the 21-Day
Vegan Kickstart and we start it

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.570
at the beginning of every
month as in March 1st.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.360
And if you sign up,
it's totally free.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.160
What you get is e-mails
from celebrities

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.650
and doctors and athletes.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.820
We have a free app.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.870
And every day it's menus, recipes,
cooking videos, all kinds of stuff,

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.570
and it's in English,
Spanish, Mandarin.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:39.720
We have one for people from the
Indian sub-continent with, um,

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.770
English language, but
Indian ingredients.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.290
We have a Japanese program as well.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.880
All free. We've had more than
a half a million people go

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.230
through this so please do it.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.160 position:56%
Um, and for people with heart
disease let me recommend Dean Ornish

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.120
has a book and Caldwell
Esselstyne, you've probably --

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.330
when Bill Clinton was talking
a lot about heart disease,

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.550
these were the guys that
were always on the news

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:01.850
because they're the pioneers.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.960
And John McDougall
also has been terrific.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.170
Um, my own books, I've
got a number of them

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:08.900
and the Cheese Trap is
coming out next week.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.890
Please do let your cheese
addicted friends know about that.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:17.770
Um, and for any, uh, nurses,
doctors, health care people

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.370
in the audience, please
join us in July.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.940
GW and the Physician's
Committee are teaming up now

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.220 position:56%
for the 5th international
conference on nutrition and medicine

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.270
over right here at the Hyatt, uh --

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.950
Grand Hyatt, you know,
the White House.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:33.970
And it's two days of everything
you need to know about nutrition

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:35.790
and applying it in medicine.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:41.880
Um, finally, we felt that when
people come in with diabetes

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.900
or high blood pressure and
only medications are used

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.370
that we're not really
tracking the cause.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:52.010
So a year ago we opened the Barnard
Medical Center to use medications

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:55.430
when we need to, but to go
to the cause for everybody

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.440
and that means a nutritional
approach is offered

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.910
to every -- every patient.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.480
If you have trouble,
we don't fire you.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.500
Uh, we love all our patients,
but we help everybody --

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.010
we have three dieticians on staff

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.980
and classes all day every
day that's all free.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.280
And so come see us.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.960
We're up right on Wisconsin Avenue.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.890
We take all insurances
and it's a non-profit, um,

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.350
but it's a cool place to go.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.590
And even if you don't want
to be a clinic patient,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.950 position:56%
we have classes for the public free.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.250
We'd love to have you come.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:29.710
OK? Um, the last thing
that I just want to say is

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:36.830
when people make changes, the
most important issue I think isn't

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.830
necessarily our own health.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.640
I think it's the next generation.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.090
When you look at kids, they're
eating foods that our parents

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.260
and grandparents never heard of.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.680
And there are seductions on the
way home from school, on TV --

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.360
half the commercials on TV
are now for snack foods.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.200 position:56%
The other half are medications to
undo the effects of the snack foods.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.850
And that's the world that
our kids now think is normal!

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.410
When I'm older, I'm going to
be on medications and I'm going

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.030
to eat these foods and now kids are
overweight before they get their

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.330
high school diploma.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:09.990
They've got the beginnings
of heart disease.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:15.680
One in three now has
pre-diabetes or diabetes.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.360
We've got to change that.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.390
Whether you're concerned about
the money for health care

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.740
or what really counts, which
is our families going to be OK.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.390
Are they going to be
able to stay together?

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.330 position:56%
That's why we need to do two things.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.540
We need to experiment with
healthy foods and then we need

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.840
to make some noise about it.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.630
But I'm not a finger
wagger type person.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.090
It's not -- this is not
a question of guilt.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.420
It's a question of having
fun and trying some things.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.900
So you experiment with foods.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.200
You find the ones you like.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.760
If you find recipes or products
or books or DVDs that you like,

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.400
share them around and you're
going to have some duds

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.280
when you experiment with
a new lasagna or whatever.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.580
That's OK.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.060
That's what experimenting
is all about.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.360
But find the foods you like.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.660
Share them around.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.960
Make some noise.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.260
And I'm convinced we can change
the health of this country.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.060
Thanks very much.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.720
[ Applause ]

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.400
Thanks. Um, can I -- is it OK

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.820
if I take questions for
a couple of minutes?

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.120
We all right?

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.420
OK. Please?

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.720
&gt;&gt; I heard you say [inaudible].

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:18.220
And I wanted to [inaudible]
how stress also works against.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.520
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: OK.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.820
&gt;&gt; And [inaudible] diet [inaudible]

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:25.890
at the beginning causes
heart problems [inaudible].

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.190
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Yes.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:30.450
&gt;&gt; And could you say
something about that?

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:33.750
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Sure.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.050
Um, the question was
what about stress?

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.350
What role does it play?

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.970
Um, I think it plays
a couple of roles.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.410
One is that when a person is under
either acute or chronic stress,

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:46.160
the body releases hormones, stress
hormones, cortisol and others.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.460
And that these do have a
variety of health effects.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.760
That's number one.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.430
Number two, when you're
stressed -- is this not true?

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:56.810
We will eat anything just
to get through that period.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:01.620 position:56%
Um, so April 12th, 13th, 14th is not
a time when an accountant is going

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.190
to follow an especially great diet.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.800
When we're stressed,
we let other things go.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.140
So stress is -- is an issue and
you should all win the lottery

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.160
and quit your jobs and have
a stress-free existence.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:19.290
Um, contrary to that, though,
in World War II pathologists

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:24.250
who were looking at people who died
of old age, um, were also soldiers

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.260
on the battlefield, what they
found was that those who were

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.010 position:56%
under deprivation, say, like in
Belgium, places where Nazis came in,

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:38.900
took over, took the meat, took the
cheese, left the local population

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.570
with potatoes and vegetables,
their arteries started to clear

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:48.800
up even though they were,
arguably, under tremendous stress.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.730
So I think it is good to contain
stress, but even if you have a lot

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.360
of stress in your life,
when people are

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.820
on a healthful diet,
they seem to do well.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.470
There was a question over here.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:01.310
Yes? What about oil?

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:05.720
Yeah. Was there a particular
issue about oil or question?

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.830
&gt;&gt; Um, [inaudible].

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.130
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: OK.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.670
Um, oil is, um -- is high in
calories as any other fat.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.720
So if a person is trying to
lose weight, we not only want

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.710
to avoid the animal fat, it's good
to keep the vegetable oils low too.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.280
So even extra virgin -- even extra
extra virgin olive oil still has

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.200
nine calories per gram.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.630
You remember that number?

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.320
Um, so for weight loss it's
good to keep fatty foods low

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.970
and that includes things like
peanut butter and even guacamole,

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:34.280
which has a lot of fat in it.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.870
Um, vegetable oils are
different from animal fat

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.110
in that they don't have
a lot of saturated fat

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.550
that raises your blood cholesterol.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:44.230
And our friends in
Spain and in Italy argue

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:46.900
for what they will call
the Mediterranean diet,

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.140
which is not a butter type diet.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.280
It's more an olive oil type diet.

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.660
And they will point
to heart benefits

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.960
from the Mediterranean diet.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.710
Now Mediterranean diet
isn't just oil.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.010
It's also less meat,
more vegetables.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.380
Uh, some people will argue that
red wine is a key ingredient.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.300
Um, all these things may work
together to create health effects.

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.010
So oil is better than animal
fat, but for weight loss,

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.970
that's one reason to
keep it kind of low.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.500
Yes, please?

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.740
&gt;&gt; Are you concerned about soy?

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.040
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Um,
in -- about soy.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.040
Is there a particular issue
about soy that you -- ?

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.950
&gt;&gt; Just sometimes you'll
see articles that say

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:24.970
that there are [inaudible]
medical, um, problems with soy.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:26.270
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: OK.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.520
I'm really glad that you
asked that because, um,

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.120
the argument goes like this.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.820
Soy has estrogens in it that will
cause boys to become effeminate

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:37.480
and cause girls to
have a higher risk

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.210
of breast cancer is
what they'll say.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.370 position:56%
Um, the -- here's the truth of this.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.870 position:56%
Back in 1921 some compounds were
identified in soy called isoflavones

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:48.830
and they look vaguely
like sex hormones.

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:50.530
They are not sex hormones.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:52.370
But they look vaguely like it.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:57.070
And if you, however, look at
men who consume a lot of soy, A,

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:01.530
they are not effeminate, B, there
is no reduction in fertility

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:06.010
as you can quickly see when you go
to any country like China or Japan

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.940 position:56%
where soy is a big part of the diet.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.760
Fertility has not been impaired.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.250
Um, but most importantly when
it comes to breast cancer,

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:21.460
there have now been I believe at
least 35 or 40 studies on women

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.840
who consume a lot of soy.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.800
Their breast cancer risk
is cut by about 30% to 40%.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.870
In other words, soy somehow
has the opposite effect.

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.790
And I don't know why and I'm not
even necessarily pushing soy.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:34.090
Um, it's very convenient.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:37.050
You know, you're better off with
soy sausage than pork sausage.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.950
Uh, you don't need it, but
women who consume a fair amount

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.410
of soy have much less risk
of developing breast cancer.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.740
And women who have had
breast cancer in the past,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.210 position:56%
if they consume more soy, their risk
of reoccurrence is about 30% less.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:54.000
And that's important because
a lot of them are told

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.750
by their well-meaning,
but ill-informed doctor --

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:00.250
I read somewhere you shouldn't have
soy if you've had breast cancer

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.870
and the women who avoid soy have
the highest reoccurrence rate.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.320
So, I'm not pushing soy,
but it -- it does --

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.100
it seems to have these
health benefits.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.710
Time for maybe one last question?

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.010
Yeah?

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.510
&gt;&gt; What about supplements
like Vitamin D?

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.810
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Ah,
excellent question.

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.110
What about supplements?

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.410
I only -- there's really only two

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:18.710
that I think people
should really think about.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.150
Number one is Vitamin B12.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:22.910
You need it for healthy
nerves and healthy blood

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.320
and I believe everyone
should take a B12 supplement.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.870
Second, Vitamin D normally
comes from the sun

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:33.100
and when we had the good sense
to stay in equatorial Africa,

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.540
we got lots and lots of Vitamin D.
But some of us had the bad judgment

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.020
to move to places like North Dakota
where I grew up, or New Jersey

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.360 position:56%
or Washington, D.C. and even if
there's a lot of sun, we're indoors.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:45.590
So a Vitamin D supplement
makes sense.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:49.330
How much? About 2,000
international units a day is safe.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:52.740
For Vitamin B12, you
need 2.4 micrograms,

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.280
but there's no pill that small.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.170
So any Vitamin B12 pill you
take has more than enough

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:00.070
and it's non-toxic even if
you swallow the whole bottle.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.510
Um, so that's -- that's really it.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.860
There are other supplements
sold, but they are only used

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:09.910
for particular applications
and mostly unnecessary.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:11.210
Yes? One last question.

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:12.510
Sure.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:13.810
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.110
OK [laughing].

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.410
&gt;&gt; I, over the years -- salt -- OK.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:18.770
You got sea salt.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.140 position:56%
I've been told that you need iodine.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.360
Is that still true?

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.660
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: Yes.

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:27.960
Yeah.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.280
&gt;&gt; And should we [inaudible].

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.580
&gt;&gt; Neal Barnard: OK.

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.880
All right.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.180
Fabulous. OK.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.480
What a good group you are.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.780
This -- excellent questions.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.250
OK. You do need a little bit iodine
and there's not a lot of sources.

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.060
And it's true, there are salts

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.480
that have iodine added
to it and that's good.

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.860
It's good for your thyroid gland.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.170
But there are also natural
foods like seaweed that have it.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.100 position:56%
So when you're going to the Japanese
restaurant with all your friends

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:53.010
and having the cool vegan sushi
and getting the admiration

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:56.720
of the serving staff, you're also
getting iodine along with it.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.020
All right.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.320
Well, thank you for letting
me share this time with you.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.620
I really appreciate it.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:01.920
Thanks to the organizers as well.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.220
Thank you.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.520
Thank you.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.220
&gt;&gt; One of the things that I
have shared through the year

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:12.280
because I am a four time
cancer survivor and I have --

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:14.340
most of my survival has been

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:18.480
because I have been following
a plant based diet just

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.820
about all of my life.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:24.070
And so even though I got breast
cancer, um, in the last stages

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.470
of it, um, the plant
-- the plant based diet

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:30.900
for me was part of my surviving.

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.290
And through the years, um,
you had written this book,

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:38.040
which was a good book that I've
shared with many cancers survivors

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.490
through the year because it
wasn't out when I first got it.

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:46.110
But this came out, I
believe it's 2008 or 2009

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:50.750
and this is an excellent book for
those to -- to share with others.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.670
And even if you're
not necessarily, um,

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:58.150 position:56%
someone that's a cancer survivor,
this book itself is a real good book

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:03.160
because it really basis on really
pretty much Dr. Barnard has been,

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.030
um, actually doing.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:08.280
And this is the name of the book.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.910 position:56%
But he has several other good books,

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.880
but this is an excellent
book, um, to have [inaudible].

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.180
And he has some incredible, um,
recipes in here too that I've tried

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:21.060
through the years as well.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:28.290 position:56%
So Dr. Barnard, I am so happy that I
finally met one of my idols along --

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:32.140
I don't know if I'll ever get
a chance to meet Dr. Ornish

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.430
because I've followed him
through the years, but I thank you

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:38.690
so very much -- um
-- everyone -- um --

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:44.190
I thank you all for continuing to
support our living well, um, mind,

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:50.240
body, and spirit, um, Brown Bags
and we will have an exciting, um,

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.470
speaker on March 15th
that will be coming.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.940
So look out for that as well.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.960
So, thank you so much for your --

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:04.510
your coming and sharing all
this wealth with our audience.
