00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.610
The core idea behind defining all of our traits is the idea that

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.860
we're not just one trait, but a collection of all of our traits together.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.090
&gt;&gt; We all have our own stories about

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.210
what it's like to live with different traits,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.250
and we're all different because of the environment

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.670
we live in or certain combination of traits.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.130
&gt;&gt; And help us on our journey

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.390
of understanding the biological basis for many of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.450
our traits. We're going to be sharing personal

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.230
stories from individuals from all walks of life.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.850
&gt;&gt; We've

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.880
recruited five people that we're going to talk

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.860
to extensively throughout the whole course, and see

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.659
what it's like to live with their certain

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.800
traits, and how these traits affect their life.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
&gt;&gt; Our group of five individuals consists of a visible and hidden traits

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.790
That have come to shape who they are in both small and big ways.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.550
&gt;&gt; By the end of this course, you'll be familiar

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.940
with the particular traits these individuals represent, and the biological

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.100
significance of having these variations.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.010
&gt;&gt; You know, let's, let's go meet 'em.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.610
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
