00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.240
This is my office Brady, full of beautiful
memories, full of actions, full of work and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.200
also full of some maths curiosities.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.329
See this, for instance, it looks like a plain
doughnut.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:22.529
Let's see, it separates into two Möbius bands
which are intertwined.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.179
This required quite some skill at the, you
know, 3D printer.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:38.790
This is the famous Möbius band in wood, you
know, just one side and just one boundary.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.870
This is Pythagoras, we know, we're not even
sure that Pythagoras existed; for all that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
we know he may be a myth, but so important
myth.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.170
I bought this in Athens, one of the places
most important for us mathematicians; the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.830
place where, you know, mathematics was upgraded
from a set of recipes to solve problem into

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.260
a way to access some eternal truths.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.940
One of the most important books ever – The
Elements of Euclid, here in the beautiful

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.570
English edition.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.930
Look at these colours...
(Brady: Wow)

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.830
Here there was an effort to bring the very
notion of reasoning to life.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.850
Look at this.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.860
This is a memory from my teaching in the Aims
Cameroon Institute.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.120
You know I go teaching in Africa every year
at least couple of weeks and it's important

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.950
for me and I get a lot of joy from that.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.260
And this is a memory from there and this is
the symbol I love so much – the integral.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.580
You know, this is like an S elongated.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.229
I work in analysis, I draw integrals all the
time, so much that whenever I start working

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.549
on a problem, the symbol 'integral' flashes
in my mind.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.759
You know it was Leibniz who invented this
notation – it's an S like summation.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.371
And we know the exact year and even the exact
day on which he thought of this notation – one

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:17.769
of the most successful ever.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.439
When you think that this flash of Leibniz
now is used by hundreds of thousands of people

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:31.460
around the world - everybody learns it in
school, and reminds us that notation is so

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.700
important, and so...S is a dear letter to
me because S is the symbol of entropy on which

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.700
I worked for years of my life and S is the
symbol also of integration.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.909
Look at that.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.919
This was knitted for me.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:55.159
This is hyperbolic crochet – it's constant
negative curvature.

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.950
It's like a little bit of the hyperbolic plane.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.680
Now we know since Hilbert that there's no
way to represent the hyperbolic plane in its

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.030
entirety in our limited 3-dimensional world.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.230
If you try to continue it, it will break down
- at some point it will be impossible to continue.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.099
And still, that little bit you can touch,
and it has the property that any point, any

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.239
little bit has exactly the same geometry as
any other little bit – constant curvature.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.430
I'd like to show you one of the jewels of
this collection.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.309
This is the Gömböc.

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.819
This took ten years to the guy who discovered
it.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.299
A solution to a big and simple problem at
the same time.

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:53.139
Is it possible to make a shape that will be
convex, homogeneous and have only two equilibrium

00:03:53.139 --> 00:04:00.409
positions, only two – one stable and one
unstable.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:12.010
If I let it go from any initial configuration,
it will go back to its stable position.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.229
(Brady: Your office seems very busy, seems
very full of things.

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.989
What should I read from your office?)

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.420
From my office, first read that I am a busy
guy and that I receive lot of things.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:35.190
Books arrive here almost every day, reports,
letters, so many many things.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.300
And also, I travel a lot so everywhere I travel
there's something for me to take back.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.539
Many of these objects are associated with
memories for me.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.880
(Brady: Do they help you work?

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.000
Like when you're, when you want to think,
when you want to work things out, when you

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.199
want to do mathematics, is this environment
like, good for you, does it stimulate you

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.660
or does it distract you, like, where do you
do your best thinking?

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.949
Is it in an environment like this?)

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.970
I think what is around you when you think
doesn't matter so much.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:17.979
What you feel matters – sounds, how comfortable
you are, the desktop, your chair – that

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.199
really matters.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.729
And I think supplies of paper, having blackboard,
that also matters.

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.949
And when you think deeply the rest just vanishes
in some sense.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.479
But I may have the feeling of being at home.

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.939
In some situations however, when you are deeply
with your problem, you feel at home anywhere

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:45.099
just thinking about your problem.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:53.080
Some of my best work was done in hotels, on
the train, and there's no rule.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.539
More important when you think is what goes
on inside rather than outside.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.469
We have some enlightening texts by Henri Poincaré
describing various illuminations arriving

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:10.600
randomly – sometimes crossing the street,
sometimes during some walk – this also is

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.880
in my experience.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.220
The best thoughts can be nearly everywhere.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:24.729
Then, to do your systematic work, to work
quietly and systematically, it's good to really

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.039
feel in your environment, like at home.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:32.439
But the real (click) flash moments, they can
occur anywhere.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:43.610
Flash moment is most often when you are alone,
that's for sure, but some of the most important

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.419
ones in my career occurred in conversation.

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.449
Actually my, in my book, “Birth of a Theorem,”
first chapter is about how Clément Mouhot

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.229
and I start working on the so-called Landau
damping, and there's a discussion between

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.150
us (click) and there's a flash with the two
of us.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.819
It's clear that me alone or him alone, there
would have been no flash, and that determined

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:39.169
part of our life for the two years coming.
