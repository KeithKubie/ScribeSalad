00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.280
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: So, good morning.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
Good morning.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.360
I hope everybody enjoyed the part of the keynote
you were there for and then the last 10 minutes

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360
here.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.800
Sorry it ran a little long. Our guests -- it's
15 minutes of extra awesome for everyone.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.630
So we have a lot to cover today and we are
actually Live Waving this.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.420
We're transcribing this in a Wave and you
can get to that Wave, if you have your laptop

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.650
open, at goo.gl/Ze99.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.620
And embedded in that Wave is a Google moderator.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.500
So if you have questions for us, please put
them in the Google moderator because

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.120
we may run short on time for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.370
We'll go back and we'll – Jeff and I will
fill out everything after the fact.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.870
So my name is DeWitt and this is Jeff.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.090
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Hi.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.970
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And we're software engineers here
at Google.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.479
And as software developers yourselves you
know that Google has many different APIs,

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.540
a platform on which for you to build.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.280
I think we have over 60 different product
APIs right now.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.020
But one thing you may not have known is how
easy it is to use those APIs and what we are

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:38.579
going to show you today is ways to bring Google
technologies -- the power search, and content,

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.399
and revenue, and interactivity -- and a surprise
launch right at the end – and bring these

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.030
to your site using very simple techniques,
something that anybody in

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.850
this room can do.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.490
I'd like to start this today by handing it
to Jeff, who will talk about Google Custom

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.230
Search and bringing that to your web site.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.230
Jeff?

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.630
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Thanks. Okay. So one of the things
that Google is best known for is

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.060
search and for a while we've had a product
called Google Custom Search.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.120
I'm gonna give a quick overview of what it
is and then talk about a couple of new

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.230
tricks that we've recently taught to Custom
Search.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.470
So to begin with, Custom Search is really
all about creating your own search engine

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.030
using Google's technologies in the background.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.620
So with Custom Search you define a slice of
the web that you want Google to index, and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.610
rank, and do all the things that Google has
gotten good at doing for your particular slice

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.280
of the web that you're interested in.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.561
And then we give you a way to embed this Custom
Search box that you've created onto your site.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.840
So let's take a look at an example.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.520
[pause]

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.270
Here's one I created earlier.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.270
All right.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.200
So we have our search box here and maybe we'll
search for something.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.950
This is -- this is actually a Custom Search
Engine that I defined earlier using some of

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.830
the sites on Google code, and some of our
blogs and video channels, things like that.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.860
So does anybody have a suggestion?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.180
Anything they're interested in?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.260
Just shout it out.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.820
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Flowers.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.850
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Flowers.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.400
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: App Engine.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.220
&gt;&gt;Jeff: App Engine.
There's a good one.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.320
All right.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320
Okay.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.210
So here we have, we have our search results.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.900
We've actually applied a theme which is something
we created a little while ago, a way to make

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.570
the look and feel of this fit into your site.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.510
So you can see, I have a few tabs here.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.410
I've actually created some refinements.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.640
So for example, here, I'm just looking at
blogs that were, were indexed as part of this

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.740
Custom Search Engine.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.819
Now, the code for this is actually very simple
and you actually don't even need to understand

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.789
JavaScript and HTML to be able to use it.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.441
We can look at the source for this.

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:25.570
This is the entire page right here, just a
few lines.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.210
And I brought up a larger view here.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.210
Right.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.660
So we can see that there's just a few lines
of HTML and JavaScript and we actually give

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.790
you a tool to generate this for you.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.970
We have something called a "web element" which
is basically a graphical way to configure

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.660
the look and feel and define the scope of
your Custom Search Engine.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.070
We have sort of a zero configuration option
which is this automatically search my site.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.600
Whatever site you put this code on, if you
have that as your option, that particular

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.820
site defines the scope of the search engine.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.210
So then your search box will be just for that
domain.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.221
All right.

00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:22.630
So I mentioned some new tricks and I'm going
to show you one of these right now.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.669
I'm going to take my demo site and go to this
super secret URL.

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:31.900
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: [Laughing]

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.130
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Okay.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.560
And we have what looks to be the same thing
and I'm gonna show this quickly before you

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.330
guys view source and figure out what I changed.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.690
So this time maybe I'll look for Ajax.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.690
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Whoa!

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.690
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And hey.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:47.690
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Look at that.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.840
&gt;&gt;Jeff: What do you know? That's new.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.480
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Are those autocompletions?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.530
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yes, they are. Thank you. So..

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.790
[audience applauds]

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.710
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So today we are making available auto
completions for Custom Search Engines.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.139
So this is now available for all filter Custom
Search Engines.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.780
And setting this up is quite simple.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.831
First you'll go to google.com/cse which is
where you can manage your Custom Search engines

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:24.770
that you've created and there's a new option
now available which allows you to enable auto

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.840
completions for particular Custom Search Engine.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.190
And then you'll also need to make a couple
of changes in that code I showed earlier.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.530
Where you see we just really add a couple
lines here.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.810
So we're setting a draw option, controlling
how this is rendered, and one of the new options

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.630
is enabling auto complete.
All right.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.800
So that's one of the new things in Custom
Search.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.830
Another is actually extending this idea of
themes and actually taking the customizability

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.169
to a whole new level.

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.040
So ratcheting up the custom in Custom Search.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:18.630
So with these new templates and this new theming
system you can actually create a fully customized

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.100
rendering for your search results.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.110
This works best just to show you an example.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.520
I'm gonna bring up a site here.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:36.210
Dishola.com is a site that's all about reviewing
specific dishes at, at restaurants and the

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.360
group that's behind it actually started working
on an experimental mobile interface which

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.820
is living at dishfork.appspot.com.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.780
I thought that was kind of a clever name.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.450
So we'll take a look at this site here.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.570
So this is really designed for a mobile view.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:02.229
You can see here that if I search for something
like "cake", we have this interface that comes

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:08.610
up and what may be surprising is that all
of this is powered through Custom Search.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.009
All of this content has been indexed in a
Custom Search Engine and all of the rendering

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:16.140
is using the Custom Search JavaScript.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.120
So we can take a look, we can click through
some of these.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:26.460
And see, they've embedded a map, they've got
an average user rating, some different tags.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:36.149
And all of these are actually stored in the
index as something called "rich snippets".

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:43.719
This is a way that you can take specific pieces
of structured content on your site and actually

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:47.560
expose this as part of your user interface.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.630
Now, if we look at the source for this page,
I mentioned that they've created this entire

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.649
UI using this new templating system.

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:01.080
You can actually see here, this is their template
right here.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:08.770
It basically defined how each of these pieces,
the rich snippets, the results, the links,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.110
how they're going to be laid out on the page
and how they're going to be styled.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.330
Now, this is a lot.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.980
They really went crazy with this.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:23.360
But to look at a simplified example, if we're
just looking at the thumbnail image, this

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.620
is a quick idea just to give you a flavor
of what this looks like.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:32.140
Here you can see we're looking for a rich
snippet, we're saying where we want to render

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.760
it on the page.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.610
And if you want to learn more about this,
this templating system, you can actually look

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.980
at our documentation on code.google.com.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.980
All right.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.550
So now we've looked at a way that you can
expose the content that's on your site through

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.500
a Custom Search Engine.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.730
And we're going to look at something new,
change direction a little bit, and talk about

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.730
some ways to bring new content into your site.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.180
And for that, I'll turn it over to DeWitt.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.180
&gt;&gt;DeWitt:

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.180
Good.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.180
Thanks, Jeff.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:15.940
So really quickly, you may have heard -- this
is confidential – that, that blogs are dead,

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.460
that RSS is dead, feeds are dead.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.959
The people who say that, I'm not sure where
they're getting their data 'cause we've seen

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:27.250
year, after year, after year continued growth
in the number of feeds, the

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.610
number of feed consumers.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:36.130
The popularity of feeds continues to grow
and one of the ways that people get to feeds

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.050
is using the Google Feed API.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:47.490
So the Google Feed API converts RSS or Atom
feeds, published by publishers, into a normalized

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.850
form in JSON, and then allows that JSON to
be embedded in web browsers.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.930
It's, it's grown and grown and grown.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:02.130
We're now doing well over a hundred million
requests for feeds over the Feed API every

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.260
single day.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.380
And why don't I show you an example of a site
that's using the Google Feed API.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.370
So you're all familiar with The New Yorker
magazine.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:19.180
The New Yorker publishes RSS feeds for their
recent articles and restaurant reviews.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:26.100
The content on their site is exposed via feeds
and if you look at their home page, what's

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.630
interesting is it's very rich, very dynamic,
brings in a tremendous amount of content.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:37.990
And you'll see down here sections -- the movie
section, the reporting an essay section.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:44.050
Those are actually brought in from their RSS
feeds and what brings them into this page,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.840
which is dynamically rendered in the browser,
is the Google Feed API and I'll show you how

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.600
they're using this.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.330
So we do a search for "google load" you'll
see that they're loading the Feed API and

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.211
then loading their own RSS feed, and then
dynamically rendering it on the page.

00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:04.580
[pause]

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:11.570
They do this using a surprisingly small amount
of code.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:18.300
So it's about ten lines of code to load and
fetch a feed in a web browser, normalize it,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:26.080
and then iterate over each entry, and then
rendering it on the page using HTML and CSS.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.050
So this is interesting and to talk about exactly
how it works we need to go into a little more

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.529
detail about how feeds in general work.

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:36.120
So you have feed publishers.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.510
So you have The New Yorker, you have the New
York Times, you have the TechCrunch.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.089
They publish either RSS or Atom and they publish
them to the web.

00:12:43.089 --> 00:12:47.730
And on the other hand you have feed subscribers.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:53.800
This could be Google Reader, it could be blog
lines, it could be Outlook, it could be Firefox.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.370
So those are feed subscribers.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:04.120
One thing that cannot be a feed subscriber,
unfortunately, is the browser.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.740
So as a security feature, browsers have what's
known as a "same origin" policy.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.030
It prevents third-party content from being
loaded into a page from a domain that's different

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.520
than the page it was surfed off itself.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.970
So we can't do what we see in this image.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:29.029
We can't load from the browser directly from
the publisher.

00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:31.170
For that, we need the Google Feed API.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:38.100
So what the Google Feed API does is it retrieves
the RSS or the Atom feed, it converts it into

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.910
JSON, and then it serves it back out to the
browser using a technique called JSONP.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.790
So that allows the third-party content to
be embedded in the context of the page.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.170
We just saw this on The New Yorker.com.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.170
This works.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.540
It's successful but can you see the problem
with it?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:02.550
Well, the problem is those lines that are
going back and forth on the screen.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.839
The fetch and the response.

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.060
Fetch and the response.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.640
Fetch and the response.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.720
Or as we joke, it's like the kid in the backseat
going, "are we there yet? Are we there yet?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.670
 "
Over and over and over again.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.649
This introduces a tremendous amount of latency.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:22.580
You have to fetch the feed right after it
was published to get the update quickly and

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.850
it's also a lot of wasted energy.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.529
We spend a lot of time fetching stuff that
doesn't exist.

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:29.510
The answer is usually, no, we're not there
yet.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:35.240
To solve this problem on the servers, a lot
of us in the industry have been working on

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:42.800
a protocol called PubSubHubbub and it's as
fun to say as it is to use.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.950
PubSubHubbub is actually fantastic.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:51.120
What it does is it introduces a hub in between
the feed publisher and the subscribers.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.420
So when, say, TechCrunch has a new entry up,
they ping their hub, the hub goes and fetches

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.260
the update, and then broadcasts it out to
all of the subscribers so Google Reader will

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.830
get the update in, say, 2 seconds rather than
in 5 minutes.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:12.380
So PubSubHubbub is rapidly accelerating, if
you'll forgive the pun, the real-time web.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.480
So here's where we are today.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.670
We have the Google Feed API wired up to PubSubHubbub.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:27.209
So a entry posted on TechCrunch will make
it to the Feed API in a second.

00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:29.520
You see what's going on here?

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.519
The browsers are still pulling the Google
Feed API.

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:38.790
So even though we can get it up to Google
in a second, it's -- you have to refresh the

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.580
page to get it down to the browser.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.880
Wouldn't it be great if we could change that?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:53.230
So we did. I'm very pleased to announce today
the Google Feed API with Push all the way

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.800
to the browser.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.980
And I wasn't gonna show you guys this but
it kinda went viral this week so.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:06.320
&gt;&gt; One of the Google Feed API you can easily
add content from your favorite feed to your

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320
web site.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.750
For instance, here's an example matchup showing
entries from a couple of my personal feeds.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.610
This is great for adding rich content to your
site and is easy to implement using a few

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:16.610
lines of JavaScript.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.990
The problem is that your visitors will only
see new content when they reload the page

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.220
and even then only after Google has recrawled
the feed.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.910
Enter the new Google Feed API version 2, now
with Push updates.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.610
Just make a couple of changes to the code
and your visitors will be able to receive

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.160
updates pushed to their browser without a
refresh.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.950
Let's see how this works.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.220
Here's the demo again but this time with Push
enabled.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.370
Now I'll go post an update on my blog.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:46.360
As I submit this post, Word Press is adding
the new post to its feed and pinging the PubSubHubbub

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360
hub.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.529
The hub will then fetch the new content and
send it to all subscribed servers, including

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:54.880
Google servers, which send it to all subscribed
browsers.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880
And there you go.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.510
The update arrived within seconds on my page
and it would have done the same for anyone

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.010
who was looking at that page at the same time
as us.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:08.870
For more information, please see the documentation
at code.gooogle.com/apis/feed/push.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.760
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: So we are extremely excited about
this.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.970
Let me just show you the code again.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:23.939
In order to go from a polling based feed subscription
using the Google Feed API we can go to a push-based

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:30.610
subscription model simply by changing to Feed
API version 2, changing the constructer there,

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.700
and changing the load to a subscribe.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.700
Fantastically simple.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:41.020
We think this is going to enable a whole new
type of application in the web browser.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.860
We are going to be rolling this out over the
next couple weeks.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:56.540
If you are interested and wanna start trying
it soon, please visit us as google.com -- code.google.com/apis/feed/push.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.000
And if you're interested in all the technical
details behind this, and there are plenty,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.200
please join Bret at the Realtime Web -- Realtime
Web Apps talk tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. right

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:13.220
back in this room and that'll be a lot of
fun.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.770
And now Jeff is going to talk about one way
to bring more revenue to your web site.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.190
So we showed you search, we showed you content,
and now we'll talk about revenue.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.840
Jeff.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.140
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Thanks.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.140
Okay.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.580
So we've shown some ways to bring great content
to your site, either exposing it through search

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:39.010
or bringing in new content, and now that your
users are there and have a lot of stuff to

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.740
do on your site, maybe now is the right time
to think about ways that you can bring in

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.000
some revenue.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.730
One way that people do this is through a e-commerce
store front.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:53.730
Something like this, you know.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.100
There are several different solutions out
there.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.710
A lot of them have sort of a similar look
and feel, something like this.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.600
You usually have an image of what you're selling,
a description, price, you have a shopping

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:11.980
cart so that people can continue to browse
around and add things to their cart, purchasing

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.390
them all at the end.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:19.840
And setting up these sites is not trivial;
right?

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.500
There's usually a little configuration and
coding involved and we at Google wanted to

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.400
see just how easy we could make this.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:37.230
So I actually set up one of these earlier
using this new Google Checkout element.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.510
We're gonna take a look at it here.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.570
[Pause]

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:48.540
So this is a simple store here that I set
up all about selling stickers for your laptop.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.880
See, I went with kind of a theme here.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.980
And for some of these, you can add them to
your cart, you can change quantities.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.980
Let's see.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.820
I want a few of these.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.450
You can select different sizes, things like
that.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.450
You can change your mind.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.450
Right.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.980
All of this is kinda standard stuff.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:16.960
But what's surprising about this is how very
little code is actually required to get this

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960
set up.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:24.890
In fact, if we view source, we can see right
here this is the entire code for the page

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:30.490
and this right here is actually what's driving
all of this.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:37.451
So we have here a gadget that's actually embedded
and loaded on the page and the great thing

00:20:37.451 --> 00:20:42.850
about this is that the content for this is
actually all pulled out of a Google spread

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.900
sheet.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.230
So I noticed actually that I made a mistake
here.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.370
So there's a typo here.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.590
Turns out that apparently this sticker is
gonna make you sicker.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.900
Probably not something that people would be
interested in.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:06.580
So now I have kind of a problem where I have
to fix this and I don't know.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.672
I have to call the webmaster.

00:21:07.672 --> 00:21:08.672
I mean, this is -- this is gonna be a big
deal.

00:21:08.672 --> 00:21:15.980
Well, turns out, since we're working with
a spreadsheet here and pulling all the information

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:22.460
dynamically as needed, I can just open the
spreadsheet and fix it right here.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.600
There we go.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.039
And while I'm at it, maybe I'm also having
a sale.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:30.860
Yeah.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.860
New low price.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.920
And also this size option I'd kinda like to
do that for some of these other stickers as

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.330
well.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:45.820
So I just changed the spreadsheet and when
next time someone views the page, they will

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.760
actually see the updated information.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.150
[pause]

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.150
All right.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.250
So here we have it.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.990
And I can now select sizes here.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.801
All right.

00:21:57.801 --> 00:22:04.860
So what we've tried to do is make setting
up one of these e-commerce store fronts really

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.440
simple.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.490
As I mentioned, you just edit a spreadsheet
and the spreadsheet containing everything

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.970
from the screen shot, to the description,
the price, and it even has this quantity column

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:17.970
here.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:23.780
And so if someone purchases something, that
purchase is entered into the Google Checkout

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:30.470
Merchant Center so the merchant center is
actually handling the whole flow of the transaction.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:35.380
And then when the purchase is made it actually
updates the quantity here, decreasing the

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.340
available quantity here in your spreadsheet.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:45.350
So what you have now is a store gadget talking
with Google Checkout and spreadsheets all

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.929
working together.

00:22:46.929 --> 00:22:51.240
And I think this highlights one of the great
things about Cloud computing and the fact

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.080
that your spreadsheet data lives in the cloud
and that there's an API so that you can build

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.820
these interactive applications.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:05.240
You could actually build something like this
yourself.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.060
So in continuing with our theme of you don't
have to know programming to do this, we actually

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:17.590
provide a configuration wizard where you can
set some options like sizes and currency and

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:23.400
actually get some code to copy and paste onto
your page.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400
All right.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.961
So that's one way to bring in revenue through,
through actually selling something and a few

00:23:29.961 --> 00:23:32.299
sites have started using this.

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:36.789
I picked a couple of examples that I thought
highlighted some interesting ways that this

00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:38.590
could be used.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.340
The first is one of these is being used on
a Google site.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:49.500
So this site here is actually selling rose
and they didn't have to set up any of their

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.789
own servers, or know how to write HTML.

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:59.840
They did all of this hosted on a Google site
which has a, a nice editor and you can just

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.179
paste an iFrame right in there and it runs.

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:08.960
Another here, Long Live Books, actually took
some of the customization features.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.650
So one of the things you can do in your spreadsheet
is actually have a field where people can

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.400
enter their own text.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.030
So they use this to allow people to put their
own custom text on a book cover that they're

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:25.360
ordering and that text that they entered goes
into the Merchant Center along with the order,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.040
flows through the whole, the whole process.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:35.760
So we feel like there's really a lot you can
do and it's really easy to get started with

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760
this.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.760
All right.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.179
So now we'd like to change gears a little
bit and talk about another way to possibly

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:47.100
bring revenue to your site and for that I'll
turn it back over to DeWitt.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.100
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Great.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.100
Thanks, Jeff.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.590
So Jeff just showed you how to run your own
store online with very little code, not even

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.031
hosting your own web servers using the Google
Check Out element.

00:24:58.031 --> 00:24:59.031
All right.

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:06.250
But many of you are probably already using
a revenue-generating API, the AdSense API,

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.970
one of the most popular APIs on the web.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:14.520
And what I'm going to talk about today I think
will make a number of you very, very happy.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.240
So think about how AdSense for content works.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.880
Google bot crawls the content of the page
and it matches relevant ads by Google with

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.179
that content on the page and presents them
to your users.

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:33.740
Well, this works very, very well if there
is content on the page to be crawled.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.440
But something happened.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.100
Sunar was talking about it earlier.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:43.170
Something happened over the last couple years
and -- well, actually, you think about it,

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:46.679
we're kind of responsible for it -- this Ajax
revolution.

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:53.940
The, the growth of HTML, and JavaScript, and
CSS where the content of the page is only

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.240
created when the user is interacting with
it.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.520
There's less to be crawled.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.750
This has traditionally posed a problem for
AdSense for Content so we introduced a new

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:14.320
API, the AdSense for Content/AdSense for Ajax
API and what the AdSense for Ajax API allows

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.549
the publisher to do is pass hints about the
current content of -- content on the page

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:22.080
up to Google.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.200
And also when you think about Ajax apps, they
often don't reload, the user doesn't like

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.970
hit "refresh" all the time.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:35.780
The page refreshes itself with the content
on the page so the AdSense for Ajax API allows

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.220
you to dynamically update that ad blog.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:44.720
Let me show you an example of this site that's
using the AdSense for Ajax API.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.990
So here we have a site, trip.com; they're
a travel site, and what's interesting at this

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.191
travel site is if you click on these tabs
here -- it's actually a nice looking site

00:26:54.191 --> 00:27:00.789
 -- you click on these tabs here, you'll notice
the URL at the top doesn't change.

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:05.360
This is all being built in the browser using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.480
It's an Ajax app.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.530
Now, look at the bottom right here.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:17.780
This is an AdSense block and as we change
the tabs, you'll notice that the AdSense block

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.539
got updated based on the changed context of
the page.

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:25.570
So I imagine you're thinking, well, that's
gonna be a lot of programming.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.570
No.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.010
By now you probably figured out by now no,
it's not gonna be a lot of programming.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:31.909
It's actually going to be a couple lines of
code.

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:35.120
I actually prefer this to the traditional
AdSense block.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:43.159
You pass in a IEB size where you would like
the ad, you pass in a hint about the content

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:51.690
of the page, and then you simply call the
ads API to render an ad by Google for your

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.559
users into the desired dev.

00:27:54.559 --> 00:28:00.270
And then if that content changes, you can
call the ad refresh method and refresh that

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.260
block.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:09.020
So this works fantastic when you have content
on your page but there's another type of site.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.070
It's a search engine.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.500
So say you're running your own search engine,
you have an e-commerce site, you have a travel

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.799
site, you have a local search site.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:22.299
Users are coming to you and they are typing
key words into the search box.

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:29.340
This intent is an incredibly powerful tool
to match relevant ads by Google with users

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.030
who are interested in it.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:39.020
So we are expanding our program of AdSense
for Search Ads Only and let me show you an

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.110
example of a site that's using this.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.929
So this is merchantcircle.com.

00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:46.860
They are a local search engine.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.350
So users come to the site, they type in a
keyword, they type in a geography.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.390
And I'll do that right now.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.419
I'll search for pizza in San Francisco.

00:28:56.419 --> 00:29:00.279
And you will notice down here we have local
search result.

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.940
So they are running their own search index.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.870
So we showed you earlier how to do it using
Google Custom Search.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.110
They have their own index.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:17.480
Above this, we have relevant ads by Google
that were matched against the pizza in San

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.080
Francisco query.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:25.440
So this is the AdSense for Search Ads Only
program.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.860
[pause]

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.390
Using AdSense for Search is also very simple.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.260
In fact, I think it's even easier than the
AdSense for Ajax API.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.270
You simply give us the pub ID; you give us
the user search query, the most important

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:48.080
part; you say where you would like the ad
rendered; and then you ask for an ad to be

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.409
fendered into that block and Google takes
care of the rest.

00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:57.059
So we draw an iFrame, we make it safe, we
present that directly to your users.

00:29:57.059 --> 00:30:04.190
And we are growing these programs and if you
are interested in joining us with these two

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:10.740
new AdSense features, please visit us on code.google.com
and search for AdSense.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.529
So there's a tab on the left of the new AdSense
features.

00:30:14.529 --> 00:30:15.529
Very excited about that.

00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:24.090
So Jeff -- I wanna save a few minutes for
Jeff to launch something I'm thrilled to be

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.090
doing today.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.309
But before we turn it back over to Jeff, I
wanna talk real quickly about bringing interactivity

00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:31.640
to your site.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.539
So how many people here are familiar with
Google Buzz?

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:38.539
Great.

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:39.539
That's everyone.

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:40.539
That's awesome.

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:41.539
I'm a big fan of Google Buzz.

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.539
I use it all the time.

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:45.460
I use it to communicate with my friends and
my family.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.789
It allows me to post videos and texts, and
updates, and share 'em with my friends.

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:58.150
And after we launched Google Buzz, which of
course launched as part of Gmail, we heard

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:04.890
from publishers who said, well, this is really
nice but I'd really like to get Buzz onto

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.890
my site.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:12.140
I would like my site visitors to be able to
engage via Buzz with their friends.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.899
So we introduced the Google Buzz Button.

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:18.149
One of the sites that adopted this quickly
was our friends over at TechCrunch.

00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:25.270
And you'll notice at the top of every post
on TechCrunch there's a Google Buzz button.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:33.600
So let's actually press that.
And we could say "live Buzzing from Google

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:44.370
I/O" and when I post this, it's going to get
posted up to all of my friends and the link

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.169
will be pointing back to TechCrunch.

00:31:46.169 --> 00:31:51.730
So that's one way to drive engagement on your
site and make your site more interactive using

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.510
Google Buzz.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:59.159
You can get a Google Buzz button on your site
by going to google.com/buzz/stuff.

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:02.580
They're very simple to embed.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.149
It would take anybody about three minutes
to put one on their site.

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:09.179
They're actually remarkably customizable.

00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:15.529
And speaking of customization, I don't wanna
spoil the launch this afternoon but -- and

00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:22.830
you didn't hear it from me -- come today at
1:45 to room eight and you may learn something

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.170
about Google Buzz APIs.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.120
So that was Google Buzz.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.510
Another way of bringing interactivity to your
site is a product that we launched called

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:43.169
Google SideWiki and what Google SideWiki does
is allows people as they surf the web to annotate

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:44.169
it.

00:32:44.169 --> 00:32:49.490
So you see a site you like, you're able to
note -- leave a note for yourself, leave a

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.289
note for friends, about the content on that
site.

00:32:52.289 --> 00:32:56.600
And we launched this as a tool bar and we
launched this as an extension.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.130
So there's a Chrome extension for it.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.940
Let me show you what the Chrome extension
looks like.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:11.500
So I'll go here and I'll go to google.com
and you'll notice I have the Google Chrome

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.500
extension installed.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.220
And if I click on it, it's supposed to pop
up.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.220
I may be clicking too many times.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.220
There we go.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:24.450
So this pops up Google SideWiki and this is
my personal view of Google SideWiki so this

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:30.520
follows me around the web and here we see
that Marisa and, my friend Danny Sullivan

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:35.539
said Google's amazing but nothing's perfect
and I guess that's true.

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:39.740
And publishers asked us about the SideWiki
element and they said this is great but I

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.470
wanna know what people are saying about my
site.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:47.110
In fact, if it's useful content and interactive
content, I wanna actually distribute it to

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.840
everybody who visits my site.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.450
So they asked us for this and we launched
the Google SideWiki Element.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:58.029
And what the Google SideWiki Element does
is allow the publisher to embed the public

00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:03.620
view of the annotations of that page in the
page for everybody to see.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:09.540
So now anybody who's visiting a site that's
using the SideWiki Element has the ability

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.429
to see what's going on with SideWiki.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.629
You can get it at Google.com/webelements/sidewiki.

00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:25.059
And before I hand it back to Jeff, I wanna
talk very briefly about one other way to make

00:34:25.059 --> 00:34:27.579
your site more interactive.

00:34:27.579 --> 00:34:32.649
So you may remember we launched Google Wave
at the keynote here last year, Google I/O

00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:33.649
2009.

00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:40.069
One of the things we showed was the ability
to take Google Wave out of the Wave interface

00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:42.339
and embed it on a web site.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:46.069
And we just recently launched that as the
Google Wave Element.

00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:50.399
In fact, we announced that we were launching
the Google Wave Element and our friend at

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:57.819
Read Write Web within an hour had a blog post
up talking about the Google Wave Element and

00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:02.089
how it can be used to embed Google Wave on
web sites.

00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:06.829
It was cool and they got the screen shot,
and then -- wait a minute.

00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:09.630
That's not a screen shot.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.259
It's actually Google Wave embedded in their
site.

00:35:13.259 --> 00:35:16.059
It's a Wave about this page.

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:21.359
So what Read Write Web did was – I mean
you can imagine this replacing comments for

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:29.249
your site -- they took a live Google Wave,
scoped to that page, embedded it on the site,

00:35:29.249 --> 00:35:34.709
and what's very, very cool here -- so now
if we go here and we comment on it,

00:35:34.709 --> 00:35:37.359
[pause]

00:35:37.359 --> 00:35:43.910
I'm very high quality comment there -- this
Wave will appear automatically in my Google

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.950
Wave inbox.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.539
So this conversation isn't static.

00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:51.589
This conversation does not just live on Read
Write Web site.

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:58.469
This is a part of my Wave now and all the
interactions follow me around.

00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:08.079
Embedding a Google Wave onto your site is
as simple as going to google.com/webelements/wave.

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:13.049
And like all web elements, there's a wizard
and all you have to do is configure it a little

00:36:13.049 --> 00:36:14.049
bit.

00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:15.809
You configure the size and then you copy and
paste.

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:21.700
It's about eight lines of HTML I think and
just drop that onto your page and you have

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:28.349
live Google Wave on every page on your site.

00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:34.339
You can get more Google web elements, we have
I think 16 of them now, all of which bring

00:36:34.339 --> 00:36:38.609
Google products to your site using the simple
copy and paste technique.

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:39.609
We showed you a few.

00:36:39.609 --> 00:36:40.609
We showed you Google Custom Search.

00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:42.770
We showed you Wave, SideWiki.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:49.700
You can get more of these at google.com/webelements.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.650
And with that, I'd like to hand it back to
Jeff to finish up with the launch of something

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.660
very exciting.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.531
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Okay.

00:36:57.531 --> 00:37:00.660
So quick recap of where we've been.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:06.119
We've talked about ways to expose the content
on your site using Custom Search, bring new

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:15.170
content in now dynamically in near real time
with Push -- feeds of Push API.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:20.499
And we've shown ways to possibly bring in
some revenue either through selling goods

00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:21.900
or advertising.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.469
And we've showed some ways to make your site
more interactive, right?

00:37:25.469 --> 00:37:32.880
Bring --take your site's users and give them
an experience across the entire web.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880
All right.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.830
So one thing that's common in all of these
is actually the text that's on the page.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:45.109
It's pervasive, it's all around us and text
has been with us for thousands of years and

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:48.079
I predict that it'll be around for at least
a couple more.

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.480
So you heard it here first.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.599
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: [Laughing]

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:56.430
&gt;&gt;Jeff: But one of the things that's, that's
kind of a challenge with text is that it's

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.900
a big part of your user experience.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:04.380
So much of their time is spent reading and
you really want to have the text fit the look

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.630
and feel of your site.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:09.289
It defines a lot of what your user sees.

00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:15.789
So if you want your, your site to look the
same for everybody who's viewing it, you're

00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:18.170
really limited in your choices.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:22.309
If you want something that's available in
all browsers, all operating systems, you really

00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:23.309
have what?

00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:28.799
Like, five choices or something like that?

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:34.680
And we at Google have focused on doing a lot
of things to make the web better.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.190
We've looked at trying to make the web faster,
make the web more accessible, the web more

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:46.469
powerful and we thought, gee, wouldn't it
be great if we could take the web and make

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:49.160
it more beautiful?

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.779
[pause]
All right.

00:38:50.779 --> 00:39:00.499
And so to that end today we are pleased to
announce a new API, the Google Font API.

00:39:00.499 --> 00:39:06.410
So this is a way the dynamically load fonts
onto your page so that users will have the

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:11.180
same experience across different browsers,
different operating systems.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.680
And we'll take a look at some of these new
fonts that we're making available.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:23.119
We tried to, to cover a wide range of styles
to really let you pick something that fits

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:28.359
your site and the way that it feels.

00:39:28.359 --> 00:39:32.880
And we'll take a look at a site where we're
using this.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:38.329
You've actually already seen this today and
you probably didn't even notice but the Sticker

00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:44.259
Shop here, yeah, this banner up at the top,
our title actually isn't a picture.

00:39:44.259 --> 00:39:45.920
It's just text.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.640
[applause]

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640
And you can see it.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.630
It scales nicely as we go up, right?

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.900
As a font should.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.791
And using this on your page is actually very
simple.

00:40:01.791 --> 00:40:04.400
[pause]

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.930
So that slide earlier, the "Making the Web
Beautiful" slide, this is actually the full

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.390
HTML for, for that slide.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.940
This is the whole thing.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.250
So we've got the text down at the bottom and
we've got this link up at the top, and some

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:22.519
CSS and I'll actually dive into this in a
bit more detail.

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:28.099
So we'll look at the link first.

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:34.880
So this is -- as you would load a CSS file,
for example, into a site you can define this

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.230
resource that the browser should go out and
fetch and here we've said, okay, we're going

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:46.869
to fetch a font from the Fonts API and the
font that we picked is called "tangerine",

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:48.890
the name of the font there.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:54.519
And so the browser now is going to go out
and fetch this and dynamically load it so

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:58.759
that it's now available to be used in the
page.

00:40:58.759 --> 00:41:04.859
Now, with any fetching of resources, right,
there could potentially be some latency increase.

00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:10.039
So we've done our best to keep the latency
down to continue to allow your users to have

00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:15.789
a fast experience even with dynamic fonts
by doing some aggressive caching so that once

00:41:15.789 --> 00:41:20.339
a font is loaded it should never have to be
requested again.

00:41:20.339 --> 00:41:26.990
And in addition with these fonts we actually
serve just the font format that's appropriate

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.979
for the browser you're using.

00:41:28.979 --> 00:41:34.910
So if your user is viewing in IE 6, 7, or
8, they get one particular file, if they're

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:42.009
viewing it in Firefox 3.5, or Chrome, or Opera,
or Safari, they get, they get another, and

00:41:42.009 --> 00:41:47.259
we're also planning to support the web open
font format which is a new up and coming standard

00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:49.059
for distributing fonts.

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:50.059
[pause]

00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:51.059
All right.

00:41:51.059 --> 00:41:56.249
Now, in addition to the caching serving just
the file that's appropriate for your browser,

00:41:56.249 --> 00:41:59.219
we can actually batch these requests together.

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:03.910
So if you were using, say, three fonts on
your site, three of these, you can request

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.749
them all in just one request.

00:42:05.749 --> 00:42:11.630
So you just have one round trip in the browser
and you get a combined download with all of

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.079
these in it.

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.079
[pause]

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:23.269
There's actually some more kind of narrower
scopes that you can do if you just want, say,

00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:24.979
a particular flavor of one of these fonts.

00:42:24.979 --> 00:42:30.670
You can actually be even more fine-grained
and there's more details documented on that.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.670
Okay.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.869
So we've talked about loading these new fonts.

00:42:33.869 --> 00:42:38.410
Now, how do you use them once they're available?

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:43.170
Well, one way is to just use CSS just as you
would any other font, right?

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:50.849
You can define your font family that you're
looking for for a particular selector and

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:56.619
you can even chain multiple of these together,
use them as you would any other font in CSS.

00:42:56.619 --> 00:42:59.279
We've tried to make this as seamless as possible.

00:42:59.279 --> 00:43:02.930
[pause]

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:09.410
Now, another great thing that we've done is
taken this new set of fonts and the customizability

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.940
there and given you a way to try this out.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:18.959
I mean, I mentioned doing some CSS and you
may not be a CSS expert so we've created something

00:43:18.959 --> 00:43:23.630
that we hope will help you really create something
that looks great.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.640
So I'm going to pull up this web fonts preview
tool.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:36.420
This is actually an HTML5 application but
let's look at some of these fonts.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.289
And you can select different ones.

00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:43.890
Some of these are pretty interesting.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:46.489
I like this one.

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:47.489
[pause]

00:43:47.489 --> 00:43:49.259
It's right here.

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:56.099
You can actually do some things like change
the spacing between the words.

00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:57.329
See it update dynamically.

00:43:57.329 --> 00:44:01.619
Or maybe the line spacing here.

00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:08.599
And down below what you get is actually an
updated CSS rules that you can just copy and

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:09.599
paste into your page.

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:15.499
[pause]
This one is one of my favorites here is a

00:44:15.499 --> 00:44:18.920
nice looking fixed-width font.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:25.729
So as coders, you may appreciate having something
nice to view your code in.

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:29.160
And going here, we can just edit this right
here.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.630
So that wasn't a preview image or anything.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.110
This is just the text running right here in
the page.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:44.309
[pause]

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:45.309
All right.

00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:47.720
So with that, we have a few examples.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.180
[applause]

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:58.059
We're actually using this now in Google products.

00:44:58.059 --> 00:45:05.729
So one of them that we just released is spreadsheet
forms now have templates and themes where

00:45:05.729 --> 00:45:12.079
you can create your questionnaire or survey
and you can give it a customized look and

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:13.140
feel.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.959
And this text down here is actually using
the Fonts API and we've created several different

00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:20.289
ones of these.

00:45:20.289 --> 00:45:22.499
This one is one of my favorites.

00:45:22.499 --> 00:45:27.989
When I see this text there on the side, I
just have been conditioned to think, oh, this

00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:30.999
must be an image or a plug-in or something.

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:38.019
But this is actually just plain text using
the Fonts API and you can see it fits really

00:45:38.019 --> 00:45:40.670
nicely into the page.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.170
And this has several benefits.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:47.279
The fact that it's just plain text as opposed
to an image or plug-in means there's not this

00:45:47.279 --> 00:45:49.829
large download that someone has to do.

00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:57.420
An image, right, takes a ginormous amount
of data to, to transmit compared to just text

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.650
characters.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:04.829
And in addition things like screen readers
will have no problem reading this text.

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:06.880
So this actually improves accessibility.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.970
[pause]

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.170
Editing is another headache.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:15.579
If you're going to have to make changes on
this and you're relying on images, you have

00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:18.400
to edit it, take a screen shot, upload the
picture.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.910
Here, you just change the text.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:29.199
So we have quite a few of these that we created.

00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:31.459
We had a lot of fun with these.

00:46:31.459 --> 00:46:36.789
There's a lot of variety and great things
that you can do with, with these different

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:37.940
fonts.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.089
[pause]

00:46:39.089 --> 00:46:40.249
All right.

00:46:40.249 --> 00:46:45.069
So if you've enjoyed this so far I have one
more piece of good news which is that we've

00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:50.779
taken these fonts that we've either licensed
or created and we're making them all available

00:46:50.779 --> 00:46:52.109
through an open license.

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:59.520
[audience cheers and applauds]

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.989
So these are all available either under the
open font license or Apache 2 license.

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:09.949
So you're free to take these fonts, use them
in your own applications or sites and redistribute

00:47:09.949 --> 00:47:10.949
them.

00:47:10.949 --> 00:47:11.949
[pause]

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:13.520
All right.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:20.589
And so with that, you can find out all the
details on this and actually some of the more

00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:27.890
advanced features with the Web Fonts API at
code.google.com/apis/webfonts.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:33.239
I wanted to mention, too, we actually have
a JavaScript API that gives you more fine-grain

00:47:33.239 --> 00:47:37.999
control on how these fonts are fetched or
rendered.

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:42.789
So you can really customize this to your heart's
content.

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:46.839
And then we also have a talk that touches
on web fonts along with some other topics

00:47:46.839 --> 00:47:50.839
in HTML5 and that's tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
in room –

00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:51.839
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Today.

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:52.839
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Oh, today.

00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:57.869
Thank you, at 3:00 p.m. in room five.

00:47:57.869 --> 00:47:58.869
[pause]

00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:00.650
And so with that, we'll wrap things up.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:01.650
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: That's great.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:02.650
So we showed you a lot today.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.369
Thank you for sticking with us.

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:09.640
So we showed you how to add search to your
site using the Custom Search element.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:14.289
We showed you how to bring content to your
site using the Google Feed API.

00:48:14.289 --> 00:48:19.339
We showed you how to bring revenue to your
site using Google Checkout and the new features

00:48:19.339 --> 00:48:21.160
of Google AdSense.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:27.020
We showed you how to make your site more interactive
with Buzz, and SideWiki, and Wave.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:32.619
And maybe the best thing ever, we showed you
how to make the web more beautiful using the

00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:34.329
Google Font API.

00:48:34.329 --> 00:48:39.049
You can tell I'm particularly excited about
that one.

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:42.410
And, yeah, and all of these things, really,
anybody in this room can do this.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:43.410
I mean, this is copy and paste.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.279
You walk through the wizards.

00:48:45.279 --> 00:48:50.720
You shouldn't have to be a computer scientist
to do, you know, search, or content, or to

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.220
make money with your website.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.329
So Jeff and I are happy to take some questions
now.

00:48:55.329 --> 00:48:59.670
We have this Wave going right here at goo.gl/Ze99.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:07.689
We'll open it up, we'll take a look to see
if people had questions in the moderator.

00:49:07.689 --> 00:49:12.670
If you have questions for us and you're in
the room, please use the microphone.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.890
It'll make my mother happy when she watches
on YouTube.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.650
So great.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.650
Thank you everyone.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.710
Okay.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.309
[applause]

00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:29.150
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Where's the Wave?

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:30.150
Questions?

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.759
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Does anybody have any questions?

00:49:33.759 --> 00:49:34.759
Sir?

00:49:34.759 --> 00:49:39.700
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: So you can -- I think it's
really cool that you can add the Wave Element

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.700
to a web site.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.700
I haven't tried that yet, though.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.700
But the one thing I was worried about is,
like, what if somebody goes in and deletes

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.700
all the comments?

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.609
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Well, so Wave of course, is revision
based.

00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:46.609
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Yeah.

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:51.989
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And if you don't like something
that happens in the Wave, you can revert to

00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:54.799
any point in time very fine-grain revision
model.

00:49:54.799 --> 00:49:58.739
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: But, like, I mean, who's
going to be watching that and always reverting

00:49:58.739 --> 00:50:01.309
if people are vandalizing that?

00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:02.309
I dunno.
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Yeah.

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:03.309
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: It seems kinda hard.

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:04.309
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: I think that's a really good question.

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:08.439
I've had a couple public Waves that have evolved
over time and either they evolve into a community

00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:13.160
where a community of people actually keep
an eye on it or at some point you remove public

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.160
write access.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.160
You say, okay.

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.069
I do this with blog comments on my own site.

00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:20.490
After 30 days I shut out blog comments because
after that, it's mostly just spammers.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.979
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: What I think would be nice
is if people who post on it were able to make

00:50:25.979 --> 00:50:31.289
sure that other people don't modify their
comments, but I don't know.

00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.069
Like, if you had that same sort of user permission.

00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:34.239
Anyway.

00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:36.589
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Yeah.

00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:37.680
No argument from me.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:44.530
I know that the Wave team is giving a number
of talks over at Google I/O and you should

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:45.530
ask them about that.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:46.530
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Cool.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:47.530
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Thanks.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:51.089
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: So I was wondering if there
were plans to support Push within GWT.

00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:54.199
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Push within GWT.

00:50:54.199 --> 00:50:57.829
I think there are ways to do that but it's
interesting because it requires a server side

00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:58.829
component.

00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:59.829
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Right.

00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:01.099
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: So the Feed API is two things.

00:51:01.099 --> 00:51:04.069
It's a JavaScript client that we just showed
you.

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:09.519
So we showed you the interface that you would
work with as the developer but then that is

00:51:09.519 --> 00:51:16.890
making requests up to a server and the -- in
all honesty, the hard part is on the server

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:20.089
of managing, you know, large numbers of concurrent
connections.

00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:21.450
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:27.420
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: I -- the GWT guys are here this
week so we should ask them if they have any

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.789
server side components that they're working
with.

00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:33.170
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah. There's also, there's also,
there's also some details along those lines

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:42.390
with Bret's talks, the one we mentioned earlier,
if you wanna go to that.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:43.390
[pause]

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:45.269
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Hi.

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:49.529
With the Fonts API, is performance affected
with large amounts of text, or is it best

00:51:49.529 --> 00:51:50.529
used sparingly or –

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:53.769
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Well, if you hand the mic to the
guy to your right.

00:51:53.769 --> 00:51:54.769
[Laughing]

00:51:54.769 --> 00:51:55.950
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Yeah.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:58.440
The guy from the Fonts API team.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:51:59.869
&gt;&gt;Ray Flavine: I'm Ray Flavine.

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:04.930
I'm one of the engineers on the Fonts API
so feel free to see me after also with more

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:05.930
questions.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:12.459
But there's a small download for the font
itself that ranges from about 17K to over

00:52:12.459 --> 00:52:17.160
100K per font and then once that's downloaded
 -- and that's once per font.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.720
So no matter how many sites are using the
fonts that it should be downloaded once and

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.059
cached.

00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:25.719
Once it's in the browser, there really is
no performance impact.

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:32.029
You can do as much text as you like, you can
do body copy, huge amounts, and the performance

00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:35.769
should be about the same as for native fonts.

00:52:35.769 --> 00:52:40.850
Can I do the other two that are on the moderator?

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:41.850
They're great questions.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:42.850
What user web browsers?

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:45.839
We have not yet turned on support for mobile
web browsers.

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:49.869
That's very high up in our list.

00:52:49.869 --> 00:52:54.529
Again, it's mostly the download of 20 to 100K.

00:52:54.529 --> 00:52:57.969
Once it's there, again, the performance should
be pretty good.

00:52:57.969 --> 00:53:04.420
Also, we're only in western European Latin
one character set today but we expect that

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.049
to change pretty soon.

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:08.039
CJK is very challenging.

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:13.059
Those fonts can be up over a megabyte so we're
actively working on how to bring those down

00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:17.959
but expect cool new things with languages
in the next -- in the coming months.

00:53:17.959 --> 00:53:18.959
Thanks a lot.

00:53:18.959 --> 00:53:20.119
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Thank you.

00:53:20.119 --> 00:53:21.119
[applause]

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:24.369
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: That's gonna be hard to
follow.

00:53:24.369 --> 00:53:30.619
As a web site designer, where would you place
Buzz, versus SideWiki, versus Wave?

00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:31.969
What's the usage case?

00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:35.090
Why would I use one over the other?

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:40.969
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: The answer gets actually more complicated
today at 1:45 as we roll out read/write support

00:53:40.969 --> 00:53:41.969
for Google Buzz.

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:45.759
But you didn't hear it from me.

00:53:45.759 --> 00:53:51.079
Right now I would do something like I would
allow people -- I would definitely put a Google

00:53:51.079 --> 00:53:52.230
Buzz button on my site.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.440
I would want to syndicate that out.

00:53:54.440 --> 00:54:00.579
Over the long term, I hope that we see more
sites federating comments, Buzz style comments,

00:54:00.579 --> 00:54:02.920
using a protocol called "Salmon".

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.660
And then I would integrate Buzz-style comments
into either my existing comment feed or maybe

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:14.279
even more interesting, I would build a Buzz
robot that could speak Salmon and go pull

00:54:14.279 --> 00:54:16.349
in Buzz comments into a Wave.

00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:17.349
Sorry.

00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:18.349
Did I say that right?

00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:19.349
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah.

00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:21.279
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: I would build a Wave robot that
would pull in Buzz comments which I think

00:54:21.279 --> 00:54:22.279
would be very exciting.

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:27.869
Or you can do something like you saw the guys
at Read Write Web playing with which is use

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:30.789
a Wave as a commenting widget.

00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:35.549
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: One though there is that
with Wave you have that extra level of interactivity

00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:37.150
when you embed thaaat.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:43.640
I haven't done this yet so when you embed
that Wave, are you able to add in all that

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.429
level of interactivity throughout the map
or is it simply comments?

00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:47.429
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Yeah.

00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:52.109
The example we showed earlier actually on
the Read Write web post somebody actually

00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:54.239
added the pole gadget and everything.

00:54:54.239 --> 00:54:55.239
So yeah.

00:54:55.239 --> 00:55:00.109
All of the -- it's basically all the features
just embedded running right in Wave.

00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:08.140
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: It is a Wave in the page, a full
Wave.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.579
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Another web fonts question.

00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:10.579
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Yeah.

00:55:10.579 --> 00:55:14.119
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: If I heard you guys right,
you're talking about bringing web fonts to

00:55:14.119 --> 00:55:19.569
IE 6 with the Font API and so I'm wondering
what is the range of browsers that this will

00:55:19.569 --> 00:55:20.999
work with?

00:55:20.999 --> 00:55:22.439
&gt;&gt;Ray: Sure.

00:55:22.439 --> 00:55:29.900
It's IE 6 and up, it's Chrome since 4.0 which
shipped in January, it's Firefoz since 3.5,

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:38.880
it's Safari for over a year, Opera 10.5 is
 -- does work and I'm sure I've missed one

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:47.140
 -- I'm sure I missed one but we're at about
98 percent of the browsers that are actually

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.240
out there in the world.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.240
[pause]

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.400
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Good question.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.529
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: I have a question regarding
the autosuggest.

00:55:55.529 --> 00:55:58.150
Thank you for creating that autosuggest for
Google Custom Search.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:05.759
As a developer, I have been trying to add
a Custom Search autosuggest to my search box

00:56:05.759 --> 00:56:11.119
and I have been using jpeg3 but it doesn't
work that well.

00:56:11.119 --> 00:56:17.010
My question is, the autosuggest, can you specify
for a specific site so the autosuggest still

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:18.970
work on the site?

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:19.970
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Right.

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:20.970
Yeah.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:27.260
So the completions, the autocomplete data
is actually targeted for that Custom Search

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.260
Engine.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:38.759
So each one sort of grows its own set of autocompletions
and right now you can't specify your own,

00:56:38.759 --> 00:56:43.039
like, things that you would like to surface
but yeah.

00:56:43.039 --> 00:56:45.619
Over time, you know, it sort of grows.

00:56:45.619 --> 00:56:46.619
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Right.

00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:49.730
&gt;&gt;Jeff: And it is targeted to a specific Custom
Search Engine.

00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.589
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Thank you very much.

00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:55.619
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And also let us know if you want
more flexibility in the way that the autocompletions

00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:56.619
are done.

00:56:56.619 --> 00:57:01.809
Like you want to also populate it with your
own autocompletions.

00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:02.809
[pause]

00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:03.910
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Cool.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.890
Well, thank you all for coming.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:09.209
We really appreciate the opportunity to talk
about all these things.

00:57:09.209 --> 00:57:12.530
This'll be on YouTube and great seeing everyone.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.530
Thanks.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:13.760
[applause]
