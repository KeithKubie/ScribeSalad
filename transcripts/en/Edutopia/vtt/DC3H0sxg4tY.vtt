00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For most sixth
graders the day begins

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.876
with the shuffling of
paper and textbooks.

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:20.526
&gt;&gt;Beth: And then we're going
to put the weeds in a pile

00:00:20.556 --> 00:00:21.696
and take them to the compost.

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:23.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But In
this outdoor classroom

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:26.116
at Martin Luther King
Middle School in Berkeley,

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:29.636
California students spend
their first period planting.

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:31.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Put it in.

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:32.276
That's it.

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:32.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Harvesting.

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:33.706
&gt;&gt;Beth: Try that one.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And eating
organic delights

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:38.136
from their edible schoolyard.

00:00:38.136 --> 00:00:41.156
&gt;&gt;Beth: Boy these are
figs, don't tell anyone.

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:46.856
&gt;&gt;Esther: Look at this!

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:49.616
Now, where do you think
this came from?

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:49.906
&gt;&gt;Students: The garden.

00:00:49.906 --> 00:00:54.726
&gt;&gt;Esther: Right out there; so
we're making little pumpkin pies.

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:55.416
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The garden

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:59.376
and the adjacent kitchen classroom
are learning labs for social studies.

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:01.586
&gt;&gt;Esther: And this is
a variety from France.

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.746
The name of this is
"musique de Provence"

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.606
and that means the
"music of Provence".

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Math.

00:01:08.536 --> 00:01:10.896
&gt;&gt;Esther: If it calls for one and
one-half cups of cooked pumpkin

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:12.946
and we're doubling the recipe,
then how much do we need?

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:13.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Three.

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:14.466
&gt;&gt;Esther: Three.

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:14.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Science.

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:15.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Why is it wet?

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:17.156
&gt;&gt;Beth: We've just
been studying this.

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:19.376
&gt;&gt;Students: Oh yeah the
rain- Water, Oh yeah.

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:21.326
&gt;&gt;Beth: The water cycle;
what part of the water cycle?

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:22.196
Why are there droplets?

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Condensation.

00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:24.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And life.

00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:26.956
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're also going
to add some of the manure

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:27.976
from that pile over there.

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:29.836
&gt;&gt;Students: Ewwww.

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:33.316
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: When you watch these
kids in the garden classes you see

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:38.056
that the teachers just use every
little drop of water or dew

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:42.576
and every plant and
every bed to teach.

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:45.416
&gt;&gt;Beth: It likes each other because
it's attracted-- surface tension.

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:46.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Look at
the size of my drop!

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.016
&gt;&gt;Beth: We've been studying that
water molecules have a special bond

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:54.536
that creates surface tension
and so we've been doing a series

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:57.386
of experiments in the classroom
so it's nice to sort of see

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.276
if you can play with
it someplace else.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.816
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: It seems
effortless but it isn't.

00:02:02.096 --> 00:02:06.866
It's a high art, it's almost like
an artist who is a master violinist,

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:08.566
it takes years and years of practice.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:09.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You understand?

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.896
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: So this is where we come
in with the Center for Ecoliteracy.

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:16.206
We train teachers and it
takes a lot of preparation

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:20.496
to make the garden the center of
teaching, because what you see here,

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.676
is only part of it goes
on in the classroom.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Does anyone remember
why we turn the compost pile?

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:27.666
&gt;&gt;Hector: So the FBI
could breathe and stuff.

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:28.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's FBI?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:30.596
&gt;&gt;Hector: "F"...

00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:32.086
&gt;&gt;Student: Fungus.

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.736
&gt;&gt;Hector: The fungus,
bacteria, insects.

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:40.486
&gt;&gt;The compost, I like it because
there are a lot of bugs and stuff

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.916
and I didn't know like these little
leaves it's kind of like you turn it,

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:48.016
it kind of dries out and then like
about one month it kind of soil.

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:51.996
It becomes soil and we
learned the cycle of compost.

00:02:52.296 --> 00:02:55.076
First it becomes kind of a plant,
then it becomes kind of dry,

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:59.846
and the dry becomes kind of
soil, then it becomes soil

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:03.166
and then you grow something
and you start it over.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.736
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: They are learning first
of all the basics of ecology.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.176
They are learning about
photosynthesis,

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:14.706
the cycling of matter, the
diversity that supports resilience

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:19.016
of an ecosystem but what they
also learning is to cooperate,

00:03:19.376 --> 00:03:22.346
to do projects together,
to build community.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:29.496
Another important thing is that
the kid who is brilliant in math

00:03:29.496 --> 00:03:33.806
or science or languages will
not necessarily be brilliant

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:34.526
in gardening.

00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:39.066
And somebody who is not very
articulate but is very good

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:42.666
with her hands or his hands,
will be very happy in the garden

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.696
and will gain in prestige
among the class community.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:49.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So this is very hot,
be careful- Okay pour it all in;

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:52.046
now mix it together very quickly.

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:54.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The edible schoolyard
concept is the brainchild

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:58.976
of Alice Waters who runs the renowned
Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley.

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.036
&gt;&gt;Alice: I love them
when they're mixed in.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:05.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: She originally conceived
the garden back in 1994 as a way

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:07.596
to improve on school lunch programs.

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:12.366
&gt;&gt;Alice: This is a delicious
revolution that we're talking about.

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:13.726
This isn't hard to do.

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:18.056
If they grow it, they cook
it, they want to eat it

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:22.936
and that there's a whole
range of foods that kids love.

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:24.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You see
just making it hot,

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:27.046
just toasting it gives
it a different flavor.

00:04:28.056 --> 00:04:33.236
&gt;&gt;Alice: The kids have been
captivated by this experience

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:38.476
and you see them looking and smelling
and tasting and they don't think

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:44.866
that this is school, yet we know
what they're learning and it's very,

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:48.706
very fundamental, important
information.

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:51.726
They all know how to make
a vinaigrette for a salad.

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:55.876
They all know what it is to set
a table and to ask people to come

00:04:55.876 --> 00:05:00.446
and sit down and eat together
and talk at the table.

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:05.816
They're learning these values
of concentration and generosity.

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:08.146
&gt;&gt;Esther: Beautiful, I'm going
to bring it right over here.

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:08.626
Put it down.

00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:13.146
&gt;&gt;I think for our students the
biggest benefit is being able to come

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.146
to their senses literally.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:14.946
&gt;&gt;Student: It tastes like cinnamon,

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:17.856
it gives you like a warm feeling
right here when you eat it

00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:19.726
because it's nice and warm.

00:05:19.726 --> 00:05:21.166
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, just kind of inside.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:21.966
&gt;&gt;Student: It's really nice.

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:25.036
&gt;&gt;Esther: I think that it's
almost a sign of the times

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.626
that we have a program like this
to teach things that are so basic

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:30.966
that people used to learn at
home from their own families

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:34.466
and that's really not happening now,
and it's a very dangerous thing to be

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:36.696
that cut off from where
your food comes from,

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.876
knowing where it is grown, how did
it get to wherever you buy it from,

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:43.866
and it completes a circle
for a lot of students

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:47.746
who don't know the least little thing
about nature and farming and they get

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:50.566
to see that whole cycle and not
just see it, but make it happen.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:51.876
They're the ones that
are driving the garden.

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:54.746
They're the ones that come in and
make it all happen in the kitchen.

00:05:54.746 --> 00:05:57.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: For closing circle
the question is one word

00:05:57.786 --> 00:06:03.926
that describes your favorite
part of the garden this season.

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:04.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Harvest.

00:06:04.766 --> 00:06:06.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Growing everything.

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:10.676
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: In middle school
they are just at the transition

00:06:10.676 --> 00:06:13.866
between childhood and adolescence.

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:16.306
&gt;&gt;Student: The colors.

00:06:16.356 --> 00:06:16.606
&gt;&gt;Student: Flower.

00:06:16.606 --> 00:06:21.496
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: And there's still a lot of
the sense of magic in those children.

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:22.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Riding on a wheelbarrow.

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:26.506
&gt;&gt;Fritjof: And when they come to
the garden especially their garden

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:31.026
which they have planted and built
themselves they own that sense

00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:34.506
of magic and so it is a
very, very special place.

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:40.636
