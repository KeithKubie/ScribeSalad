00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.494
Okay, so we know that the allele for HD, Huntington's Disease, is dominant. And

00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:11.341
the allele for a normal brain, or NORM, is recessive. And remember, that the

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:14.940
recessive allele is masked by the dominant allele when you find them both

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.859
together. So we know in this situation with two normal alleles, that we're

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.630
going to have normal brain function. So this will not result in somebody with

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.128
Huntington's disease. On the other hand, we know that if you have two HD or

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:32.607
Huntington's Disease alleles, that you will definitely be affected by

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:39.810
Huntington's Disease. But what happens in our mixed group? Well, because our

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.296
dominate allele, HD masks the effect of the recessive allele, NORM. This

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:50.122
individual will also be affected by Huntington's Disease. So the answer is both

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:52.751
the first and the second scenario.
