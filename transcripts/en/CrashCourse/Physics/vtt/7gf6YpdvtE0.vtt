00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.080
When people say that Isaac Newton completely
transformed the field of physics, they really aren't kidding.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, we’ve already talked about his three laws
of motion, which we use to describe how things move.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.280
But another of Newton’s famous contributions
to physics was his understanding of gravity.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.860
When Newton was first starting out, scientists’
concept of gravity was pretty much nonexistent.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.550
I mean, they knew that when you dropped something, it fell to the ground, and from careful observation,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.720
they knew that planets and moons orbited in
a particular way.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.740
What they didn’t know was that those two
concepts were connected.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.570
Of course, just like with motion, we now know
that there’s a lot more to gravity than

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.600
what Newton was able to observe.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.140
Even so, when it comes to describing the effects
of gravity on the scale of, say, our solar system,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.289
Newton’s law of universal gravitation
is incredibly useful.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.789
And it all started with an apple.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.369
… Probably.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:01:01.380
[Theme Music]

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.760
Odds are, you’ve been told the story of
Newton’s apple at some point.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.710
The story goes that one day, he was sitting
under an apple tree in his mother’s garden,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.380
when an apple fell out of the tree.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.640
That’s when Newton had his grand realization:
Something was pulling that apple down to Earth.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.150
And that led to another idea: What if the apple
was pulling on Earth, too, but you just

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.540
couldn’t tell, because the effect of the
apple’s force on Earth was less obvious?

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.100
A few years later, Newton was sitting in the same garden when he had another stroke of inspiration:

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.940
What if the same force that pulled the apple
to the ground could affect things much farther

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.500
from Earth’s surface -- like the Moon?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.150
It was kind of counterintuitive, because the
Moon orbits Earth, instead of crashing straight

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.240
into the ground like an apple that falls off
a tree.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.900
But Newton realized that the Moon was still
being pulled toward Earth -- it was just moving

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.860
sideways so quickly that it kept missing.
That’s what was keeping it in orbit.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.060
If gravity was keeping the Moon in orbit, what if it affected the behavior of any two objects --

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.640
like a planet orbiting the
Sun?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.530
That’s the official version of the story
-- the one Newton himself used to tell.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.830
Most historians think he was embellishing at least
a little, but there probably is some truth to it.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.390
Whether or not the thing with the apple actually
happened, Newton thought his idea seemed promising.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.750
The idea that gravity might affect everything, including
the orbits of other planets and moons.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.760
So he started looking for an equation that
would accurately describe the way the gravitational force made objects behave --

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.820
whether it was an apple falling on the ground, or the Moon orbiting Earth.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.130
Newton knew that however this gravitational
force worked, it would probably behave like

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.290
any other net force on an object -- it would
be equal to that object’s mass, times its acceleration.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.610
The mass part was easy enough -- it would
just be the mass of the apple or the Moon.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.320
It was going to be a little harder to figure
out the factors that were affecting the acceleration part of the equation.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.510
The first thing Newton realized he’d have
to take into account was distance.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.840
When an object is close to the Earth’s surface,
like an apple in a tree, gravity makes it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.220
accelerate at about 10 meters per second squared.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.630
But the Moon has an acceleration that’s
only about a 3600th of that falling apple.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.520
The Moon also happens to be about 60 times
as far from the center of Earth as that apple would be --

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.140
and 60 squared is 3600.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.600
So Newton figured that the gravitational force
between two objects must get smaller the farther apart they are.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.010
More specifically, it must depend on the distance
between the two objects squared.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.260
Then there was mass.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.250
Not the mass of the apple or the Moon -- the
mass of the other object involved in the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.660
gravitational dance: in this case, Earth.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.370
Newton realized that the greater the masses
of the two objects pulling on each other,

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.840
the stronger the gravitational force would
be between them.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.780
Once he’d taken into account the distance
between two objects, and their masses,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.580
Newton had most of his equation for
the way gravity behaved:

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.400
The gravitational force was proportional to
the mass of the two objects multiplied together,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.480
divided by the square of the distance between
them.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.860
But it had to be a lot smaller, or else you’d see a force
pulling together most everyday objects.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.240
Like, that Rubik’s cube is staying right where it is instead of being pulled towards me.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.180
So the gravitational force between us
must be very small.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.670
So Newton added a constant to his equation
-- a very small number that would make the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.710
gravitational force just a tiny fraction of
what you’d calculate otherwise.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.920
He called it G.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.180
And he called this full equation, F = GMm/r^2,
the law of universal gravitation.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.550
Newton had no idea what number big G would
be, though. He just knew it would be a tiny

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.770
number, and put the letter G into his equation
as a placeholder.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.470
About a century later, Henry Cavendish, another
British scientist, made careful measurements

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.060
with some of the most sensitive instruments
of the time, and figured out that G was equal

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.760
to about 6.67 * 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.500
So indeed, Newton was right about big G having
to be quite small.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.690
But even though he didn’t know the exact
value of big G at the time,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.850
Newton had enough to establish his law
of universal gravitation.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.800
He described gravity as a force between any 2 objects, and published his equation for calculating that force.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.760
Then Newton took things a step further -- well,
technically three steps further.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.280
About 50 years earlier, an astronomer named
Johannes Kepler had come up with three laws

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.270
that described the way orbits worked.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.400
And those predictions almost perfectly matched
the orbits that astronomers were seeing in the sky.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.400
So, Newton knew that his law of universal
gravitation had to fit with Kepler’s laws,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.050
or he’d have to find some way to explain
why Kepler was wrong.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.270
Luckily for Newton, his law of gravitation
not only fit with Kepler’s laws,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.790
he was able to use it, in combination with his
three laws of motion and calculus, to prove Kepler’s laws.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.110
According to Kepler, the orbits of the planets
were ellipses -- as opposed to circles --

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.440
with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse -- one
of the two central points used to describe how the ellipse curves.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.300
And that’s what’s known as Kepler’s first
law, and it actually applies to any elliptical

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.520
orbit -- not just those of the planets.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.699
Our moon’s orbit around Earth is also an
ellipse, and Earth is at one focus of that ellipse.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.080
Kepler’s second law was that if you draw
a line from a planet to the sun, it’ll always

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.669
sweep out the same-sized area within a given
amount of time.

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.680
When Earth is at its farthest point from the
Sun, for example, over the course of one day

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.320
we’ll have covered an area that looks like
a very long, very thin, kinda-lopsided pizza slice.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.120
And when we’re at our closest point to the
Sun, one day’s worth of the orbit will sweep

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.009
out an area that’s more like a short, fat
pizza slice.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.289
Kepler’s second law tells us that if we
measure them both, those two pizza slices

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.180
will have the exact same area.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.540
His third law is a little more technical,
but it’s basically an observation about

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.259
what happens when you take the longest -- or
semimajor -- radius of a planet’s orbit

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.259
and cube it, then divide that by the period
of the planet’s orbit, squared.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.520
According to Kepler, that ratio should be
the same for every single planet --

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.260
and now we know that it is, almost exactly.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.449
For every single planet that orbits our Sun,
that ratio is either 3.34 or 3.35.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.699
And! Newton was able to explain why the actual,
observed orbits in the night sky sometimes

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.779
deviated very slightly from Kepler’s predictions
-- for example, by having those slightly different ratios.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.520
What Kepler didn’t know, and Newton figured
out, was that the planets and moons were all

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.680
pulling on each other, and sometimes, that
pull was strong enough to change their orbits just a little bit.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.300
There’s one more thing we should point out
about Newton’s law of universal gravitation,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.860
which is that it fits what we expect the equation
for a net force should look like, according to Newton.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.360
From Newton’s second law of motion, we know
that a net force is equal to mass times acceleration.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.259
What the law of universal gravitation is saying,
is that when the net force acting on an object

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:13.419
comes from gravity, the acceleration is equal
to the mass of the bigger object -- like Earth --

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.740
divided by the distance between the
two objects, times big G.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.040
So, you know how we’ve been describing the gravitational acceleration at Earth’s surface as small g?

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.440
Well, small g is actually equal to big G,
times Earth’s mass, divided by Earth’s radius, squared.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.780
...math!

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.860
And we can use this equation for gravitational
acceleration to help NASA out with a challenge

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.669
they’re grappling with right now.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.340
We want to send humans to Mars. But we have
to make sure that their spacesuits will work

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.100
properly in Martian gravity.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.040
One way that NASA tests spacesuits is by
flying astronauts on special planes --

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.880
sometimes called Vomit Comets.

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.430
They fly in arcs that let the spacesuit-testers
experience reduced weight -- or none at all

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.780
-- for short periods of time.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.050
To simulate Martian gravity, the flight plan
will need to aim for the gravitational acceleration

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.710
you’d experience if you started hopping
around on the surface of Mars.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.419
So, what would that acceleration be?

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.080
Well, from Newton’s law of universal gravitation,
we know that the acceleration of stuff at

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:12.240
Mars’s surface would be equal to big G,
times the mass of Mars, divided by Mars’s radius squared.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.520
We also happen to know Mars’s mass and radius
already, which ... helps.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.320
So, plugging in the numbers, we can calculate the gravitational acceleration at Mars’s surface:

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.460
it should be about 3.7 meters per
second squared.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.880
That’s the acceleration you’d experience on Mars, and what the Vomit Comet pilots try to attain when they fly --

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.620
about 38% of the acceleration that you experience when you jump off the ground here on Earth.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.060
So, hundreds of years after Newton’s day,
NASA is still using his math.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.099
Yeah, I’d say he was a pretty big deal.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:44.719
Today, you learned about how Newton
came up with his law of universal gravitation.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.400
We also talked about Kepler’s three laws, and calculated the gravitational acceleration on the surface of Mars.
