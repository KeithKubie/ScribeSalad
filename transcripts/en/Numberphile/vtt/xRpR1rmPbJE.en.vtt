00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
I want to talk about slide rules, this is
a slide rule, but to explain what it is

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:13.880
So what we have is a classic old school Faber-Castell slide rule. Anyone who is over 50 or

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.779
maybe over 60 would have had to learn to use
one of these at school and actually the

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.130
use of mathematics for the previous
three hundred odd years required the use of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.699
this and you could say that every single
scientific invention oh you know through

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.370
the age of enlightenment through the
nineteenth century and the 20th century

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.070
would have relied at some level

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.000
on ease of calculation through use of the slide rule

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
and these are only a few out of the wide

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.000
variety of problems that can be worked
with the standard slide rule

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.920
this is what scientists had

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.890
so it was shorthand for being a scientist and it's
so wonderfully nerdy and I think that

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.390
the nerds were like yeah this is this is our this is our sword you know it's a light saber

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.720
its actually rather lovely

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.960
the way this moves in and out it's so beautifully done
this instrument is actually really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
pleasurable just going like this here with a slide rule it's not like a calculator

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.229
it's not digital you don't get the exact
answer you get an approximate answer but

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.409
normally within two to three significant
figures which

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.280
should usually be enough for the job that you're trying to do

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.320
we have one of these scales on the top line here "A" which is the top line

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.380
we have another identical scale underneath it on "B" so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.840
there are lots of different types of scales here but I'm just going to be using "A" and "B"

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.900
"A" is this one here
"B" is underneath it

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.480
let's say we want to multiply three times four

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.020
we look at "A" and we go to where three is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.820
and we put the bottom one at one where three is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.580
then we go up four and then we read where four is on the original one and you can see four is at twelve

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.360
because it's ten eleven twelve

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.640
just say we do something else as let's say
this is something more complicated

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.080
seven is a complication number let's multiply seven by seven

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.200
seven squared

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.480
so we put the number one at seven here

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.360
and we go up to seven at the bottom one

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940
and it exactly comes up to forty-nine so that's cool

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.880
so what logarithms do and what this is a physical interpretation of

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.640
is that they change multiplication into addition

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.890
so we're multiplying two things but actually we're just adding two lengths

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.480
the reason why this is useful obviously seven times seven we know that in our heads

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.680
just say we wanted to multiply 2345 times 6457

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.220
ok what we do

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.900
we turn that into 2.345 times 6.457 and let's do the sums

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440
so we go to 2.345

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.480
2.345

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.480
it's probably about there

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.560
and we got here at 6.457

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.420
6.457

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.360
and that is

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560
that's almost exactly 15

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.220
ok so get rid of our things

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.460
that would tell me within a few seconds that 2345 times 6457 is 15 million

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.240
and why don't we just check that

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.500
...457 equals wow

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.520
the real answer 15,141,665

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.100
this gives us a handy idea of what the answer's going to be

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.260
multiplication is addition so division is
subtraction

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.960
so let's say we want to divide 20 by 3

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.580
we go to 20 and we basically just need to take away 3

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.640
so we put 3 where the 20 is there

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.440
and go down to 1

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.540
and where is 1 we use our hairline here

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.540
oh look it's 6

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.760
between 6.6 and 6.7

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.140
this is something which is quite cool and fun and a bit of a historical relic

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.380
but it's not a particularly beautiful thing

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.560
unlike my other slide rule my prized possession

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.560
and this is the Halden Calculex

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.040
ok I'm going to open it is from 1906 and it
comes almost like you know

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.580
like I'm proposing marriage to you

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.840
that I'm getting down on my bended knee and giving you a Halden Calculex

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.440
will you be my mathematical bride

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.440
so what this is is it is a circular slide rule

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.260
here we have the logarithmic scale along a line

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.300
in a circular slide rule it's in a circle

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.380
now let's put that down for a second

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.260
this comes with this fantastic sort of set of instructions

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.920
the thing is not that many people collect mathematical instruments and so you get probably get loads of

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.240
you know this might have been found by someone just clearing out their attic didn't know what it was

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.680
like it can't have been more than a few dozen dollars

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.900
so revised rules tables and formulae for the Halden Calculex

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.720
which is a circular slide rule

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.420
this is just wonderful absolutely wonderful

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.520
price one over six that's a penny isn't it I don't know I'm too young even though I'm old to understand old English

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.600
I'm going to read you a story

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.920
although the ordinary slide rule is usually acknowledged to be a most useful and reliable instrument

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.480
it has one or two great disadvantages

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.120
for instance it is a most inconvenient article to carry about in one's pocket

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.820
also in the hands of the average user it is rendered almost useless for any unusual calculation

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.720
so in other words you couldn't put this in a pocket and it's not very elegant

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.700
on the other hand the Halden Calculex is beautiful it's like a pocket watch

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.340
and it's something that if you ever needed to do fast approximate analogue calculations on the fly

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.960
and it was 1906 you could whisk this out

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.560
here there are two moving parts there is

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.960
you're moving this logarithmic scale against the top one so two sides

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.400
and you've got the hairline

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.200
here you can move the middle one

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.020
and you've got the hairline

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.180
so again there are lots of different scales for doing lots of different things

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.200
I'm just going to concentrate on multiplication and division

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.040
so just say again we wanted to say

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.440
do 4 times 5

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.860
and we can see if you can see close up

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.210
we know it's 20 and it's on 20

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.870
this is lovely this thing what do you do with this

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.600
what do you do you do calculations

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
but what do you do with it

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.640
I sort of take it out and stroke it and polish it and put it up there and talk to it

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.060
quite a lot of times things are just made for being functional

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.080
and this is something which is not only functional it is a rather beautiful object

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:39.040
and it's you could say it's a kind of iPhone of the early English 20th century

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.700
because this is the height of technology packaged with beauty
