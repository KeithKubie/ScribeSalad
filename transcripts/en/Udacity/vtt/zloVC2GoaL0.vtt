00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.700
As we discussed earlier in this lesson, a data

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.640
scientist needs to have substantive expertise. What does that mean?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.180
Well typically it means that a data scientist knows

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.300
which questions to ask, can interpret the data well and

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.980
understands the structure of the data. You can imagine

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070
that a data scientist needs to know about the problem

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.665
that solving. For example, if you are solving an

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:25.200
on-line advertising problem, you want to make sure you understand what

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.450
types of people are coming to your website. How they are

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.790
interacting with the website and what different data means that can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.410
help you ask the right questions like, Are people falling off

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.090
and not completing our ads at a certain point in the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.340
flow, or do people complete more ads at a certain time

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.250
of the day? You would also, then, be very familiar with

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.820
how the data is stored and structured. And that could help

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.540
you work more efficiently and more effectively. This is why it's important

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.850
for a data scientist to have substantive expertise. It's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.980
important to note that data scientists usually work in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.410
teams. So it's normal for data scientists to be

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.090
stronger in some areas and weaker in others. So even

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.740
if you, as a data scientist, don't have a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.220
tons of substantive expertise, if you have great hacking

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.670
skills or know a lot of statistics you can

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.860
still be a valuable member of a data science team.
