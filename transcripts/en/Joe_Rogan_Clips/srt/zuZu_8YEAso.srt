1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,070
I know Robbie was angling
for a fight with Darren till,

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:06,000
but after Mazda all start steering until,
which was the nasty man.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,860
People sleep a Mazda though. They do or
do not know why I don't understand it.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,480
Go back and watch those backyard fights.
That guy's been going at it a long time.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,030
Hey man,

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,030
any man that's [inaudible]
to both backyard but he
just had again this weekend.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,620
Yeah, I know. That was crazy.
It's not about, it's about, um,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,830
you know, you can't just
talk like nowadays this era,

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,870
you could just say whatever you feel
like you could say what you want because

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:37,560
he's social media. You want to get
fans on your side and this and that.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,540
And he just happened to say it to
the wrong guy at the wrong time.

12
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,050
Like that. That's the situation.
And you did it backstage to massive.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,060
Don't give a fuck. Like
know mutual. I think I,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,290
I think it's mutual respect with me
and mass with all, like I respect him,

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,800
you know? I mean if we have to fight,
we have to fight one day, but you know,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,520
like we feel the same when it's like if
you're going to talk shit online when I

17
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,600
see you keep the same energy.
Like when I saw Ben asks went backstage,

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,960
the only thing that stopped me from
pushing his head through that wall back

19
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,121
there,

20
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:14,250
it was the fact that I almost blacked
out blacktop when I was walking towards

21
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,020
him. Then I realize Dana was
right behind. So you were angry.

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,940
It wasn't that I was angry. It was the
fact that Bro, like if you're, you're,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,170
you came at me online like you
had a problem with me. Like you,

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,830
she started talking mad shit to me.
Like you had a problem like saying things,

25
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,100
putting up memes and all this.
To me that means like you have a problem.

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,380
I don't know what I did to you,
but you've got a problem with me.

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,040
So when I see you now, like I want
you to still have that same energy.

28
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,580
Don't just act like we're cool. Like
what's up bro? Yo, you want to hug it out.

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,690
Don't act like that. Act like you
still have the problem. Same problem.

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,390
Well you think he's just trying to
mark it. I mean Ben not ever happens.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,600
That's fun. Anger, that's attitude
towards that. But that's what I'm saying.

32
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,121
That's the thing.

33
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,790
Like people are kind of letting
them off for certain things now.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,660
Now what happens if mass for dog
would have starts him like that? Yeah.

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,540
Backstage because he did talk shit to
what happened if that was him mass for it

36
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,520
all starts like that. What
happens? Yeah. You know,

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,730
so that was my thing is I,
when I saw him backstage,

38
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,940
I almost wanted to push his
head through the wall, you know,

39
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:22,290
but not realize Dana's behind me. Brian's
mind. What happens if it all now in uh,

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,470
in, in England because they don't like
that shit over there. I don't know why,

41
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,390
but I think he got away free
Scot free. Really? I think,

42
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:32,700
I know I haven't heard
anything and everything's
fine. He's in the back already.

43
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,300
That's hilarious. But that's the
case cause that's a salt. Yeah.

44
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,740
But I mean,
I guess you could say it's hard.

45
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,630
It's hard to say assault when you're
dealing with UFC fighter. Right.

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,260
It's so hard.
Like he played basketball off the cob.

47
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,080
Solutely it's hard to say this. It's
a tricky, tricky situation. Right,

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,410
but he struck him out in the parking lot.
Yeah,

49
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,920
I have to a baseball game but I think
data and then Dana put out a statement

50
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,500
saying that that can't happen anymore. We
got to do a better, something like that.

51
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,400
We should do a better job of having
security around two separate guys.

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,320
They didn't know.
My father didn't let me near.

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,230
Ben Asked when or a core cold dead. Yes.
There was one time, not before this fight,

54
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,670
but before previous fight where you
were backstage. It was actually,

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,350
was it a press conference?

56
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:23,810
It was press conference and
you were trying to talk to
Colby. Like what's up man,

57
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,560
I'll schedule it. Yeah. I was scheduled
to fight Santiago [inaudible] in balls.

58
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,270
That's right.

59
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,440
And we were doing a big press conference
and they happened to have like,

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,200
I didn't even know he
was there cause they hit,

61
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,630
they had them hidden away the whole time.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,260
It wasn't until you are going to get on
the bus to go to the press conference.

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,710
He came downstairs like
we were all meeting in the
lobby and I saw him and right

64
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:48,520
away I told her, I said, I don't know
what it is. I just, I stopped my boy.

65
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,370
I just started your blood.
My blood just started bawling.

66
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:54,740
I started duct to a read. I
was, I read man, that's not
gonna work. That's not work.

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,310
You'll, you got moving, reuse.
Like we're getting him right now.

68
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,920
We're moving and read, put it, puts
him in a different car and every,

69
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,350
all the other fighters ride together.
And this is what I mean,

70
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,110
he's already isolated. That's
so fun. So we get there,

71
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,600
but we have to line up to walk out.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,200
So he's lined up and he's just happened
to be in my vicinity and I just free,

73
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,070
I was trying and I was like,
yeah, I'm not going to say,

74
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm not going to say I'm not gonna
say nothing. I just look at him. Yo,

75
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,760
I see you was talking all that
shit online now. Now we in person,

76
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,460
you can't talk. What's up with all
that shit you was talking online,

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,780
you thought she was tough.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,410
What's up with that was that
tough guy now and he's just like,

79
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,380
I think he was reading his lines like
what he was going to say when he got out

80
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:39,940
there and Prescott, he uses like Wheaton
and he heard me and he's like, shit,

81
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,030
I don't want to say nothing. Shit. I
could get my eyes. What bright here.

82
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,243
I don't want to do that.

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,150
And I could say all those thoughts was
contemplating and Whitaker was standing

84
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,570
next to him and Whitaker does one
of these joint like look around,

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,040
fuck this dude talking to,

86
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,630
cause I had to watch the video over
and over where it could look bad.

87
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,830
Like he ain't talking to me
and then saw Kobe is like,

88
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,000
oh he's talking to Kolby.

89
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:08,920
So Winokur just kindly slid off
to the side and I'm getting,

90
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:13,150
I'm like, what's up with all that shit
you was talking. And then he's like quiet,

91
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:13,690
quiet.

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,690
And then he sees the security kind of
cause then they heard me and security kind

93
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,320
of walks. I didn't even know
there was a camera back there. Uh,

94
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,890
and then security walks up and security's
like, Yo, Yo, no, no, we don't need this.

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,830
We don't need this. And this was, uh,

96
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,710
what press con Kobi was about to fight.

97
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,330
This was after that Conor.
Khabib bus situation. Yes.

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,390
And so they're like, Yo, who don't need
this this week. We don't need this.

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,850
And now once this security,
he goes, he goes, stick,

100
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,930
stick to stick to a network. Television
Junior. Stick to this boy. You know,

101
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,120
I'm like network television.
What does that mean?

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,380
Because I guess he was fighting in
his first fight on now on paper view.

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,980
But this is the thing,
you were on Fox. Yeah.

104
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,760
But this is the thing is he had
never headline of car. To this day,

105
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,380
I don't think he's ever
headlined the card.
