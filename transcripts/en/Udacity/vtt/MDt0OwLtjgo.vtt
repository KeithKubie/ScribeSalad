00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And here's my answer. It's a one-liner.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A bid in an array of 1000 things, and this is the beauty of Python.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's ways to make it more complicated as it is before in the variance case.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now this is a little bit more compact. So I ran the test random.random larger than 0.5.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And this thing over here gives me the true or false and I want to do this 1000 times.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And doing this 1000 times invokes this command for x in range (N) where N is 1000

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and range N becomes a list of 0 to 999.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This will go 1000 times of different x's.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The x's that we've used here because the random coin flip

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
doesn't understand what the order of the coin flip is.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They're the same every single time but this just means I ran this procedure over here 1000 times,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
collected the results in the bracketed list, and returned it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Specifically, if we were to print out f and hit the run button then what I get is the stuff down here.

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
A list of 1000 items of false, true, and false. It makes for a beautiful wallpaper, doesn't it.
