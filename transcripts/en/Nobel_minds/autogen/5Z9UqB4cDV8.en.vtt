he started to work on this in the late
 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.910
he started to work on this in the late
1950s and initially he was studying

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920
1950s and initially he was studying
 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.830
1950s and initially he was studying
female and male germ cells in animals

process there but already during the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159
process there but already during the
 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.120
process there but already during the
light late 950 s realized that much what

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130
light late 950 s realized that much what
 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.389
light late 950 s realized that much what
he knew could perhaps be used to treat

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399
he knew could perhaps be used to treat
 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.929
he knew could perhaps be used to treat

the end of 95 90 50s he had a vision

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250
the end of 95 90 50s he had a vision
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.670
the end of 95 90 50s he had a vision
that he could use his knowledge and

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680
that he could use his knowledge and
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920
that he could use his knowledge and
other's knowledge to transform this into

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930
other's knowledge to transform this into
 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.830
other's knowledge to transform this into
a method to treat infertility and the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840
a method to treat infertility and the
 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.690
a method to treat infertility and the
first thing he actually did was to find

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
first thing he actually did was to find
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.569
first thing he actually did was to find
out how human Oh sites could be measured

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579
out how human Oh sites could be measured
 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.349
out how human Oh sites could be measured
in vitro and he during a ten year period

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359
in vitro and he during a ten year period
 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.870
in vitro and he during a ten year period
he showed step-by-step that it could be

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
he showed step-by-step that it could be
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.789
he showed step-by-step that it could be
maturity that is you took out through a

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799
maturity that is you took out through a
 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.609
maturity that is you took out through a
surgical procedure you took out a mature

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619
surgical procedure you took out a mature
 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.649
surgical procedure you took out a mature
oocyte from the women you let them

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659
oocyte from the women you let them
 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.649
oocyte from the women you let them
mature in vitro and in the end you could

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659
mature in vitro and in the end you could
 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.870
mature in vitro and in the end you could
give them sperm and he could show and it

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880
give them sperm and he could show and it
 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160
give them sperm and he could show and it
was the first to show that you could

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
was the first to show that you could
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.130
was the first to show that you could
actually need to fertilize those sites

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
actually need to fertilize those sites
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.260
actually need to fertilize those sites
that been in matured in vitro

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270
that been in matured in vitro
 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.930
that been in matured in vitro
outside the body

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
outside the body
 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.720
outside the body
so at that time point was a major

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
so at that time point was a major
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.350
so at that time point was a major
success to happen in 1969 it was in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360
success to happen in 1969 it was in
 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.520
success to happen in 1969 it was in
media all over the world it was a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
media all over the world it was a
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.400
media all over the world it was a
fantastic success in that sense however

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410
fantastic success in that sense however
 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.040
fantastic success in that sense however
he also came to the realization that the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
he also came to the realization that the
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.790
he also came to the realization that the
in-vitro Machado site was a bit fragile

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800
in-vitro Machado site was a bit fragile
 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.190
in-vitro Machado site was a bit fragile
so he decided to shift focus and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
so he decided to shift focus and
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.980
so he decided to shift focus and
initiate in collaboration with a very

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
initiate in collaboration with a very
 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.230
initiate in collaboration with a very
skilled obstetrician and gynecologist

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240
skilled obstetrician and gynecologist
 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.330
skilled obstetrician and gynecologist
dr. Patrick Steptoe that unfortunately

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
dr. Patrick Steptoe that unfortunately
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.130
dr. Patrick Steptoe that unfortunately
died in 1988 and together with him he he

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140
died in 1988 and together with him he he
 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.220
died in 1988 and together with him he he
were able to retrieve maturer sites

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230
were able to retrieve maturer sites
 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.040
were able to retrieve maturer sites
instead of immature sites and having

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050
instead of immature sites and having
 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.680
instead of immature sites and having
access to these mature sites he could

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
access to these mature sites he could
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.260
access to these mature sites he could
then start over again by indeed by

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270
then start over again by indeed by
 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.450
then start over again by indeed by
fertilizing those in a cell culture dish

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460
fertilizing those in a cell culture dish
 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.780
fertilizing those in a cell culture dish
and then in this particular case he

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
and then in this particular case he
 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.580
and then in this particular case he
could see that he formed early embryos

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590
could see that he formed early embryos
 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.210
could see that he formed early embryos
and that was coming close to the end of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220
and that was coming close to the end of
 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.730
and that was coming close to the end of
his vision because now not a few years

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740
his vision because now not a few years
 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.610
his vision because now not a few years
later his method and resulted in the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
later his method and resulted in the
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.860
later his method and resulted in the
birth of the first IVF child Grace Brown

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
birth of the first IVF child Grace Brown
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.380
birth of the first IVF child Grace Brown
and when was that that was in 1978 and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390
and when was that that was in 1978 and
 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.620
and when was that that was in 1978 and
so that was a great breakthrough so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630
so that was a great breakthrough so
 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.180
so that was a great breakthrough so
where are we now with life via therapy

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
where are we now with life via therapy
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.040
where are we now with life via therapy
how prevalent is it and how successful

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050
how prevalent is it and how successful
 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.790
how prevalent is it and how successful
is it nowadays depending on the country

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800
is it nowadays depending on the country
 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.740
is it nowadays depending on the country
you look at it varies from country to

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750
you look at it varies from country to
 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.530
you look at it varies from country to
country how much the IVF is used but if

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540
country how much the IVF is used but if
 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300
country how much the IVF is used but if
you look in in the Western countries or

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
you look in in the Western countries or
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.490
you look in in the Western countries or
in developed countries between one to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
in developed countries between one to
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.280
in developed countries between one to
five percent of the children born or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290
five percent of the children born or
 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.229
five percent of the children born or
through IVF and so IVF is more of a

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239
through IVF and so IVF is more of a
 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.150
through IVF and so IVF is more of a
clinical procedure and traditionally or

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160
clinical procedure and traditionally or
 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.650
clinical procedure and traditionally or
more often than not the medicine prize

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660
more often than not the medicine prize
 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.530
more often than not the medicine prize
goes to more basic research where does

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
goes to more basic research where does
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.470
goes to more basic research where does
IVF therapy fits within all the other

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480
IVF therapy fits within all the other
 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.910
IVF therapy fits within all the other
prizes that have been awarded the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920
prizes that have been awarded the
 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.979
prizes that have been awarded the
