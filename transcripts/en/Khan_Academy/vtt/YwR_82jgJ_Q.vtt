00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:02.510
- [Instructor] So we have listed here

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.394
are two significant properties
of indefinite integrals.

00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:07.718
And we will see in the future

00:00:07.718 --> 00:00:09.276
that they are very, very powerful.

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.283
All this is saying is
the indefinite integral

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.218
of the sum of two different functions

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:19.880
is equal to the sum of
the indefinite integral

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.789
of each of those functions.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.008
This one right over here
says the indefinite integral

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.065
of a constant, that's not
gonna be a function of x,

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.879
of a constant times f
of x is the same thing

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.046
as the constant times the
indefinite integral of f of x.

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:38.452
So one way to think about it is

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:41.178
we took the constant out of the integral,

00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:42.256
which we'll see in the future,

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.777
both of these are very useful techniques.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:48.365
Now, if you're satisfied with
them as they are written,

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:50.110
then that's fine, you can move on.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.125
If you want a little bit of a proof,

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.191
what I'm gonna do is take the derivative

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:57.417
of both sides of this equation
and use derivative properties

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.931
to show that their
derivatives are the same.

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.324
So let's do that.

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:04.476
And from there, you know,
especially when you're taking

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:06.643
with indefinite integrals.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.115
What I'm going to do
here to give an argument

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.888
for why this is true is use
the derivative properties.

00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:14.737
Take the derivative of both sides

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:18.137
and see that the equality holds

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:20.887
once we get rid of the integrals.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.647
So let's do that.

00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:29.353
Let's take the derivative
with respect to x

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.436
of both sides of this.

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.853
Derivative with respect to x.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.326
The left side here, well,
this will just become

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.976
whatever's inside the indefinite integral.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.309
This will just become f of x

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:45.384
plus g of x

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:47.557
plus g of x.

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:52.137
Now what would this become?

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:54.439
Well, we could just go to
our derivative properties.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.945
The derivative of the sum of two things,

00:01:56.945 --> 00:02:00.090
that's just the same thing as
the sum of the derivatives.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.379
So this'll be a little bit lengthy.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.558
So this is going to be the
derivative with respect to x

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.439
of this first part plus the
derivative with respect to x

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.106
of this second part.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:15.405
So this first part is the
integral of f of x dx,

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:16.630
we're gonna add it.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.492
And this is the integral of g of x dx.

00:02:19.492 --> 00:02:20.924
So let met write it down.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.424
This is f of x and then this is g of x.

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:28.238
Now, what are these things?

00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:30.641
Well, these things, let me
just write this equal sign

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:31.934
right over here.

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.198
So then this is going to be equal to

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:35.117
the derivative of this with respect to x

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:37.538
is just going to be f of x.

00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:39.877
And then the derivative
with respect to here

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:42.127
is just going to be g of x.

00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:45.858
And this is obviously true.

00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:47.745
So now let's tackle this.

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.376
Well, let's just do the same thing.

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:53.248
Let's take the derivative of both sides.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:57.267
So the derivative with
respect to x of that

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.666
and the derivative with
respect to x of that.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:05.833
So the left-hand side will
clearly become c times f of x.

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.632
The right-hand side is going to become,

00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.996
well, we know from our
derivative properties,

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:16.734
the derivative of a
constant times something

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:20.799
is the same thing as the
constant times the derivative

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.299
of that something.

00:03:23.307 --> 00:03:25.611
So then we have the integral,

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:28.611
indefinite integral of f of x dx.

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.339
And then this thing is
just going to be f of x.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:36.506
So this is all going to be
equal to c times f of x.

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.457
So once again, you can see that
the equality clearly holds.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:43.835
So hopefully this makes you feel good

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:45.110
that those properties are true.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.210
But the more important thing
is you know when to use it.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.527
So, for example, if I were
to take the integral of,

00:03:52.527 --> 00:03:54.860
let's say, x squared plus

00:03:57.185 --> 00:04:00.573
cosine of x, the indefinite
integral of that,

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.024
we now know it's going to
be useful in the future.

00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:04.423
Say, well, this is the same thing

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:06.399
as the integral of x squared dx

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.457
plus the integral of cosine of x dx.

00:04:10.457 --> 00:04:14.124
So this is the same
thing as that plus that.

00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.408
Then you can separately evaluate them.

00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:21.733
And this is helpful, because
we know that if we are trying

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.233
to figure out the integral of,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.013
let's say, pi times

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:30.265
sine of x dx,

00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:36.547
then we can take this constant out.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.771
Pi is in no way dependent on x,

00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:40.781
it's just going to stay be equal to pi.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.985
So we can take it out and
that is going to be equal

00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:46.152
to pi times the integral of sine of x.

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:50.381
Two very useful properties,

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:54.548
and hopefully you feel a lot
better about them both now.
