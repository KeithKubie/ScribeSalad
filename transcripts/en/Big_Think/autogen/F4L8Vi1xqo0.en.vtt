you know that almost history started and
knew that it was a new era and therefore

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409
knew that it was a new era and therefore
 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.059

qualification and therefore the way I've
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.550
qualification and therefore the way I've
tended to look at it is to try to make

which I've done but archive based
research requires you to get really into

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359
research requires you to get really into
 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.680
research requires you to get really into
the detail of particular policies and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690
the detail of particular policies and
 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.990

looking back and I'm really thought
 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.330
looking back and I'm really thought
about it until you posed the question

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340
about it until you posed the question
 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.619
