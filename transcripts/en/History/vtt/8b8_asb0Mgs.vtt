00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.040
- On July 7, 1947, at Edwards
Airforce Space

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.380
then called Muroc Air Base--

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.710
Major JC Wise was sitting
his XP-84 fighter jet

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.120
experimental aircraft
when he noticed

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.620
that people on the
ground were watching

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.830
an object off in the distance.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.250
He looked and saw a bright,
spinning, yellow object

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.580
about 10,000 feet in
the air that was a ball

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.080
of about 5 to 10 feet diameter.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.750
[music playing]

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.380
After the sighting,
it was actually

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.580
required that all officers
fill out a form if they

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.920
saw anything that
might be regarded

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.880
as a UFO or a flying saucer.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.330
And in addition
to that, they were

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.080
told not to discuss their
sighting or what was

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.420
on their report with anyone.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.710
In the wake of the incredible
number of UFO reports

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
that reached the military
in the summer of 1947,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.420
Lieutenant General Nathan
Twining at Wright Field

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.080
created a new order
to ensure that all UFO

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.670
reports reach the military.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.290
This led to the creation
of the first official UFO

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.790
research program on the
part of the military,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.920
known as Project "Sign."

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.210
NARRATOR: On January
22, 1948, the US

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.210
government authorized
its first official study

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.080
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.290
The highly classified agenda
was known as Project "Sign."

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.120
WILLIAM HENRY: Project
"Sign" officially

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.080
argued that these UFO
sightings were authentic

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.580
and hinted that
they were, in fact,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.960
extraterrestrial in nature.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.710
But the higher-ups
in the military

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.460
stepped in and redacted those
statements, canceled Project

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.000
"Sign," turned it into Project
Grudge, which ultimately

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.330
became Project Blue Book.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.750
MAN: The Air Force closed down
Blue Book because, essentially,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.330
they said they didn't find any
evidence that UFOs were real

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.330
or represented a threat
to national security.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.960
Between 1948 and
1969, the US Air Force

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.750
collected 12,618 UFO reports.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.500
Of that number, 701
remained on explained.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.080
[music playing]

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.290
NARRATOR: While the Air
Force's official stance

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.000
was that Project Blue Book
produced no compelling evidence

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.330
that extraterrestrial craft
occupied Earth's airspace,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.000
one important contributor to
the study strongly disagreed.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.880
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a professor
in the Department of Physics

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.210
and Astronomy at Ohio
State University,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.380
was appointed as scientific
advisor for UFO studies

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.330
during Projects "Sign,"
Grudge, and Blue Book.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.960
MAN: Dr. Hynek
was a pure skeptic

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.790
at the very beginning
of his career

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210
as a consultant to the
United States Air Force.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.040
In fact, he considered these
UFOs to be utterly ridiculous.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.000
But he's got more
and more involved,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.880
and began talking to more
and more quality witnesses

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.380
like military fighter pilots,
it became clear to him

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.250
that there really was something
to this whole UFO question.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.420
[jet soaring]

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.710
When asked in his
later years what

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.580
turned him around on
the whole UFO question,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.210
Dr. Hynek said two things.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.170
The first is that the
Air Force was dead set

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.580
on putting an answer on
every single UFO report,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.750
even if they had to
force the answer.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.580
The second is that he started
talking to very, very credible

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.670
witnesses that led him to
believe that these objects

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.420
were, in fact, real.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.250
[sounds of strange aircrafts]

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.250
NARRATOR: In the
intervening years,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.790
UFO investigators and
scholars have attempted

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.460
to access Project Blue
Book case files utilizing

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.620
the Freedom of Information Act.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.790
But the names, details, and
other personal information

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.120
of all the witnesses
and sightings

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.620
have been blacked out
from the documents,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.790
preventing any
further examination.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.750
WILLIAM HENRY: Considering
the way the US government has

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.080
labeled UFOs top secret,
we have to at least

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960
be open to the possibility
that higher-ups within the US

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.880
government-- or even those
higher than the US government--

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.620
are absolutely aware of
extraterrestrial involvement

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.250
in human affairs,
and have sought

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.620
to cover up this phenomena
for the past six decades.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.670
[tense music playing]

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.580
NARRATOR: Considering
the top secret nature

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.000
of these projects,
is it possible

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.670
that the incredible claims of
Dr. J. Allen Hynek are true,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.500
and that actual contact
with extraterrestrial craft

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
has been concealed from
the general population?
