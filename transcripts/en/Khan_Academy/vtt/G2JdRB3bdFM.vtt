00:00:00.543 --> 00:00:04.525
Ever since the AFC championship game,
and into the run-up to the Super Bowl,

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:07.408
there's been a lot of talk
about deflated footballs.

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:11.968
And in particular, to what degree
can the pressure of a football go down--

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:15.532
to what degree can it get deflated--
based on temperature differentials

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:19.294
from where it was inflated
to where it is actually played.

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:22.957
Especially if it's inflated in a
warmer environment, say indoors,

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:26.265
and then it's played outdoors,
in a colder environment.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:27.943
And so to think about this,

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:31.787
we'll take out one of my
favorite laws or equations,

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:34.202
the ideal gas law.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:38.214
And it tells us that
pressure times volume

00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:44.114
is equal to the number of molecules
of our ideal gas we're dealing with--

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:49.029
it's measured in terms of moles, which is
the measure of the number of molecules--

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:53.273
times our ideal gas constant,
times our temperature.

00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:56.954
Or if we just want to rearrange it--
and I do want to rearrange it,

00:00:56.954 --> 00:00:59.231
because I just want to
solve for P here--

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:02.823
we can divide both sides by V,
and we would be left with

00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:04.825
P is equal to nRT over V.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:11.189
Now let's think about
the exact case of what happened

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.237
with the New England football--

00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:17.034
what the argument is for why
they might have deflated naturally--

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:19.515
why there might not be foul play.

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:25.082
The argument is maybe they were
inflated indoors where the temperature

00:01:25.082 --> 00:01:30.963
was room temperature--
so roughly 75 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:37.265
which is roughly 24 degrees Celsius,
and in order to apply the ideal gas law,

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:42.739
we'd want to convert it to Kelvin,
so this is approximately 297 Kelvin.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.409
That's the indoor temperature.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.517
So if we're infated here, indoors,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:57.520
and then we play outdoors,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.565
where the temperature is
roughly 50 degrees Fahrenheit--

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:07.123
and that, from what I've read,
was actually the temperature

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:10.337
on the field during
the New England game.

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:14.923
50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is
approximately 10 degrees Celsius,

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:17.698
which is approximately 283 Kelvin.

00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:23.549
So the argument being made is,
look, you have this temperature drop,

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.294
could that temperature drop, if this
temperature drops by a certain percent,

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:32.781
could that account for the pressure drop
that was actually measured?

00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.515
And the pressure drop that was
actually measured, gauge pressure--

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.592
and this is an important point,
because it was glossed over

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.800
in some of the initial analyses--

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.689
the gauge pressure indoors,
where the ball was inflated,

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.530
was 12 point 5 pounds per square inch,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.029
and the gauge pressure outdoors,
where it was felt the balls were

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.072
deflated somehow, or where they
had less pressure,

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.469
was 10 point 6 pounds per square inch.

00:03:02.152 --> 00:03:05.783
So, to see if these numbers are
consistent with no foul play,

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:08.577
let's simplify our
ideal gas law a little bit--

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:11.653
make it a little bit particular for this
circumstance.

00:03:11.653 --> 00:03:14.874
So in this circumstance,
we're going to assume no foul play.

00:03:14.874 --> 00:03:18.156
If we assume no foul play,
that means no air is let into or out of.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.563
So the number of molecules
aren't going to change.

00:03:20.563 --> 00:03:22.966
The ideal gas constant
obviously shouldn't change,

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:26.087
it's a universal gas constant,
so this should be constant.

00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:27.332
And then our volume--

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:31.373
let's just assume the football is made
out of leather, it's relatively rigid--

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:33.766
its volume might have
changed a little bit,

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:37.219
but for the sake of our analysis,
we'll say that it pretty much

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.250
held up its shape.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.308
So its volume stayed constant
as we went from indoors to outdoors.

00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:46.951
So to simplify this equation, let's just
call all of this stuff in green K.

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:51.376
If you take your n, multiply it times R,
divide it by V, that's just equal to

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.165
some constant called K.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.930
So we can simplify all of this to
P, pressure, in this case,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.635
should be some constant times temperature.

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:12.572
Because once again, we're assuming
volume doesn't change,

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:15.525
we're assuming no air is let in or out.

00:04:15.525 --> 00:04:17.466
So when you look at it this way,

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:22.220
any percent change on temperature should
have the same percent change in pressure.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.955
So let's see if the percent change
in temperature is consistent with

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:29.853
the percent change in pressure
that was actually observed.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:34.509
And so when we look at the temperature,
we should be doing it in Kelvin,

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.768
so we should look at this change here,
going from 297 Kelvin to 283 Kelvin.

00:04:40.768 --> 00:04:43.182
So what is the drop here?

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:44.616
Let's see.

00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:48.432
It's a drop of 14 Kelvin,
let me get my calculator out.

00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:54.363
It's a drop of 14 Kelvin.

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:59.292
And we started at 297, so divided by 297,

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:03.654
let's just say if we round
to the nearest percentage,

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:09.258
gets us zero point zero four seven,
that's rougly a five percent drop.

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:12.864
So this is a five percent drop.

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:19.622
And I'll write approximately
5 percent drop.

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:22.732
Now let's see what
the drop in pressure is.

00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:26.317
So this is going from 12 point 5 psi
to 10 point 6 psi.

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:28.955
That's 1.9 psi drop.

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:32.584
So that's 1.9 psi drop
divided by our start,

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:35.361
which is 12 point 5,

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:40.746
which looks like a 15 point 2
percent drop, or roughly

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:42.982
a 15 percent drop.

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:47.064
So things are starting to look shady.

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:50.009
This looks like a 15 percent drop.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.483
And this is actually what some of the
initial analyses did,

00:05:53.483 --> 00:05:56.362
they said, look, something
clearly shady happened,

00:05:56.362 --> 00:05:59.456
because temperature by itself
should only account for

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:03.425
a 5 percent drop in pressure, but
there was a 15 percent drop in pressure,

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:06.168
so maybe some air was let out somehow.

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:09.260
But there was actually a mistake
in that initial analysis.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.089
Gauge pressure, the 12 point 5 psi,
that's actually not the absolute pressure.

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.141
What gauge pressure is a measure of

00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:23.489
is how much more pressure
you have inside than outside.

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:27.551
Outside the ball, you do have pressure,
standard atmospheric pressure.

00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:30.751
And it might change depending on
the weather, et cetera.

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:32.044
But there is pressure.

00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:34.958
The pressure is caused by
the weight of the atmosphere.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.172
So, in order to figure absolute pressure,

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:39.734
and to figure out the correct
percentage change,

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:43.190
you need to add how much
more pressure there is inside the ball

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.038
to what the outside pressure is.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:49.083
And I don't know the exact readings
for that day in New England,

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:53.939
but standard atmospheric pressure
is 14 point 7 psi.

00:06:57.818 --> 00:07:01.870
So plus 14 point 7 psi gets us to,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.076
27 point 2 psi.

00:07:07.056 --> 00:07:09.425
And if we add the 14 point 7 over here,

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:11.922
again, to get the true absolute pressure--

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:15.067
once again, the gauge reading is just
how much more pressure

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:16.935
inside the football than outside.

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:20.600
So if you want the true pressure,
the absolute pressure, you add these.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.810
And this is going to be 25 point 2 psi.

00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:29.207
Now we can calculate
the actual percentage drop,

00:07:29.207 --> 00:07:31.617
and compare it to this 5 percent drop.

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:35.577
Minor mistake, this is 25 point 3 psi.

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:41.853
So we still have the same drop,

00:07:41.853 --> 00:07:43.976
we have a 1 point 9 psi drop,

00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:46.667
to go from 27 point 2
to 25 point 3.

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:48.573
But it's over a larger base.

00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:51.017
So it should be a lower percentage.

00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:53.669
Let's calculate what that is.

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:58.506
We have 1 point 9 psi drop,
divided by 27 point 2 psi.

00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:02.427
Is equal to a little under
a seven percent drop.

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:05.540
So approximately a seven percent drop.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.783
Now these two things are not exact.

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.807
But they are a lot closer.

00:08:13.807 --> 00:08:15.784
And this degree, you're like, okay,

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:18.027
there might have been
other factors at play.

00:08:18.027 --> 00:08:20.952
Maybe some of the measurements
weren't done exactly right.

00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:22.694
Maybe actually the ambient pressure

00:08:22.694 --> 00:08:24.776
was somehow different inside and outside.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:27.997
There's also some possibility,
especially when you're outside,

00:08:27.997 --> 00:08:30.708
that some water,
some precipitation is on the ball.

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:33.352
As that precipitation evaporates,

00:08:33.352 --> 00:08:35.582
it might cool down the ball further,

00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:38.170
which would drop the pressure even more.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.735
So this isn't definitive,

00:08:39.735 --> 00:08:43.768
but at least the numbers here,
when we apply the ideal gas law properly,

00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:47.985
they pretty much account for
most of the pressure drop.

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.967
So at least here,
I wouldn't get too caught up

00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:53.397
in all of the conspiracy theories.
