00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.750
well it's hard to say uh

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.579
you know obviously they will do something that surprising
that that

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.249
current generation wouldn't expect

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.939
and even to that energy feild there's a lot of

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.499
 approaches

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.820
that arent much discuss solar chemical high
winds

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.060
you know wild ideas that atleast

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.310
we need thousands of people pursuing

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.499
uh

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.090
and nine hundred ninety of them will hit dead
ends

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.750
but if that's become an urgent question

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.980
and some making sure that there's basic R&amp;D
 money that there is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.780
uh  money to do pilots on a variety of things

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.060
I do think

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.160
uh whoever makes the breakthrough for

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.730
very cheap energy that's environmentally friendly

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.070
our multiple breakthroughs will be required
for that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.030
they will make a huge contribution but who
knows what

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.350
what particular technology this is %uh

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.560
a case where we need to have

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.280
thousands of ideas 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.030
that are pursued
