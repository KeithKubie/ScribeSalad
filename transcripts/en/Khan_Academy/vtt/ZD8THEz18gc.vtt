00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.490
We've learned in
previous videos that

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.290
relative to the orbital
plane around the sun

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.540
or the plane of Earth's
orbit around the sun,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.900
the Earth has a certain tilt.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.790
So let me draw the Earth's tilt
relative to that orbital plane

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.129
right over here.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.090
So this if this is the
orbital plane right over here

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.720
so we're looking right directly
sideways on this orbital plane

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.110
that I've drawn in orange.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.460
And maybe at the point
in Earth's orbit right

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.299
now, maybe the sun
is to the left,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.630
and so the rays from
the sun are coming

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.600
in this general direction.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.220
We've learned that the
Earth as a certain tilt,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.760
and when I mean that
it means if you think

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.280
about the axis around which
it's rotating it's not straight

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.586
up from the orbital
plane, it is at an angle.

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:52.460
And let me draw that.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.960
So if I were to draw an arrow
that's coming out of the North

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.650
Pole it would look like that.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.830
And maybe I'll draw an arrow
coming out of the South Pole.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.019
And the Earth is rotating in
that direction right over here,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.210
and you notice this axis that
I've drawn this arrow on,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.410
it is not straight up and down.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:22.980
And right now it is at
an angle of 23.4 degrees

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.180
with the vertical, with
being straight up and down.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.920
And we've learned
how this is what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.930
is the primary
cause of our seasons

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.380
in that when the Northern
Hemisphere is pointed

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.000
towards the sun it's getting
a disproportionate amount

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.540
of the solar radiation.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780
Whatever's going through
the atmosphere has

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.530
to go through less atmosphere
and the things in the Northern

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.400
Hemisphere are
getting more daylight.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.140
And when the Earth is on
the other side of the sun

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.360
and the Northern
Hemisphere is pointed away

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.990
from the sun then the
opposite is going to happen.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.180
And the reverse is true for
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.260
But in that video
when we talk about how

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.700
tilt can affect
the seasons, I also

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.280
kind of hinted a little bit
that this is the current tilt

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.120
right now, and over
long periods of time

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.930
that this tilt will change.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.710
And in particular, it will
vary, and even the boundaries

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.760
for this varying are different
for the past million years

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.720
than they will be for
the next million years,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.780
but it varies roughly between
22.1 degrees and 24.5 degrees.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.350
And just to make it
clear that it's not

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.120
wobbling back and
forth like this,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.660
and just to visualize
22.1 versus 24.5,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.380
it's not a huge difference.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.640
So if this is 23.4-- and
I'm not measuring exactly--

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.139
maybe pointing in this
direction, maybe 22.1

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.430
would look something like that.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.030
In fact, I've exaggerated it.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.770
And maybe 24.5 would
look something like that.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.500
And so it's not a
huge difference,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.390
but it is enough of a difference
so we believe to actually

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.810
have a significant impact
on what the climate is like

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.620
or what the seasons
are like, especially

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.400
in terms of how much of a chance
different parts of our planet

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.542
have a chance to freeze
over or not freeze over

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:18.500
and all the rest, or how
much sunlight they get

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.230
and all the rest.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.290
So it has some
impact, but I want

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.360
to make it clear that it
takes a long period of time.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.680
That it actually
takes 41,000 years

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.470
to go from a minimum
tilt to a maximum tilt

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.600
and then back to a minimum tilt.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.510
41,000 years.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.730
And right now at a
tilt of 23.4 degrees,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.200
we're someplace right
smack in between.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.720
And we think the last
maximum was at 8,700 BCE,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.630
before the common era, or
you could say before Christ.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.870
And that the next minimum, when
our tilt has been minimized,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.900
the next time our
tilt will be minimized

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.350
will be in the year 11,800.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.480
So this isn't something
that's happening overnight,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.160
but it is something
that could affect

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.760
our climate over
long periods of time.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.910
And this is just one
factor, and sometimes

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.720
this changing of the tilt,
a fancier word for tilt

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.810
is sometimes given,
is obliquity,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.350
but this is really just
a fancy word for tilt.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.670
This changing of the obliquity--
or the changing of the tilt--

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.430
is one of these changes in
Earth's rotation or Earth's

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.960
orbit around the sun that
might have long-term cycles

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.490
or effects on Earth's
climate, and maybe they

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.490
do help cause certain ice
ages when they act together

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.490
with each other
over certain cycles.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.200
And broadly, this
entire class of cycles

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.880
are called Milankovitch cycles.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.610
Milankovitch, he was
a Serbian scientist,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.320
who's the guy who theorized that
these changes in Earth's orbit

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.160
might be responsible
for long-term climate

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.850
change or maybe some cycles
where we enter ice ages

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.280
and get out of ice
ages or we have

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.520
more extreme or less
extreme weather.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.550
So these are
Milankovitch cycles.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.020
And changes in the tilt,
or the elbow obliquity,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.560
are just one of the
possible factors

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.430
playing into
Milankovitch cycles.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.030
And what I want to do in this
video and in the next video

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.821
is talk about all of
the different factors,

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:22.730
or at least summarize all
of the different factors.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.510
Now, another one.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.780
This one is pretty intuitive for
me that this tilt can change.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.250
One that's a little bit less
intuitive when you first

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.510
think about it is something
called precession.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.800
And the idea behind
precession, I

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.350
guess the best analogy
I can think of,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.080
is if you imagine
a top, or maybe you

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.720
could imagine Earth as
a top right over here.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.910
The top is spinning, the top
is spinning in this direction,

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.730
and obliquity tells
you, essentially,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.897
how much it's wobbling.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.480
Actually, let me
think of it this way.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.280
Imagine a wobbling top.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.740
So it's rotating like
this, it's tilted,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.230
and then it is
also if you imagine

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.980
that this was a pole up here
that's coming out of the pole,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.646
that this was actually
a physical arrow,

00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:16.320
that that arrow itself
would be rotating.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.050
So the best way to think
about it is a wobbling top.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.560
If you think after
some point of time

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.790
this thing would wobble so
it would look like this.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.510
So now the arrow is
pointing that way.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.093
And if you wait a
few more seconds now

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:34.802
maybe the arrow is pointing
a little bit out of the page.

00:06:34.802 --> 00:06:36.510
And then you wait a
few more seconds then

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.080
it's pointing in this direction,
it's pointing into the page.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.950
And so this whole time, the
obliquity isn't changing.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.730
The obliquity you can view
it as how far is that wobble.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.620
You could imagine how far
from vertical is that wobble,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.290
and no matter where we
are in that rotation

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.320
it hasn't changed, and you
could imagine the precession

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.195
as where we are in the wobble.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:04.090
And I want to-- this is a
little bit hard to visualize,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.410
and hopefully, as we think
about it in different ways

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.700
and I draw different
diagrams it'll

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.170
become a little bit clearer--
but I want to make it clear.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.280
Just as it takes a long
time for the inclination

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.410
to change from a minimum value
to a maximum value and back,

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.130
it takes a huge amount of
time for Earth's precession

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.030
to change in a significant way.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.020
So for this top to-- if you
imagined this arrow popping

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.230
out, for this arrow to actually
trace out an entire loop,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.970
it takes 26,000 years.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.770
So 26,000 years to have an
entire cycle of precession.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.400
Now, what I want to
do is think about

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.950
given that this
precession is occurring,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.020
I want to think about how
that would affect our seasons,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.810
or how it would
actually affect how

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.700
we think about the
year or the calendar.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.620
So let's draw the orbit
of Earth around the sun.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.610
So here is my sun
right over here.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.329
And here is the orbit of Earth.

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:03.870
And I'm not going
to think too much--

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.270
I'm going to assume
that it's almost

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.660
circular for the
sake of this video.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.243
In future videos,
we'll talk about how

00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:12.090
the eccentricity-- or how
elliptical the orbit is--

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.440
can also affect the
Malinkovitch cycles

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.550
or play into the
Malinkovitch cycles.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:23.630
But let's just draw the orbit of
Earth around the sun over here.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.530
And so you could imagine this
is, at one point in time,

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.910
this is the Earth.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.789
Let's say it is tilted
towards the sun right now.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.900
And so is in the
Northern Hemisphere--

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.669
and I'm assuming this
arrow is coming out

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.169
of the North Pole-- this would
be the summer in the Northern

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:44.980
Hemisphere.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.680
And then if you had no
precession, absolutely

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.120
no precession, when you
go to this time of year

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.680
you still have the
same direction of tilt.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.440
Let me do that in blue.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.630
You still have the
same direction of tilt.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.950
We're still pointing to the
same part of the universe.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.720
We still have the
same North Star.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.600
You go to this time, we're still
tilting in the same direction

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.225
relative to the
universe, but we're not

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:11.660
tilting away from the sun.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.056
And now this would be the winter
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:16.180
And we'd keep going around.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.138
And if you had no
precession, when you get back

00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:20.410
to this point over
here, we'd be tilting

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.180
in the exact same direction.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:27.030
If your obliquity or if your
tilt changed a little bit,

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.090
you might move up or
down, away, or towards

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.134
the sun a little bit, but this
is all assuming no precession.

00:09:33.134 --> 00:09:34.550
Now, I'm going to
think about what

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.800
happens if you do
have precession.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.320
So what's happening
with precession

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.530
is when you go around
one time around the sun,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.780
by the time you get
to this point again

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.730
you're not pointing at
exactly the same direction.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.160
You are now pointing
a little bit further

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.030
so this arrow-- let me draw
it a little bit bigger.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.640
So this is the Earth
and this is that arrow.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.060
And this is hard to visualize
or at least it's hard for me

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.280
to visualize.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.310
Well, once you get it,
it's easier to visualize,

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.950
but the first time I
tried to understand it,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.070
it was hard for me to
understand how precession

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.230
was different than obliquity
or different than tilt.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.640
Obliquity is how much
we're going from vertical.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.570
And so if we had
no precession, we

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.260
would be exactly pointing in
that same direction every year.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.110
Now, with just precession alone
what happens is every year

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:31.960
this arrow is slowly tracing out
a circle that goes like this.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.770
So I'm going to
exaggerate how much it's

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.700
happening just so that
you can visualize it.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.120
So maybe after several
years that arrow

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.810
is not-- when you're at that
same point relative to the sun,

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.350
that same point in
the solar system,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.710
that arrow is no longer
pointing in that direction.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.320
It is now traced out a
little bit of that circle.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.745
So it is now pointing
in this direction.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.080
So if it is now pointing
in this direction,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.530
will that same point
in the solar system,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.820
that same point relative to
the sun, that same exact point

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.350
in the orbit, will it
still be the summer

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.970
in the Northern Hemisphere?

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.140
Well, it won't because we're
now not pointing directly

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.220
or we're not most inclined
to the sun at that point.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.880
Now, we would have
been most inclined

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.750
to the sun a little bit earlier
in the year or a little bit

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.590
earlier in the orbit.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.210
So we would have been
most inclined to the sun

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.175
maybe over here.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.840
And it would take many,
many, many actual thousands

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.950
of years for the precession
to change this much,

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:43.080
but then over here this is where
when at this point in that year

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.100
when we would be pointed
most towards the sun.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.040
So what the real
effect of precession

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.680
is doing to our
seasons and doing

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.370
to what our sense of what our
year is, is that every year

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.430
relative to our orbit
on Earth, because Earth

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.810
is kind of a top
that's slowly circling,

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.780
that's slowly tracing
out this circle

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.440
with, I guess you could
say, with its pole.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.370
What it's doing
is it's making it

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.880
tilt towards the sun
or away from the sun

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.709
a little bit earlier each year.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.750
I know it's hard to
visualize, but you could even

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.670
take a top out and have
a basketball as the sun,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.390
and if you play with it,
you'll see how that works.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.670
And precession is another
one of those factors that

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.800
play into, I should say,
the Malinkovitch cycles.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.130
And what we'll see is when
you combine precession,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.720
when you combine-- or I should
say change in precession, when

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.090
you combine that
with changes in tilt,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.590
and you combine that with
changes in actual how circular

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.360
or how elliptical the actual
orbit is and how that changes,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.810
then you might have a
respectable way of explaining,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.250
or some of explaining,
why Earth is entered

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.790
into these climactic cycles
over many tens of thousands

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.460
of years.
