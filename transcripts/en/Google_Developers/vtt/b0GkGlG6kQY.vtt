ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello, and
welcome to our first annual

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.360
State of the Script.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.680
My name's Arun Nagarajan.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.690
I'm joined here by our esteemed
product manager,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.350
Saurabh Gupta.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.220
And this is our first annual
State of the Script.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.420
And those of you that are
joining in from the United

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.180
States, you'll know
the reference.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.690
Today is the State
of the Union the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.080
president delivers annually.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.370
And we're trying to preempt him
by giving the State of the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.010
Script ahead of time.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.870
And we're pretty excited.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.830
A lot of good questions rolling
in on Moderator.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.010
We're going to be watching it.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.160
I have a few questions that
I'm going to ask Saurabh.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.520
And we'll get started.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.940
SAURABH GUPTA: Thank you,
Arun, for having me.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.220
And thanks everyone
for watching this.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.000
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yes, welcome
to our new studios.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.940
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Shiny
new studios.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.180
And we're pretty excited.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.230
Very fancy setup, and good
lighting, and everything.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.740
So before we get started, you
want to introduce yourself?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.625
Tell us a little bit
about yourself.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:03.240
SAURABH GUPTA: Sure.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.350
I'm Saurabh Gupta.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.680
I'm product manager for
Google Apps Script.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.200
I work very closely with Arun
and rest of the team to make

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.980
Apps Script as awesome
as possible for you.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.140
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.310
So I think a lot of folks have
an understanding of what a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.570
product manager does.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.320
But for everybody's sake, can
you explain a little bit about

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.365
what a product manager does?

00:02:24.365 --> 00:02:26.100
Are you writing code all day?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.090
Are you on the phone with
customers all day?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.840
What is it that a product
manager does?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.690
SAURABH GUPTA: So it's

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.320
interesting question, actually.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.250
There's a long answer.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.460
And there's a short answer.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.710
So short answer is, anything
that engineers or you guys

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.430
won't do, like our esteemed
developer relations folks

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.930
won't do is what a product
manager will do.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.750
But a long answer is a little
bit of everything.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.280
But most important job of the
product manager is to steer

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.700
Apps Script in direction
where it's most useful.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.020
And it aligns with overall
Google Apps strategy.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.035
And it is a useful product
for developers.

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:09.490
And we are taking care of pain
points, and making sure that

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.910
things just work, and they
are right, and they

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.680
are on right path.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.430
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Got it.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.040
So when something's not going
right, it's your fault.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.460
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.640
Absolutely.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I kid.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.770
I kid.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.154
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:22.970
OK.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.080
And then--

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.270
my bottles in the way here.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.260
Let me get that out
of the way.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.320
So you also had an interesting
background.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.450
You were in developer relations
before you became a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.230
product manager.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.510
So you know a lot about
what we do, as well.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.260
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.750
And I think for a developer
product like Apps Script, it

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.280
is absolutely critical that we
have a very diverse set of

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.880
skills in our team.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.590
So we not only need great
engineers who actually build

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.700
the product, but we also need
great developer advocates, and

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.310
great developer programs
engineers, and a good product

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.480
manager, I hope, to make this
product successful.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.130
Because it's not just
enough to throw a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.840
bunch of APIs out there.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.880
You've got to be able to
articulate the vision.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.600
You've got to be
able to guide.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.720
You've got to be able to have
developers focus on how to use

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.470
APIs the best way,
and all of that.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.519
It's really, really important
that we have good support for

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.470
developers.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.950
And that's where developer
relations come in.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.990
And that's where I came in.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.770
And that's how I joined.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.370
When I joined Google, I joined
in developer relations.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.710
And that's how I transitioned
from developer relations to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.110
product manager role.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.970
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So all you
that are listening in, he

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.040
understands your pain.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.590
He had to deal with--

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.420
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.520
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
really good.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.380
Just conversing with Saurabh, I
know that when I explain our

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.230
partners, or our developers,
or our customers that are

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.590
running into issues, he's able
to quickly understand it, and

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.110
not just look at it from
features, from an end user

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960
perspective.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.220
I think we're in good
hands there.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.540
Now that we know a little bit
about you, tell us about the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.010
State of Script, 2013.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.890
SAURABH GUPTA: If I'm being
very presidential like, I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.400
would say state of
script is strong.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.470
But yes, we have launched a few
things over the past year.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.670
The last Google I/O, if
remember, we launched a few

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.680
major things.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.460
HTML service was one of them.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.870
ScriptDb was one of them.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.030
We launched the standalone
script editor, a new way of

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.450
doing web apps.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.140
So we launched a
lot of things.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.110
And we spent the last six months
post I/O making sure

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.460
that we iterated on whatever we
launched at I/O. So that's

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.360
what we've done.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.390
We have launched a few things
along the way, as well.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.010
And there's more to come.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.510
But overall our users
are very excited.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.680
Google Docs users, Drive users,
app, Gmail users, Drive

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.970
users are very excited about
interesting things that can be

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.080
built using Apps Script.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.020
So I think there is a very, very
strong interest there,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.010
both on the consumer side and
the enterprise user side.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.440
So that [? pace, ?] we
are very strong.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.410
Can you talk a little bit about
some of the favorite

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.370
things that we've launched
in 2012?

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.465
I know you already listed
a few things.

00:06:15.465 --> 00:06:18.250
Are there a few that kind of--

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.280
SAURABH GUPTA: So the first
thing that is my favorite is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.510
HTML service.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.610
And the reason why it's favorite
is because it just

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.990
gives you raw power of
JavaScript HTML CSS

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.360
into your web apps.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.150
Like, if you remember--

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.170
ARUN NAGARAJAN: On
the client side.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.830
SAURABH GUPTA: On the
client side, yes.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.060
If you remember, with UI App,
the service that we had, you

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.450
could only stitch UI together
on the server side.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.590
And then it moved
to client side.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.400
But with HTML service, now you
can do the web apps the way

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.980
you have been doing it, which
is using JavaScript, HTML,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.800
CSS, jQuery.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.570
So this is one of my really
favorite things.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.190
Standalone script editor is
another big thing for me.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.850
Because if I need to just
write a script, I go to

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.210
script.google.com.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.670
And that's it.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.870
And this was such a pain
point for developers.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.910
Because before Script Editor
existed in Drive, you had to

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.020
go to Spreadsheet.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.415
And if you remember--

00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:15.550
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah,
I remember.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.790
SAURABH GUPTA: And tools
and script editor.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.750
And that was like, we are
there writing web apps.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.860
So those are the two of
my favorite things.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.950
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Those are
really good ones.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.610
Those are pretty big
and important ones

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.590
that I use every day.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.150
So I'm pretty excited.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.090
What are some of the now--

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.550
part of State of the Script is
looking ahead a little bit.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.480
So looking ahead in 2013,
what are some of the big

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.200
philosophical things
we're working on?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.990
What are some of the little
things but have big impact?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.520
Can you talk a little bit
about that right?

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.960
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.170
Lots more new interesting
stuff to come in 2013.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.400
One of the things that we do
want to solve as a pain point

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.930
is making scripts easier to
execute, making scripts easier

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.350
to package, making scripts
easier to distribute.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.715
I think that's really one of
the big pain points that we

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:09.220
want to solve.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.360
For example, if you create
something awesome, whether

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.190
it's a script in a spreadsheet
or as web app, you just want

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.890
to package it, make it easily
available to end users.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.840
And today, it's a little hard.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.420
We have a script gallery, and
you publish something to a

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.660
script gallery.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.570
But it should be a much easier,
smoother process, for

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.750
both you as a developer
and your users.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.990
So we are really working
very hard on that.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's a
really important point.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.370
Because today, when I write a
great script, I find it very

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.610
easy for me to test
it on myself.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.250
But then when I want to send
it to you, I have to either

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.070
send you the source code, or
package it up in a spreadsheet

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.300
as a copy, and have
you copy it up.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.510
So I think a lot of folks that
are listening in will be very

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.260
excited about that.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.390
So stay tuned for
more on that.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.800
Other things that may make
sense for the developers?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.120
SAURABH GUPTA: Yep.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.360
So one of the outstanding
requests is, why do we just

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.280
have scripts in Spreadsheet
and [? Sites ?] right?

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.280
So there will be good news
on that front, as well.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.310
Because we want to treat all
Google Docs properties equal.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.060
We want sheets and slides and
docs are on equal footing.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.370
So we don't want to just give
special treatment to

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.130
Spreadsheets.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.870
There will be some good
news on that front.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.820
Another thing to look forward
to is the overall end user

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.520
experience.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.320
And as part of that end
user experience is the

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.460
authorization flow.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.550
Arun, you remember the ugly
dialogue that comes up

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.260
whenever an authorization
is required.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.330
We want to fix that, so
that's not scary.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.592
Today, if you give a script
to a user, you get an

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.070
authorization dialog which is
like, oh my god, what is this?

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.910
And then you click on it.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.660
Then there's another
one, you close it.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.740
There's quite a few hoops
that users have to

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.990
jump to use your scripts.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.530
We want to make that simple,
easy, and painless.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.560
So that's happening.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.200
Also, there are a whole bunch
of other Google APIs is out

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.270
there that are not available
through Apps Script.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.480
And we are going to make more
of these APIs available.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.125
In Google API Services, if you
look at that category, there

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:22.830
are four or five today.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.700
And that list is
going to grow.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.730
So that whole experience is
going to change a little bit

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.890
as well, and for the better.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.930
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And when you
say other Google APIs, you

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.960
mean things like Google+,
YouTube, the whole set of

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.330
services that we provide
outside of Apps.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.650
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.160
So today we have default
services category, and then

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.260
Google APIs category.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.400
And default services are like
native services that are sort

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.110
of baked into Apps Script.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.100
This is our foundation.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.890
But then there's a whole bunch
of other Google APIs.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.060
And you have to go to Google API
Console to turn them on,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.870
and all of that kind of stuff.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.430
So you've probably always
wondered, why can't I use

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.250
those APIs from Apps Script?

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.920
And today you can, a few, Like
analytics, AdSense, BitQuery,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.180
stuff like, Predictions.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.780
So we want to expand
that roster.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.800
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good,
excellent.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.080
I know that's going to welcome
news for a lot of folks that

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.210
are trying to build more
automation around YouTube

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.590
reporting, more awareness of
their Google+ stream, and

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.170
things like that.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.650
That's very exciting.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.860
So when you talked about all the
different apps, I noticed

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.760
that you didn't talk
about forms.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.770
In fact there's actually
a question around that.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.250
And I'll actually jump to
our Moderator here.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.970
Are Googleists working
on a forms class?

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.330
With the new forms, there seems
to be much or potential

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.930
for dealing with existing forms
and underlying data

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.660
without having to
create new UIs.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.420
It seems like this person,
Michael, is picking up on some

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.370
interesting hints.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.780
SAURABH GUPTA: That's right.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.420
I thought I'd keep
it a surprise.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:03.280
SAURABH GUPTA: But again, forms
is a first class on a

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.890
Google Drive app.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.990
So we don't want to leave
any app behind.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.890
Especially the sites are
where we are right now.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.490
We are looking at it others,
and forms is

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.490
certainly one such.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.520
And so stay tuned for
the good news.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.450
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah,
very good question.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.700
And certainly we'll continue
monitoring

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.550
Moderator for such questions.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.010
So you mentioned a lot of
these services, default

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.320
services, you called them.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.720
So these are everything
from cache service to

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.220
Document app, and so on.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.590
What is your favorite?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.100
SAURABH GUPTA: Before I jump
onto my favorite, I want to

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.230
also separate the wheat from
chaff a little bit.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.800
So if you look at default
services, we have a whole

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.220
bunch of different services
in default.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.160
But I would like you to organize
default services into

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.130
these models.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.190
So the first is sort of like
the big five, if you will.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.110
We have like Spreadsheet,
[INAUDIBLE] service.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.130
We have Drive service.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:01.990
We have Gmail.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.200
We have Drive.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.810
And we have Document.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.790
So you should think of these
five as really the big,

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.520
important services.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.140
Then we have other important
services, like URL fetch, and

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.980
UI app, and HTML service,
which sort of

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.040
is part of the platform.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.670
Less an API-ish step thing, but
more part of the platform.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.760
Then we have third category,
which is

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.870
experimental services.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.700
A lot of these are
experimental.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.580
And we have never thought of
creating a separate category

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.090
of experimental, but sort
of try things out.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.170
And if they work, then
graduate them.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:43.100
If not, then keep it more open
for suggestions and feedback,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.210
and stuff like that.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.660
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.840
first think of that.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.820
Now going back to your question
about what are some

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.510
of my favorite ones, I would say
Gmail App is certainly one

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.330
of my favorite.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.950
There's a very famous script out
there called Gmail meter.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.070
I have it installed on my Gmail
account, my wife's email

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.950
account, my Google account
for my work.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.650
And I know a ton of other
people who have it.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.420
And it's almost always a
pleasant surprise on the first

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.150
of every month that I get a nice
little email giving me

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.280
stats of my inbox.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.740
And it's a good window
into what's going

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.710
on in the past month.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.930
So that's one of my
favorite ones.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.250
I like the Drive one as well.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.650
It's pretty interesting.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.720
And HTML service.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.390
I really like it because now I
can use jQuery and create some

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.230
interesting web apps,
and stuff like that.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool, good.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.080
I think Spreadsheet App is
one of my favorites.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.270
I think the fact that you can
inject a menu, or run a script

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.795
off of a button, I think
you can do so much.

00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:52.440
As Spreadsheets happen to be
such a natural user interface

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.700
for a lot of folks that
we work with.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.130
That's good.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.400
Everybody's got to have
a little favorite.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.650
That's great.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.960
One of things I realized, just
looking at our Apps Script

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.540
usage internally is that we are
pretty avid users of Apps

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.520
Script, ourselves.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.880
Internally, we use it for
progress tracking, welcoming

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.680
new folks into teams, I know a
lot of interesting use cases.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.260
Can you talk a bit about that
internal usage a little bit?

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.510
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.820
one of the founding principles
of Apps Script was to make

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.390
automation a lot simpler
and easier.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.480
That's how we started.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.220
That's how Apps Script as
a product got started.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.650
And we need automations
in different ways.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.440
It's not just automation in a
spreadsheet, where you can do

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.580
different things in
a spreadsheet.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.360
But it is automation around
a bunch of other stuff.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.980
For example, when we are about
to launch stuff, there is

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.830
stuff that we use the Drive and
Spreadsheet, and all that

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.230
other stuff.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:07.570
So there is quite a good
considerable use case within

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.740
Google using Calendar and
Spreadsheets together.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.690
That's a big one.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.960
I just mentioned Gmail
and Spreadsheet,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.860
and Gmail and Drive.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.610
Like Gmail meter, Gmail
meter is a pretty

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.860
popular one, as well.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.720
Other things that we do.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.280
We do do a lot of custom mail
merge type applications.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.880
Like if you want to send out,
let's say, 200 emails, or

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.780
something, Apps Script
is perfect for that.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.720
You write up a doc.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.520
And then you just send out
emails, and things like that.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.830
So it's pretty interesting
that [? base, ?] as well.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.150
There's a lot of reporting and
dashboard stuff that happens

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.070
using Apps Script.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.890
Like for instance, we use that
project web script that is

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.060
available in the gallery, which

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.490
gives you project tracking.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.970
We use that a lot.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.620
Especially in our team,
to track stuff.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.770
ARUN NAGARAJAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:57.360
as well.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.920
SAURABH GUPTA: Exactly.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.950
So there is considerable usage
around Apps Script within

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.640
Google, and within Docs and
Drive and all the other teams.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.480
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I would say
it's more the dog fooding.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.420
I think we're actually using it
for real mission critical

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.990
stuff in a lot of ways.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.920
I'm actually pretty excited
about that.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.089
I think it gives us new ideas,
and make sure that our stuff's

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.609
is going to work for everybody,
not just the

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:23.270
developers.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.810
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.240
ARUN NAGARAJAN: One of the
things that I wanted to talk

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.750
about as well was you work with
other product managers

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.700
pretty closely.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.590
From your perspective, how does
Apps Script fit with the

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.390
rest of the Google
Apps strategy?

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.920
And can you talk a bit about how
that guides our roadmap,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.380
our priorities?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.500
SAURABH GUPTA: So Apps Script
is a developer product.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.540
And automation is our
founding principle.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.390
But along with automation, it's
tied to another concept,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.670
which is called extensibility.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.550
Meaning, Google Apps
are great.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.790
They can meet 99.99% of
your requirements,

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.280
maybe, or 99%, or 98%.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.960
You take the pick.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:10.020
But that 1% or 0.1% or 2% that
you need to meet 100% of your

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.240
use cases you need some
kind of customization.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.105
And as part of our core product
offering, like for

00:18:16.105 --> 00:18:19.850
Docs or Drive or Gmail, we can't
imagine and conceive

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.660
every feature, and stuff the
product with every feature.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.820
So this is where Apps
Script comes in.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.190
Which is, you take a developer
product and you extend Google

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.860
Apps, using Apps Script, to meet
all of your requirements,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.590
to meet 100% of your
use cases.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.580
So our goal is automation,
extensibility and no use case

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.910
left behind.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.946
So that's where Apps Script fits
in overall apps strategy.

00:18:47.946 --> 00:18:49.980
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And that
actually should be music to

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.510
all the developers' ears.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.210
That creates such a huge
opportunity of products and

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.600
software that they could build,
provide additional

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.140
services to the millions of
users that Apps brings in.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.960
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.180
Because every organization
has different needs.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.935
If you work for a company, they
have their own processes.

00:19:08.935 --> 00:19:10.300
They have their own workflow.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.190
They have their own tracking
system, and all that

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.030
So Spreadsheet is such a
foundational product.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.370
It's such a fundamental
product.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.810
Drive is such a fundamental
product.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.070
Gmail is such a fundamental
product.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:29.920
And you need to be able to
extend these, and meet your

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.780
requirements.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.270
So that's where Apps
Script fits in

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.760
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.650
That makes a lot of sense.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.630
You're saying all the idea of
Apps Script is to cross cut

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.440
all the different apps that
we have, and provide an

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.840
extensibility and an
automation story,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.640
consistently.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.060
And that. combined with some
of the deployment story you

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.950
talked about.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.200
SAURABH GUPTA: That's
where our focus is.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.030
As I said earlier, which is make
it easier for developers

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.560
to package your scripts and
distribute them to an

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.140
organization, or to individuals,
or whoever.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.200
But it should be just
simple and easy.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.010
And it should just work.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.066
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Makes
a lot of sense.

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.820
A couple tough questions
for you.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.980
SAURABH GUPTA: I love
tough questions.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.300
ARUN NAGARAJAN: We talked about
a lot of the good things

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.270
we're working on, a lot of the
exciting thing that's coming

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.720
up, the great 2012
that we had.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.350
What are some of the challenges
that you look at

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.760
right now and we're working on
that's kind of tough on us?

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.220
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.870
SAURABH GUPTA: There are
quite a few challenges.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.750
We have a vast footprint when it
comes to Apps Script as an

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.950
infrastructure.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.980
So we have a Script Editor.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.380
We have a whole bunch of APIs.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.550
We have the leave the Apps
Script runtime itself.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.880
We have the event
infrastructure, where you can

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.130
get on [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.600
The pieces to this whole
machinery is just too many.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.070
We do a good job of
making sure it's

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.270
reliable, and all of that.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:08.500
And we want to make it even
better and reliable for

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:08.980
developers.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.150
So that's something that
we focus on heavily.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:15.280
So that's the first thing.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.780
There are other challenges, as
well, in the sense that we

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.940
have to pick and choose
our features.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.210
I know you guys have
so many feature

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.120
requests out on our tracker.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.390
And you can just see this
sheer volume of it.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.940
And there are chances that we
may not be able to implement

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.440
every one of those
feature requests.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.870
So we have to take a hard look
at what is good, bad, or what

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.400
is absolutely needed,
and what is not.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.520
And we have to make
trade offs.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.400
And these trade offs are hard.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.010
Because I've been on the other
side of the fence.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.390
And I know when, if I don't have
a method on the API it's

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.640
infuriating.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.730
And to make these trade
offs, it's not easy.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.900
I know a lot of frustration on
the tracker sometimes, which

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.700
is hey, how come this feature
has not been implemented for x

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.590
weeks or x months,
or whatever.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:09.890
And we look at it.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.350
And we say, we have to
choose our battles.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:22.885
So making sure that developers
are happy, and not boiling

00:22:22.885 --> 00:22:26.140
over, some of these things, is
another challenge for us.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.810
Which is, we want to meet
your expectations, and

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.960
not piss you off.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.910
Yet we want to pick
our right battles.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: But at the same
time, we do appreciate

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.360
your professional well-noted
comments in the issue tracker,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.920
an your votes.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.550
So we do track that.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.210
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:43.400
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I can
attest to that.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.330
SAURABH GUPTA: The votes are
absolutely important.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.390
I can't stress enough.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.310
The number of votes on the
tracker for a given issue or

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.240
feature request--

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.880
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Especially
with good use cases, and

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.590
sample code, and scenarios where
it's really important

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.400
for you or your business.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.240
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.270
That's a great question.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.720
ARUN NAGARAJAN: A lot of
folks are asking some

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.390
good questions here.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.470
I'll take one.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.430
This one's around performance,
which is another thing that

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.430
we're working on.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.940
Apps Script gadgets take a long
time to initially render

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.840
in a Google site.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.780
Do you have any plans to
speed up the execution?

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.610
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.340
The answer is a resounding
yes.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.710
We're already playing
with something that

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.650
speeds up the stuff.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.690
If you have developed something
using HTML service,

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.350
for example-- and I'm taking an
assumption here that it's

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.920
HTML service--

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.910
then things are slow
right now.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.850
Especially the first initial
load times, and you and I have

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.490
discussed this a lot right.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.050
And we already have solutions.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.970
We are internally playing
with one.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.080
And good news is on the way.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.810
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.920
We're coming up on time here,
just a couple of minutes.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.820
I wanted to ask you what are
some of the use cases and

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.210
capabilities today that you
think there's a need in the

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.950
vacuum that is a great
opportunity for the community?

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.850
If you look at what's available
and what's possible,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.230
what's that window like?

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:02.050
What's the gap like?

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:03.920
And what are some of
the opportunities?

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.170
SAURABH GUPTA: Oh yeah.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.470
I think there are quite a few
services that developers can

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.760
use which are not being used as
heavily as we would expect.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.530
So HTML service is one such,
which is the quality of UI

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:28.680
that you can build using HTML
service is leaps and bounds

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.150
better than what you
can do in UI app.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.680
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You get the
full power of the browser.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.450
SAURABH GUPTA: Exactly.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:38.570
So I am expecting that more
and more developers will

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:43.610
leverage that, and build some
amazing use cases around it.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.450
Another thing that I think is
not being leveraged as well is

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.030
ability to publish web apps
in Chrome Web Store.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:57.320
We launched this integration
at Google I/O. And a lot of

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.450
developers have used it.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:01.890
But I would expect a lot more,
given the volume of web apps

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.985
that are published
out of our--

00:25:02.985 --> 00:25:04.800
ARUN NAGARAJAN: And the
popularity of Chrome.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.900
SAURABH GUPTA: Absolutely.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.340
So I think that is something
that developers can use.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.920
Because Chrome Web Store is a
great distribution point.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.090
It's really easy to build
awesome web apps, and then

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.720
just publish them in
Chrome Web Store.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.050
And then have that as a
point of distribution.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.315
So I think I think that's
something that is very useful.

00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:29.610
The third thing I think that
could be used by developers is

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.675
web apps that run not as the
publisher, but as the user

00:25:32.675 --> 00:25:35.210
[? on a keyboard. ?]

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.130
I'm expecting more and more
developers to leverage that

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.670
capability, as well.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.140
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.970
You get the user's data, which
is so useful and applicable at

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.270
that point.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.740
So we're coming up
on time here.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.520
So we do want to wrap it up.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.010
Hopefully this was a really
useful session for you.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:53.220
You got to see one of the
brain trusts behind our

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.110
product, really kind of give
you the history, what our

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.580
priorities are, some of the
challenges, and the roadmap

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.170
for 2013 and beyond.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.610
And hopefully this
all made sense.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.700
And we look forward to comments
and questions.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.620
And we'll find more ways to
engage the product manager

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.380
team, the engineering
team, and have this

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.480
conversation going.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.560
Thank you very much, Saurabh.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.030
SAURABH GUPTA: Thank
