00:00:00.438 --> 00:00:01.953
- [Instructor] So now
that we have been able

00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:03.737
to express our d sigma,

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.475
I think we're pretty close to evaluating

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.202
the integral itself,

00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.450
and one thing I do wanna point out

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.798
that might have been nagging you

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:11.271
from the end of the last video,

00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.104
at the end of the last video,

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:16.187
I took the principal root
of cosine squared of t,

00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:20.919
and I simplified that to
just being cosine of t.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.247
And you might have said,
"Wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:00:22.247 --> 00:00:25.218
"What if cosine of t evaluated
to a negative number?

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:27.065
"If I then square it,
it would be positive,

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:28.798
"and then if I took the
principal root of that,

00:00:28.798 --> 00:00:30.413
"I would then get the
positive version of it.

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:32.106
"I would essentially
get the absolute value

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:33.490
"of the cosine of t."

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.836
And the reason why we were
able to do this in particular

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.350
in this video or in this problem

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.698
is because we saw t takes on values

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:44.615
between negative pi over two
and positive pi over two.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.621
And so cosine of anything that's either

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.446
in the first or the fourth quadrant,

00:00:48.446 --> 00:00:49.969
so this is t right over here,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.465
the cosine will always be
positive for our purposes,

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.780
for the sake of this surface integral.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.472
Cosine of t is always
going to be positive,

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:00.529
and so in this case,
we don't have to write

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:02.039
absolute value of cosine of t.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.095
We can just write cosine of t,

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:05.734
and so hopefully that makes you satisfied.

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:09.002
That was just based on how
we parameterized the t.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:09.883
Now, that out of the way,

00:01:09.883 --> 00:01:11.871
let's actually evaluate the integral.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.502
Our original integral,

00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:15.944
the original integral, just to remind us,

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.840
was the double, or I should
say the surface integral,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.490
of x squared, d sigma.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.703
We already know what d sigma is.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:26.654
Now we just have to write x squared

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:28.411
in terms of the parameters.

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:31.456
Well, we know the parameterization of x.

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:35.204
The x, in terms of the parameters
right over here is cosine.

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:37.334
This is our parameterization:

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.811
x is going to be equal
to cosine t, cosine of s.

00:01:40.811 --> 00:01:44.978
Let me write that down:
x of s and t is equal to,

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.661
I already forgot, I have a
horrible memory, is equal to,

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:53.292
we have to go back to the
original parameterization,

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:54.540
not these partial derivatives.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.802
Cosine t, cosine s.

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:58.385
Cosine t, cosine s.

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:01.988
Cosine t, and then cosine s,

00:02:05.802 --> 00:02:08.066
and we're taking the
integral of that squared.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.476
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:11.867
So let's just do this
part right over here.

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:15.495
If we square x, we're going to get

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.412
cosine squared t, cosine squared s.

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:22.258
Cosine squared s,

00:02:24.156 --> 00:02:26.414
that's the x squared
part right over there,

00:02:26.414 --> 00:02:27.885
and then you have the d sigma,

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:31.468
which is this stuff,
which is times cosine,

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:34.104
lemme do that same green,

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:36.642
don't wanna confuse you with
different shades of colors,

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:38.809
times cosine of t, ds, dt.

00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:42.994
And now that we have this in terms

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:45.408
of the parameters, the
differentials of parameters,

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.101
this essentially becomes a double integral

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.684
with respect to these two parameters,

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:51.310
and so, and the good thing is

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.042
that the boundary is
pretty straightforward

00:02:53.042 --> 00:02:56.435
with respect to s and t:
s takes on all values,

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.087
s takes on all values
between zero and two pi,

00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:01.932
t takes on all values
between negative two pi,

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:03.913
and, sorry, negative pi over two

00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:06.098
and positive pi over two.

00:03:06.098 --> 00:03:07.723
So first, the way I wrote over here,

00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:10.154
we're gonna integrate
with respect to s first,

00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:13.737
s goes between zero
and two pi, and then t,

00:03:17.374 --> 00:03:19.622
lemme write and make clear, this is s,

00:03:19.622 --> 00:03:24.020
and then t will go between
negative pi over two

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.103
and positive pi over two.

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:30.901
And so let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:33.209
This is equal to the double integral

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.345
over that same region,
over that same area,

00:03:36.345 --> 00:03:39.733
I guess we could call it,
over that same area of,

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:41.976
well now we have this cosine squared of t

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:44.307
and then we have another
cosine of t right over there,

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:45.354
so lemme just right it this way,

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:49.521
as cosine to the third of
t times cosine squared...

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.931
Cosine squared of s, and then ds,

00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:56.801
lemme color code it a little bit,

00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:01.211
ds, and so this is the
integral for the ds part,

00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.211
and then dt.

00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:08.297
And this is when we
integrate with respect to s,

00:04:08.297 --> 00:04:11.024
notice these two, the
t parts and the s part,

00:04:11.024 --> 00:04:12.635
they're just multiplied by each other,

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.716
so when we're taking the
integral with respect to s,

00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:18.984
this cosine cubed of t
really is just a constant,

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:23.151
we can factor it out, and it
could look something like this,

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:28.574
so let me rewrite it, this
could be the integral from,

00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:30.570
t goes from, I'll rewrite the boundaries,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.804
negative pi over two,
to positive pi over two,

00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:37.304
cosine cubed of t, I just factor that out,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.776
and then I'll write the s part,

00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:44.544
times the integral, s is going to go

00:04:44.544 --> 00:04:47.984
between zero and two pi,
and I'll write this in blue,

00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:52.151
cosine squared of s, ds, and
then you have dt out there,

00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:57.926
you have dt, I'm gonna do the dt in green,

00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:04.835
gimme that same green, dt.

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:07.604
And now, this outer sum we can view it,

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:09.974
you essentially view it as the product,

00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:12.217
well, of all of this
business right over here,

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:15.591
this thing has no t's
involved in it whatsoever,

00:05:15.591 --> 00:05:17.508
so we can rewrite this,

00:05:18.358 --> 00:05:21.245
and I'll write all the stuff
involving the t's as green.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:24.412
So we can rewrite this as pi over two,

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:28.643
from negative pi over two, to pi over two,

00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:31.976
cosine cubed of t dt times the integral,

00:05:34.594 --> 00:05:36.189
and I'm really just rearranging things,

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.184
I guess you could kind of view this

00:05:37.184 --> 00:05:38.598
as the associative property,

00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:40.541
or I guess the commutative property.

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.544
Well those things always confuse me,

00:05:42.544 --> 00:05:45.544
times the integral of zero to two pi

00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:51.531
of cosine squared of s, ds,

00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:52.579
and you didn't have to do it this way,

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:54.229
you could've just evaluated it

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.510
while it was kind of mixed like this,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.195
but this'll help us kind
of work through the,

00:05:58.195 --> 00:06:01.622
the trigonometry a little bit easier.

00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:03.090
Now to solve these two integrals,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.875
we just have to resort
to our trigonometry.

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:10.042
Cosine squared of s, we can
rewrite that as 1/2 plus one,

00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:14.095
actually let me do that
in that same blue color

00:06:14.095 --> 00:06:15.604
so we don't get confused.

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:19.771
That is the same thing as
1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of two s,

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:27.221
and cosine cubed t, well
that's the same thing,

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.804
let's see, we can factor
out a cosine of t,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.856
so let me rewrite, ah let's just do it,

00:06:35.856 --> 00:06:37.742
well let me just do it,
both at the same time,

00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:39.557
just get all the trigonometry out of way.

00:06:39.557 --> 00:06:43.165
This right over here can
be rewritten as cosine of t

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:47.332
times cosine squared of t,
and the intuition here is,

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.574
if we can get a product
of a sine doing something

00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:54.468
with a cosine, because
cosine is sine's derivative,

00:06:54.468 --> 00:06:56.242
that's kind of, y'know, u-substitution,

00:06:56.242 --> 00:06:57.930
you see a function and its derivative,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.682
you can just kind of
treat it as a variable,

00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:02.283
so that's what we're trying
to get to right over here.

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:04.535
So cosine squared of t can be rewritten

00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:06.233
as one minus sine squared of t,

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:10.400
so this is cosine of t times
one minus sine squared of t.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.067
And so we can rewrite this as cosine of t

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:18.150
minus cosine of t, sine squared of t,

00:07:19.263 --> 00:07:20.096
and you might say "Wait,

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:22.133
"this looked a lot simpler
than this down here."

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:23.902
That is true, it looks simpler,

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:25.933
but it's easier to take
the antiderivative of this,

00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:28.136
easier to take the
antiderivative of cosine of t,

00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:30.512
and even over here, you have derivative

00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:32.513
of sine of t, which is cosine of t,

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:34.754
and so essentially you
can do u-substitution,

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.964
which you probably can
do in your head now.

00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:39.433
So let's evaluate each of these integrals.

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:41.722
So this one, let me rewrite them

00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:42.833
just so we don't get too confused,

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:45.754
so we have the integral
from negative pi over two,

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:48.254
to pi over two, of cosine of t

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:53.623
minus cosine of t, sine squared of t, dt,

00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:02.038
times the integral from zero to two pi

00:08:04.516 --> 00:08:08.683
of 1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of 2s, d s.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:15.448
Now we are ready to take
some antiderivatives,

00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:19.685
the antiderivative of this
right over here is going to be,

00:08:19.685 --> 00:08:23.852
the antiderivative of cosine
t, well that's just sine t,

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:26.122
and then right over here,

00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:29.102
the derivative of sine t is cosine of t.

00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:30.592
So we can just essentially,

00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:32.126
if you wanna do
u-substitution, you would say,

00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:36.709
u is equal to sine of t, d u
is equal to cosine of t, dt,

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:37.994
and you do all of that, but the,

00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:39.693
what we probably cannot
do in your head is,

00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:41.679
okay, I have the sine
t's derivative there,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.084
so I can treat sine t just
like I would treat a t,

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:45.312
or I would treat an x.

00:08:45.312 --> 00:08:47.852
So this is going to be, you
still have this negative sign,

00:08:47.852 --> 00:08:51.185
minus sine to the third of t over three,

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.272
if this was just a t squared,

00:08:56.272 --> 00:08:59.120
the antiderivative would be
t to the third over three,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.837
but now since we have a derivative,

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:02.899
we can kind of treat it the same way,

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:06.103
which is essentially doing
u-substitution in our head.

00:09:06.103 --> 00:09:08.757
So that's that, and we're
going to evaluate it

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:12.709
from negative pi over two, to pi over two.

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:16.193
And so this is equal to, if
you evaluate it at pi over two,

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.443
sine of pi over two is one.

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.758
So it's one minus 1/3, so that's just 2/3,

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:28.117
actually lemme not write it that way,

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:29.240
I don't wanna confuse people,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.192
and then minus sine of
negative pi over two,

00:09:33.192 --> 00:09:36.712
well that's going to
be negative one minus,

00:09:36.712 --> 00:09:38.203
sine of negative pi over two is

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.837
negative one to the third
power is negative one,

00:09:39.837 --> 00:09:42.754
so this is negative 1/3.

00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:48.473
And so this is going to
be equal to, this is 2/3,

00:09:48.473 --> 00:09:52.640
and this is negative one plus
1/3, which is negative 2/3,

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:55.736
but then you have a negative out front,

00:09:55.736 --> 00:09:57.665
so this is plus 2/3 again.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:01.377
So this part at least evaluates to 4/3.

00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:03.712
This part, all this, is
really the home stretch,

00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:05.860
that all evaluates to 4/3.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.080
Now this part right over here,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.247
antiderivative of 1/2 is just 1/2 t,

00:10:13.908 --> 00:10:16.491
antiderivative of cosine of 2s,

00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.262
well, ideally you would
have a two out front here,

00:10:21.262 --> 00:10:23.207
out front, lemme write
and make this clear,

00:10:23.207 --> 00:10:24.934
so if I were to take the antiderivative

00:10:24.934 --> 00:10:29.605
of cosine of 2s, ideally you
would want a two out here,

00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:31.681
so you have the derivative of the 2s,

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:34.401
so you could put a two out front,

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.201
but then you would have
to put a 1/2 out front

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:38.236
so that you're not
changing the value of it,

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:41.142
and of course you would
have a ds right over here.

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:42.883
I'm just taking a general antiderivative,

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:44.288
but once you have it like this,

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:45.154
then this just like taking

00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:47.466
the antiderivative of cosine of s.

00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:50.717
This becomes, antiderivative
of cosine is sine.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:53.446
So this will become sine of s.

00:10:53.446 --> 00:10:57.596
So this right over here is just sine of s,

00:10:57.596 --> 00:11:02.532
and then you have the
1/2 out front, times 1/2,

00:11:02.532 --> 00:11:04.382
but then of course,
and then you would have

00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:06.687
plus a constant if you were
taking an indefinite integral,

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:07.890
but we're taking a definite one,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.491
so you don't have to
worry about the constant,

00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:13.074
so just the antiderivative
of cosine of 2s,

00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:18.108
just the antiderivative of
cosine of 2s is 1/2 sine of s.

00:11:18.108 --> 00:11:19.806
And so you have this constant out front,

00:11:19.806 --> 00:11:22.243
1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4.

00:11:22.243 --> 00:11:26.410
So it's going to be plus 1/4 sine of 2s.

00:11:32.586 --> 00:11:34.017
That's the antiderivative,

00:11:34.017 --> 00:11:37.534
and now we're going to evaluate
it from zero to two pi,

00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:38.836
and in either situation,

00:11:38.836 --> 00:11:40.650
this thing's going to evaluate to zero.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.164
Sine of zero is zero,
sine of four pi is zero,

00:11:44.164 --> 00:11:48.531
and so you're gonna have 1/2
times two pi, which is just pi,

00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.589
plus zero, 'cause sine of four pi is zero,

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:55.756
minus 1/2 times zero, zero;
1/4 times sine of zero, zero,

00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:59.022
so you're essentially
just gonna end up with pi,

00:11:59.022 --> 00:12:02.180
so this whole thing right
over here evaluates to pi.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.221
And so we're done!

00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:06.467
You take the product of these
two things, 4/3 times pi,

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:10.634
our entire surface integral
evaluates to: 4/3 pi.

00:12:12.318 --> 00:12:16.795
So this is equal to 4/3 pi, which is neat!

00:12:16.795 --> 00:12:19.284
If you have a sphere of radius one,

00:12:19.284 --> 00:12:23.371
its surface area, or actually
no, I shouldn't even go that,

00:12:23.371 --> 00:12:25.913
because, let me be very careful.

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:27.344
I shouldn't make that statement,

00:12:27.344 --> 00:12:30.237
because this wasn't just
with respect to one.

00:12:30.237 --> 00:12:33.296
But, we have at least
evaluated the surface integral,

00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:37.046
and we deserve, I think,
a bit of a rest now.
