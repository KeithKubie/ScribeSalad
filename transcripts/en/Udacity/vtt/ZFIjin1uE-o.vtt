00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's probe your knowledge of interpreting HTML

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and JavaScript and evaluating expressions.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here I've written four claims.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can interpret an expression by recursivly walking its abstract syntax tree.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To interpret the HTML we covered in class,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we need an environment.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To interpret the JavaScript we covered in class,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we need an environment.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And finally, interpreting always produces a value or an error.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Mark each one that's true.
