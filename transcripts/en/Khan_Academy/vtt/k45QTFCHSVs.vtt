00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.740
So we're told that
AE is equal to 12.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.470
That's this side
right over here.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.865
And EC is equal to 18.

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:13.470
And then they've drawn a bunch
of the medians here for us.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.350
So we know that they are medians
because, when they intersect

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.100
the opposite side, they're
telling us that this length is

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.900
equal to this length, or
that ED is equal to DC,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.070
CB is equal to BA,
AF is equal to FE,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.735
or that F, B, and
D are the midpoints

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.560
and that G, then, would
be the centroid where

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.310
the medians intersect.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.710
And so the first thing they ask
us is, what is the area of BGC?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.460
So BGC right here.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.280
That is this triangle
right over there.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.780
And to figure out
that area, we just

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.850
have to remind ourselves that
the three medians of a triangle

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.702
divide a triangle into six
triangles that have equal area.

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:57.160
So if we know the area of the
entire triangle-- and I think

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.410
we can figure this out.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.610
This is a right triangle.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.770
They're telling us that.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.662
AE-- this entire distance right
over here-- is going to be 12.

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:05.745
So this is going to be 12.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.560
Let me make sure I
have enough space.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.450
This entire distance
right over here is 18.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.800
They tell us that.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.530
So the area of
AEC is going to be

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.480
equal to 1/2 times
the base-- which

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.950
is 18-- times the height--
which is 12-- which

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.520
is equal to 9 times
12, which is 108.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.340
That's the area of this entire
right triangle, triangle AEC.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.550
If we want the area of BGC or
any of these smaller of the six

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.830
triangles-- if we ignore
this little altitude

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.060
right over here, the ones that
are bounded by the medians--

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.005
then we just have
to divide this by 6.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.380
Because they all
have equal area.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.160
We've proven that
in a previous video.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.480
So the area of BGC is
equal to the area of AEC,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.120
the entire triangle, divided by
6, which is 108 divided by 6.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.950
Which is what?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.765
It's 60-- let's see.

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:05.880
You get 10 and then 48.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.070
Looks like it would be 18.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.735
It would be 18.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:10.110
And that's right
because it would

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.239
be-- 108 is the same
thing as 18 times 6.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.280
So we did our first part.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.400
The area of that right
over there is 18.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.900
And if we wanted,
we could say, hey,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.760
the area of any of
these triangles--

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300
the ones that are bounded
by the medians-- this

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.250
is going to be 18.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.520
This is going to be 18.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.310
This entire FGE triangle
is going to be 18,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.900
but we did this first
part right over there.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.240
Now they ask us, what
is the length of AG?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.090
So AG is the distance.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.520
It's the longer part of
this median right over here.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.365
And to figure out
what AG is, we just

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.300
have to remind ourselves
that the centroid is always

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.570
2/3 along the way
of the medians,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.230
or it divides the
median into two segments

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.100
that have a ratio of 2 to 1.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.200
So if we know the entire
length of this median,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.880
we could just take 2/3 of that.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.430
And that'll give us
the length of AG.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.200
And lucky for us, this
is a right triangle.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.670
And we know that F and
D are the midpoints.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.930
So for example, we
know this AE is 12.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.700
That was given.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.150
We know that ED is
half of this 18.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.450
So ED right over here--
I'll do this in a new color.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.150
ED is going to be 9.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.760
So then we could just use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.530
to figure out what AD is.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.000
AD is the hypotenuse
of this right triangle.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.920
So we're looking at
triangle AED right now.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
Let me write this down.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.310
We know that 12
squared plus 9 squared

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.513
is going to be
equal to AD squared.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.210
12 squared is 144.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.200
144 plus 81.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.290
And so this is going to
be equal to AD squared.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.360
So this is what?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.490
This is 225.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.350
So we have 225 is
equal to AD squared.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.560
And 225, you may or may not
recognize, is 15 squared.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.489
So AD is equal to 15.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.780
You want to take the principal
root, the positive root,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.570
because we're talking about
distances or lengths of sides.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.140
We don't care about
the negatives.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.700
So AD is equal to 15.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.500
So this whole thing
right over here

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.620
is going to be equal to 15.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.253
And AG is going to be 2/3 of AD.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.310
We proved that in
a previous video,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.312
that the centroid is
2/3 along the way of any

00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:44.020
of these medians.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.769
And we could do it for
any of the medians.

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:52.680
So it's equal to 2/3 times
15, which is equal to 10.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.070
So AG right over
here is equal to 10.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.340
So we did the second part.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.397
Now, this third part,
what is the area of FGH?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.210
So let me color it in-- FGH.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.970
So if we knew this length-- if
we knew HG and if we knew FH--

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.540
we could easily figure
out what that area is.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.230
And there's actually
multiple ways

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.550
of figuring out either
one of those things.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.430
So one way that we can think
about finding what HG is

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.150
is to remind
ourselves that HG is

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.640
the altitude of either
triangle FGE or triangle AFG.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.850
And both of them
have a base of 6.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.680
So this is 6, and
this is 6 over here.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.360
And then they have a
height equal to GH.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.810
And we know what the area is.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.070
We know that the area
is already equal to 18.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.520
So let's take this
triangle up here.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.920
So we're talking about
the area of triangle AFG.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.480
So we know it's 1/2
times its base, which

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.660
is 6, times its height,
which is GH-- times GH.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.250
That's just 1/2
base times height

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.370
is equal to the area
of this triangle, which

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.230
is going to be equal to 18.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.580
And so then, we just have
to tell ourselves, well,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.860
this is-- 3 times
GH is equal to 18.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.300
If we divide both sides of
this by 3, GH is equal to 6.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.900
So that is one way to do it.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.960
GH is equal to 6.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.020
You could have also made
the similarity argument.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.720
Then you could have said,
look, this triangle up here

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.230
is similar to this larger
triangle over here.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.420
This hypotenuse is 2/3 of the
length of this entire thing.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.795
So this is going to
be 2/3 of this 9.

00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:57.170
So that's another way that
you could have gotten 6 there.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.470
But either way, we
got this length.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.860
Now we just have to
figure out what FH is.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.190
And we could figure out what
FH is if we know what AH is.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.220
Because we know A to F is 6.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.810
So FH is going to
be AH minus AF.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.190
So let's figure out what AH is.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.456
Well, once again, we can
make a similarity argument.

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:20.830
And if we want to
do it formally,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.330
we see that both this larger
right triangle and the smaller

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.380
right triangle, both have
a 90-degree angle there.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.630
They both have this
angle in common.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.190
So they have two
angles in common.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.020
They are definitely
similar triangles.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.050
And so we know the ratio of
AH-- let me do it in orange.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.590
We know that the ratio
of AH to AE-- which

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.330
is 12-- is equal to
the ratio of AG-- which

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.230
is 10-- to the ratio of AD--
which we already figured out

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.170
was 15.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.022
So one way to think about it
is AH is going to be 2/3 of 12.

00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:01.980
Or we can just work
through the math just using

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.560
the similar triangles.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.410
So this right-hand side
over here is just 2/3.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.460
And so AH-- multiplying
both sides by 12--

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.700
is equal to 2/3 times
12, which is just 8.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.970
So AH here is 8.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.640
AH is 8.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.860
AF is 6.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.129
So FH right over here
is going to be 2.

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:28.670
And so now we have
enough information

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.409
to figure out the area of FHG.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.669
So let me write it over here.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.270
It's going to be
1/2 times the base.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.360
I'll just use FH
as the base here,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.490
although I could
do it either way.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.299
Well, I'll use FH as the base.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:49.490
1/2 times 2 times the height--
times 6-- which is equal to 6.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.329
And we are done.

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:52.370
And you could keep going.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.880
You could figure out the
length of pretty much

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.280
all of these segments here
using some of these techniques

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.290
or any of these areas.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.370
Well, we've actually
figured out most of them.
