00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.790
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Today, the
program is entitled The Origins

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.240
of the Military-Industrial
Complex.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.670
It features CRS specialist
in national defense,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.370
Dr. Daniel Else, who's sitting
right here in front of me,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.410
who is this year's
Kluge Staff Fellow,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.490
which is really a
prestigious position.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.200
While at the Kluge Center,
Dan has been using items

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.730
from the Library collections
to investigate the origins

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.350
of the military-industrial
complex through the wartime

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.100
and immediate post-war,
meaning post-World War II,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.440
evolution of the relationship

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580
between scientific research
industry and national defense.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.790
Dan's been at CRS a long time.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.980
He's advised Congress
on defense issues.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.480
I was a colleague of his
at CRS for several years.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.040
Dan did things that were in
connection to what I knew

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.100
and a whole range of things
-- Defense Production Act,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.470
Military Construction
Appropriations,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.380
and he does many more
things there at CRS

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.610
where he will be
returning later this fall.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.700
He holds a Ph.D. in
Political Science

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.520
from George Washington
University,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
and as many of you know,
at CRS, he's the author

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.940
of numerous reports on
defense trade and security.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.980
This project is the
latest example of the kind

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.920
of work undertaken
by staff fellows,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.160
showcasing their
knowledge and passion

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.780
about their areas of expertise.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.280
This is funded by the gift
left by the late John W. Kluge

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.100
that founded the Kluge
Center back in 2000.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330
The staff fellow is one of
nearly a hundred scholars

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.630
who pass through the
center each year.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.300
It has been our privilege to
have Dan with us for the bulk

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.790
of the last year and
during his tenure here.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.510
Please join me in welcoming Dan.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.910
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Daniel Else: Okay,
well, thank you very much.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.680
How's this working?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.360
Okay? All right.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.060
All right, this is an
inquiry into the evolution

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.890
of what President
Dwight D. Eisenhower

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
in his Farewell Address to the
Nation on January 17, 1961,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.240
dubbed The Military-Industrial
Complex.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.950
Exactly what Ike meant by that
term has been debated ever

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.680
since, but for the purposes
of this talk, let's regard it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.630
as a perceived informal
alliance between a portion

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.580
of the nation's scientific
and technological community,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.610
its defense establishment,
and certain sectors

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.780
of the country's
industrial base.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.960
Specifically, we'll focus

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.340
on a World War II
temporary government agency

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.710
that was created in 1940
and passed out of existence

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.750
at the end of 1947: the
Office of Scientific Research

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.550
and Development, or OSRD.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.720
This year, I've been trying

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.620
to answer three relatively
narrow research questions.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.420
Why did OSRD exist?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.560
Why do those who have
studied OSRD consider it

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.770
to have been superbly effective?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.890
And what are its legacies,
and are there echoes of OSRD

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.790
that we can hear today?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.940
I owe a great deal of thanks
to a number of individuals

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.520
who have conspired to make
this inquiry possible:

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.930
the 2016 Kluge Scholars Council,
who plucked my application

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.700
from the pile and deemed
it worthy of attention;

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.570
the then-acting Librarian
of Congress, David Mao,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.460
for appointing me to the
position; the dedicated staff

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.690
of the Kluge Center itself.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.970
I and my fellow fellows
have wanted

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.170
for nothing during
our stays here.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.890
They include Emily Coccia,
Travis Hensley, Anastasia Jones,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.990
Mary Lou Reker, Daniel Torello,
and he who must not be named,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.440
the brand new Kluge Center
director, John Haskell.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.830
The other stars in this drama
are the fantastic resources

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.220
of the Library of
Congress itself.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.370
I have wallowed through
the library for a full year

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.960
and barely touched upon its
resources that bear directly

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.660
on my own small project.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.210
There are, of course, the stacks
and stacks of books maintained

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.660
by the Collections and Services
Division, under Helena Zinkham;

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.200
the online catalogs that
guide you and through

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400
which these treasures are
brought to you; the e-journals

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.260
that stretch back
decades; the databases

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.040
of congressional documents
and the laws of the land.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.720
Special mention is merited
for two unique resources:

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.910
the most complete collection
of technical reports prepared

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.080
under contract to the OSRD,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.060
along with scientific
intelligence gathered

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.290
by the Alsace missions to the
European and Pacific theatres

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.490
of operation, which are
curated here by Lawrence Marcus

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.890
and his colleagues in
the Library's Automation,

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.400
Collection, Support, and
Technical Reports section.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.160
And the Personal Papers
collection entrusted

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.950
to Jeffrey Flannery and the crew

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.040
of the Library's
Manuscripts division.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.090
They, with some help
from their contemporaries

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.390
at the Franklin Roosevelt

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.200
and Harry Truman Presidential
Libraries, and archivists

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.620
at the Harvard University
and Massachusetts Institute

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.850
of Technology provided
the material

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.990
from which this study has come.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.660
And by the way, the
relevance of the holdings

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.220
at the library were highlighted
by an inquiry today received

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.860
by Lawrence Marcus and his crew

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.090
for a specific OSRD technical
report that is wanted

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.480
by another government agency.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.670
If there's a central
figure to this story,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.900
it's Dr. Vannevar Bush.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.630
Vannevar rhymes with
"achiever," or in his case,

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.000
perhaps, "over-achiever."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.430
An inveterate inventor,

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.960
professor of electrical
engineering at MIT

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.980
and co-founder of the
company now known as Raytheon,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.800
he was Dean of MIT's School
of Electrical Engineering

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.430
and the institute's
vice-president before he moved

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.710
to the capital at the
beginning of 1938 to take

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.890
up the directorship of
the Carnegie Institute

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.130
of Washington, now known as the
Carnegie Institute for Science.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.560
During World War II, he
was appointed as chair

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.120
of the National Defense
Research Committee

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.850
and later became the director
of its umbrella organization,

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.830
the Office of Scientific
Research and Development,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.070
and became the unofficial
scientific advisor

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.450
to President Franklin Roosevelt.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.420
These wartime organizations
exerted a profound influence

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.590
on the impact of technology
on the conduct of the war,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.120
including the introduction
of atomic weapons

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.160
and the ensuing post-war
relationship

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.190
between the federal government
and scientific research

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.390
that has developed since 1945.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.820
Today, government support
for scientific research,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.780
especially at the most basic
level, is taken for granted.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.160
This was not always the case.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.050
Traditionally, what passed for
scientific inquiry was supported

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.640
by individual fortunes
or by wealthy sponsors.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.030
After the creation of the
United States, even inquisitive,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.390
science-minded chief
executives found it difficult

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.450
to expand support for
American science beyond private

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.270
philanthropy, primarily
due to the strict reading

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.960
of the Constitution by
states' rights advocates.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.440
There was no explicit
mandate to support science,

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.200
so any federal support to
efforts such as the Lewis

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.350
and Clark Expedition,
the founding

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.300
of the Naval Observatory in
1830, or geological surveying

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.760
and mapping projects
had to be justified

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.580
under the Constitution's
Article I, Section Eight:

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.370
admonition of Congress
to regulate commerce

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.580
with foreign nations and
among the several states

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.030
and with the Indian tribes.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.870
Thus, science had to
be good for business.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.510
In the middle of all this,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.260
a wealthy British chemist
inadvertently threw a

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.610
constitutional hand grenade.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.800
James Smithson, never
married and without children,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.470
died in 1829, leaving
his considerable estate

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.890
to his nephew.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.000
Said nephew, likewise
unmarried and without heirs,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.040
had the audacity to pass
away himself in 1835.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.840
Anticipating this, Smithson has
stipulated that the next use

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.020
of his endowment would be
to found in Washington,

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.400
a place he had never
visited, under the name

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.940
of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.430
for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.610
Congress belatedly
accepted the bequest in 1838

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.690
and started seven
years of haggling

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.900
over what the ensuing
institution should be:

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.650
a library, a university, a
museum, or something else.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.130
Its first secretary,
Joseph Henry,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.710
steered it into becoming a
center for scientific learning.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.800
At the same time, the benefits
of scientific enhancements

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.250
to the nation's dominant
agriculture economy were

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.350
becoming apparent, especially
along the agriculture-dominated

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.020
frontier of the Midwest.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.460
Prodded by Professor
Jonathan Baldwin Turner

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.760
of Illinois College,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.370
Representative Justin
Smith Morrow

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.730
of Vermont introduced a bill in
Congress in 1857 to grant tracts

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.530
of federal land to the
states for the purposes

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.250
of established agricultural
colleges.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.280
It finally passed both houses
in 1859, but was vetoed

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.120
by President James Buchanan

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.410
on a strictly delineated
constitutional grounds argument.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.630
The states' rights obstacle
soon resolved itself,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.590
though, through secession.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.050
When the congressional
delegations

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.060
of the 11 seceded Southern
states absented themselves

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.360
from Washington,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.240
Morrow reintroduced his land
grant bill, which was an Act

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.610
in 1862, giving us what are now
known as land grant colleges.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.310
Upon the outbreak
of the Civil War,

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.140
all manner of inventors
flocked to the capital to offer

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.120
up their devices
for the war effort.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.090
We've all heard stories
of individuals showing

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.210
up at the War and Navy
Departments and even

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.140
at the White House, eager

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.260
to demonstrate the
effectiveness of their projects.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.410
It soon got so bad
that the Secretary

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.100
of the Navy appointed a Navy
Department permanent commission

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.640
of three scientists to screen
the flood of suggestions.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.090
At the same time, a group
of three scientists --

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.540
Alexander Basch, a geographer,
Louis Agassiz, a biologist,

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.940
and Henry David -- excuse
me -- Charles Henry Davis,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.310
a Navy astronomer --
persuaded Senator Henry Wilson

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.850
of Massachusetts
to introduce a bill

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.110
that would put a new scientific
community at the service

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.680
of the federal government
to investigate, experiment,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.680
and report on any
subject when requested

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.610
by a federal department.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.220
The bill was one among
dozens that were enacted

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.880
on the last day of the lame duck
session of the 37th Congress

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.700
and that established the
National Academy of Sciences.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.220
After 1865, American
inventiveness turned away

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.890
from war and toward
commerce and industry.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.740
Development of the lands of the
West did promote some agencies

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.850
to investigate natural
resources.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.440
The Department of Agriculture,
the Department of Commerce

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.230
and Labor, and the National
Park Service appeared during

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.640
this period.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.210
While government research
tended toward the applied end

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.630
of the research spectrum,

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.670
newly-created private
foundations,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.250
such as the Rockefeller
Foundation

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.250
and the Carnegie Institute
of Washington, supported much

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.300
of the nation's basic
scientific research.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.810
Military technology, though,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.240
continued to advance among the
European nations, particularly

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.390
in Germany, Britain, and France.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.260
Military aircraft,
submarines, poison gas,

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.490
and the machine gun
revolutionized warfare,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.550
and when the United States
entered the conflict in 1917,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.950
the country found that it had
to mobilize the entire economy

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.640
and society for war and that
advancing science needed

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.020
to be applied to weapons
and industrial development.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.790
In the event, though, the
conflict provided a number

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.510
of lessons on how not to do it.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.540
Neutrality before 1917 inhibited
any pre-hostility preparation;

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.250
to the extent that they could,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.610
existing federal laboratories
including the newly-created

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.010
National Advisory
Committee on aeronautics --

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.310
NASA's predecessor -- possessed
considerable scientific

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.110
expertise, but they were
oriented toward peacetime

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.220
development, and once the U.S.
entered the war, had no contact

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.960
with the War or Navy
Departments.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.710
Secretary of the Navy
Josephus Daniels tried

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.690
to replicate the
Civil War experience

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.650
by asking Thomas Edison to
head a Naval Consulting Board

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.710
of scientists and engineers
to solicit suggestions

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.570
for solving some of the
Navy's pressing problems

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.730
such as submarine detection.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.620
Other bodies set up
through legislation

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.450
and emergency powers included
a Council of National Defense,

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.280
which, like other
temporary wartime agencies,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.240
suffered from ill-defined
mission and authority.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.120
The National Academy
of Sciences,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.330
unable to assist organically,
suggested to President Wilson

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.530
that a National Research
Council be established

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.280
under its authority to
organize war research outside

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.250
of its own membership.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.190
After the U.S. entry
into the war,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.050
the Council on National Defense
brought the National Research

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.960
Council under its wing
as its research arm

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.000
and the Naval Consulting Board
as its board of inventions.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.560
However, military departments
favored direct control

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.790
over the research that
might affect its operations.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.410
In addition, there were
just no specific legal means

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.410
for the Army or Navy to funnel
appropriated funds to civilians

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.390
for specific scientific work.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.870
Therefore, the principal means

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.440
by which technology found its
way into the war effort was

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.040
through the temporary
commissioning of scientists

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.860
and engineers into the
services themselves.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.350
Thus, between the relatively
disorganized efforts

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.450
of the Council on
National Defense,

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.990
the federal civilian
laboratories,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.580
and the military
services, technology

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.930
and even industry could not hit
its stride before the Armistice

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.660
of November 1918.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.710
Demobilization began as soon
as the guns fell silent.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.360
Scientists surrendered
their commissions

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.450
and the Naval Consulting Board
effectively ceased to exist.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.400
Federal laboratories returned
to peacetime pursuits,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.210
the National Research
Council turned

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.300
from organizing wartime
scientific research

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.750
to the promotion of civilian
scientific societies,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.800
and it soon ceased to use
any government funding.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.620
After the war, the NACA
continued a vigorous,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.340
if sparely funded, program
of aeronautical research.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.370
The Council of National
Defense, though,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.060
had outlived its usefulness
and was suspended in 1921.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.020
Nevertheless, the Naval
Consulting Board had

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.760
recommended, back in 1916,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.390
that the Navy create its
own research facility.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.650
Because various factions
could not agree on a site

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.400
for the facility, the Naval
Research Laboratory was not

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.130
commissioned in any
[inaudible] until 1926.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.620
All government science until
now had been concentrated

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.580
on the natural sciences, but the
burgeoning industrial economy,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.610
overtaking traditional
agriculture and the advent

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.170
of government planning and
Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal --

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.520
with those, the importance

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.350
of social sciences
came to the fore.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.700
For example, in the form
of Ethelbert Stewart

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:48.360
of the National Bureau of
Labor Statistics, on the left,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.130
and Secretary of
Agriculture Henry Wallace.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.800
FDR appointed Karl Compton,
a physicist and president

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.300
of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.870
in 1933 to head a
Science Advisory Board.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.140
Funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.740
for there was no appropriation,
the board tapped academics

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.210
and industrial scientists
to study the organization

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.400
of various government bureaus.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.470
In the course of its limited
life, the board suggested

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.150
that the study of basic science
underpinned all other research

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.490
and should become
an end in itself.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.100
It also proposed a New Deal for
science, using government funds

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.150
to support research
at universities.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.320
Compton's plan, however, proved
too ambitious and was resisted

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.120
by another FDR-appointed body,
the National Resources Board,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.190
which was headed by FDR's
uncle, Frederic Delano.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.910
Ultimately, Compton's plan
failed to gain sponsorship.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.790
Military research during the
interwar period was minimal,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.290
and a small anecdote
may explain why.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.610
In 1934, a board headed
by former Secretary

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.310
of War Newton Baker recommended
strengthening Army research

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.050
and development above the
equivalent of $74 million

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.140
that it was in the early 1930s.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.110
The Army General staff in
the person of Deputy Chief

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.150
of Staff General Stanley Embick
responded by concluding that

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.830
"the Army needs large quantities
of excellent equipment

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.420
that has already
been developed."

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.720
The outbreak of World War II

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.320
and the high technology weaponry
immediately deployed gave lie

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.590
to such an attitude, and some

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.170
within the nation's
technology community responded.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.270
In large part, that
response took the form

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.480
of a new National Defense
Research Committee, or NDRC.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.200
The three individuals most
responsible for its creation

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.040
and effectiveness
were Vannevar Bush,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.900
President of the Carnegie
Institute of Washington;

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.940
James Conant, a physicist
and the president

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.500
of Harvard University;
and Karl Compton.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.590
They and others used the
experience of World War I

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.470
and Compton's 1930s studies to
develop a different organization

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.010
for supporting the
coming war effort.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.200
The lead individual was Bush,
who used his relationship

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.620
with Frederic Delano to gain
an audience in early 1940

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.530
with FDR's close
advisor, Harry Hopkins.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.500
At that meeting, he
outlined an organization

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.070
that could leverage the
prestige of its central actors

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.660
to become the interface between
the existing university research

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.380
organization and the War
and Navy Departments.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.540
Revising and using the existing
authority of the Council

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.350
of National Defense,

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.170
Bush proposed a National
Defense Research Committee

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.550
that would be created by the
president within his Office

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.520
for Emergency Management

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.700
under his special emergency
powers that existed in 1940.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.840
The committee would be
empowered to support research

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.430
on the mechanisms of warfare,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.970
except where those activities
would overlap with the NACA

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.230
or the War or Navy Departments.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.680
Importantly, this NDRC would
undertake its own research

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.820
on instrumentalities, methods,
and materials of warfare.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.110
Lacking any direct
statutory authority,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.610
the NDRC would be funded by
the president's emergency funds

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.860
that had been made
available to him by Congress.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.100
Hopkins persuaded FDR to meet
with Bush on June 16th, 1940,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.020
and the president gave
his immediate approval.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:30.150
The NDRC officially
stood up on 27 June 1940.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.030
The organizers knew
that the efforts

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.730
of the previous war
floundered in part

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.120
because of the separation
between military services

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.220
and the research organization.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.160
Therefore, the committee
included senior representation

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.560
of both the War and Navy
Departments and Bush,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.660
reporting directly
to the President,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.470
was able to cultivate close
relationships with the Secretary

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.530
of War and with the
Secretary of the Navy.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.890
Scientific societies were
represented by Frank Jewett,

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.060
the president of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.930
who also happened to be the
director of Bell Laboratories,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.830
thus involving industry.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.470
Conway Coe, the commissioner
of patents,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:09.770
was also on the committee along

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.830
with James Conant
and Karl Compton.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.690
The Navy was represented by
Rear Admiral Harvey Bowen,

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.800
who was the director of
the Navy Research Lab,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.710
and the Army assigned a
Brigadier General G.B. Strong.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.420
As originally organized, the
NDRC set up five divisions

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.820
to break down war research
into manageable disciplines.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.270
The intended vehicle for
prosecuting studies was

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.620
to let contracts to
existing university

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.320
and industry laboratories
for the development

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.530
of various mechanisms and
other techniques useful

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.410
to prosecuting the war.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.840
Where individual labs
might not prove helpful,

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.110
the NDRC contracted
with universities

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.130
to establish purpose-built
research centers.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.090
One such laboratory was
MIT's radiation laboratory,

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.050
or Rad lab, that
specialized in the development

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.830
of airborne radar and
navigation systems.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.850
It soon became overloaded
so a second laboratory,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.350
the Radio Research Lab,

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.670
was created at nearby Harvard
University to specialize

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:12.340
in electronic countermeasures
such as radar chaff.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.950
Things soon got more
complicated, and in 1942,

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.840
NDRC reorganized
into 23 separate

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.140
subordinate organizations.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.540
It didn't stop there,
though, as the Council

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.610
of National Defense
brought other organizations

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.960
under its umbrella.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.690
It soon became apparent that
the NDRC would be more effective

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.730
if it expanded its mandate.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.870
Therefore, on June 28, 1941,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.940
FDR signed an executive
order establishing the Office

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.910
of Scientific Research
and Development, or OSRD,

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.190
and appointed Vannevar
Bush as its director.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.440
OSRD tied itself closely to the
relevant government agencies

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.660
through its advisory council,
which consisted of Harvey Bundy,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.990
an assistant to the secretary
of war, and also the father

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.480
of McGeorge Bundy,
who you may --

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.790
some, those of us of a
certain age may have heard of.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:14.900
James Conant, now the chair of
the NDRC, Rear Admiral JA Furor,

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.320
the coordinator of research and
development at the Department

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.260
of the Navy, Jerome
Hunsaker, chair of the NACA,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.130
and Dr. A.N. Richards, the chair

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.870
of the newly established
Committee on Medical Research.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.220
Because coordination with
the British had been close

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.490
since the creation of the NDRC,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.910
the OSRD established a
liaison office in London,

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.810
and with the Office of
Strategic Services, or OSS,

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.000
CIA's predecessor, getting,
which was getting involved

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.860
in unconventional warfare.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.360
So Bush created a liaison with
General Donovan's organization.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.660
Subordinate to OSRD was the
expanded NDRC, the Committee

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.950
on Medical Research, which
organized development

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.470
of medicines, such
as penicillin,

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.480
and also developed
psychological studies --

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.670
things like what was
called battle fatigue,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.910
etc. were studied.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.750
The Office of Field Services,
which deployed scientists

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.040
to combat theaters to
assist with the introduction

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.900
of newly developed devices and
techniques to combat commands

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.660
and which staffed the
Alsos intelligence missions

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.420
mentioned earlier.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.090
The Obligatory Office of
the Executive Secretary,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.840
which kept everything running,

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.910
and several special
sub-organizations.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.530
Three of these organizations
are worthy of special note.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.520
Section T developed
the proximity fuse,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.810
also called a variable
time or VT fuse.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.200
This fuse caused an antiaircraft
shell or artillery shell

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.650
to explode when it
reached a specific distance

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.420
from an object, such as
an airplane or the ground.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.010
Its existence was considered
so secret and so effective

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.610
that it was forbidden
to be used over land

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.410
where it might fall
into enemy hands.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.360
Therefore, it saw its first use

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.080
in the Pacific aboard
Navy ships trying to deal

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.160
with the kamikaze threat;
and in Britain, where it shot

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.320
down V1 buzz bombs that
were headed for London.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.570
Only after a direct
intervention by Bush himself

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.570
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff
was it permitted to be deployed

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.620
to Europe for use in the
ground war, just in time

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.620
to have a devastating effect on
German troops during the Battle

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.010
of the Bulge in December of
1944 and January of 1945.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:31.520
The S1 executive committee
was the Manhattan Project.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.700
Most folks know that
atomic weapons were created

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.730
by the Manhattan
Project under the command

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.700
of Major General Leslie Groves,

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.990
but that's only part
of the story.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.050
Development of an atomic
weapon was authorized

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:47.120
by President Roosevelt
in 1940 under the NDRC.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.490
The Army was brought in first
during 1942 to manage the mass

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.460
of construction that
the effort needed.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.930
Not until mid-1943 did the
Manhattan Engineering District

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.840
under Groves begin
to assume control

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.780
of the scientific contracts

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.670
that had constituted the
research effort, and the NDRC,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.890
through James Conant's
S1 committee continued

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.940
to support the scientific
personnel.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.340
So, if you measure the
program initiation,

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.780
if you measure the program
from initiation to the day

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.770
of the first atomic device
being dropped on Hiroshima,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.540
the Army ran the program
less than half the time.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.840
The third organization

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.410
of special mention is the Agency
Committee on Selective Service.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.260
World War II, during
World War II,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.110
more than 16 million Americans
served in uniform in a country

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.770
that then numbered about
two hundred million.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.390
Today our active military
numbers are less than a million

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.670
in a country of about
380 million.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.990
In World War II, money for
projects was plentiful,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.490
but trained technical
people were not.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.300
The services needed to bring
in soldiers, sailors, airmen,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.160
and marines at an
ever-quickening pace,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.240
and eventually, even the most
highly skilled scientists were

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.300
likely to be called up.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.070
The impact of the loss of just
a few trained technical people

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.680
could cripple research programs.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.950
So this agency, the Agency
Committee on Selective Service,

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.030
and Bush himself, were heavily
involved in securing drafting

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.890
from its critical personnel.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:18.420
Let's turn to the practices that
OSRD and its subordinates put

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.960
in place to prosecute
their mission.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.810
Project initiation.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.340
Projects could be initiated
by a request from one

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.700
of the services: the War and
Navy departments, Army, Navy,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.440
Marine Corps; or by
allies, the British,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.930
the French in exile, etc., etc.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.070
; or on NDRC's or
OSRD's own initiative.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.690
Constant and close
liaisons through the Office

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.370
of Field Services
and the rotation

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.280
of operational personnel
through the research labs

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.790
as they came back from the
field kept everyone abreast

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.360
of current operations
and the needs

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.340
of those who were in combat.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.760
Development in patent
registration.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.950
The labs would develop a
project to a certain point

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.550
and when patents became
necessary in order

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.350
to protect intellectual
property, the practice was

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.870
that the office of OSRD itself
would register the patents

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.520
and register them to the
United States government.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.260
However, once done, those
would be freely available

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.870
for licensing at no charge to
virtually anybody who wanted.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.690
Prototyping and initial
production.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.580
Bush turned physicists
into engineers

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.280
and they were all deeply
involved in creating the devices

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.520
that their theoretical
approaches had created.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.910
If manufacturers were
too involved in war work

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.720
or if the demand for a
particular device wasn't going

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.310
to exceed more than a
couple of hundred articles,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.630
the NDRC created the
Research Construction Company,

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.840
adjacent to the MIT
campus, to handle prototype

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.600
and small-scale manufacturing,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.930
so they became their
own manufacturer.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.650
At the appropriate time,
OSRD handed off projects

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:04.010
to the services or to industry

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.060
to continue large-scale
manufacturing.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.620
Finally, the Office of Field
Services provided what we would

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.760
call today technical
support to the military units

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.200
that receive the new equipment.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.640
Thus, OCRD and its constituent
units explicitly avoided the

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.450
fate of its predecessors, such
as the Naval Consulting Board.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.510
In fact, within a month of
the creation of NDRC in 1940,

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.120
Secretary of Commerce Harry
Hopkins created a National

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.880
Inventors Council within
his department that acted

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.210
as the World War II screen
for independent inventors,

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.510
unaffiliated scientists,
and citizens at large,

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.090
relieving what might have been
a crushing weight on OSRD.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.290
Let's move on to show a few
examples of OSRD's work:

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.630
the bazooka, for example.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.830
The DUKW or "duck" [phonetic].

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.130
Any of you who have taken a tour

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.540
from Union Station are
familiar with the DUKW.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:03.370
That was an OSRD creation
that was passed off

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.620
to General Motors
for production.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.920
Development and production.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.970
Another example is

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.580
what you all see in wartime
movies, the mine detector.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.790
The mine detector, a handheld
soldier-carried detector

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.360
of mines in the field was
also a development of one

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.940
of the research centers at OSRD.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.970
And of course, there
was airborne radar

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.330
and atomic weapons.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.190
During the war, OSRD or
NDRC created a number

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.760
of those centralized
research centers and these are

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.810
where they were and what
they specialized in.

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.330
For example, the University
of Illinois had a --

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.300
was chemistry, along with
the University of Chicago.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.950
Princeton University
studied ballistics.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.650
University of Michigan
specialized in explosives.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.400
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.630
as we noted was radar.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.990
Woods Hall, Oceanographic
Institute:

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.940
logically enough,
underwater sound.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.720
And so on and so forth.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.620
The number of contracts, the
value of contracts converted

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.060
into 2017 dollars
stand as follows.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.690
There have been some
scholars who have averred

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.420
that perhaps the
Northeast, elite institutions

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.750
in the Northeast were
favored by OSRD contracts.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.260
However, if you take
a quick look

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.240
at the non-industrial
contractors, the top 25,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.580
they're scattered
from coast to coast.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.440
I don't think there's much
value to the allegations.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.090
Also, the industrial
contractors,

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.290
they would be contracted
not only to conduct research

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.490
but to provide manufacturing,
and you can see them there.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.620
The Research Construction
Company, as we saw before,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.810
was number two on
that, for the number

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.340
of devices that they created.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.600
Okay, post-war scientific
research.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.440
What happened after
the war was over?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.820
Well, OSRD wound down almost
immediately to be replaced

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.490
by a permanent entity.

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.710
The idea, Bush's idea
was that we wanted

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.220
to institutionalize
the federal funding

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.370
of basic scientific research,

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.230
and this was an opportunity
to do it.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.940
There was a consensus
on the need

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.760
for federally funded basic
scientific research but not

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.010
on the form or the mandate.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.960
So, essentially two
camps were created

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.080
to conceptualize what became
the National Science Foundation.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.760
You had Bush on one side, and
you had Senator Harvey Kilgore

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.440
of West Virginia on the other.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.160
Bush was a classic technocrat;
he wanted everything done

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.180
by the merits of the
individual project,

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.900
including the organization that
would be administrating it.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.160
Kilgore, on the other hand,
was a [inaudible] New-Dealer.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.540
He wanted to make sure that
the entire country benefited

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.840
from this and the research

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.370
that they would fund would
be socially relevant.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.800
And in the end, President
Truman got into the act,

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.150
so we essentially
had a trifecta.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.970
The original 1946 proposals for
the National Science Foundation,

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.800
both Bush and Kilgore agreed

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.570
that a central federal
research agency was necessary,

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.630
that the natural sciences should
be its object of research,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:36.320
medicine should be researched,
defense should be researched.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.760
Social science research,
not so much on Bush's side;

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.370
he was a natural
scientist at heart,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.280
even though he was
only an engineer,

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.700
and Kilgore on the other hand
thought that was a great idea.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.380
Geographic dispersion
of support,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.190
Bush didn't care; Kilgore did.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:55.440
Applied research.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.740
Bush didn't want to
have anything to do

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.790
with applied research
because that would detract

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.100
from the basic research
mandate that was supposed

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.400
to be at the heart of this.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.100
Kilgore, on the other hand,
wanted to see some sort

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.810
of social benefit
come out of this,

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.620
so his proposal included
all of that.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.760
Patent ownership, Bush
pressed for private ownership

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.710
of federally funded research;
Kilgore thought it should be,

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.690
the ownership should
stay with the government.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.430
Political control
of the foundation --

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.150
this would be the appointment of
the senior officers, etc., etc.,

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.270
and oversight by Congress.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.880
Bush, not so much.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.630
He wanted the technocrats
to run the show.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.500
Kilgore, on the other hand,
he thought it was a good idea.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.290
And should it be independent
of executive agencies?

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:41.250
Both thought that was a great
idea, much as OSRD had been.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.550
So, what actually happened?

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:47.940
In 1946 there was
no NSF legislation.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.000
The Atomic Energy Commission
was created at that time.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.770
The Office of Naval
Research was created.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.990
The War Department, realizing,
belatedly realizing the value

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.810
of scientific research,
stood up a research

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.770
and development division, and
the War and Navy Departments

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.640
between them established a Joint
Research and Development Board,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.960
an advisory board, actually
with Bush at the head,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.290
to advise the War and Navy
Departments on research

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.750
that should be conducted.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.310
The Senate managed to pass a
compromise National Science

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.600
Foundation bill, but
it didn't go anywhere.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.600
The House sat on it.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.990
Okay, let's move
forward to the next year.

00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:28.390
Research -- now we have a
Department of Defense and,

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.530
therefore, the Joint Research

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.440
and Development Board was
replaced by a Research

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.230
and Development Board that
advised the Assistant Secretary

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.730
of Defense for research
and engineering.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.340
There were seven
NSF bills introduced

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.700
that year, and one passed.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:48.070
But because of the lack of
adequate political control

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.120
in the eyes of the president, he
vetoed the bill, and OSRD went

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.760
out of existence at
the end of that year.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.840
1948, the Air Force created
its Office of Air Research.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.150
It also got involved in the
scientific research game.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.420
An amended NSF bill
passed the Senate,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.350
but the House again sat on it.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:13.030
In 1949, another amended
NSF bill passed the Senate.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.330
The House took no action.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:18.200
In the meantime, part of
the mandate of the Office

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.430
of Naval Research was to
find basic research science.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.860
So as it turns out, the Office

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.270
of Naval Research
became the primary funder

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.760
of basic scientific research

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.810
by the federal government
during this period.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.640
Finally in 1950, the Air Force
created a larger organization,

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.730
the Air Research and
Development Command.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.690
The House finally
passed the Senate bill

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.700
that had been passed
the year before,

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.430
and the president
signed the bill,

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.260
establishing the National
Science Foundation.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.600
So in that five-year gap,
what we saw was the creation

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.600
of a number of military,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.600
Department of Defense
organizations for science

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.950
and scientific research, and
the final NSF bill contained no

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.570
mandate for military research

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.460
for the National
Science Foundation.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.880
So, what are its
legacy organizations?

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.310
A number of federal agencies
can trace their origins back

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.610
to the OSRD.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.910
National Science
Foundation, of course,

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.410
the Office of Naval Research,
the Army Research Development

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.940
and Engineering, or,
and Evaluation Command,

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.520
Air Force Office of
Scientific Research, DTRA,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.310
the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency, DARPA, of course,

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.810
and in the Department of Energy,

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:25.390
the National Nuclear
Security Administration,

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.900
which is the custodian
of atomic stockpile.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.090
A number of research
centers exist

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.920
that can trace their origins
back, at least conceptually.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.810
Universities still
have research,

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.630
defense-dedicated
research centers at them,

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:46.760
and here's a list of what
the current inventory is.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.690
There's also an organization
or complex of FFRDCs,

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.970
or Federally Funded Research
and Development Corporation.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.740
And finally, the Department

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.870
of Energy's national
laboratories are the direct

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.060
descendants; in fact, some
of them are the survivors

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.760
of the Manhattan Project.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.200
So, getting back to
the research questions.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.500
Why was there an OSRD?

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.310
In my opinion, timing
had a lot to do with it.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.020
It was only 20 years between
the end of World War I

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.210
and the initiation of the US
involvement in World War II.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.010
So the lessons that were learned
during World War I were still

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.630
fresh, and the people who
learned those lessons were

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.080
in positions of senior
management

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.500
by the time it became necessary.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.930
The opportunity.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.530
The state of the
federal government

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.640
and of industry was propitious.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.100
We were coming off at the end
of the New Deal at that point.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.540
Federal government had
expanded a lot during the 1930s

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.430
and so it now might have had the
capability of actually taking

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.280
on the management of a research

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.720
and development effort
of this magnitude.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.080
Also, the US enjoyed a
very robust industrial base

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.380
at that point in time.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.510
They could also respond.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.330
The individuals involved.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:14.820
FDR, goes without saying; the
triumvirate of Bush, Compton,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.550
and Conant, who were all
interested in the topic

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:22.770
and had eminent, were eminently
qualified to carry it through.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.180
And the need: technological
war was evident,

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:31.920
and the US found itself in
1939, 1940 far behind the state

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.860
of military science in
Germany, Britain, and in France.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.780
So why was it so effective?

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.410
Really the crux of the
matter comes down to the fact

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.480
that there was a war on.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:47.730
There was a mindset that
required cooperation,

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.370
collaboration, and dedication.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:53.860
And also, a significant factor
was the organizational model

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.760
that was chosen by Bush and his
compadres to manage the effort

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.310
that was needed to
support the war.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.370
And what was the OSR's legacy?

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.600
Well, first and foremost
was the USA's monopoly

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.000
on atomic weaponry that
existed between 1945 and 1949.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.410
That was a gift that FDR
was very cognizant of,

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.480
and Harry Truman also.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.180
Second would be the enduring
relationship that came

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.190
out of the war between
the scientific

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.410
and technical communities, the
federal government in general,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.390
and the Defense Department
in particular,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.640
and the industrial base
that had supported them.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.330
But this came at a
cost during the war.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.730
Essentially, the training

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.930
of technical personnel during
World War II was frozen.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.340
All effort went into what
was immediately going

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.470
to be available to
prosecute the war effort.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.500
Therefore, there was very little
training of, at the master's

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.580
and doctorate level, of
scientific personnel,

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.840
and Bush felt that
very strongly.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.610
So he put into the NSF
legislation the ability

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.280
to provide scholarships

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.860
and graduate fellowships
for scientific

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.560
training of personnel
after the war.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.190
But what is a legacy
that we don't hear,

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.440
that perhaps we should?

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.760
And that is, as we saw from
the legacy organizations

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.880
that were listed at the
end of the presentation,

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.810
all of the organizations
listed there are part

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.870
of the federal government,
in one way or another.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.250
There is no independent voice.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.330
And we found during World War II

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:31.760
that the independent research
initiated by NDRC and OSRD

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.240
as part of their war
effort provided real value

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.750
to the services that they
sometimes did not want to accept

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.410
but found to be very effective.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.080
For example, the application
of operational research,

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.600
statistical analysis to strategy
and tactics, something that Army

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.500
and Navy had never considered
and were not interested in.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.770
But it proved extremely
effective in the war

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.070
against the U-boats in the

00:40:55.110 --> 00:41:00.570
Atlantic, and in other
areas and theaters of war.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.610
The DUKW itself, the Army
Quartermaster Corps couldn't

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.580
have cared less about
an amphibious truck

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.490
that could ferry goods from a
ship off shore to the beach.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.250
But it proved extraordinarily
effective

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.440
after it was introduced
in Sicily in 1943.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.840
And afterwards, president
Marshall, or -- excuse me --

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.390
General Marshall, the
Army Chief of Staff,

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.170
told the Army Quartermaster
Corps chief

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.370
to congratulate his troops on
the development of the DUKW,

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.140
although they had nothing
to do with it and they had

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.180
to accept it over
their own objections.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.600
So the independent voice
could be a very effective

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.490
and useful tool that
no longer exists.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.510
With that, I thank
you very much.

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:52.040
[ Applause ]

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.910
&gt;&gt; We have time for
a few questions.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.390
There's mics on both
sides [inaudible],

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.540
and Dan will call on you.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.890
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Or I
might not call on you.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.000
[Inaudible] There he is.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.300
&gt;&gt; Superb as --

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:23.220
Is it on? I wondered whether, in
terms of why it was effective.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.460
Now, I'm making this
up as we go.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.160
You know from ten years
since I've had the pleasure

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.560
of doing business with you.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.420
I wonder if there was a
coincidence between the state

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.050
of military art and the state
of the physical sciences

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.210
so that the physical science --
where the physical sciences were

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.830
about to go that nicely
just happened to mesh.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.850
What I'm thinking of is,

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.370
military power was largely
contained in very large,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.720
discrete objects that
were very lethal:

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.970
submarines, bombers
and so forth.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.440
And if you happened
to come up with a way

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.410
to detect small numbers of very
large -- hey, that's not bad.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.400
We're now at a point where
we're dealing with individuals

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.470
and the state of physical
and social science

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.370
and behavioral sciences,
not so clear

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.050
at how much leverage
there is there.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.690
I mean, we tried
the, you know, the,

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.790
what's the human terrain
teams and so forth and so on.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:21.170
But it doesn't seem to have
gained the kind of leverage

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.860
that this process you've
described so well here did.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.580
And I wonder if there
was something I --

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.090
again, I'm just making
this up as I go.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.540
But I wonder if it just happened
to be just the right point,

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.150
both in the state of the
arts of war and the state

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:37.940
of the physical sciences
that, by God,

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.420
it meshed like hands in a glove.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.490
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Thank you for
that insightful question, Ben.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:50.190
I can only guess.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.650
And in hindsight,
everything looks

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.350
like it really should've
worked out that way:

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.950
boy, what a coincidence.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.020
I think, though, if
you take a look at it,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.320
the folks who were going through
it in 1949, 1945 didn't think

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.970
that it was just a coincidence.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.660
They had to work very,
very hard and think outside

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.310
of a whole number of boxes to
be able to come up with things

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:13.120
like the VT fuse, the airborne
radar, submarine detection,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.590
etc., etc. Magnetic anomaly
detection was originated during

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:17.890
this period.

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:27.040
So I wonder -- I must defer the
question but pose another one.

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.580
To what extent, I wonder,

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.860
does the outside influence,
the outside status, let's say,

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.870
of something like NDRC that
promotes independent thinking,

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:45.230
how much did that play into
a specific number of devices?

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.930
And I suspect there are
a significant number,

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.680
but you'd have to do a whole
lot of research to figure out.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.310
Because the way that
the cooperation worked,

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.670
perhaps some soldier in the
field would suggest something

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.640
like a rocket-propelled grenade.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.340
Okay, well, NDRC would then
say, "Oh, that's a good idea,"

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.030
jump on it, develop it,
hand it off to industry.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.730
Who gets credit for that?

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.740
Because a lot of --
I'll give you an example

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.170
of the atomic bomb.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:13.660
That was something that
in Vannevar Bush's view,

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.080
was going to happen anyway.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.570
It didn't require a letter
from Albert Einstein to FDR.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.800
It didn't require anything
else, because as soon

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.570
as nuclear fission, atomic
fission was discovered

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.310
and proven in 1938, the
entire scientific community,

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.250
whether it was funded by
governments or not, took off.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.870
They were looking to
see, is there a --

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.080
is it feasible for there
to be atomic fission?

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.790
And if so, then what
can we do with it?

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.340
And so it was going
to happen anyway.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.930
And so what Bush did
was he convinced FDR

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.560
that this was something that
we needed to get in front of,

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.410
and who knew how far
along the Germans were,

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.380
because they discovered
the darn thing.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.130
And so that became
the Manhattan Project.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:54.430
But it was something

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.690
that eventually would've
happened anyway.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:01.900
So timing, as I noted
earlier, is critical in life.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.120
Ninety-nine percent of
success is showing up.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.830
But you've got to be in the
right place at the right time.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.150
Anybody else?

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:12.450
Yes, ma'am.

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.840
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.780
I had a, first I had a couple
questions, just a short --

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.530
you said the Department
of Defense was created,

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:22.830
what was -- What year?

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.130
Did you say --

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.430
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: 1947.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:26.730
National Security Act of 1947.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.030
Its original title
was the Department

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.500
of National Defense, yeah.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.980
Department of National Defense.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. Perfect.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.730
And then my second
quick question was,

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.030
what were the other countries?

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:41.230
You said that the U.S.
was technologically behind

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.250
militarily in 1939, 1940.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.250
You said Germany, France and?

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.550
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Britain.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:48.850
&gt;&gt; Britain, okay.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.150
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Britain likes
to claim a lot of the credit

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:53.350
for things like the atomic bomb
and radar and all that sort

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.600
of stuff, but as we noted
earlier, there were a lot

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.880
of people working on a lot of
things at that point in time.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.960
So who gets credit?

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.240
Whoever has the loudest
press release, I guess.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.070
&gt;&gt; And then my final
question was,

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:09.710
I was curious how far we
were behind those countries.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.010
If you could kind
of give examples --

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.690
you spoke a little bit about
it in the answer earlier

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.680
about Germany, but
I was just curious

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.660
like how far we were behind,
and then any other examples.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.090
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Well, I don't
know how you could develop a

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.260
metric for that,
especially a statistically

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.730
significant metric.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:32.630
But many of the -- let's
just say many of the ideas

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:33.930
that were later developed

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:39.120
into war devices originated
elsewhere and were brought in.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.610
We benefitted greatly by the
number of emigres from Germany

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.230
who came over just
prior to World War II.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.530
They brought their scientific

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.140
and technical knowledge
with them.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.030
The Brits, the Brits,
when they got --

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.340
when they were getting their
butt handed to them in 1940,

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.190
came over to the United States
and started pushing on us some

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.780
of their laboratory
concepts that had maybe,

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.760
might have been helpful.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.880
For example, the
klystron, which is the heart

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.400
of not only your
microwave dinner,

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.780
but also the airborne radar.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.000
They brought over a laboratory
sample and then we had

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.480
to take it and turn it

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.980
into something they could
actually use in an airplane.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:20.650
The variable time fuse, the
VT fuse originally started

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.230
out a little bit as an idea
that somebody in the UK had.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.530
They brought it over.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.480
We had to turn it into something
that would survive 20,000 Gs

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.260
when fired out of a
cannon and still explode

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.910
at the other end
at the right time.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.940
So let's just say
we did not have --

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.880
we had not devoted the thought
to developing the groundwork

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.710
for development, but
once we got the ideas,

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:46.510
we were very successful in
turning them into something

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:48.600
that made a difference
on the battlefield.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:00.200
&gt;&gt; Hi. My question is, a lot of
the devices that you're talking

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.630
about that were developed
in the war period,

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.930
and even in the decades
after, eventually filtered

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.480
out into other civilian uses,

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.960
like you just mentioned
the microwave,

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:18.620
etc. To what extent is
that still happening,

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:22.220
and is there a pipeline
between --

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.010
that pipeline between
what's developed

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.430
in these military
research studies

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:33.070
out into civilian
life and industry?

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:36.580
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Well, I don't
think there's a way to measure,

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.470
let's say, the flow of
the number of ideas.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.510
But if you take a
look at the funding,

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.230
let's just say the funding,
that goes into research

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.880
and development, on the part
of the federal government,

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.380
particularly the
Department of Defense,

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.360
and let's say private
industry, that line --

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.530
we started the post-war period
with the Department of Defense

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:57.460
or War and Navy Departments
kind of up here,

00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.950
and commercial entities
down here,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.920
and that line crossed
in the early 1950s.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.500
And it looks like this now.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.360
So that's why you see,
that's why you see soldiers

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.610
out in the field using
their smartphones:

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.910
because they're smarter

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.760
than anything DoD can
give them and such.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.670
And there are, though -- DoD
has been conscious of that,

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:20.300
and over the recent
years, let's say,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.120
they've been trying very
hard to build pathways

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.020
to bring commercial
technology back into the defense

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.530
and create pathways such
that that can happen quickly,

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.980
expeditiously and,
hopefully, cheaply.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:38.280
And in fact, there's a member

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.140
of the audience here you can
address that specifically

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.740
to after we get finished.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.360
Okay, two more.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.660
Time for two more.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.070
Just over here and
in the center.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:49.730
&gt;&gt; You had your hand up.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.030
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Oh.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.330
[Inaudible] Oh, I did?

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:57.190
Okay. Then over here,
and then in the middle.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.820
Thank you.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.150
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:02.910
&gt;&gt; Real quickly,
you mentioned a lot

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:04.900
of the bureaucratic
characteristics of the OSRD

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.440
that contributed to its
successes: independence,

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.290
its ability its own projects,

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:13.710
its ability to work very
closely with the services.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:16.070
What lessons would you say
that the services should take

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.990
from that in the contemporary
environment with the development

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.690
of a bunch of rapid acquisition
pathways, prototyping funds

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.420
that they should carry forward

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.000
to have those efforts be a
little bit less fragmented

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.730
and a little bit
more successful?

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.030
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: Hmm.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.560
Well, trying to make it
less fragmented implies

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.480
that you need a central
organization that's actually

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.780
governing it.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.880
And as we just -- you just
saw a sampling of the number

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.810
of organizations in
the Department --

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.730
just within the Department
of Defense that are devoted

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.940
to research and engineering,
and so therefore,

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.800
I think until you get a
strong, centralized authority

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.310
within the department,
you're always going

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.940
to have fragmentation like that.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.810
But one advantage was,
as we mentioned earlier,

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.190
OSRD was outside the government.

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:01.630
And what it did was its
contract, it contracted

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.860
with existing scientific
organizations at universities,

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.670
so that they didn't
move the scientists

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:09.300
into the War Department
or the Navy Department.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.940
They left them at
their universities.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.440
They created spaces for them
to work at their universities,

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.640
and therefore, they
didn't disrupt the programs

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.170
that were ongoing.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.470
So I think that contributed,
too.

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:25.720
And so I think you need a
centralized authority to kind

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.520
of get a handle on that.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.830
I don't know if that's possible.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:33.780
And a minimal disruption
to the existing status

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.660
of the research environment
that's ongoing.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.970
And over here?

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.800
&gt;&gt; Yes. Mark Wilson has written

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.570
about the rather
extensive lobbying that went

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:53.760
on before the war and at the
start of the war to make sure

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.260
that defense production
was concentrated

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.900
in the private sector rather
than the public sector.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.450
And one consequence of this was
that we had a lot of conversion

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:07.470
of existing industrial plants
for defense production rather

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:10.730
than construction of new
perhaps government-owned plants

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:13.930
for defense production
or so is his argument.

00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:19.930
How does the research story
that you're telling relate

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:24.290
to this effort to make sure
that what was produced resulting

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.980
from this research was
predominantly produced

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.530
in the private sector?

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.470
&gt;&gt; Daniel Else: First of all,
I want to take a little bit

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:37.090
of issue with the idea that
the government didn't build a

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:43.240
massive industrial base
specifically for the war effort.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.650
They did. In fact, in fact,

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.100
there was something called
the Defense Plant Corporation

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.780
that was created in the early
1940s to do exactly that.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.320
They would build a
facility, they would build,

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:59.310
they would stock it with
all the necessary equipment,

00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:01.450
and then they would
hire a private industry

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:02.800
to come in and staff it.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.450
That's where you got
the defense plants.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.250
That's where you got
the defense workers

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:07.730
who were not federal employees;

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:10.110
they were private
corporation employees.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.300
But the liability for
the physical plant lay

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:15.850
with the government,
because they owned the place.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.700
Something like, something
called Plant 42 out in Palmdale,

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.820
California, which is, which
was operated essentially

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.240
by Lockheed Martin,
the Skunk Works,

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.460
that was a federally
funded, federally built plant

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:34.040
in the 1940s that was operated
by a contractor over the years.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:38.980
So the idea that -- well,

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:43.910
the reason for that lobbying
effort was, after World War I,

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:47.380
the War and Navy Departments
cancelled outstanding

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.680
war contracts.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.250
The armistice took
everybody by surprise.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.230
We were just gearing up,
there were massive numbers

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:54.730
of contracts out there, civilian
corporations had converted

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.200
over to war production, and all

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.100
of a sudden, the
lights went out.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.280
And there were lawsuits
for the liability

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.580
of those cancelled contracts

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.930
that extended well
into World War II.

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.150
So in order to avoid that,

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:10.520
we had the defense plant
corporation product,

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.930
that scheme of approaching
industrial production.

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.810
You can kind of see
some of the same thing

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:21.010
in the OSRD organization in that
they did it all by contract,

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.280
and they contracted
out to research centers

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.170
at universities --
some in industry,

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:26.750
but mostly at universities --

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:30.240
and if they needed
a temporary sort

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.540
of research center,
it would be built.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.500
And then they would staff it
from the university staffs.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.930
And so that was kind
of the same model.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.080
And then, but after the war,

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.600
most of those research
centers went away,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.860
and they were replaced, as
you saw, over the years,

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.860
with other research centers
dedicated to other purposes.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.510
Thank you very much.
