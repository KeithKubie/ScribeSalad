&gt;&gt;Steve Meany: Hello everybody.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.510
How ya doin'?

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.510
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.180
My name is Steve Meany, I'm a Googler and
it's actually my pleasure to bring a friend

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.240
of mine of all people, Jason Felch, to come
speak with you all.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:22.500
For those that don't know everything about
Jason like I do, he is an award winning journalist

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.480
from the L.A. Times, he's also a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize, and he's actually

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.280
gonna be discussing what he and his colleague,
Ralph Frammolino, put into that work not just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.389
in the L.A. Times but also into the book entitled
Chasing Aphrodite which chronicles basically

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:49.729
the illicit antiquities trade as it existed
in one of the world's richest museums.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.269
And as you'll see from today's discussion
how that sort of, that web actually got larger

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.889
and larger and spread to many of the world's
most well known museums.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:06.720
Their book, Chasing Aphrodite, uncovers really
the roots of Jason and Ralph's discovery and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.120
what was chronicled in the L.A. Times.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.390
His talk is gonna provide basically the insider's
view of the illicit antiquities trade as well

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.540
as the international black market in recently
excavated artifacts.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.520
So Jason and I sort of talked about like what
is the purpose, like he's done talks like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.241
this before from anywhere from the Commonwealth
Club to NPR to wherever it might be and we

00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:37.110
talked about what should be the purpose in
coming to Google and sharing this with you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.860
all here today and the folks who are gonna
watch this on video later?

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.490
It's really sort of boils down to three pieces:
one is to really just educate you on the findings

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.110
and the research in the book, that's of course
very important and I wouldn't actually be

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.680
a card carrying sales person here of this
company if I didn't mention that the books

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.450
are for sale right over here so feel free
to buy one later, also to give you a greater

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.550
appreciation of this topic and really why
it's important to all of us.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.769
And the last piece is really, I think, uniquely
Google and that is Jason's here to actually

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.689
solicit some help.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:21.689
This, as you'll find out from today's discussion,
this topic doesn't end today, like, it's going

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:22.689
to spread.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.129
And what I mean by spread is that while Jason's
uncovered and Ralph have uncovered a problem,

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.450
they need help to solve that problem.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.319
A And so as we sort of think about this today
I wanted all of you to think about just our

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.180
quest, organize the world's information, didn't
necessarily start in 1998; it actually extends

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.180
to the past.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.650
And we actually have, in my opinion, a chance
to sort of recover and organize historical

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.590
data, historical knowledge, and for those
of you that are interested in reaching out

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.209
to Jason and helping him in this quest, I
actually think it's very worthwhile endeavor.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.360
So Jason'll touch on sort of how we can all
help him as he moves forward.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.510
So without further ado, Jason.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.599
[applause]

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.080
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Thank you Steve.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.840
Steve and I went to high school together in
San Francisco and played on the volleyball

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.890
team and I've seen him a few times since,
but it's a pleasure to be back here with Steve

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.920
and thank you all very much for coming today.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.059
As Steve mentioned I wanna talk for probably
about half an hour about the book and about

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:37.029
the world that we got into in the book and
then save some time at the end for your questions,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.250
for a conversation, and for pitch because
as Steve hinted I need help.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.439
I have an idea for a project that could harness
technology to address some of the problems

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.939
raised in the book in the illicit antiquities
trade, but I'm not a tech guy.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.120
I'm a journalist so I'm hoping some of you
here might either be people or know people

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.879
who might be able to help out with this.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.780
So I'll save some time at the end to talk
about that.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.400
Before I start can I just get a sense for
who's in the room, how many people here are

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400
Googlers?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400
[pause]

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400
Oh wonderful.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.680
And of the Googlers here how many of you are
engineers or do actual technology stuff?

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.319
Nice, wonderful.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.210
And how many people, I noticed there's some
Stanford archeology people here?

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.910
Wonderful, hello, welcome.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.530
You'll correct me if I get any of the archaeological
references wrong?

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.440
To start I wanted to tell a little bit of
story and it's the story that's kind of at

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.840
the heart of the book.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.700
It's the story of the J. Paul Getty Museum
and it starts with this man.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.390
J. Paul Getty was, in his day, the world's
richest man.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.880
Getty was something of a miser, he was a misanthrope,
and he was a thoroughly unpleasant person

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.500
to most people who knew him, but he was a
passionate collector.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.830
He was passionate really about three things
in life, the first you see here.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.620
The other two were money and art.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.390
He was known to keep a running diary everyday
of every dollar that he spent on everything

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:19.440
down to the penny and the rumors about him
having a pay phone in his house at Sutton

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.450
Place, this huge manor outside of London,
are true.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.420
In fact, I just, giving a presentation the
other day, ran into somebody who visited Getty

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.140
at his Italian villa and there was a pay phone
there, too.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.970
So Getty didn't like to spend money when he
didn't have to.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.460
He had made his vast fortune in the oil fields;
he inherited his father's oil business, Getty

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.100
Oil.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.470
And in the oil business you drill holes in
the ground hoping to hit oil and that was

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.800
kind of the approach he took to art, too.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.810
He was out there looking for bargains and
hoping to find something that was under-priced

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.640
that he could buy and kind of find this lost
marvel.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:07.480
The area of art that he was most passionate
about was ancient art; he imagined himself

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.060
as something like the reincarnation of the
Emperor Hadrian who'd been this great philanthropist

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.900
and patron of the arts in his time.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.370
And he imagined his oil company, which by
the time Getty took it over as a young man,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.840
really spread its arms all around the world;
he imagined that as something like the Roman

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
Empire.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.290
And so he had fantasies of grandeur and ancient
art, antiquities, gave him an opportunity

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.500
to kind of feel the past in his own hands.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.140
And so he was a passionate collector, he was
not always a very good collector, a lot of

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.250
the objects he bought ended up proving to
be fakes or not what he thought they were,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.390
but he bought a lot particularly in the 50s
and 60s and the 70s.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:58.030
He being a skin flint didn't like having to
pay taxes on this growing art collection and

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:05.710
so his tax advisor in the 1950s told him,
"Well you know if you dedicate these two rooms

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.750
in your house in Malibu and call them a museum,
a public museum, you can actually treat these

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.970
art purchases as a tax write off."

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.860
And so the Getty Museum has its origins in
a tax dodge.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.611
Eventually Getty went on to build a much larger
building for his collection; this is the Getty

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.180
Villa today.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.950
Getty ordered this built from his house in
London in the 1970s and he based it off of

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:44.830
a Roman villa that had been excavated just
outside of Pompeii and it had been buried

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.230
by the eruption of Vesuvius.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:52.930
And so Getty had found the plans for this
Roman villa and built what we today call the

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.430
Getty Villa to emulate that villa and filled
it with his art collection, his rapidly growing

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.920
art collection.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.090
Getty never saw this museum, he, from really
the 1950s on, lived in London and Europe,

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.040
he was deathly afraid of flying and so he
never came back to the United States, but

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.660
even though he sent all his art here and had
this amazing building built.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:24.740
So when he died in 1976 he left this incredible
personal fortune, most than $800 million and

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.160
there was a big mystery: who's gonna get this
money?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.020
He basically aliened all of his family members;
he had five ex-wives and five sons, one to

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.990
each of them, and had kind of fallen out of
touch with all of them and alienated all of

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.990
them.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.150
He had this harem of women who kind of surrounded
him who he always promised to take care of

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.020
in his will; you saw them in the first picture.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.360
He didn't leave his money to them either.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.130
What he did to the surprise of almost everybody,
was he left his entire personal fortune to

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.050
the Getty Museum.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.761
Overnight the Getty became, went from a very
kind of provincial, middling, regional museum

00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:07.700
that not a lot of people visited to the richest
art museum in the world, a status that it

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.780
still has today.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.720
Today it's called the Getty Foundation, there's
an umbrella foundation over it, but it has

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.390
an endowment of about $6 billion so it's the
wealthiest arts organization on the planet.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.350
It was to this organization that this young
woman came in 1982.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:32.350
This is Marion True; she came to the Getty
in the early 80s as an Assistant Curator for

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.370
Antiquities.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.830
She had been trained at Harvard, she was something
of a refugee when she came to California;

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:44.290
she was leaving behind a bunch of unsatisfying
jobs in the art market on the kind of market

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.280
side of the trade.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.950
She had not finished her studies yet at Harvard
so she was kind of leaving that behind; she'd

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.220
had a failed marriage that she was getting
away from, so like a lot of people, she came

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.330
to California as something of a refugee to
start over and she arrived at the Getty just

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.670
as it was coming into this enormous wealth.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.180
So when Getty died in '76 he bequeathed his
money but it was tied up in litigation until

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.180
the early 80s.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:12.730
So suddenly in the early 80s, the Getty is
enormously rich and it has really one mission,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.910
it's to go out into the world and to buy the
very best art that there is.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:21.580
Well Marion True was well positioned; she
came into the Getty at a time of a lot of

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:30.940
flux, in fact her boss, the Curator of Antiquities
at the Getty was a man named Jiri Frel, a

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.500
very colorful character.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.331
When you read the book, he's kinda my favorite
guy in the book, the guy I'd wanna have a

00:10:35.331 --> 00:10:40.430
beer with in the book, 'cause he was completely
corrupt but very up front about it.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.150
He was one of the very few people in this
world that was not kind of two-faced about

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.029
what he was doing; he was just basically blatantly
corrupt.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:50.890
Well, he was driven out of the Getty after
a tax fraud scheme was revealed, that he'd

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:59.350
been defrauding the Federal Government through
kited appraisals and phony donations.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.800
So when he was driven out, Marion True was
suddenly elevated to the position of Antiquities

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.020
Curator.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:11.810
And it was not long after this, in 1987, that
she went to London on her first buying trip

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.260
and she was going out to find the best ancient
art in the world and buy it.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.130
Well, the first people that she went to visit
were these two gentlemen.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:27.470
On the right you see Robin Symes, on the left
is Christo Michaelides.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:33.060
In the 1980s, these men were the very tippy
top of the market in ancient art; they were

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.810
dealers of antiquities; they had the very
best stuff out there.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.260
And so good in fact that very few museums,
American museums, could afford to buy from

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.790
them; most of their clients were private collectors.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.500
Well, the Getty could afford to buy from them
and so this is who she went to visit.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.700
Robin Symes said to Marion, "Thank you so
much for coming.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.370
I have something very important that I wanna
show you."

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:01.029
And they popped into his maroon Bentley and
drove out of London into this kind of warehouse

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:05.070
neighborhood of Battersea and he took her
to this big warehouse, this kind of run down

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.589
area of town, and he opened up the door and
turned on the lights and this is what Marion

00:12:09.589 --> 00:12:17.650
True saw: it was a seven and a half foot Cult
Statute of a Goddess.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.990
She had her breath taken away when she saw
this; nothing like this existed anywhere else

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.060
in the world.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.020
This is an acrolithic statute which means
that it's made of two different materials;

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.560
you'll see that the head and the arms are
made out of a white marble, that's Parian

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.300
Marble from the Green island of Paros; it's
one of the finest marbles there is.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.710
The body is made of limestone.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.850
This was a cult goddess that would have sat
at the center of a Greek temple as the object

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:52.529
of veneration for likely Greek settlers in
the kind of outskirts outside of Greece.

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:56.420
She knew from the fact that it was an acrolith
that it was almost certainly from southern

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.029
Italy.

00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:04.220
This technique was used when there was a shortage,
there was a scarcity, of actual local marble

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.670
and so the extremities, the marble for the
extremities would be imported from Greece

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.480
itself, but in the colonies, in the Greek
colonies they would use the local limestone

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.490
to carve the actual body.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.970
Well, she knew three things when she saw this
statute.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.130
First of all, she knew that this was an incredibly
important piece of art.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.490
As I said there was nothing like it anywhere
else in the world; the closest reference she

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.430
could come up with was the Parthenon Friezes.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:35.570
When Pheidias had sculpted those sculptures
which we sometimes refer to as the Elgin Marbles,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.500
they're now in the British Museum in London;
when Pheidias the Greek sculptor had sculpted

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.681
these he had developed a new style, a new
artistic technique and this goddess was a

00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:46.970
direct reflection of that.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:54.960
It was this wet drapery style and so it was
a clear reference right back to what our historians

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.390
would consider really the apex of Western
civilization, the highest moment of classical

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.450
Greece that you can come up with.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:08.120
And so it was enormously important for that
as she wrote later in her proposal there was

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:15.420
nothing like this anywhere outside of Athens
itself or Great Britain, meaning the Elgin

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.339
Marbles in the British Museum.

00:14:17.339 --> 00:14:22.640
So it was clear that this kind of acquisition,
an object of this caliber, could immediately

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.540
put the Getty on the map, make it a credible
institution in the eyes of its East Coast

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:32.870
peers, and would be a career making acquisition
for a young curator like Marian True.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.649
Well, there were other things that were also
immediately clear about the statute.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:42.180
If you look at these photographs of the statute
before restoration you see that before she

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.720
was cleaned up she was a little bit dirty.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.360
On her face, you can see the encrustation,
that's not acne she has that's actual dirt

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.880
that's been encrusted there over the centuries.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.100
And if you look at the limestone body of the
statute you'll see that there are two prominent

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.360
break points: one in the waist and another
at the knees.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.709
Now when she walked up to the statute, she
ran her finger along those cracks and they

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:12.779
were sharp; they'd been recently made.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:18.040
Ancient statutes with ancient breaks wear
down over time and so they wouldn't be sharp

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.250
breaks like that.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.520
Well, all of these things were a clear indication
that this statute had been recently found

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.690
and judging by the fact that it was an acrolith,
it must have been found in southern Italy

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.830
or Sicily and so this bore all the clear signs
of looting.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.410
Closer inspection showed that it actually
still had dirt in the folds of the gown.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.790
Now when she asked Robin Symes, "Where did
this thing come from?"

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.660
She was very curious because it had never
been studied before.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.800
Art historians and archaeologists and scholars
of classical art are very passionate and very

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.360
diligent researchers and anything of this
size or proportion even it had been in a private

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.410
collection would have been known and documented
if it had known to exist.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.730
So this thing was completely out of nowhere.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.410
Robin Symes wouldn't say much about where
it was from.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.080
He said he'd gotten it from a Swiss supermarket
magnate who had had it in his family collection

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.060
since the 30s.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.120
And that was good enough and fine for Marion
True.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.649
The decision to acquire it wasn't hers; it
was really her boss's decision.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:25.440
But she knew very well that this thing bore
clear signs of being a recent discovery and

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.170
therefore it was hot; it was potentially dangerous
for the museum to be involved with.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.100
Well, this created a dilemma and it was not
a new dilemma for the Getty.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.779
The Getty had been wrestling with the issue
of whether and how to acquire antiquities

00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:44.720
particularly antiquities that appeared to
have been recently excavated for many years.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.200
The decision really fell to these two men:
John Walsh on the left was the Director of

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.430
the Getty Museum at the time.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:58.500
He was a very respected curator at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art; his specialty was Dutch art.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.179
He was really one of the leading up and coming
museum figures in the country and he had been

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:07.740
brought to the Getty to kind of bring seriousness
to the Getty Museum.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.860
And his boss was Harold Williams.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.450
Harold Williams was the CEO of the Getty Trust,
the umbrella foundation over the museum.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:21.220
Harold Williams also had a pretty good lineage;
he had worked for Carter, he was the Chairman

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.860
of the Securities and Exchange Commission;
he had been an advisor for many years to Norton

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:30.770
Simon so he had some knowledge of the art
world, but really he was a financially credible

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:35.679
person who could manage this enormous endowment;
he had been trained as a lawyer.

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:39.580
So John and Harold had been going back and
forth for several years over this question

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.510
about antiquities, the antiquities collection.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.130
The Getty was aggressively trying to build
its collection but it kept running up into

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.080
this issue, which is a lot of these objects
on the market, in fact Harold Williams had

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.010
been told 95 percent of the objects on the
market, had been recently excavated.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:01.650
And under not just foreign law but also American
law, knowingly buying something that had been

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:07.500
looted from a country that had a patrimony
law like Italy's that said, "Objects in the

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:14.910
ground belong to the state," doing that under
American law was a violation of the criminal

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.660
statutes and could end up getting the Getty
into a lot of trouble.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.049
And as an attorney, Harold Williams was keenly
aware of this and concerned about it.

00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:30.350
Well, John Walsh was a museum guy and he made
the case to Harold, he said, "Look Harold

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:35.600
this has been going on for decades, this is
how we buy these things.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:43.210
And yes there's some risk involved but these
cases are almost never proven and furthermore

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.990
don't we have a moral obligation to buy these
objects?

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:52.910
Isn't it really our duty in the world to purchase
antiquities like this even if they've come

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.049
out of their country illegally?

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:57.910
If we don't buy them what will come of them?

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.110
If we don't buy them they could end up back
in the black market and we'll never see it

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.110
again.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.650
It could end up in a private collection and
it will never be studied and available for

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.370
the public to admire.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:13.600
So isn't it our moral duty as a museum, and
a very wealthy museum at that, to buy and

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.720
conserve and protect and study and make available
for the public just these kind of objects?"

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.370
Well, into this mix came the Aphrodite and
it really drew this long ongoing debate to

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.620
the fore.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:31.310
And thankfully we have an actual record of
the conversation that Harold Williams and

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.410
John Walsh had in September of 1987 while
they're debating this very issue.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.490
Now I should say Walsh and Williams claimed
that the conversation I'm gonna tell you about

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.680
it purely hypothetical.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.330
The Aphrodite was under proposal at the time,
it was being considered for acquisition, but

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.170
Walsh and Williams would tell you that they
were considering a new acquisition policy

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.490
for the Getty not the Statute of Aphrodite.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.190
So keep that in mind as we read John Walsh's
handwritten notes from the meeting.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.220
"Acquisition policy antiquities."

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.880
They were creating a special policy just for
antiquities.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.030
"Harold Williams: 'We're saying we won't look
into the provenance.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.260
We know it's stolen.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.090
Symes is a fence.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.390
Must we no try?? to find out where it came
from?

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.110
Why not ask Symes?"

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.400
[pause]

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.169
Harold Williams is worried; he's worried that
buying the Aphrodite is gonna get the Getty

00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:27.170
in a lot of trouble.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:32.210
Well, John Walsh says, "Don't worry, Harold.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.260
There's no information about where this thing
came from and if we ask Symes and we push

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.580
him for information about where it came from,
he'll lie to us because that's what dealers

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.580
do.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.940
The dealers that we are doing business with
are liars and fences and we can't trust them,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.940
so let's not ask them."

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:55.429
Well, it became clear that the Getty, if it
was going to acquire the Aphrodite, needed

00:20:55.429 --> 00:20:56.740
a new acquisition policy.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.660
The existing acquisition policy in 1987 said
that the Getty museum wouldn't be able to

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.140
buy anything if it had any reason to believe
it has been illegally exported from its country

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.140
of origin.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.670
If there were any doubts about it those doubts
needed to be investigated thoroughly.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.510
Well, investigating the Statute of Aphrodite
thoroughly would only bring trouble and so

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.270
they created a new policy, one that would
allow for the acquisition of the Statute of

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.080
Aphrodite.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.870
This policy would basically put the onus of
proving that the statute was looted not on

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.600
the Getty Museum but on someone else, anyone
else.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.320
And so what the Getty did is they said, "We're
gonna notify foreign governments in the likely

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320
country of origin.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:38.760
We're gonna say, 'Do have any proof that the
statue was looted, speak now or we're gonna

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.330
buy this thing.'"

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.860
They would also get a warranty from the dealer
Symes saying that he warranted that this wasn't

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.750
looted and they would publish and display
the object and let everybody see it and so

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.210
if anybody had a claim against it they could
come forward and the Getty said, "Well, if

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.260
they come forward, we'll deal with 'em when
they come forward."

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.450
Well, this is the new policy, there was one
more aspect of the new policy and it's written

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.390
in black and white in these discussions: "No
investigations."

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.360
The Getty made a concerted effort not to look
into where the objects it was buying came

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.400
from.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.760
The reason for that is pretty clear; at the
time, American law said that if you have knowledge

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.260
of buying a looted antiquity you could go
to jail.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:24.500
So the decision at the Getty was to never
gain that knowledge and absent that knowledge

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.790
they thought they'd be safe.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.890
[clears throat]

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.880
Well, Harold Williams was a lawyer and he
wasn't entirely comfortable with this still

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.240
so he leaves John Walsh and Marion True with
a parting thought.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.960
He says, "Are we willing to buy stolen property
for some higher aim?"

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.040
Well, to me this is a remarkable document
because of its frankness and also because

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.370
it really captures a moment in time in the
American museum world.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.960
American museums had been buying recently
looted antiquities with knowledge for decades.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.410
And this is really one of the few times where,
because of changing tides in this world, senior

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.510
museum officials were saying, "Can we keep
doing this and get away with it?"

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.540
Well, the answer to Harold Williams question,
"Are we willing to buy stolen property for

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.960
some higher aim?" the answer was yes.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.820
The Getty bought the Statute of Aphrodite
for $18 million, it was a record price at

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.050
the time and American museums kept buying
looted antiquities really for the next few

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.050
decades.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.330
[clears throat]

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.680
Buying ancient art, buying other people's
culture is really nothing new this has been

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.679
going on for centuries if not millennia.

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:35.040
The earliest known legal document we have,
clears throat] excuse me, is called the Abbott

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.390
Papyrus; it's the trial of two looters in
Egypt about 2,000 years before Christ.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.559
I may have that number wrong.

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:49.710
It documents their attempts to raid the tombs
of the Pharaohs; it's not in Egypt by the

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.100
way it's in the British Museum.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.600
For centuries, people have been debating the
propriety of acquiring other people's culture

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.670
and for the most part, the rule has been "might
makes right."

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:07.270
When a country conquers another country is
hauls home the best art and puts it up on

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.250
display at home.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:14.419
This has been the subject of dispute and debate
for centuries.

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:17.460
The most prominent example, the one you're
probably all familiar with, is the debate

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.840
over the Elgin Marbles when Lord Elgin went
and took those Parthenon Friezes off the Parthenon

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.200
and brought them home to London.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.460
There was a big debate in London about whether
he had done something right or wrong.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.960
A lot of the British aristocracy had been
doing very similar things.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.419
As part of their grand tour, they'd go around
the world and bring home beautiful remnants

00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:41.960
of antiquity, but even for members of the
aristocracy in Britain at the time this was

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.260
kind of a bit too far; he had gone a bit overboard.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.919
The debate really changes, that historical
debate, really begins to change in the 1960s

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:56.410
because what becomes very clear is, particularly
in the United States in the post-war boom

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:02.610
years, regional museums across the United
are buying up antiquities, ancient antiquities,

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.919
in particular classical antiquities at a huge
rate; they're gobbling up everything they

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:14.230
can get and filling their collections with
these remnants of Roman and Greek culture.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.110
Well, the archaeologists in the field saw
the results of this pillage not just in the

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:24.120
classical world but also all across Latin
America, across Asia, across the Middle East;

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.950
archaeological sites were being devastated
by the looting.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:32.320
There was a huge demand for these objects
and it had created a huge problem with plunder.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:40.220
And so this kind of culminated in a treaty
in 1970 that we refer to as the UNESCO Accord.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.530
It has a very long name which I have given
you here.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:47.420
In essence what it said is, "We, the world's
nations, are going to try to respect each

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:52.960
other's patrimony laws and to discourage looting
to kind of curb this terrible destruction

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.240
that's going on.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.780
We're going to agree to respect each other's
laws.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.460
And so if we think that that object was looted
we're going to put import restrictions on

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.650
it and not allow it into the country."

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:09.880
And there was this kind of international regime
that would be built to kind of curb this destruction

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.010
of our history.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:17.640
Well, it was all fine and good, the museums
said they were on board, they loved this,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.280
too, of course.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.850
And Thomas Hoving, the Director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art got up and he pronounced, "The

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.400
age of piracy has ended.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400
This is it.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.160
We're changin' the way we do business."

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.630
Well, two years later Thomas Hoving and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art bought this.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:39.760
This is known as the Euphronios Krater, it's
perhaps one of the finest ancient Greek vases

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.480
that we have.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.280
It had been looted just a few years earlier
from a tomb outside of Rome, smuggled through

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.340
a network of dealers, and presented to the
Met.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.590
And the Met had a pretty good idea, Thomas
Hoving himself had a pretty good idea, that

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.429
this thing was a fresh find but he couldn't
turn it down, it was too nice, it was just

00:26:57.429 --> 00:26:59.720
too good and the Met wanted it; so he bought
it.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.240
And there was a big outcry and there were
rumors that it had been looted and people

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.130
thought they knew the guys who had looted
it, but the Met stood by its guns and said,

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.370
"Well, unless you can prove it we're not giving
it back."

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.150
And nobody could really prove it 'cause the
Italians didn't have the evidence to prove

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.150
it.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.669
So eventually the kerfuffle died down and
the Met kept its vase and it became known

00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:21.070
as the Hot Pot.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.330
This is Norton Simon in a wonderful quote
from the New York Times just to capture the

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.700
spirit of the times this is all post-UNESCO,
here's Norton Simon, "Hell yes," he's just

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:40.190
bought an enormous, beautiful Indian Vishnu
and he's got it and somebody says, "Well,

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.530
India says this thing was recently looted
and smuggled out of the country."

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.960
And Norton Simon says, "Hell yes, it was smuggled.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.280
I spent between $15 and $16 million in the
last two years on Asian art, and most of it

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.500
was smuggled."

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.179
So not exactly a secret, this is business
as usual in the museum world.

00:27:55.179 --> 00:28:01.640
Well, that continues apace really for 40 years
and I would argue, and over those 40 years

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.730
there's changes in the law, there's changes
in practice, there's lot of changes that go

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:11.130
on, but I would argue that this single photo
is really what changed the actual practices

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.419
not the rhetoric but the actual collecting
practices of American museums more than anything

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:16.419
else.

00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:21.590
This is a 2006 photograph of Marion True,
who you saw earlier, walking into her criminal

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.420
trial in Rome.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.700
She was accused by Italy of trafficking in
looted art with some of the other dealers

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.250
who were implicated.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.510
So it was really this that got museums to
pay attention after 40 years.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:42.640
The origin of this criminal case really goes
back to the early 1990s and a car crash.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.350
A low level middleman in the illicit antiquities
trade in Italy crashes his car, dies, the

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:54.429
police find some artifacts in the car, they
go back to his house and they find this document.

00:28:54.429 --> 00:29:00.100
This document is a org chart for the illicit
antiquities trade in Italy.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:07.909
What you see at the bottom of the org chart
is Elio and Angelo and Dino and the different

00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:12.440
men at the bottom of the food chain; these
are the guys out in the fields digging; they're

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.440
feeding their wares up to the principal middleman
in Italy.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.809
On the right you see Giacomo Medici.

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:23.159
Giacomo Medici was a young man who grew up
in this trade and was the bright guy who made

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:28.080
good for himself, moved the operation to Switzerland,
got a big warehouse in the Freeport, and started

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.990
becoming a huge supplier to American museums.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:37.311
So he really controlled the illicit trade
really from kind of Rome north, particularly

00:29:37.311 --> 00:29:40.220
the Etruscan areas just around Rome and Tuscany.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.710
On the left you see Gianfranco Becchina.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:49.910
Gianfranco Becchina was a Sicilian guy, same
kinda story, got his start in the trade but

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.140
kinda figured out how to make good money out
of it, moved his operation to Switzerland

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:58.659
where the laws protected him, and became a
major supplier for objects again to the American

00:29:58.659 --> 00:29:59.659
museums and others.

00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:04.210
At the top of the pyramid is Robert Hecht.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:08.860
Robert Hecht was an American, he was a classically
trained archaeologist at the American Academy

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:14.110
in Rome but decided to go to the dark side;
he opted to get involved in the trade as a

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:18.490
dealer instead of being a dirt archaeologist.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:24.159
Hecht really since the 50s had dominated the
illicit trade in classical antiquities; he's

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:29.309
an amazing man, I got to know him pretty well
while reporting this book and he just died

00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:30.650
three days ago.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:34.840
In fact, my obit of him was in the Los Angeles
Times and I think is in the Washington Post

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.179
today.

00:30:37.179 --> 00:30:39.500
He's a remarkable figure, somebody should
make a movie about him.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.360
I won't go into a lot of detail today, but
he basically helped organize, systematize,

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:53.370
and revolutionize the illicit antiquities
trade over five decades and supplied most

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.640
of the leading museums in the world with many
of their finest classical antiquities that

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.559
we have.

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:05.000
Once the Italians had that org chart they
said, "Okay, now we've got something to go

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.590
on; now we've got some teeth for our investigations."

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:13.150
They'd been investigating this world for years
and not been able to really get up the chain

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.490
of commands to the big guys, the middlemen
'cause they were all just across the border

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.529
in Switzerland.

00:31:17.529 --> 00:31:22.090
Well, they finally built enough evidence to
convince the Swiss that they could execute

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.100
a search warrant in Switzerland, something
that a lot of people in the field thought

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.529
would have never happened.

00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:33.900
So they get to Switzerland and they raid Giacomo
Medici's warehouse in 1995 and what do they

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.900
find?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.280
It's Ali Baba's cave.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.100
Giacomo Medici has thousands of antiquities
all over the place in various states of restoration;

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:49.090
some are in crates labeled Cerveteri, the
little town outside of Rome that's got a beautiful

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.640
Etruscan necropolis; these things had just
come out of the ground and were shipped to

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.950
Switzerland just like that, still in pieces,
covered in dirt.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.289
Others were kind of partially reconstructed
and then there were the things on the shelf

00:32:00.289 --> 00:32:04.929
which are kind of display quality, ready for
market, cleaned up, ready to go.

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:09.840
Well, the Italians were stunned, they really,
until this moment, had no idea how sophisticated,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.970
organized, and massive the illicit antiquities
trade was.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.070
I mean, this was a sophisticated operation.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:19.600
They noticed, by the way, that a lot of the
objects on the shelves curiously had auction

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.630
tags on them; Sotheby's, Christie's, lot number
332.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.450
Well, how could that be?

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.460
This took 'em years to figure out, they couldn't
figure out how Medici, a guy who had all the

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:34.809
sources across Italy, why would he be buying
objects at auction?

00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:38.290
Well, eventually they figured out, this is
kind of a side story, eventually they figured

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.970
out that Medici had figured out how to game
the market; he was a bright guy.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:49.279
He was consigning objects for auction at Sotheby's
and then having straw buyers in the crowd

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:53.190
bid them up to the price, the market price,
that he felt was right.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:56.039
Then they would buy them and give him back
to Medici.

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.039
Well, what did that do?

00:32:57.039 --> 00:33:02.100
A, it set the market for antiquities, he could
basically decide what objects would be worth,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.710
and B, it laundered them, it gave them a clean
provenance 'cause at the time anybody would

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.220
feel comfortable buying from a reputable auction
house like Sotheby's and having an auction

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.710
tag from Sotheby's was good enough for anybody.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:20.780
So, these were bright guys, they had figured
out how to game the system, but far more important

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.320
than the thousands of archaeological objects
they found in his warehouse were these binders

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.840
of Polaroids.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.720
Medici was not a big record keeper, he didn't
have elaborate business records, what he did

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.559
was he had Polaroids.

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:36.440
He had photographs of everything he'd ever
bought from the looters and sold on and he

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.809
had a very primitive code that he wrote on
the back of them basically indicating what

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:43.860
he'd paid for it, what he'd sold it for, and
who he'd sold it to.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.730
So, it was these Polaroids that really cracked
the case for the Italian investigators.

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:55.040
They began going through these Polaroids and
finding all kinds of really amazing archaeological

00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.049
objects that had been recently looted; tens
of thousands of them.

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:02.570
Well, whadda you do?

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.260
You know these objects were looted.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:09.010
For the first time Italians had something
they'd always been missing which was kind

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.929
of smoking gun proof of where these things
had come from.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:17.540
What they needed to do at this point was find
out where these things had ended up.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.070
Well, it took 'em a long time, I'll describe
the process 'cause I'm gonna come back to

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.889
this at the end of the presentation when I
solicit your help.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:28.820
Essentially, imagine a giant game of Concentration,
you remember that game Concentration?

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.520
You turn over one card, you look at it, you
turn it back over, you turn over another card,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.960
and you're trying to make matches.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:40.200
So these two wonderful Italian investigators
were sitting in the basement of the Villa

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.389
Giulia, the Etruscan Museum in Rome playing
an enormous game of Concentration.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:48.540
In one pile, they had Medici's Polaroids and
they'd look at 'em and they'd study them and

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.810
they'd say, "Okay, I got those in my mind."

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.960
And then they'd open up catalogs of the world's
known antiquities collections and they'd leaf

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.849
through them and they'd say, "Gee whiz, that
looks familiar.

00:34:58.849 --> 00:34:59.930
Now where was that?"

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:05.900
Then they'd go back into the, well, this is
a tedious, incredibly time consuming process.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:11.160
They spent 10 or 15 years doing this and they
came up with a few hundred matches.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.710
And those matches is what ultimately led to
the controversy, the turning point that we

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.480
write about in the book.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.010
The reason is because this is the Getty's
Apollo, this is a statute of Apollo that's

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:29.349
been on display at the Getty and here is the
Apollo soon after it came out of the ground.

00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:34.420
You can see the power of these images; when
you see something recently excavated from

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.609
the ground there's not a lot the Getty can
say to argue that this thing was in some old

00:35:38.609 --> 00:35:40.160
Swiss collection.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.619
This thing had been recently excavated, photographed
in a Polaroid so they didn't have to take

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:50.280
it to the Photomat and send out through the
supply chain to Switzerland, laundered, and

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.110
then sold to the Getty.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.510
So these images had an enormous power to them.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.280
This is Griffins Attacking a Fallen Doe, a
fabulous, enormous sculpture, you can see

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.760
that it still has traces of its original paint.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.940
The archaeologists in the crowd know that
what we think of as these beautiful white

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:13.730
marbles in their day were actually vividly
painted with bright colors and so very little

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.970
of that paint has survived antiquity.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.960
On this thing, you can really get a sense
for what these things must have looked like

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.930
when they were made, really vividly painted.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.890
Well, here is the Griffins Attacking a Fallen
Doe in the trunk of a car just after it was

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:27.980
excavated.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.240
And here it is sitting on a piece of newspaper
which when you zoom in you can tell it's an

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.609
Italian piece of newspaper.

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:39.690
And here is Giacomo Medici, the man who supplied
this to Robert Hecht who supplied this to

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:45.450
the Getty Museum, I'm sorry who supplied this
to Maurice Tempelsman, a private collector,

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:49.730
a paramour of Jackie Onassis, diamond magnate
in New York City.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:53.190
He put it in his private collection, held
it for a few years, sold it to the Getty where

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.190
it went on display.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:59.460
Well, Medici was so excited, this was really
a beautiful object, that Giacomo and Robert

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.670
Hecht went on a tour of American museums and
they visited and they took photographs of

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.870
themselves next to the objects that they'd
help to smuggle out of the country and loot.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:12.730
So, thanks to Giacomo's vanity we have the
wonderful pictures of Giacomo posing next

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.400
to these looted objects.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.720
This is an Etruscan Antefix, this is a roof
decoration from an Etruscan house and here's

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.870
the Antefix soon after it came out of the
ground.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:33.000
So the Getty Museum in 2005, is confronted
by Italian authorities with this shocking

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.430
evidence and they're forced to do something
that they'd been reluctant to do for years;

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.490
they had to look into their own archives and
examine their own past and confront their

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.690
history of buying these objects.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.980
And what they found was pretty alarming.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:53.500
They found that in their, in the conclusions
in their own internal attorneys, that the

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.770
museum had apparently been knowingly buying
looted antiquities for decades, that this

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:01.530
was a rather common practice, and that is
was done with a wink and a nod, that there

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:08.150
was an attempt to kind of cover it up or at
least obscure it, but essentially that this

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.320
was common practice.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.060
Well, on April Fool's Day of 2005 Marion True
was indicted by Italy and accused of being

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.950
a co-conspirator of Hecht and Medici and trafficking
in these objects.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:23.140
There was a human cry in the art world because
Marion True, really since the mid-90s, had

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.660
emerged as the leading opponent, the leading
critic of the antiquities trade.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:35.240
She had been denouncing really the trade for
its corruption and saying, encouraging her

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:41.599
museum colleagues to stop relying on what
was clearly a black market and that we all

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:42.790
needed to face the facts.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:48.040
She told museum directors in 2001 in Denver,
"We all need to face the fact if an object

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.820
comes to us without a known collecting history,
that's a looted antiquity and we shouldn't

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.070
be buying it 'cause we're encouraging the
destruction of archaeological sites as museums

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:02.320
or educational institutions if we promote
the destruction of these things, we're betraying

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.320
our own mission."

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.170
So, when she was indicted she had kind of
become transformed in the mind of her peers

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:12.460
as a kind of a leading crusader against this
thing, but her past had caught up with her

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:19.349
and so she was indicted and put on trial in
2005 along with Hecht and Medici.

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:20.450
Medici was convicted.

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:27.880
Both Hecht and True, their trials just expired;
True's in 2010, Hecht's just a month ago without

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.110
any conviction.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:34.080
It's noteworthy because the Italian criminal
justice system is not well prepared to handle

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.460
these type of cases; they're incredibly complex
investigations.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.859
The investigative phase of this spanned at
least 15 years and amassed an enormous amount

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:49.040
of evidence but it was not enough to ultimately
convict people, who I think the evidence would

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.570
suggest, were involved in this illicit trade.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:59.609
So the Getty based on its own internal investigation
created its own org chart.

00:39:59.609 --> 00:40:03.960
This is what their internal review came up
with in terms of the supply chain that they

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.960
had been dealing with.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.690
At the bottom you see Italy, interesting that
most of these things come to them with some

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.710
cover story about being in an old Swiss collection;
they clearly thought these things were coming

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.170
right out of Italy.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:18.950
You see Robin Symes, Robert Hecht, Fleischman
is Larry Fleischman, a prominent New York

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:24.070
art dealer who had donated his collection
to the Getty and Tempelsman, Maurice Tempelsman,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.530
who we'd mentioned earlier.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.230
And then these things going to the Getty.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.450
Well, this looks a lot like this other org
chart; in fact, if you put these two org charts

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:37.290
together what you see is the full chain of
custody essentially of the illicit antiquities

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.290
trade.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:43.130
You have from the very guys out in the fields
digging all the way up through the system,

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:46.660
through the private collectors to the museum.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.880
This is really a revolution, this is really
the first time that investigators were able

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:57.589
to trace a massive amount of objects through
an illicit black market, this illicit black

00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:58.589
market.

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:03.770
And so this is an important discovery, it's
an important understanding about how sophisticated

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:08.710
the supply chain in this antiquities, in these
looted antiquities became.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.130
As I said, Marion True was indicted in April
Fool's Day of 2005; she was never convicted;

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:19.810
her trial ended in the fall of 2010 when the
statute of limitations expired and so now

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.839
she's living with her husband outside of Paris.

00:41:23.839 --> 00:41:30.330
But she was disgraced in part because, in
stories in the Los Angeles Times, we revealed

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:35.390
not only the evidence in the Italian case,
but also the internal evidence inside the

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:40.280
Getty, which the Getty decided not to share
with the Italians, though they were promising

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.869
their full cooperation.

00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:47.160
So there was a cover up that happens, we saw
some of the documents that were covered up

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:52.060
including those notes from Walsh that clearly
indicated there had been a problem.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:58.340
These headlines ultimately created a big international
controversy.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.750
We also found that Marion True had accepted
a personal loan from a lawyer associated with

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:10.180
Symes and Michaelides to buy a $400,000 Greek
vacation home; she had repaid that loan ultimately

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.940
with a second loan from the Fleischman's,
the Getty's biggest donors who she'd been

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.560
cultivating for years.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.170
That second loan came just days after the
Fleischman's completed a $60 million transaction

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.170
with the Getty.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.420
So it all looked very bad, it was a very clear
conflict of interest that Marion True was

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.420
caught in.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:31.099
She was fired after we revealed that, even
though the Getty had known about it for years.

00:42:31.099 --> 00:42:37.110
And it wasn't just the Getty, I want it to
be clear through these headlines that what

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:42.130
the Getty had been doing was really a case
study in American museums in the 70s, 80s,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.609
and 90s.

00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:49.240
The Metropolitan Museum was forced to give
back many of its objects including the Euphronios

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.310
Krater that you saw earlier.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:54.930
The Boston Museum of Fine Arts, this is the
Statue of Sabina that had been a really keystone

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:57.630
of their collection; it went back.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:03.570
This is the Euphronios Krater back in Italy
now with the Carabinieri celebrating its return.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:09.420
And here is the Statute of Aphrodite; never
shown in the Medici Polaroids, but through

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:15.460
really shoe leather detective work by Italian
investigators, by Getty's own investigators,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.920
and by journalists we were able to piece together
the kind of story of how this thing had been

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.950
looted from an archaeological site in central
Sicily, a site called Morgantina, a very important

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:32.080
Greek city state, smuggled in a carrot truck
out of the country to Switzerland, laundered,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.300
and then sold to the Getty.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:39.230
The Getty, by the way, has photographs of
the Aphrodite in this kind of very disturbing

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.380
state just after it arrived in Switzerland;
it's kind of being poured out of a bag with

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:46.770
all kinds of dirt and it's broken in pieces,
it's before restoration.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:52.780
They refused to release these photographs
and when we keep demanding them and they keep

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.780
saying, "No."

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.340
Remember these are institutions presumably
here to serve the public, I mean they're tax

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.980
exempt, they're getting a big tax break on
that $6 billion to serve us, but they won't

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.541
show us the smoking gun picture of the Aphrodite
they say because they cut a deal with the

00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:08.770
[chuckles] smuggler who gave them the photos.

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:16.180
So here's the Aphrodite being mounted in its
new museum in central Sicily, Morgantina.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:22.040
And here she is at a big press conference
with a crush of Italian politicians and journalists

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.510
admiring the statue in her new home.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.220
In all, the effect of the scandal, this needs
updating because there's been a number of

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:34.410
recent returns, but essentially you've got
American museums returning more than 100 of

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:40.060
their finest pieces of classical antiquities
when confronted with this really clear evidence,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.450
just from the Medici archive remember, of
the looted origins of these things, these

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.590
objects were estimated at a billion dollars;
they really are some of the finest pieces

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:52.680
of classical art that we had in America and
they're no longer here.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:58.020
Now, having mixed feelings about that I think
is understandable; Italy has its fair share

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.390
of classical antiquities, it certainly doesn't
need our stuff.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:05.650
But think about it, I think about this as
kind of a token penance; this is really the

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:09.090
tip of an iceberg, it's a very large iceberg.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:13.530
Most classical antiquities in American museums
do not have a documented provenance, meaning

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.780
we have no idea where they were found or how
they got to those museums.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.960
That's alarming; it's a suggestion that they
may have illicit origins.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.970
This is just a hundred of them so it's, in
my mind, these returns were really a token

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:32.030
penance saying, "Yes, we got caught cheating
and we're giving you back some of these finest

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.070
things as kind of a way of saying we're sorry."

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:40.510
The byproduct of this has actually been somewhat
of a happy story; there's a happy ending which

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:46.619
is that as a result of this really contentious
battle between Italy and American museums,

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:51.290
there's been this whole new era of cooperation
that's come out of it and oddly enough the

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:53.640
Getty has really been a pioneer in this area.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.339
Here is James Cuno, the new CEO of the Getty,
shaking hands with the Greek Minister of Culture

00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:04.140
just earlier this year, I'm sorry, late last
year.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:11.079
This is them sealing a cultural collaboration
agreement and essentially, and other museums

00:46:11.079 --> 00:46:13.760
that have given back antiquities have signed
similar agreements.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.650
In essence they're saying, "Look Italy, Greece
you have tons of antiquities, more than you

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.560
could ever display in your museums.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.870
We wanna display antiquities, we wanna educate
our public, we wanna display them and we're

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.680
gonna stop relying on the black market.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.280
So, if you share your antiquities with us
and send 'em to us on loan, we'll stop relying

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:38.190
on the black market and we can help you restore
them and protect them and study them and there's

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.220
really a way for us to all get along."

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.550
Well, this new approach is, I think, spreading
rapidly and I think it's being seen as a kind

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.380
of a paradigm shift in the museum world not
just in the antiquities world, but I think

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:56.859
people are realizing: do museums really need
to own all the objects that they display?

00:46:56.859 --> 00:46:59.730
Is it really about possession or is it about
stewardship?

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.410
And is it about sharing these things and protecting
them and learning about them and collaborating?

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.800
And so that's a really positive sign that's
come out of this controversy and one that

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.640
I think you'll see more and more of.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:17.050
There are also some alarming signs; there's
recent signs that the museum world's reliance

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.940
on the illicit antiquities trade has not ended.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.300
Very briefly, if you wanna follow these cases
we track them on our blog, we break news on

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.450
our blog, chasing Aphrodite dot com is where
you can follow the kind of ongoing chase.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:32.339
But these are some recent cases that we've
been writing about.

00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:36.450
On the left is Michael Padgett, Antiquities
Curator at the Princeton Museum of Art.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:39.930
The Princeton Museum of Art was one of the
museums that gave stuff back in 2007; they

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.160
signed an agreement; they made happy noises
with Italy, everything was fine.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.650
Well, a few years later we learned that the
Italians are now criminally investigating

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:54.630
Michael Padgett for participating in a network
of illicit antiquities that looks a lot like

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.910
the one that Marion True was involved in.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:48:03.100
And that this alleged conspiracy to traffic
in these objects continued through 2006 when

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.200
everybody was making happy noises.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.330
In the middle, is Michael Govan the curator
at LACMA, the Los Angeles County Museum of

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.330
Art.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:14.200
They have a wonderful collection of Southeast
Asian antiquities.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.670
Michael Govan is asking federal agents whether
he can come into his museum because they showed

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:24.200
up early one morning in January of 2008, raided
the museum and four other southern California

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.890
museums after a five year undercover investigation
of an illicit antiquities network smuggling

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:36.300
Southeast Asian antiquities out of Thailand
and Burma and Cambodia through Los Angeles.

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.170
They were being donated to museums like LACMA
at inflated appraisals.

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:46.720
This is a tax fraud scheme that echoes the
very one that got Marion True's boss fired

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:50.070
in the 80s at the Getty, and it appears to
still be going on.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:55.890
No charges, certainly not against the museum
in this case yet, it's an ongoing investigation.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:01.210
On the right you see Joseph Lewis, a collector
of Egyptian material here in the United States.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:07.910
He was arrested or indicted under an alleged
conspiracy to traffic near Eastern material

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:13.180
recently looted Egyptian antiquities, smuggled
through Bahrain into New York City where they

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:18.540
were distributed to collectors and dealers
and being sold on the open market in New York.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.060
So this is still going.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.349
The age of piracy unfortunately is not yet
over, it's an ongoing issue.

00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:26.280
So that's the end of my chat.

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.829
I apologize for my quick pace but I'm trying
to get through it so I can pick your brains

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:37.819
about what I see as a potential use of technology
to address some of these issues.

00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:41.400
So let me talk about that briefly.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.980
In essence, is that still, no it's not, apologies.

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.420
[pause]

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:52.640
While reporting this story, we came across
what I see as a problem.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:57.520
There are these thousands and thousands of
photographs of recently looted antiquities

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:01.840
that have been seized by Italian authorities
and Greek authorities.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.100
It's an enormously time consuming and difficult
task for these wonderful archaeologists in

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.660
the basement of the Rome Museum to find out
where these things ended up.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.770
And so, in the course of reporting, we got
access to many of these photographs, we have

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:22.160
them on five DVDs full of photos and documents
and business records of this illicit trade

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:30.589
and is there way to process this information,
this data, more effectively, more efficiently?

00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:36.230
The other problem is that our knowledge of
the illicit antiquities trade is really rather

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.460
poor because of this lack of data.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:45.940
There's a real, even among experts, uncertainty
about how big, what the scope of the illicit

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:51.280
market in classical antiquities is; estimates
range from $200 million a year to $6 billion

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.530
a year and everybody's just guessing 'cause
like most illicit trades, it's pretty hard

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.530
to measure.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:00.250
Well these investigations that have been happening
in recent years have churned up an enormous

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:05.460
source of data about this illicit trade: business
records, photographs.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:10.930
All of this data is being processed at a snail's
pace by a handful of people.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:17.430
We have an opportunity to change that and
so what I am trying to do and need some help

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:23.700
with is essentially crowd source the task
of analysis of this information; make it public

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:31.040
on the Web and get everyone out there who
has an idea about this stuff to contribute

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.190
to our understanding of what happens.

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:41.700
It's a project that I refer to half jokingly
as WikiLoot mostly because it's a, I think

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:49.510
of it as a Wiki, a distributed analysis process
and a community effort to contribute.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:53.560
What I'd like to do is create a Web interface
that would build a community of people who

00:51:53.560 --> 00:52:02.040
will go through these images, tag them, identify
them, find out where they are today, and further

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:07.250
our understanding of how the illicit trade
works and the scope of the problem.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:11.839
A more sophisticated approach and one I've
talked about with some people at Google but

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:19.280
have yet to find kind of the right person,
is to use computer vision as a potential technical

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:26.359
way of having essentially a Web crawler go
out into the world and find where these objects

00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:27.730
are today.

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:35.400
We all know that Picasa for example and iPhoto
in Apple's iPhoto they have this facial recognition

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:40.380
technology that lets you find all the pictures
of your Aunt Sally.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:48.460
Can that technology be harnessed to recognize
a specific piece of art and go out into the

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.930
World Wide Web and find where that art is
today?

00:52:52.930 --> 00:53:00.640
That would dramatically increase our ability
to understand the scope of this problem.

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.800
This is something that I've been discussing
with a kind of small group of archaeologists,

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.079
people in law enforcement, journalists, there's
a lot of interest in this.

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:16.430
What we don't have is a technology partner,
somebody who could help us develop this technology.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.510
And so one of the reasons I'm here today is
I'm excited to be at Google is because, not

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.859
surprisingly, this is something you guys are
already doing in lots of different ways.

00:53:24.859 --> 00:53:27.430
You had a question in the back.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:33.760
&gt;&gt;male #1: Who have you spoken to at Google
so far?

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.170
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: To Eric Limon and, well I can
get you their names.

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:46.690
Both gentlemen I ran into and aren't in this
field per se but they've been, I've been kind

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:51.569
of pitching this is a 20 percent time project
through them and we haven't quite found yet

00:53:51.569 --> 00:53:52.900
the right people to connect with.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.900
So I'm still --

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.470
&gt;&gt;male #1: I know the group, so let's met
afterwards.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.470
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Wonderful, great.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:57.530
I'm glad you're here.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.090
Problem solved, right?

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.090
[laughter]

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:03.510
Okay, next problem.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:07.960
No, there's a lot of interested people in
this, this is an important cache of data that

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.359
could really tell us a lot about this world
and my vision for it is that it be something

00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.609
that it's wide open to the public.

00:54:14.609 --> 00:54:18.710
I mean, I think, one of the problems is law
enforcement isn't quite the right way to address

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:25.950
this issue and academics are very good at
what they do, but there's a gap there between

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.589
them and the public.

00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:32.461
And the public essentially is not, doesn't
completely understand the scope of the problem

00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:35.990
and, I think, particularly in the United States
there's a sense that looting is victim-less

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:41.970
crime because we don't see the devastation
of the archaeological sites, they're not for

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:43.770
the most part here.

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:47.420
And so I think public awareness is a big part
of this and I'd there to be a way in which

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:52.490
the public could engage in this potentially
by, for example, going to their local museum,

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.790
looking at these lovely antiquities that have
no provenance, snapping a picture and uploading

00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:04.711
it onto WikiLoot and allowing either experts
or an algorithm to see if it matches any of

00:55:04.711 --> 00:55:06.790
the objects in the archives.

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:10.119
This is something that I think could really
raise public awareness about this issue and

00:55:10.119 --> 00:55:15.040
help get out heads around the scope of the
illicit antiquities trade.

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.290
I'm gonna end with that, it's just a brief
overview of kind of something I hope to do.

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.470
I'd welcome all of your questions; I'd also
welcome your suggestions.

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:25.380
You know technology far better than I do.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.050
Are there other ways in which technology could
be brought to bear?

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:35.140
I'll throw one out there because I was asked
to: a lot of field archaeologists and governments

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:40.079
in antiquities rich countries that have troubles
monitoring their archaeological sites rely

00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:45.240
on Google Earth and Google Maps for their
images.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.560
Essentially they're desperate to monitor their
archaeological sites but they're frustrated

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:55.280
because the pace at which Google Images is
being updated, these great satellite views

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:01.750
of archaeological sites could be harnessed
to track looting and kind of monitor archaeological

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:08.000
sites at risk, but they can't quite get a
handle on how to get the most recent updates.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.080
I think the answer may be to buy the satellite
images from the for profit providers but there's

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.290
not always money for that.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:18.810
So that's another way that Google might play
a role in the illicit antiquities trade.

00:56:18.810 --> 00:56:23.770
Thank you so much for your patience, I know
I kind of rambled through that quickly so

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:28.960
I'm happy to take any questions or comments
or thoughts.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.589
[pause]

00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:34.230
[applause]

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.230
Anybody have any thoughts?

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.230
Yeah.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:39.349
&gt;&gt;male #2: I'm just interested in your last
comment there about the amount of money involved.

00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:40.670
Museums always seem to be struggling for money
--

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:41.670
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Yeah.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:42.670
&gt;&gt;male #2: and yet --

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:43.670
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Not the Getty.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:48.260
&gt;&gt;male #2: the amount that these things are
being bought for and the amount of trade seems,

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.970
it seems like a disconnect like they're always
short of money and yet they're spending $20

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.080
million on a --

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.420
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Particularly when you think
that you could get some of these incredible

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:04.050
objects on loan, for almost free, why would
museums be going out and spending $18 million

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:07.190
on something that could get them into a lot
of legal trouble?

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:10.730
I think that the hard times that everyone's
been having in the last couple years with

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:16.140
the recession have encouraged museums to move
in this direction and think beyond ownership

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.860
in part because ownership, they can't buy
what they want always.

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.609
And so are there other ways to get it?

00:57:20.609 --> 00:57:22.059
But I think you make a good point.

00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:26.599
Do you wanna say a little bit about your work
'cause it sounds like you have related ideas.

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:32.520
&gt;&gt;male #2: No, just the idea of doing computer
vision and matching pictures either user generated

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.859
with images that are on the Web is something
we do so --

00:57:36.859 --> 00:57:38.280
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Yeah.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:43.960
&gt;&gt;male #2: I mean, these DVDs you talk of,
they're just all images?

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:49.690
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: No a lot of them are images
and I should say a lot of them are poor images,

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:53.930
they are essentially digital photographs of
Polaroids and so they're not all very good

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:58.780
images and a lot of times, I mean this is
a challenging task for computer vision which

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.990
I know is kind of quickly evolving.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.250
But a lot of times you've got objects that
are in various states of restoration or partial

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:10.849
objects that are later, when we see them at
their museum they look pretty nice, but in

00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:13.790
some of these Polaroids they look kinda dirty
or broken up.

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:18.910
So I don't know where the cutting edge of
the technology is and it's abilities to kind

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:24.930
recognize a fragment and associate it with
something existing out there.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.280
But let's talk more after.

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.280
Yeah.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.280
[pause]

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280
Yes.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.280
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi [ indistinct ] one of the
Stanford archaeologists.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.430
So I like your idea of crowd sourcing using
these images to identify objects that museums

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:45.830
have acquired but it seems to me like you're
trying to circumvent the hierarchy of the

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:46.830
museums.

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:48.240
Have you approached museums directly or talked
to them 'cause it seems like you're working

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.829
under an assumption that museums are still
not functioning ethically in terms of trying

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:56.260
to identify --

00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:00.400
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: I am an investigative reporter
after all.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.400
[laughter]

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.400
trying to identify looted antiquities --

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.400
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Yes.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.690
&gt;&gt;female #1: within their own [indistinct
].

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:05.690
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Yeah.

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:11.150
Fair point, I am somewhat suspicious of whether
museums have completely embraced the wave

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:13.589
of reforms, I think it's a mixed bag.

00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:15.809
We test this theory almost weekly.

00:59:15.809 --> 00:59:20.730
If you follow our blog chasing Aphrodite dot
com what you'll see is that we are continuing

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.150
to chase these cases as they emerge.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:28.160
So the Princeton case which is the one that's
kind of hot right now involves a dealer named

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:33.780
Edoardo Almagia and there's a cache of photos;
we don't have them the Italian authorities,

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.020
this is a case that's kind of ongoing.

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.619
But they've linked these photos to museums
around the country so we've been contacting

00:59:39.619 --> 00:59:45.609
these museums and saying, "Would you please
tell us what you bought from this gentlemen

00:59:45.609 --> 00:59:48.339
and what you know about its origins?"

00:59:48.339 --> 00:59:52.160
And there's different degrees of transparency,
I mean it would be nice to think that museums

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.490
were all completely transparent 'cause they
see themselves as public institutions here

00:59:55.490 --> 01:00:00.440
for our benefit, that's not always the case
particularly when there's a criminal investigation

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.730
going on.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:06.079
So, I think museums could play a very active
and important role in this.

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:09.750
After all some of the leading experts, some
of the people who know how to identify these

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.110
objects better than anyone else, work at museums.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:18.230
I mean, who better than museum curators to
go onto this Web portal and help identify

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.980
and tag and locate where these objects are?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.849
I mean when Marion True in her deposition
by the Italian prosecutor was shown a lot

01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:30.180
of these Polaroids, off the top of her head
she could say, "Boston Museum of Fine Arts,

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.690
Santa Fe Museum, Cleveland."

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.880
I mean, she just knew 'cause this is her field.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.140
So I would hope that museums could be encouraged
to participate in this, I think that even

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.859
people in the dealers' community have a real
interest in having this information out there

01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:49.750
to know what their exposure is on the market.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.119
Right now the situation is everybody knows
there's thousands of Polaroids out there but

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:56.440
not which objects are in them and so there's
a lot of fear and nervousness.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.460
And my hope is that everybody could kind of
join together on this type of task to kind

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.859
of wrestle it to the ground.

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:03.859
[pause]

01:01:03.859 --> 01:01:04.859
Yeah.

01:01:04.859 --> 01:01:06.990
&gt;&gt;female #2: Following up on the last question,
you mentioned how auction houses are often

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:09.180
used to launder items, so have you thought
about somewhat involving them in this project

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.180
of yours or maybe sending them the photos
so that they can watch out for those types

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:20.940
of items if they come up for sale or someone
has a [indistinct ] auction house?

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:33.579
&gt;&gt;Jason Felch: Yeah, I mean auction houses,
like museums, keenly interested in what these

01:01:33.579 --> 01:01:38.440
photos show with the expertise in house to
identify many of these objects.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.640
And I think no one has an interest right now
in getting caught with looted antiquities.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.400
The pain has been so great over the last couple
of years during this controversy, that they're

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.860
all interested in kind of not getting caught.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:57.630
And so the idea of putting it out there on
the Web and crowd sourcing, it is that anybody

01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:58.630
who is interested in this.

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:03.240
I mean there's also some hobbyist in Ohio
who happens to know a lot about this and has

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.790
hundreds of hours of free time to go through
and do this work.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:09.840
So there's people all around the world who
are interested in this and again it's global,

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.079
it's not just the United States, there are
experts all across the world who know these

01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:15.079
things.

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:20.230
I've also heard from archaeologists that the
world that I've really been delving deeply

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:25.710
into and the kind of smuggling network that
we've been documenting is a pretty small one,

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:31.140
it's classical antiquities from the Mediterranean,
mostly Greece and Italy, going through to

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.720
classical collections in the United States.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.110
This is a worldwide problem and it's one that
involves Southeast Asia, it's one that involves

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:46.320
pre-Columbian art, and there are similar types
of archives, I'm told, of objects and of middlemen

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.790
in the trade from these different communities.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:54.109
So my idea is build it with what you've got,
in this case it's classical, in this particular

01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:59.410
smuggling network with classical antiquities,
and then if you build it they will come; build

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:00.960
it out as it grows.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.331
It's also because there's some graduate students
and academics in the audience, it's a potential

01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:14.420
for a fascinating dataset to conduct really
serious analysis that I think hasn't really

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.650
been done before.

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:20.650
I've been trying to review some of the academic
work on the issue of looting and it's pretty

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:26.651
sparse 'cause there's just not a good dataset;
there's imperfect ways of analyzing this.

01:03:26.651 --> 01:03:32.119
This is a fabulous dataset, we've got thousands
and thousands of business records from some

01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:40.690
middlemen in the trade operating over decades
and it would several great dissertations in

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:41.690
there somewhere.

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:45.180
So for those academics out there interested
in this there's a little bait.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.160
Anyone else?

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160
[pause]

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.910
Thank you all very much for your patience
and for coming today.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:53.910
[applause]

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.150
I'd be happy to sign a book if you wanna buy
one I'll be around.
