[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.640
BRAD GREENHILL:
I went to college

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.490
at University of Michigan.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.050
And I got into cooking
when I was there.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.450
I cooked professionally after I
graduated for about four years,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.190
five years.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.980
And then was feeling
burned out, wasn't sure

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.750
if that's what I wanted to do,
so I went back to technology.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.660
I have an engineering
degree from Michigan.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.220
So I started a web
development company.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.410
I also did graphic design, and
so very familiar with Google.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.230
And my partner, actually, he's
over in the Madison building,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.640
my old business partner.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.020
He started Quickly.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.010
I don't know if anyone's
familiar with here.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.520
Maybe.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.250
Maybe not.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.450
Anyway, so after I started
that, I got interested in--

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.670
kind of rediscovered my love and
passion for food, and started--

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.310
they weren't called
pop-ups then.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.360
I just started hosting
dinners in Ann Arbor.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.520
Usually, there was a bakery.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.150
We'd run out.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.530
Or I'd have them at my
house and stuff like that,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.860
and started getting
a huge following,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.920
and had a massive email list.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.650
So I would announce, oh,
I'm doing a dinner here.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.880
And people would buy
tickets and show up.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.520
And so I started looking into
opening a restaurant in Ann

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
Arbor, and found it to be
difficult. In the meantime,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.590
opportunity started
presenting itself in Detroit.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.680
And I was spending
more time in Detroit.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.990
And there is a lot different
energy between the two towns.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.010
Like, everyone in Ann Arbor
was like, oh, you should really

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.750
open a restaurant.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
OK, that's great, but I need
help, supporters, backers

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.220
to do it.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.720
Whereas people in
Detroit were like,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.928
hey, let's open a restaurant.

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:00.635
And so it was a
different sort of--

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:02.051
SPEAKER: It was
almost [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:04.590
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah,
like a different attitude.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.950
And for someone like myself,
with an entrepreneurial spirit

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.690
who's never really
had a corporate job

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.139
or a job, really--

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.930
I've always just started
my own businesses,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.330
pretty much since I
graduated, outside

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.790
of occasional restaurant work--

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.230
that sort of energy
and spirit really

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.450
attracted me to the city.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.700
So I just kind of took the
jump and moved to Detroit

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.150
and did pop-ups there, and
then food truck, and then

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.424
another pop-up, and then
finally the restaurant.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.840
SPEAKER: That's
super interesting.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.090
And I know that where
the location is now--

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.140
we'll get to this in a minute,
about the rebirth of that--

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.810
you started as a
food truck for Two

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.804
James, which is directly
across the street.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.220
So tell us a little
bit, before we

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.290
get to Christina
and your background,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.850
about the connection
there, with Two James.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.570
BRAD GREENHILL: So my
partner in the restaurant,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.720
Courtney, had this idea,
let's get a food truck.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.400
And I was like, you know, OK.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.060
I guess so.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.430
Why not?

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.020
At the time, I was transitioning
out of doing web development

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.650
and pretty much doing
pop-ups full-time.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.270
And I was actively working
on opening a restaurant,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.880
but nothing had really
materialized quite yet.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.710
And so we're like, yeah,
let's get the food truck.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.110
You know, she wanted it
because she did events,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.060
so she thought it
would be cool to be

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.000
able to have a truck at
her events to serve food

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.510
or whatever.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.590
And I was just interested
in cooking all the time.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.430
So we bought a truck,
with the intention

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.130
of sort of setting
up in different spots

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.350
all around town.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.020
But about a couple of
months after we bought it,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.760
it broke down.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.840
The axle broke.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.540
And so we were storing it
right next door to Two James,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.880
because that was the--

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.796
there was a restaurant
finally going in there,

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:09.720
but that was the spot that I
was in talks with about possibly

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.040
opening a restaurant there.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.220
And my good friends
had started Two James.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.660
So we had planned on
serving there already.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.959
And then we were
just stuck there

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.380
once we broke down, because
we didn't have the money

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.190
to get it fixed.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.580
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.699
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah, it was a
very, highly illegal operation.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.490
SPEAKER: Operation.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.486
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:36.840
And we used to have to
have a drill if the health

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.020
department came, because
we were broke down,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.270
which is like a big no-no,
and we were in this garage.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.380
But we were selling so much
food that we were like,

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.850
spilling out of the truck.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.990
Like, the truck
could not contain it.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.660
So we're in this garage, and we
had like, a prep refrigerator,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.600
and these prep tables in
there, and next to that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.850
was a [INAUDIBLE] and a salt
truck for in a snow plow.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.607
And it was just like, you can't
make it up-- only in Detroit.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.690
SPEAKER: Only in Detroit,
I was just about to say.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.090
BRAD GREENHILL: Only In
Detroit, in this specific era,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.350
could that have happened.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.090
So you know, so
we'd run this drill.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.390
If the Health Department
came, shut the door,

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.150
and oh, they're not here today.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.520
And we kind of got away
with it, because our truck

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.180
was licensed in Royal Oak.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.545
And so it didn't really fall
under the Detroit jurisdiction.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:35.460
And we just had to,
like every six months,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.630
find a way to get
it to Royal Oak

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.050
to get it reinspected,
to get the thing.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.550
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
I've got to say,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.090
I learn more and more as I
hear you tell these stories,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.167
like more stuff that
I would have never

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:49.250
expected to have happened.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.770
And it's just--

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.220
BRAD GREENHILL: Right.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.090
The truck was--

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.780
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
It's terrifying.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.655
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:56.750
The truck was a terrifyingly
awesome experience.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.670
What was kind of funny about it
is a lot of people thought what

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.020
we were doing was intentional.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.220
And we were just like,
trying to make it happen.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.110
You know, we were just
trying to find a way

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.980
to make food and
sell it and pay rent

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.020
and all this kind of stuff.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.330
But we had these people
come in from Chicago,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.060
and, oh, we heard
about this food truck,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.390
and it's like, very
authentic Thai experience.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.774
And so they came,
and they were like,

00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:26.940
you know, we were just out
of [INAUDIBLE] yesterday,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.090
and honestly, this experience,
it's like you're in Thailand.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.515
Like, there was even a
rat that scurried by.

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:34.140
SPEAKER: Oh no!

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.990
BRAD GREENHILL: And like,
all this kind of stuff.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.371
And I was like, yeah,
it's real, authentic!

00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:41.677
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:43.260
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
That's our mascot.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.570
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.070
Yeah.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.120
SPEAKER: Well, it was
interesting the first time

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.437
that I went to the old
restaurant, which was Katoi.

00:06:50.437 --> 00:06:51.270
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.720
SPEAKER: I would say the
building is very unassuming.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.440
And I don't mean that in
a negative way at all.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.459
But I actually thought
I was in the wrong place

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:00.750
the first time I pulled up to--

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.070
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
It's a common thing.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.690
BRAD GREENHILL: That was
very much intentional.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.530
SPEAKER: OK.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.214
Tell us a little
bit more about that,

00:07:06.214 --> 00:07:07.630
because it is--
the location makes

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.690
sense, the story about being at
Two James as a food truck that

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.690
is not mobile.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.950
But then looking
for space close by--

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.790
because you obviously
found a market that

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.060
was really into your food--

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.530
to look directly
across the street,

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.210
it looks like a white cinder
block, no-window space,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.070
also very small, is
very interesting.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.600
So tell us about that.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.570
BRAD GREENHILL: So
when we were running

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.430
the truck, our third
partner, Philip, we met.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.000
He had just bought that
property across the street

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.760
and wanted to put
a restaurant in.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.620
And he had kind
of a lame concept.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.480
And so we were like,
hey, let's just

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.370
do the food truck concept
in the restaurant.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.410
And sort of the big thing that
we both kind of wanted out

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.480
of it was we wanted it to have
like a rabbit hole effect,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.390
so that there's just
this white building,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.460
and maybe there's a
sign, maybe there's not,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.200
or there's a red
light out front.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.580
Or it's just very unassuming.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.540
But then when you walk
in, it's like you're

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.860
into this whole new
universe, kind of.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:29.601
So that was kind of what
we wanted to do with that.

00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:33.570
And ultimately, we put a
little neon sign out front.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.409
But we pretty much kept
the old building intact,

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.820
up to the false door of the
old entrance and everything.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.560
But we never-- we were just kind
of like, we're in such a rush

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.720
to get open, like,
we never landscaped

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.360
it, never finished anything.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.750
There was just like,
dirt piles outside,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.140
and for like three months, there
was a giant hole in the ground,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.140
because they were
excavating something.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.270
And so it never got done.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.060
And we started working
on the addition.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.730
And then that's when
the fire happened.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.520
SPEAKER: It is exactly that,
because when you walk inside,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.950
you're like, wait,
what just happened?

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.760
I thought I was walking into
almost an abandoned building

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.970
for--

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.650
not anymore.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.530
I think in Takoi, you've
done a lot of transformation

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.220
on the outside.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.320
But I love that you kept
the inside of Katoi,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.430
of Takoi, because
it's so beautiful.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.540
I've heard people
compare it to being

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:36.420
in South Beach or SoHo, or
some of the more vibrant cities

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.290
around the world,
than even in Detroit.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.210
But what did you model
the inside after?

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.480
BRAD GREENHILL: I think
a lot of the inside

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.030
was sort of, before we
opened the first time, was

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.420
a little bit kind of improvved.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.110
We had a sort of aesthetic
that was planned,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.580
which was the bar in the
front, the dining room.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.290
And so it was kind of
like layers of an onion,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.130
like bookends.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.390
Like, you come in, and
there's one experience,

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.890
and then there's
another experience,

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.920
and then there's the
kitchen experience.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.530
And the polycarbonate
was always planned.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.880
But our architect,
he's amazing, but he

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.180
can be, for lack of a
better term, a little stiff.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.970
And he wanted a specific
warm light behind the panels.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.410
And so when we're
building it, Philip,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.470
who is our other partner,
he is a little bit more

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.130
irreverent and excited.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.110
And he was like, no,
let's have colored lights.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.620
And so like when Ish was
around, we kind of like

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.970
took all his work and like,
oh, no, let's do this.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.450
And all the stuff that he would
never allow, we kind of did.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.700
And it took on its own
personality, everything

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.990
from like, there was a crown
of lights around the building,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.760
and stuff like that.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.900
SPEAKER: It's so inspiring.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.010
And maybe someday when people
are in another city in the US,

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.230
they'll say, oh, this is
just like being in Detroit,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.605
because you've
given us something

00:11:06.605 --> 00:11:08.375
really cool to go off of.

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:11.410
BRAD GREENHILL: Well,
we wanted a restaurant

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.727
that you could only
have in Detroit.

00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:14.560
SPEAKER: In Detroit.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:14.850
Yeah.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.641
It feels like that.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:20.700
BRAD GREENHILL: And so keeping
the inside, no painting

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.530
on the cinder block,
and keeping it all old,

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.140
and keeping the graffiti in
there and stuff like that,

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.460
was all very parts of it.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.460
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: It's
also really interesting

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.929
to note the fact that even
for Ish, our architect,

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:33.970
this was the first restaurant
he'd ever designed.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:34.290
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.860
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: So
you have four people--

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.650
I mean, three partners who've
never had a restaurant before,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.440
brick and mortar, and this
is what they come up with.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.240
And another interesting
thing to note

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.370
about the interior
of the restaurant

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.400
is that the booths
and the tables

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.870
are all extremely low-set.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.310
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.800
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
What did you say?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.180
It was Japanese inspired?

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.055
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:56.860
And that was very much
intentional by the architect.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.870
He wanted everything to
be on the same plane,

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:06.700
and low-set, which is sort of
an Eastern philosophy of eating,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.940
being close to the ground.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.790
You know, a lot of
Eastern cultures,

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.300
people sit on the ground
or at very low tables.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.330
And so that was all
very intentional.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.385
Ish, he thinks about things
that I would never think about.

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:23.010
SPEAKER: That's a
good partner to have.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:23.956
BRAD GREENHILL: Great.

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:26.266
SPEAKER: Well, Christina,
I want to give you a chance

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:28.390
to tell us a little bit
about your background, too,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.120
and how you came
into the restaurant.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.120
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Ooh.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.190
Well, I'm originally
from Chicago.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.470
I went to school in New York.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.180
And after school, I thought I
wanted to do market research.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.120
I was a business analyst
for the first two years.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.270
And then it wasn't
really fitting me.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.310
And then I wanted to
go back into education.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.530
That's kind of what
I studied originally.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.490
Went to Spain, lived
abroad, taught there.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.690
Still, something wasn't
exactly pulling at my heart.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.390
I found my way in Philadelphia,
in part for a boy,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.112
in part for a job.

00:13:04.112 --> 00:13:05.800
I will confess that.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.790
And that's actually where
I got my start in food.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.920
And so I just needed to
hit the reset button.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.370
I needed to do something where
I would find immediate results.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.170
I missed having a job that
had some physicality to it,

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.860
some instant results.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.840
And so I got my start
in a really tiny cafe.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.950
And then pretty much
from there on out,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.300
for the past eight and
a half, nine years,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.440
only worked for startups.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.640
I've only worked for
small businesses.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.040
So from that, I loved being
able to wear many hats

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.230
and just try on so
many different roles.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.480
I mean, in many
ways, I was manager.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.700
But I would also
be doing payroll,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.920
or I would also be
doing the marketing,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.690
or I'd be doing
the social media.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.850
So I think, similar
to Brad, I really

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.150
enjoyed having that
entrepreneurial spirit

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.650
and being able to work with food
and work within a community.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:03.140
And in Philadelphia,
people are great.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.270
Philly's a great town.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.740
And I think I came in when
they were having their food

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.550
renaissance.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.390
And that really kept me
inspired and kept me interested.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.010
And so the last
place I worked at,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:19.450
I was running three different
locations-- one in New York,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.770
one in a Whole Foods, and our
brick and mortar location,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.480
which we're a hummus place.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.740
And then next door to me,
actually shared a kitchen

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.880
with another restaurant that was
part of our restaurant group.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.850
And I met Drew Pompa, who is the
original bar director of Takoi.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.690
He had known Brad and Courtney
and Philip for quite some time.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.050
And he was telling me back in,
it was only May, he was saying,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.790
I'm thinking about going back.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.950
I'm like, but you've only
been here for six months.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.520
Like, you haven't even seen
what Philliy has to offer.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.170
And he started telling
me more and more

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.690
about what his job was,
what his position was.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.730
Ironically, his restaurant had
thrown a fundraiser for Katoi

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.320
when it burned down.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.200
So that was only
the first instance

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.709
that I had heard
of the restaurant.

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:11.500
And so everyone in the
restaurant community

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.110
in Philadelphia got
together and raised a couple

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.540
thousand dollars for a
restaurant that none of us

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.714
had ever been to.

00:15:17.714 --> 00:15:20.380
So there's a lot of camaraderie,
a lot of interest in this place

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.405
already.

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:24.030
He was telling me that they were
looking for a general manager.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.020
And I said, I'm pretty
happy with my job.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.700
And then he managed to convince
Philip and Brad to fly out

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.720
to meet me.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.370
And I thought that
was so incredible.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.630
That's so impressive.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.210
You know, only very serious
people, or crazy people,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.850
will do that.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.360
So we had a wonderful
conversation.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.590
And I was a little intrigued.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.692
And I didn't feel like I could
make a decision from there.

00:15:47.692 --> 00:15:49.900
Within two weeks' time, I
booked a flight to Detroit.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.730
It was a 24-hour trip.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.920
I met Courtney,
the third partner.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.230
And she whisked me around town.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.510
And she was like,
the velvet glove

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.050
that made the decision
so much easier.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.400
She introduced me to so
many different people.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.880
And I began to see what
Drew had been talking about,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.700
what all this intrigue
and all this excitement

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.370
and opportunity in Detroit
was, through Courtney's eyes,

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.380
and obviously through
the rest of the team.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.950
So within a week,
I made my decision

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.472
to move and completely
try something new.

00:16:24.472 --> 00:16:26.180
And that's how I ended
up at this family.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.070
BRAD GREENHILL:
Yeah, little known--

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.440
she doesn't even know
this fact right now, but--

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.540
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Oh no.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.960
BRAD GREENHILL: When we first--

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.770
Philip sent me out to
Philly to go talk to Drew,

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.419
to gauge his interest in
coming back to Detroit.

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:45.460
SPEAKER: To win him back.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.850
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah, to win
him back, bring him back.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.190
And this was when
we were rebuilding.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.280
And I met Christina
on that trip.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.500
And I said to my
girlfriend at the time,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.420
I think I'm going
to try and bring

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.887
her back to be general manager.

00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:00.970
She didn't even know that.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.761
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:17:02.761 --> 00:17:05.175
BRAD GREENHILL: The seed
was planted early on.

00:17:05.175 --> 00:17:06.140
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
All the meanwhile, I

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.790
was feeding you food,
and making it nice.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.180
SPEAKER: Yeah, that's a lot
of wooing of you, Christina.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:10.510
BRAD GREENHILL: I know.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.530
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Yeah.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.339
BRAD GREENHILL: The plotting
didn't come till after we left.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:13.619
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: OK.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.380
BRAD GREENHILL: But
I was like, huh.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.659
I had this idea.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:16.865
It was like, in my head.

00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:19.240
And then Drew was like, you
know, I think I have someone.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.800
And I was like, oh,
is it Christina?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.460
And he was like, oh, yeah.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.700
And I was like, yeah, all right.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.000
SPEAKER: Well, we're not here
to promote any other restaurants

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.710
in Detroit, but I'm so curious.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.930
What was that
moment that you had?

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.450
Was it a bunch of
other places that you

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.600
went and saw that there was a
really vibrant food scene here?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.670
Or was there an
actual moment that you

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.526
thought you could make
Detroit your culinary home?

00:17:42.526 --> 00:17:44.900
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Yeah, you
know, I think a lot of it--

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.694
I had been to Detroit a
couple of times before,

00:17:47.694 --> 00:17:48.860
had some really great meals.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.220
I have a few friends
that are from the city.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.450
But I think it was more
about the opportunity

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.340
to work with Brad, the
opportunity to work with Philip

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.010
and Courtney, and
just the way that they

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.780
felt about this
business and everything

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.330
that they thought
that it could be.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.340
I'm someone that has
always chosen opportunities

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.810
based on the people
that I get to work with.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.810
If I get to have a
really good team,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.490
Lord knows how far you can go.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.450
So I mean, I don't know if
it was Brad's anecdotes,

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.154
or if it was
Philip's unbounded--

00:18:21.154 --> 00:18:22.695
BRAD GREENHILL: Now
she's like, super

00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:23.880
annoyed with me all the time.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.921
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Yeah.

00:18:24.921 --> 00:18:25.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.030
I feel like we're
on Sally Jesse's--

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.620
SPEAKER: That happens
in good teams, though.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.990
That's a really important
thing here for us at Google,

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.230
too, is you spend most of
your life, actually, working.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.370
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Right.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.078
SPEAKER: Working with
the people that you

00:18:38.078 --> 00:18:41.420
work with is a really major
part of successful teams.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.330
So it's exciting to hear.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.460
I want to talk about the
food for a minute, too.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.480
So I don't know
if you know this,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.140
but I was at the restaurant
on Saturday night.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.780
And I thought it was
really interesting,

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.510
because I knew I was
going to get a great meal.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.980
But it's very much
an experience.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.050
I hope that that's a
favorable adjective--

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.091
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: 100%.

00:19:01.091 --> 00:19:02.390
SPEAKER: --that you use.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.920
When our server
came to our table,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.380
she actually said, I'll be
your guide for the night.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.030
And all four of us at the table,
one a lot more culinary-wise

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.960
than the three of us, we
noticed that right away.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.060
And we asked her about
it when she came back.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.190
And she said, one
thing about Takoi

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.555
is that we hope to awaken
all five of the senses.

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:25.930
So we don't want
you to just have

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.320
a sweet and savory experience.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.990
We want it to be everything.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.230
Can you talk to us a little bit
about that, that notion that we

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.270
have servers who
are more so guides

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.279
that take us through
our experience at Takoi?

00:19:38.279 --> 00:19:39.820
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.670
I think, just in
terms of nomenclature,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.840
I mean, the idea of server
and waiter is very antiquated.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.940
And I think for us, we want to
have a level of inclusivity.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.620
We want people to
feel seen and heard,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.030
and this is a safe place.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.430
So the idea of having
someone be a guide

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.710
is a lot more accurate
of what the experience

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.340
is for anyone new or a
veteran that's coming in.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.820
And so many of the
foods and ingredients

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.500
are incredibly
unfamiliar to people.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.640
So the idea of a person
who is super knowledgeable,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.550
who is super passionate, is able
to walk you through and help

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.950
you curate the
choices of what you're

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.600
going to be experiencing--

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.490
I mean so much of
what Brad's cooking is

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.620
is bold, flavorful, loud,
spicy, things on the extreme.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.930
So depending on what
it is that people need

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.390
and what people want,
if you're a newbie who

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.017
doesn't necessarily want to have
something that's super spicy,

00:20:35.017 --> 00:20:35.850
you know, certainly.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.465
Someone will be able to
provide something for you.

00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:40.590
There is something for
everyone on that menu, which

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.360
is super exciting.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.090
SPEAKER: The connection back
to technology or social media

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.730
or however you want to say it is
very interesting, because when

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.910
you do look at your menu online,
there are a lot of things

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.990
that, to the novice person,
you're not familiar with.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.490
I'm going to say it
wrong, but the branzino,

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.771
the full fish that comes out.

00:20:58.771 --> 00:21:01.270
One of our guests was like,
I've never heard of that before.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.500
So I went to YouTube and I
watched a 10-minute video

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.450
on how to eat a whole
fish, because there

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.790
is an actual technique.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.800
So talk to us a
little bit about how

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.670
you guys are using technology,
social media, or what

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.470
channels you're finding success
growing the business with.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:24.130
BRAD GREENHILL: Well, I think
we use technology every day.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.600
And I think that we'll continue
to use it more and more.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.480
Everything from our
reservation ticketing system,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.510
it's called Tock,
so it's online.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.190
And rather than-- we
don't have reservations

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.800
in the traditional
sense, but you

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.900
can buy a ticket to come to
the restaurant with a group,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.620
and then-- so it's similar
to going to a concert

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.790
or something like that.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.980
So that's one example.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.840
And of course, there's
Instagram and Facebook

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.830
and stuff like that.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.940
But everything from
spreadsheets to--

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.120
I think we only have scratched
the surface on how much we

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.050
can use technology.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.710
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Absolutely.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.126
I think there's a
lot more that we

00:22:12.126 --> 00:22:14.970
can do to maximize,
especially once we

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.400
start delving more into video.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.510
Brad always says, he
never wants to tell people

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.570
how to eat their food.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.486
BRAD GREENHILL: Right.

00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:23.310
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: But I think,
you know, a lot of times people

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.590
will reference-- how do people
make decisions on where they're

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:26.715
going to eat for a weekend?

00:22:26.715 --> 00:22:27.900
They're going to go to Yelp.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.150
They're going to go to Google.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.510
And they're to go to Instagram.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.100
And so with all
those things, people,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.590
we rely so heavily
on those visual cues

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.400
and those visual choices.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.690
And by bolstering
up those pieces,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.150
it allows for
people to understand

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.530
what they can expect.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.110
I mean, for me, I didn't
have the opportunity

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.905
to visit the restaurant
before I decided to move.

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:52.600
I didn't have the opportunity
to even taste the food.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.030
So in many ways, I was
coming in as a consumer.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.240
I was coming in as like,
a brand new person.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.360
And so from what I had
gleaned, based on social media,

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.370
based on everything
that I had read,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:04.905
was a lot of
important information.

00:23:04.905 --> 00:23:06.840
And I think the more
that we translate

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.290
our story and our narrative
that way, the more powerful

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:09.870
it can be.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.453
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:10.453 --> 00:23:15.180
We are in an environment where
sight, sound, and motion is now

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.160
cost of entry.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.150
So it's more than
the Instagram's

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.930
of the world, where you have
these beautiful images of food.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:22.440
It's video.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.710
And it's something that we talk
a lot about with our customers

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.460
here at Google.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.350
It's kind of, if
you don't have it,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.830
you're not on a
consideration list.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.165
BRAD GREENHILL: Right.

00:23:31.165 --> 00:23:32.456
SPEAKER: So that's interesting.

00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:35.700
What would be, if you
had endless budgets,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.460
marketing budgets to produce
some crazy video, what would be

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.440
your dream video that would--

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.940
not an anthem, per se.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.137
But is it how to
eat a whole fish?

00:23:44.137 --> 00:23:45.720
Or is it something
else that you would

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.720
want to use to promote
the restaurant?

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.220
BRAD GREENHILL: Like, you mean
if I had my own Netflix show?

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.230
SPEAKER: Or anything.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.400
Would you create your
own Netflix show?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.719
Anything.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:55.510
BRAD GREENHILL: No.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.770
Well, I think it
would start with sort

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.850
of some how-tos,
educational sort of things

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.720
on how some of the
food is prepared.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.490
And not necessarily
how you eat it,

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:12.440
but how it's presented,
and sort of culture

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.405
and history around that.

00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:19.050
We use a lot of
different techniques

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:23.350
that aren't used in a
lot of other kitchens.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.690
Most places are French-based.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.380
So a lot of people come work
for me, and they're like,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.380
this doesn't make sense.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.450
This is like, the exact
opposite of everything

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.540
that I've been taught.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:39.980
So I think that would be sort of
the start, sort of the process

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.790
and what is behind the food,
because everything we make

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.590
is from scratch.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.580
And there's different
pastes and fermentations

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.880
and stuff like that.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.020
And so to me, as
kind of like a nerd,

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.760
that's what I would be into.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.590
I would want to see
the video of, oh,

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.750
how do they ferment that?

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.100
Or how do they make that?

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.760
So I think that's kind
of where it would start,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.100
and kind of evolve from there.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.310
But maybe Christina has
some different ideas.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.830
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Yeah, no.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.330
I think that's
absolutely important.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.520
I think so much of what
the experience is at Takoi

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.700
is encouraging
people to take risks.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.600
Like you said, the exterior
is very, in many ways,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.220
unassuming and uninviting.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.300
And what is it?

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.520
Like, how do you encourage
people to take risks?

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.470
And then how do you
then reward them

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.440
for being awesome and
trying something new

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.350
and trying something that they
never expected they would like?

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.750
So I think getting
people to understand

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.810
some of the base
of the ingredients,

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.960
but also profiling the
different spaces within.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.200
Going back to the interiors,
we also have a DJ room.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.510
We also have-- which
is an annex, which

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.720
is a waiting room, which is
a threshold into the patio.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.410
So there are so many different
features to the space

00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:00.030
that are really interesting and
very complex, but ultimately,

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.820
a place where people can
find themselves within.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.215
I think it's allowing for
people to find themselves

00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:08.740
within our world
that can make it

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.164
a really wonderful experience.

00:26:10.164 --> 00:26:11.580
SPEAKER: One thing
that I think is

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.270
kind of the elephant
in the room,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.910
so I'll let you guys
take this question

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.200
and answer it however
you want, but there

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.780
is a lot of speculation around
the fire, around what happened,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.630
and a lot of fans who, here
and even in this room, who

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.080
had been to Katoi several
times and were shocked when

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.300
the fire happened, and
the delay between Katoi

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.940
and now what's Takoi.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.205
So feel free to address
that however you want.

00:26:35.205 --> 00:26:36.080
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:43.890
Well, I was in Thailand at the
time that the fire happened.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.958
Luckily-- yeah.

00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:46.166
SPEAKER: Yeah, it wasn't you.

00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:47.850
BRAD GREENHILL:
Yeah, it wasn't me.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.700
Luckily, it was at the
tail end of my trip,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.890
so I didn't have a
tough decision to make.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.410
I was leaving the next day.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.477
But yeah.

00:26:56.477 --> 00:26:58.810
There's always been a lot of
speculation about the fire.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:04.590
But basically what happened
was, like I was saying,

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.339
we were building a
new addition to the--

00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:11.005
we had put on another
shipping container

00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:15.000
and the bar was going to
extend out to the right side.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And then there was going to
be a little secret garden

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.140
on the side patio.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:27.630
And they had just put in a glass
screen door, which is now still

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:31.420
on the shipping container
that's in a different spot.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.900
But what they failed to
take into consideration

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.290
was that that screen
door was completely

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:42.450
shielded off from Michigan
and also from 17th.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:49.750
So anyone could easily come
and not be seen from that side.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.980
So what happened was,
there was a series

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.270
of break-ins that night.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.210
The first one was at
Nemo's down the street.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.506
And someone went in, smashed the
window, stole a bunch of booze.

00:28:01.506 --> 00:28:03.380
And then a little bit
later that night, there

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.330
was a break-in at our place.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:11.130
So someone had smashed
that screen window,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.200
went into that
shipping container,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.420
and then broke the window
to get into the restaurant.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.370
And again, no one's going to
see this or hear it happening.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.540
Went in and stole pretty
much all the booze

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.370
within arm's reach, and
ran out the back door.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:38.480
They found one of the
bags of booze out there.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:46.590
And we have a little tip safe
up at the counter, where,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.640
actually, the fire started.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.660
They tried to-- they
smashed it open with an axe

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:58.230
that we had by our smoker
that we used to split wood

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.420
to put it into the smoker.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.170
So it was someone who
was familiar with--

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.700
who had walked around
in the neighborhood,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.970
to know that that wood
splitter was there,

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:17.490
to know that that
entrance had literally,

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.700
two days before the fire,
just been installed.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.190
So as someone-- yeah,
someone in the area.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:32.010
And then they started a fire
at the host stand, which

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:35.690
why they did, we don't know.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.660
The speculation that we
have is at the host stand

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:44.040
was where we have
the stereo equipment.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.070
And so our thought
was that they probably

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.880
thought that that was a camera
system, because it's not clear

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.410
that it's stereo.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.440
And so that was
all wood encased.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.720
So they started a fire there
and it ran out the back door.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.390
There was a witness.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.860
There was a suspect.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:09.370
And I believe that there
was someone brought

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.480
into custody that said that
they broke in but didn't

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.040
start the fire.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.430
But there's no proof linking
them to the whole thing.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.930
But--

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.150
SPEAKER: It's still
an unsolved mystery.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.608
BRAD GREENHILL: It's an unsolved
mystery, as far as I know.

00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:28.900
I haven't checked in
on it for a long time.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.720
You know, right
afterwards, you're

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.040
like, you want to
catch the person.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.010
And then you start realizing
that more than likely,

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:41.460
the person who did
this was like--

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:46.390
there's no-- the punishment
doesn't fit the crime, kind of.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.920
Like, what-- it's not going
to bring the restaurant back.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.000
This guy's life
already is not good.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.960
You know, he's probably
homeless, alcoholic.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.860
In a lot of ways, this is--

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.160
if he goes to jail, his life
will probably be better.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.660
You know?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.307
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:07.307 --> 00:31:08.640
BRAD GREENHILL: Debatable, but--

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.223
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:09.223 --> 00:31:10.960
Trials and
tribulations, for sure.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.390
So you reopened in
December of 2017?

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.070
Or was it even--

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.520
BRAD GREENHILL: August.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.210
SPEAKER: Oh, it was August.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:16.320
Excuse--

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:16.920
BRAD GREENHILL: August.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.503
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:31:17.503 --> 00:31:20.260
And we were all thrilled
to see you reopen.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.770
So talk to us a little bit
about maybe the future.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:28.180
What is Takoi-- is it going to
grow beyond the space it's in

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.970
now?

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.607
Or any other plans for 2.0?

00:31:30.607 --> 00:31:32.690
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: Yeah,
there's a couple things.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.686
I mean, we finally--

00:31:33.686 --> 00:31:34.810
we've been open, what, now?

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.500
Six months?

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:35.640
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.223
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
And we finally hit

00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:41.500
our stride, and still dealing
with crazy busy Saturdays,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.600
like the one that you were at.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.300
And we're trying to figure
out more ways how we

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.360
can offer different features.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.320
So Brad is doing, once a month,
these special green room dinner

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:53.830
series.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.330
They're like small,
intimate dinners

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:59.380
where he's cooking food that has
never been on the menu before.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.000
They're completely one-off.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.610
And they're inspired by
different regions of Thailand.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.247
So this past one that he did
was southern Thai cuisine,

00:32:06.247 --> 00:32:08.330
and the one before that
was northern Thai cuisine.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.454
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:32:09.454 --> 00:32:11.120
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
In addition to that,

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.590
what is different from
1.0 is that we now

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.530
have DJs that regularly play.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.360
So there's Wednesdays
for happy hour,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.860
and then Friday and
Saturday nights.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.820
So we're definitely going to
build out that as a feature

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.742
and have some great acts
during movement, hopefully.

00:32:29.742 --> 00:32:31.700
Just a lot-- we're going
to be opening a patio.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.180
BRAD GREENHILL:
Patio season, yeah.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.110
SPEAKER: Plans for a
patio, that's exciting.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.900
BRAD GREENHILL: The patio--

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.390
when we opened,
wisely, we decided

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.460
not to open the patio also.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.800
That gives us a
little bit of time

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.270
to figure out what
we want to do.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.110
But yeah.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:50.330
We're going to have food
out on the patio that's

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.330
a little bit different
from what you get inside.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:58.060
It's going to be more, kind
of as if you were visiting

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.880
a street stall in Thailand
or something like that,

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.330
so very kind of street food.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.420
And it's going to be cool.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.200
And then from there, there
isn't plans for a Takoi 2.0,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:19.790
but we are, same team, opening
a restaurant called Magnet.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.782
We'll be opening in August.

00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.710
SPEAKER: Where will
Magnet be located?

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:28.890
BRAD GREENHILL: It's in
Detroit, Grand River and Warren.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.590
So our partner Philip owns
some property over there.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:38.260
So Takoi is in an old garage.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.779
This is is an old radiator shop.

00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:40.320
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.160
BRAD GREENHILL:
So there is like--

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.310
I think it'll very much
be the sister restaurant,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.720
but we won't be the same.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.470
Like, you'll know it's
by the same people.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.840
SPEAKER: Totally different menu?

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.210
BRAD GREENHILL: Totally
different style of food.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.585
SPEAKER: Totally
different style.

00:33:53.585 --> 00:33:55.570
What would the
style of Magnet be?

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.622
BRAD GREENHILL:
Without going into it--

00:33:57.622 --> 00:33:58.622
SPEAKER: Oh yeah, sorry.

00:33:58.622 --> 00:33:59.350
Has this been announced?

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.580
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
Good question.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.050
SPEAKER: Is this your
official announcement?

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.866
BRAD GREENHILL: This
could be, a little bit.

00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:04.616
SPEAKER: Oh, nice.

00:34:04.616 --> 00:34:06.700
Yes.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.670
BRAD GREENHILL: I won't get into
specific regions of the world,

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.650
but the whole kitchen is
going to be fire-driven.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:18.360
So it's wood-fired
grill, wood-fired oven,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.469
wood-fired plancha, coal pits.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:25.449
So the whole kitchen is
all based on wood fire,

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.360
live wood-fire cooking.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.639
So that informs it quite a bit.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.340
And I think the
other aspect of it,

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:38.070
it's going to be very
plant focused, so heavy

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.739
vegetarian, vegan influence.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:46.780
From there, I think the rest,
the world is our palate.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.570
I think more what
we're kind of going

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:54.940
for is creating a, for
lack of a better term,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.720
Detroit food, like something
that could only come from here,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.610
based on what's around
us and stuff like that.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.965
SPEAKER: Something other
than Faygo Redpop and Better

00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:10.440
Made potato chips and
Buddy's Pizza, which we love.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.130
Those are great.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.600
BRAD GREENHILL: All great,
but we don't have to--

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.850
SPEAKER: We need a new palate.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.200
BRAD GREENHILL: It doesn't mean
it's Detroit just because you

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.700
braise your ribs in Rock and
Rye or crumble Better Made chips

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.300
on it.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.216
SPEAKER: Where does the
name Magnet come from?

00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:31.260
BRAD GREENHILL: So
the former business

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.367
that was there was called
Magnet Radiator Works.

00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:33.950
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:39.030
BRAD GREENHILL: And so when we
got the building, I was like,

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.390
that's a cool name.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.940
And so we started thinking
about, creatively,

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.130
what's the concept of a magnet?

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:51.420
And a magnet is something that
sort of attracts and pulls

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.880
people or items together.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.470
And so that's kind
of loosely the theme

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.530
going behind the
food, is the idea

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.450
of what are the foods
near us, around us,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.300
that we're sort of
attracted to, and what

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.330
are the foods that are kind
of attracted to each other?

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.380
So that's sort of the
basis of creatively

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.420
how I'm approaching it.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.900
SPEAKER: What's your soft
launch date or target open date?

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.760
Do you have one?

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.780
BRAD GREENHILL:
That I can't say.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.988
SPEAKER: Is that a tough one?

00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:30.020
BRAD GREENHILL:
Sometime in the summer.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:30.910
SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.170
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.660
Probably on the later side.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:32.850
SPEAKER: Great.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.810
Well, that's exciting.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:35.485
BRAD GREENHILL: Don't
hold me to August.

00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:38.300
SPEAKER: We'll be
looking forward to that.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.330
I want to allow time if
there's any questions.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.405
It looks like we've got one
over here to start with.

00:36:44.405 --> 00:36:45.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.750
Thanks, guys, for coming in.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.660
We really appreciate it.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.120
Takoi is definitely my favorite
spot in all of Detroit,

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:51.680
hands down.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.000
So thank you.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.640
One comment, and two questions--
sorry to be that guy.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.170
The comment is I
think it's awesome

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.050
that with this new
Magnet restaurant,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.742
that you're not shying
away from having

00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:03.950
open fire in your restaurant.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:04.825
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:37:04.825 --> 00:37:07.350
AUDIENCE: It's almost
like an homage to Katoi.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:07.975
So I like that.

00:37:07.975 --> 00:37:09.391
BRAD GREENHILL:
Well, the irony is

00:37:09.391 --> 00:37:10.880
that we're going
to have open fire,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.430
and then the design
that Ish has come up

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.800
with for the whole front
of the house is all wood.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.329
So you know--

00:37:18.329 --> 00:37:20.120
CHRISTINA PONSARAN:
We'll see what happens.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.203
AUDIENCE: Fingers crossed.

00:37:21.203 --> 00:37:22.971
BRAD GREENHILL: Be very careful.

00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:23.970
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.330
One's real-- well,
not simple, but I'm

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.780
just curious why Thai
was the selected food

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.890
choice for Katoi, now Takoi.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:37.140
And then two, if you could
maybe expand a little bit--

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.030
I've heard the story
from Courtney--

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.160
on the transition
period, what happened

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.242
between the fire at Katoi
and the reopening of Takoi,

00:37:45.242 --> 00:37:46.950
in terms of keeping
all of your employees

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.260
on and bouncing around to make
sure that there was always

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:49.990
something to do.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.920
And I also like the
story about the rally

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.080
of all of the restaurants,
not just around Detroit,

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.980
but around a lot of the Midwest
and even to the East Coast,

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.560
that kind of showed support
to raise money for you guys

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.744
to keep you moving.

00:38:03.744 --> 00:38:07.350
BRAD GREENHILL: Well, I'll
start with the first question,

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.480
why Thai.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.770
There's really no
great answer to it.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.430
It was a philosophy
and style of food

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.660
that I just found
myself, probably

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.520
about eight to 10
years ago, migrating

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.280
towards without really knowing.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:29.970
The concepts of sweet and
sour, salty, savory, spicy, I

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.570
started incorporating
heavily into sort

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.180
of my Italian
Mediterranean cooking I

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.830
was doing at the time.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.760
And around that time is when I
started exploring Asian markets

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.730
and discovered fish
sauce and all this,

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.250
and started really studying.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:49.400
And I'm always a curious
cook, so I probably

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.750
have 400 or 500 cookbooks.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.910
So like, I'm always trying
to learn the next thing.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:39:00.780
And this was just what
I sort of migrated to.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:06.060
And so when-- but I
had an issue always

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:10.410
being known as the Italian
guy, or the Mediterranean guy.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:15.420
And so I would be doing
these Thai dishes,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.262
but labeling it on my menu
as like, Italian food,

00:39:20.262 --> 00:39:25.770
kind of renaming it based on
the ingredients that were in it.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.460
And so finally, when Courtney
decided do the food truck

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.050
and asked me about
it, I was like,

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.460
if we're doing a
food truck, this

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.190
is when I'm just
going to switch over

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:40.650
and just come at food completely
from a Thai, Southeast

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:45.480
Asian perspective, rather than
sprinkling that into the food

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.380
that I currently made.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.710
And the nature of
the food truck,

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.890
being street food
and stuff like that,

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:59.390
felt like the natural jump-off
point to doing Thai full-time.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.805
Now, with going into Magnet,
it's like how am I going to--

00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:05.190
I don't know that
I can fully go back

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:12.710
to doing a different style of
food, because I'm warped from--

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.926
once you go Thai,
you don't go back.

00:40:14.926 --> 00:40:17.406
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:24.750
And but it'll be a
lot of fun revisiting

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.120
sort of some food
I cooked before,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.020
with new knowledge
and a new palate,

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.480
and bringing sort of some of
that dynamic boldness of Thai

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:41.460
cuisine into something that
may be more Mediterranean

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:47.160
or Italian or Middle Eastern or
something like that, or Indian.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.210
It's always just trying
to find new flavors

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:55.290
and expanding my
knowledge as well as

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.595
what we're feeding guests.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.510
Yeah.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.535
And then second question--

00:41:03.535 --> 00:41:04.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.367
The second question
was the process

00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:07.950
that happened between
Katoi and Takoi.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.825
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:41:08.825 --> 00:41:12.640
So a lot happened
in between that.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.940
So the fire happened.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.390
And I got back, and the
first thing you think

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:25.230
is like, I have 42 employees
who don't have income,

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.480
don't have a job.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.250
What are we going to do?

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.660
And luckily, the community,
being as awesome as it is,

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.330
rallied.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.860
And there was fundraisers,
seemingly like every day,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.590
everywhere.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:45.150
And so we used
that money to give

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.060
to all the employees
a little stipend

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:52.770
until they could find
temporary new work,

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:56.040
because we knew we
couldn't keep everyone on.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.910
So we basically kept
like, a management team

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:03.090
and some few others,
like a core group

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:07.480
that we employed throughout
the duration of the closure.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.680
So on my end, I started
doing what I did before

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.980
and organizing pop-ups all over
the place-- so Motor City Wine,

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.990
and we did one at Mabel Gray,
Grey Ghost, Selden Standard.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.390
And it also just
happened to correspond

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.260
with the opening of
a place called Frame

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:34.590
in Hazel Park, which their
concept was having prolonged

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.120
residences for guest chefs.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.075
And so they were
just about to open,

00:42:39.075 --> 00:42:40.200
so it worked out perfectly.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.460
We were there for three months.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.930
And we did dinners
three days a week--

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.590
or yeah, two seatings
three days a week.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:54.850
And that kept my
team pretty nimble.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:57.545
We were working on
stuff that whole time.

00:42:57.545 --> 00:42:58.920
SPEAKER: I attended
one of those.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.230
And I thought it was
interesting, because we just

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.380
assumed that with this
pop-up at Frame, that we were

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.210
going to have a table for four.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.050
And it was a happy
surprise that when we went,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.790
it was family-style seating.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:15.000
So we were seated at a
table with like 15 people.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.650
And we had a chance to get
to know a bunch of people

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.500
and talk about
the food together.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.210
So I loved that concept
and what that was.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.210
BRAD GREENHILL: So yeah.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.700
It was very much after the fire,
I felt more like a FEMA officer

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.470
than like a chef, you know?

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:38.340
But the community was absolutely
amazing, just so supportive,

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:44.040
everything from chef friends
hiring some of my kitchen

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:48.840
people, even though they knew
it was going to be temporary,

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.120
or hiring servers, or whatever.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.116
And so it was great.

00:43:53.116 --> 00:43:54.990
SPEAKER: I think that's
the magic of Detroit.

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.400
You won't find
another city where

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.410
people are willing to help each
other more in circumstances

00:43:59.410 --> 00:43:59.910
like that.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:00.784
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:44:00.784 --> 00:44:05.490
And I think the fact that
there was this public sort

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:11.760
of rallying around our staff
that it influences places

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.380
like Philly or Chicago
or something else.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.840
Other people see
that, and it's hard

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.050
not to get swept up in that.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.390
SPEAKER: Yeah, in the community.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.265
BRAD GREENHILL: Yeah.

00:44:23.265 --> 00:44:26.040
And I think people
can relate to it.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.200
You know, they go
to work every day

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:34.674
and they're like, if my place
burned down, what would I do?

00:44:34.674 --> 00:44:36.840
CHRISTINA PONSARAN: That
was certainly the mentality

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.620
that the former restaurant
group that I worked for had.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.980
I mean, we all were very
aware that they'd also just

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.470
been nominated for
a James Beard Award.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.700
And then just, what?

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.920
A week or two later,
a fire happened?

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.790
So the Philly community
had this whole idea

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.930
of a brother-in-arms scenario,
and wanted to do anything,

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.850
to do everything that
they could do to help.

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.860
So yeah.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.660
SPEAKER: Tell us,
last but not least,

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.460
because I know we're
getting close on time,

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.239
tell us about the dish that
you brought here today for us.

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:09.780
BRAD GREENHILL: So
the dish I brought

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.700
today is called Som Tum Thai.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.150
It's a very common--

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:20.400
we serve it at the restaurant,
and it's very prevalent

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.550
all over the
country of Thailand.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:28.560
It's one of the few sort of
traditional dishes that we do.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.040
In Thailand, there's probably
infinite variations on it.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.300
Everyone has their own
sort of version of it,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.720
depending on what region
of the country you're in.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:47.440
But the basis of it is som
is sour, and tum is to pound.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.230
So the idea is it's a generally
sour sort of salad that's

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.900
built in a mortar and pestle.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.370
So the defining
characteristics--

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.620
sour and spicy, always.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.710
So it's green papaya
that's been pounded

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:10.500
with a little bit of garlic,
Thai chilies, tomatoes,

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.690
long beans, and fish sauce,
palm sugar, little lime juice.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:21.270
Normally in Thailand, you would
always find dried shrimp in it.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:25.050
I like the dried shrimp in
it, but as a crowd pleaser,

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:28.160
we tend to take it out of there.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.080
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.460
I saw a lot of bowls
being filled back there.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.920
So thank you very much.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.650
And thank you so much
for coming in for today.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.880
Let's get one more round
of applause for our guests

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.480
from Takoi.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.080
Thank you.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.530
[APPLAUSE]
