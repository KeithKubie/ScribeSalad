00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.620
Solve using the
elimination method.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.290
And they tell us the sum
of two numbers is 70.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.940
Their difference is 24.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.780
What are the two numbers?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.212
So let's use this
first sentence.

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:12.420
Let's construct an equation
from this first sentence.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.860
Let's construct a constraint.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.920
The sum of two numbers.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.660
Let's call those
numbers x and y.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.890
So their sum, x plus
y, is equal to 70.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.810
That's what this first
sentence tells us.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.430
The second sentence says
their difference is 24.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.334
So that means that x
minus y is equal to 24.

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:32.750
We're just going to assume
that x is the larger of the two

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.640
numbers, and y is
the smaller one.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.473
So when you take their
difference like this,

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:37.610
you get positive 24.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.730
So we have a system of two
equations with two unknowns.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.750
And they want us to solve it
using the elimination method.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.140
So let's do that.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.677
So if we were to just
add these two equations,

00:00:48.677 --> 00:00:50.760
on the left-hand side, we
would have a positive y,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.557
and we would have a
negative y over here.

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:53.640
And they would cancel out.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610
So if we were to just
add these two equations,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.650
we would be able to
eliminate the y's.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.820
So let's do that.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.540
So x plus y plus x minus y.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.670
Well, the plus y and
the minus y cancel out.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.210
And you're just left with
an x plus an x, which is 2x.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.330
And then that is going to
be equal to 70 plus 24.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.944
70 plus 24 is 94.

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:15.360
And I want to make
it very clear--

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120
and I mentioned it
in previous videos--

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.970
that this process of adding the
equations to each other, this

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.750
is nothing new.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.440
We're really just adding the
same thing to both sides.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.720
We could do it as to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.570
You could say we're adding 24
to both sides of this equation.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.330
Over here were explicitly
adding 24 to the 70.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.740
And over here you could say
we could add 24 to x plus y,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.080
but the second constraint
tells us that x minus y

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.920
is the same thing as 24.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.950
So we're adding the same
thing to both sides.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530
Here we're calling it 24.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.410
Here we're calling it x minus y.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.500
And we were able
to eliminate the y.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
So we get 2x is equal to 94.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.250
Now we can divide both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.750
And we are left with x is
equal to-- what is that?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.090
47.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.010
And now we can substitute
back into either one

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.100
of these equations
to solve for y.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.200
So let's try this
first one over here.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.630
So we have 47 plus
y is equal to 70.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.270
We can subtract 47 from
both sides of this equation.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.020
So we subtract 47.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.550
And we are left with y is
equal to-- what is this?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.020
23.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.500
y is equal to 23.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.980
And you can verify
that it works.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.230
If you add the two numbers, 47
plus 23, you definitely get 70.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.190
And then if you take 47 minus
23, you definitely get 24.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.767
So it definitely meets
both constraints.
