Hello, I'm Craig Benzine.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.420
Also known as WheezyWaiter, also known as Craig.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.300
You don't even have to refer to me, really. If you don't wanna.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.540
Do you want to know more about movies?
 sure! We all do!

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.620
Well, you're in luck! Because for the next year, that's what we're gonna be talking about here at Crash Course Film.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.300
I'll be leading you through the first sixteen weeks of that with Crash Course Film History.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.460
We'll look at the complex, inspiring, and sometimes upsetting story of how movies came to be,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.240
and how they evolved into what we now see at the Megaplex, or NetFlix, or on DVDs from Redbox,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.560
or on Blu-ray, or you know, DVDs from
Best Buy, or you know wherever.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.420
Because, as I'm sure you know, movies
haven't always look like they do now.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.740
There was a real long process to
figure out what they ... were!

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.240
Were they spectacles? Documentaries?
Short films? If so, how short?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.540
Long films? If so, how long?
Is black and white better than color?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.280
Should sound be the industry standard?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.820
'And where should we make them?' Because at first, Hollywood wasn't the epicentre of film making.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.480
So many questions! And I'll do my best to
answer them. At least, a lot of big ones.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.800
See, nobody really planned on movies!
They were an accident.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.860
And most of the people that developed the
original technologies, even THEY didn't think
movies had a future.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.720
Studying film is really studying people,
psychology, society, and technology.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.580
What do we want? What do we fear, and why?
What inspires us?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.320
Like many art forms, film gives us
a window into these things.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.820
So, I hope you'll join me for the next few months
as we dive deep into the history of movies here on
Crash Course Film.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.780
