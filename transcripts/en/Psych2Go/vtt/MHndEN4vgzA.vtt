00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
Crazy about your crush?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.450
Chances are, they might also be into you.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.819
Here are seven sure signs your crush likes
you back.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.759
One; they make time to see you.

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.350
Some people are naturally fast and known to
do the queen bees and kings of texting, but

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.570
if your crash is especially shy and reserved
and know to be unresponsive but makes time

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.760
to see you, this is a dead giveaway that they
enjoy your company.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.759
Two: they make excuses to get close to you.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.340
Do they ever brush their arm against yours
or give you hugs?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.000
Physical affection is sweet and they might
be trying to show you that they...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.430
You know, like - like you.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.880
Three; they remember the small details about
you.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.559
If they seem to know you more than you know
yourself, not only do they like you back but

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.020
you've also found yourself a keeper.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.710
Four; they let you in on their personal life.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.180
How close is too close until it's time to
make a move?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.190
When someone is being real with you, they
let you in on their secrets.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.050
That includes embarrassing stories, thinks
they aren't so proud of or memories that still

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.420
haunt them.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.500
Congratulations!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.870
This means they feel at ease with you.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.260
Five; they develop an interest in your hobbies.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.300
Maybe you love playing League of Legends or
enjoy baking.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.860
If your crush who's usually not into those
activities starts to play video games with

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.200
you or bakes you cookies, they might be trying
to impress you.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.550
Six; they act cold and distant randomly.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.950
Okay, this sounds weird right?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.920
But sometimes people, especially shy ones,
try to seem like they don't like you, fearing

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.700
you don't reciprocate the same feelings.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.250
It's the whole fight-or-flight scenario.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.670
Deep down though, they hope you notice their
absence and want you to reach out.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.330
Seven; they make it obvious that they're single.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.500
Thinks it's too good to be true?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Think again.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.500
If they haven't friend-zoned you by calling
you their sis or bro, then this is a sure

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
sign.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.810
They've already made up their mind about their
feelings but do they know you have?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.390
Be bold and make the next move, you never
really know unless you try.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.670
Do any of these signs sound familiar?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.140
What's stopping you from asking your crush
out?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.490
Thanks for watching!

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.600
Hi everyone.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.360
As you may have noticed, we don't post as
often as we'd like anymore.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.950
We are low on funding as our expenses are
exceeding our revenue.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.360
However, we want to keep making more content
that help people learn about psychology and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.530
mental health.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.920
So we want you to be a part of that process.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.450
Starting today, we will have a donate button
underneath our videos.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.370
You've probably seen it in some of your favorite
channels already but if you don't see the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.790
button, we've included a link in the video
description.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.540
Our vision is to keep making psychology more
accessible to everyone.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.710
We try to keep our videos concise and create
open dialogues among the community.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.290
As a supporter, you will receive recognition
for your support by having a cool site icon

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.610
next to your username when you comment.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.590
This helps us recognize it's you and engage
you more.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.260
On top of this, you will also receive a free
copy of our Psych2Go eBook and occasional

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.110
magazines every quarter.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.010
Just email in to myself when you've donated
and I will send you the copies at tai@psych2go.net.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.320
However, even if you cannot support us financially,
we still totally understand.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.600
You can help us out by sharing this video.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.750
We still love you and we'll give you a free
eBook if you mail in to let us know.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.340
There is no fixed term or shady things like
that.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.070
You can also cancel your support at any time
too.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.100
So there's absolutely no risk.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.030
We promise to use your funding wisely and
for creating new videos that can help others.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.770
Let's make psychology more accessible for
everyone.
