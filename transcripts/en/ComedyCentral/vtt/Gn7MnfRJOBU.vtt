00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:05.171
In order to be falsely
accused I would need accusers.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:08.007
I turned to my intern, Josh,
and his girlfriend, Tina.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.344
So this is the police blotter
for the city of Burbank.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.347 align:start position:0%
Now pick a crime on here,
any crime at all,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.815 size:78% position:39%
and then accuse me of it.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.583 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to back down
no matter what,

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.752
no matter what the police say,
certainly no matter what I say.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start position:0%
Just point the finger of blame
at me, please,

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start position:0%
and keep it pointed.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:24.991 align:end position:100%
Okay.
Yeah, no problem.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.726 align:start position:0%
Okay, good.
See, look here.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.562 align:start position:0%
Someone's been stealing avocados
from this woman's tree.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.097 align:start position:0%
Like, that's perfect.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.900
What you doing?
Oh, you're getting started.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.669
- You know what to do?
- I think Tina's got it.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.939
(Forrest)
But very quickly, I began
to suspect I'd left this task

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.707
to the wrong people.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.410
Josh and Tina seemed to be
putting off their accusation

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.979
in favor of all other
manner of business.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:48.781
While on an outing
to buy headphones

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.316
from a store
called craigslist,

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.918
Tina ran out of gas.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.020 align:end position:100%
You get this at the gas station,
fill it up with gas.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.354
Well, if I'm going
to the gas station,

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.123
- I'm just gonna fill it up.
- Sure.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.791
- Yes, you can hold on to that.
- Have a good day.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.560 align:end position:100%
I hope you weren't doing
anything really important.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:02.128
To be honest, I was not,

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.931
but this is still
an inconvenience.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.133
(Forrest)
Josh, in an effort to make up
for this frustrating time suck,

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.801
offered to have
my glasses fixed...

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.903 align:end position:100%
Like, this side is closer
to my face than this side.

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.705
(Forrest)
An errand
which I did appreciate,

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:14.807
as they'd been crooked
ever since I was shot in them.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.143
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.580
I felt useless in the meantime,
a feeling Tina tried to soothe

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.316
by having me sign some responses
to our fan mail.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.817
I guess they'd get a big kick

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.886 align:start size:66% position:34%
out of seeing my name
signed on there, huh?

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.122
(Forrest)
I began to suspect my
coconspirators had completely

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.723
forgotten their assignment.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.091 align:start position:0%
Great.
And that's just your whole name.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.626 align:start position:0%
All right.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.796
(Forrest)
I couldn't have
been more wrong.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.464 align:start position:0%
The police are here
for you.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:41.467 align:end position:100%
[sighs]
At last.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.336
- Are you Forrest MacNeil?
- Yes, I am.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.738 align:start position:0%
But, officers, I'm sorry to say
you've got the wrong man.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.673 align:start position:0%
I don't even like avocados.
You see, they upset my stomach.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:49.308
Great. You're under arrest
for arson, attempted murder...

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.344
- What? No, no, no.
- And destruction of property.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.379 align:end position:100%
What are you talking about?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.014 align:end size:59% position:59%
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.649 align:end position:100%
Oh, no, no.
Hey, Dad, call my lawyer, okay?

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.184 align:start position:0%
Forr--
Who's your lawyer?

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.253
- Call a really good lawyer.
- A realty lawyer?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.287
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.622
one will be appointed for you.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.492
Oh, Forrest.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.594
(Forrest)
My lawyer, Daisy,
rushed to the police station.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:09.929 align:start size:69% position:31%
What took you so long?

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.531 size:78% position:39%
I couldn't find my shoes.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.332
Well, this is ridiculous.

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.301 align:end position:100%
I mean, they can't possibly have
any kind of case against me.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:19.105 align:start position:0%
Well, I normally would
tell you not to worry, Forrest,

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.840
but I think you should worry.

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.042 size:88% position:56%
How could it be bad? There's
no way for this to be bad.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:25.211
(Forrest)
To my shock and horror,

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.947
I had been charged with
the incredibly serious crime

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.615
of burning down
a sorority house

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.717
at the University
of Southern California.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.487 align:start position:0%
They found
your fingerprints

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.223 align:start position:0%
all over this container used
to pour gas on the house.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.691 align:start size:81% position:19%
Well, that ought to do it.

00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:42.528 align:end size:72% position:72%
They found eyeglasses
that match your prints

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.130 align:start position:0%
and your prescription.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:45.798
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.600
I appreciate it.
Think about it for a second.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.635
How would I have driven home
from there without my glasses?

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
Well, you might have
a backup pair.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.243
- I do have a backup pair.
- Oh, my God.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:02.248 size:88% position:44%
And finally, a whole series
of hand-signed hate letters.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.184 size:81% position:41%
"Put a jacket on, whores."

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.552 align:start size:63% position:38%
That's my signature.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:08.688 align:start position:0%
"Life--it's literally
all you have.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:10.690 align:start position:0%
"And you're a bunch
of stuck-up sluts.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.258 size:78% position:39%
Signed, Forrest MacNeil."

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.759 align:end position:100%
I guess
they'd get a big kick

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.695 align:start size:66% position:34%
out of seeing my name
signed on there, huh?

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.697
(Forrest)
Apparently, Josh and Tina
had not felt it adequate

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.733 align:end position:100%
to simply point the finger at me
for a minor crime.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.366 align:end position:100%
This was supposed
to be stolen avocados.
