00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.501
Voiceover: What I want
to do in this video is

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:05.242
start to visualize the balance
sheet for a simple bank

00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:07.271
so we can start to understand
the actual mechanics

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:11.346
for how a bank accounts for
its assets and liabilities

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:14.516
in the context of a
fractional reserve system.

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:16.543
First, let's just give a general idea

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:17.795
of what a balance sheet is,

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.137
and I go into a lot more
depth in other playlists,

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:22.145
but when we talk about a balance sheet,

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:23.437
we're really just talking about

00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:25.217
how many assets does something have,

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.905
and how many liabilities offset it,

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.052
and how much is left over
for the owners of the firm

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:31.833
or whatever we're talking about.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.206
For example,

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:35.692
So, for example, if I have, let's say,

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:38.520
let's just say, generalize
it to any type of company.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.689
Let's say that they have,

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.215
so over here, I'll draw their assets,

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.388
so their assets, I'll
do it in this green box.

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:46.791
The height of it is kind of the magnitude

00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:47.947
of their assets.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.230
Let's say there's some company

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.494
that has $100 million in assets,

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:53.984
and assets, you probably understand.

00:00:53.984 --> 00:00:55.963
It's something that gives
you some type of benefit.

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:57.172
The more formal definition

00:00:57.172 --> 00:00:59.024
is something that gives
you some future value,

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.695
and it's generally considered to have

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.216
some positive economic value,

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:04.197
so it could be cash because
cash can be converted

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.691
into other things.

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:06.553
You can go buy a cow,

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:08.122
and that cow can provide milk for you

00:01:08.122 --> 00:01:09.727
and give you future benefit.

00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:11.118
A cow itself would be an asset.

00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:12.218
A building would be an asset,

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:13.871
because it gives you the future value

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:15.786
of giving you shelter,

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:16.880
so assets could be anything,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.666
but here for the sake of this company,

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.507
we could even visualize
it as cash, if you like.

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:23.794
It has $100 million of assets,

00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:25.741
and let's say it has some liabilities,

00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:27.566
so let's say this company right over here

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.854
has 60 million in liabilities.

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:31.939
I'm trying to do it roughly
equal to the height.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.102
It's not exact,

00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:37.553
but let's say that they have
60 million in liabilities.

00:01:37.553 --> 00:01:39.917
Liabilities are just obligations,

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:43.919
so it owes people $60
million worth of stuff,

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.185
and so when you look at it this way,

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:46.720
this entity here,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.966
it could be a company, a firm,

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.651
you could even call this a person,

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.805
if this was a person.

00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:52.804
They have $100 million of assets,

00:01:52.804 --> 00:01:55.265
but they owe 60 million of that 100,

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.538
or you could say they owe 60,

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.377
and you could view it of that 100 million,

00:01:58.377 --> 00:02:00.051
so they would have 40 million left over

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:00.947
for themselves.

00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:03.780
If you were to say, "What
is the value of this?"

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.387
How much do the owners of this entity,

00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:07.985
actually, how much are they
worth from this entity?

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:10.283
It would be the 100 minus the 60.

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:12.406
they have 100, they owe 60,

00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:14.692
so the owner's equity, right over here,

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:17.222
would be $40 million.

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:18.784
That's really kind of the value

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:20.726
of what the owners have,

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:25.280
and it's called owner's equity.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.848
That's just a basic primary

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:28.456
primer in assets and liabilities,

00:02:28.456 --> 00:02:29.346
and now I want to use,

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:30.843
I want to build on that to think about

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:31.787
what's actually happening

00:02:31.787 --> 00:02:33.957
in a fractional reserve
system with the bank,

00:02:33.957 --> 00:02:35.102
and what we're going to see is,

00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:36.526
the way it's actually done mechanically

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:37.924
in a modern fractional reserve system

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.072
is slightly different than

00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:40.493
the way you would conceptualize it,

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.009
the way you,

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.614
actually, I've been
conceptualizing it for you guys,

00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:44.570
because that's just an easier way

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.074
to think about things.

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:48.235
Let's just say we were
going to go start a bank.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:52.126
Let's say I want to start a bank,

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:55.146
and what I do is I go and I take,

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.001
I go buy a, I don't know.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.514
Let's say I go buy a $10
million existing bank.

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:02.462
Here, I have an asset,

00:03:02.462 --> 00:03:05.143
which is my equipment and the building

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.933
and all of the computers
and all of the things,

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.942
all of the things that can
essentially run a bank,

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:13.491
and that's worth $10 million,

00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:15.192
and this is my owner's equity.

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:17.492
So i have $10 million of owner's equity.

00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:19.506
Maybe I'll do it in those
same colors that I did,

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.583
so let me do this in that green color.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:22.758
This is an asset,

00:03:22.758 --> 00:03:24.073
and I have no liabilities yet.

00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:26.016
Let's just say that I
inherited that money,

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:27.828
or that was just money
that I had saved up,

00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:29.934
so I went in and bought
a $10 million asset,

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.196
and so my equity,

00:03:31.196 --> 00:03:33.155
since there's no offsetting liabilities

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.683
is $10 million,

00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:37.663
so this is my owner's
equity right over here,

00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:39.657
is $10 million,

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:42.656
so I'll just call it equity.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.378
Now, let's say that, you know,

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:46.439
you were impressed with my building,

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.883
and my IT systems,

00:03:47.883 --> 00:03:50.765
and the number of ATMs
that I have around town,

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:52.326
so you decide that you want to deposit

00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:54.130
some money with me,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.135
so let's say that you take your,

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.190
you take a wheelbarrow,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.315
and in your wheelbarrow,
you come and you deposit,

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:03.099
let's say you deposit
$100 million in my bank,

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.268
in cash.

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.649
These are cash reserves.

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:07.081
These are federal reserve notes

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:08.511
that you're depositing in my bank,

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:09.827
so I'll draw these as assets.

00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:10.782
So this is ...

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.078
So, let me do $100 million,

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:14.663
so it should be about 10 times as high

00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:15.909
as what I've already drawn,

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.128
so you're going to come here,

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:18.369
and you're going to deposit.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.168
you are going to deposit $100 million.

00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:24.315
So this is $100 million,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.027
100 million of, I'll call it cash,

00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:29.675
of cash.

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:31.193
We'll visualize it as physical cash,

00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:33.683
and it goes into these
vaults that I had purchased,

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:35.532
and so that's the asset that I got,

00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:37.672
but obviously, you're not
just giving me this cash.

00:04:37.672 --> 00:04:39.149
Then I would be $100 million richer.

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:40.050
You're keeping that,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.913
you want that on demand.

00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:42.891
You want that in a checking account

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:44.221
so that you can write checks against it

00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:45.809
and access it from your ATM,

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.805
and so I have an offsetting liability.

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.814
My offsetting liability

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.797
is that this is essentially
a demand deposit for you,

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:55.975
so this is,

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:57.623
I guess the way we can view it is,

00:04:58.222 --> 00:05:00.229
the way we can view it is,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.431
we can write it as a checkable,

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:06.594
checkable deposit,

00:05:06.594 --> 00:05:08.661
and I'm viewing it from
the bank's perspective.

00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:09.990
That's why it's a liability

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.263
because someone can hand me a check,

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.520
and I would have to give them some money.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.926
This is an obligation.

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:17.227
If someone writes a check

00:05:17.227 --> 00:05:19.564
against these deposits to someone else,

00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:21.309
that's an obligation that I, as the bank,

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:22.330
have to service.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.063
I could call this just a checking account,

00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:25.662
or checking accounts of person A.

00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:27.130
Maybe that makes it easier to,

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:30.157
A's checking account
is a liability for me,

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:31.171
so let me call it,

00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:32.523
if I haven't called them person A already,

00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:33.471
I'm calling them now.

00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:35.374
Person A's checking account,

00:05:35.774 --> 00:05:39.023
checking account, and that's a liability

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:40.917
because person A can come at any time

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:46.532
and they can demand $100 million of cash.

00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:48.296
Now, this, right over here,

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.793
I haven't done anything fractional yet.

00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:52.068
This is just regular, so far,

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:53.885
this would be equivalent
to full reserve banking.

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:56.804
I'm just keeping person A's money safe.

00:05:56.804 --> 00:05:59.092
We know in a fractional reserve system,

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.991
I can lend out a good bit of money,

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:03.734
so that's, essentially,
what I could then do,

00:06:03.734 --> 00:06:05.840
if we're talking about fractional reserve.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.780
I can lend out 90% of this money.

00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:10.640
I could lend out 90% of this,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.076
so let me take out 90%,

00:06:12.076 --> 00:06:14.754
so let me clear this right over here.

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:17.057
Let me clear that,

00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:18.936
and so let's say I took out 90% out of it,

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:20.119
and lent it out,

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:21.665
and so we only have 10 million

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:23.800
of the original cash there as reserves,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.795
and I'll call them reserves now.

00:06:24.795 --> 00:06:26.800
But that's 10 million of the original,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.401
so I'm going to have 10
million of reserves left,

00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:33.271
and everything else I lent out,

00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:35.895
so everything else I lent out,

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.882
so 90 million, I lent,

00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:41.792
90 million of lending,

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.480
so we can even visualize
it as big stacks of cash

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.046
that I handed out to people,

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:46.717
and then you might say,

00:06:46.717 --> 00:06:48.996
"Well, I didn't just give
that to those people."

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:51.800
In exchange for that, they are saying

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.569
I'm going to pay me back.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:53.708
So that's an asset.

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:55.822
If you borrow money from me,

00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:57.401
it's an obligation for you.

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:58.407
It's a liability for you,

00:06:58.407 --> 00:06:59.796
but it's an asset for me.

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:00.896
Let me make this clear.

00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:02.374
So, if I'm a bank,

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:04.257
if I'm a bank,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.291
and there's a borrower,

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.958
there is a borrower,

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.498
there is a borrower,

00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:11.849
and if I give the borrower,

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.481
if I give the borrower $1,

00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.270
if I give them $1,

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.290
you could visualize it,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.668
although that's not exactly how it works,

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:20.212
is that they give an IOU.

00:07:20.212 --> 00:07:22.202
They give the bank an IOU.

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:25.136
I owe you $1 at some future date.

00:07:25.136 --> 00:07:26.932
Now, from the bank's point of view,

00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:28.805
this IOU is an asset.

00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:30.309
They're essentially exchanging assets.

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:31.889
The bank is giving it a $1,

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:33.976
the borrower is giving an IOU.

00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:35.254
From the borrower's point of view,

00:07:35.254 --> 00:07:36.889
the dollar is an asset,

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.620
and this IOU is a liability.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.882
But from the bank's point of view,

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:41.599
it's like, "Oh, I have this IOU.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.065
"Maybe I could give this to someone else.

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:44.245
"Maybe I could sell this IOU.

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:46.107
"This IOU is going to
give me future benefit."

00:07:46.107 --> 00:07:47.615
Because assuming this person's good

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:48.362
for their money,

00:07:48.362 --> 00:07:50.522
they're going to give that money back.

00:07:50.522 --> 00:07:51.586
That's the same reason why a check

00:07:51.586 --> 00:07:53.571
is a liability of the bank.

00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:54.890
If you write a check to someone,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.188
the bank has a responsibility to,

00:07:57.188 --> 00:07:58.920
if someone were to give
that check to the bank,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.779
to give them cash.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:01.776
So, in a similar way,

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:03.558
when the bank lends out all of this money,

00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:04.801
they're going to get IOUs

00:08:04.801 --> 00:08:06.274
from all the people that they lent it to,

00:08:06.274 --> 00:08:07.978
so they're going to have,

00:08:07.978 --> 00:08:11.420
they're going to get 90 million of IOUs.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.921
We could say 90 million worth of loans,

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:15.305
but you really could just view those

00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:16.864
as these are IOUs to other people.

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.898
This is an asset because
it's going to give

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.973
some future benefit at some future time.

00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:22.787
I'm going to leave you there,

00:08:22.787 --> 00:08:24.225
because what I did here,

00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:25.469
this is conceptually identical

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:26.808
to everything we've been talking about.

00:08:26.808 --> 00:08:28.799
This is, frankly, how
most people visualize

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:30.204
fractural reserve lending.

00:08:30.204 --> 00:08:33.229
You get 100 million reserves,

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:35.823
you lend out 90 million of that reserves,

00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:37.149
and you exchange that for an asset,

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:38.825
which is essentially an IOU.

00:08:38.825 --> 00:08:39.814
What we'll see in the next video

00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:41.329
is this isn't exactly true.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:42.465
What a bank could actually do

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:43.386
is it could actually create.

00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:45.778
It could actually take just
the 10 million of reserves

00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:47.866
and then it could create these assets,

00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:49.562
which are functionally equivalent.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.508
It looks a little bit shady

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:52.175
the first time you think about it,

00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:53.990
but they're actually
functionally equivalent,

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.466
so it's not as shady

00:08:55.466 --> 00:08:57.869
as you might initially think it to be,

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.125
and we'll cover that in the next video.
