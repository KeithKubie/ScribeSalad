00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.430
Formulas can be as simple as like ticket

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.840
price times quantity equals total cost. But they can

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.840
also be powerful and really dynamic. While a traditional

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.690
formula usually consists of solely numbers and mathematical symbols,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.400
formula fields can manipulate a bunch of different data

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.020
types, like dates, for example. Your festival object has

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.630
a start data and an end date. What do

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.200
you think will be the significance of the formula,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.690
end date minus start date plus one?
