00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.730
And the answer is no, the load doesn't act as

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.470
the cache or the memory. We know that this is

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.860
the same address, so the load will get it's value

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.970
from the store. So the correct answer here is no.
