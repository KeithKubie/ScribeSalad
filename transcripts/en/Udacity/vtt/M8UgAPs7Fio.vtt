00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
We know that this other city is directly east of Grant's hometown. So, we're not

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:08.385
moving in the up and down or north and south direction at all when we go from

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:12.190
here to here. We're only moving horizontally, which only changes the

00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:16.695
x-coordinate. We're moving over 200 miles so the x-coordinate becomes 200. Since

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:20.730
you've moved 200 miles over from zero in the positive direction, and the y

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:24.720
coordinate doesn't change at all. It stays as zero. We know that Udacity is

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:28.626
directly north of this other city. So, if we move from the other city up to

00:00:28.638 --> 00:00:32.836
Udacity, all that we're changing is the y-coordinate, since we're only moving

00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:37.021
vertically. That means that the horizontal coordinate stays the same, but it

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.749
needs to be the coordinate of this other city. So, Udacity is located at 200,

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:47.945
and it's y-coordinate will be 0 plus 700, or 700.
