00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:08.746
&gt;&gt;Probably the most important
thing for kids growing

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:11.916
up today is the love
of embracing change.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.846
&gt;&gt;I mean, the catch
for preparing students

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:33.016
for the 21st century workforce
is "How do you get kids

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.466
that have curiosity and
a questing disposition?"

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:40.696
We have called it in the past
"the gaming disposition."

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:45.326
If you look at the disposition
of hardcore gamers such as World

00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:48.766
of Warcraft, massive multi-player
games, the surprising thing

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:53.226
that you find, contrary to what
people think, is these kids,

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:56.586
first of all, are incredibly
bottom-line-oriented.

00:00:57.436 --> 00:01:02.056
They want to be measured,
because they want

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.026
to see how much they're improving.

00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:10.296
And in fact the most common
mantra of a real gamer is

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:13.376
"If I ain't learning, it ain't fun."

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:17.686
And how do they constantly
keep learning is

00:01:17.686 --> 00:01:21.796
because basically they are
embracing change, leveling-up,

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:25.876
doing higher-order tasks, or
the game itself is changing,

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:30.076
or they change the game in terms
of the strategies they want

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:31.696
to experiment with and
so on and so forth.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.126
And in fact if you think of this
questing disposition you end

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.476
up embracing change,
not running from change.

00:01:39.546 --> 00:01:46.316
&gt;&gt;Coming from that gaming
disposition I became very intrigued

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:48.586
when I landed here in Maui.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:50.876
It turns out that my neighbor turns

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:58.336
out to be a 20-year-old
kid moderately world-famous

00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:00.376
in the surfing world
named Dusty Payne.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:04.236
And what got interesting to us is

00:02:04.236 --> 00:02:10.976
that Maui has never produced
a world-class champion before.

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:13.946
They basically come from Oahu,

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:15.886
from the North Shore
and so on and so forth.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:23.196
But all of a sudden four kids make
it big, big time here in Maui.

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:24.596
You say "What happened?"

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:28.836
&gt;&gt;And it turns out that if you kind

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:33.556
of meet these kids they have all
come together very much like a guild

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:38.376
in World of Warcraft, and what they
do is they compete with each other

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:42.926
and they collaborate with each
other incredibly intensely.

00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:46.596
They think up a new move, they dash
down the hill, they try it out,

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:48.386
they take their video
cameras with them.

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.446
They're videoing each other.

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:52.106
They dash back up here.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.496
They start kind of analyzing
what worked, what didn't work,

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:58.476
build new ideas, dash down
the hill again, try it out.

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:04.086
And then what they start doing is
they start looking at, of course,

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:06.386
all the other people
surfing around the world,

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:07.776
which they get from YouTube.

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:08.686
They have all this kind of stuff.

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:10.646
They start picking up
new moves like that.

00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:12.346
That's a kind of interesting way

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:18.576
that digital media has enhanced the
ability of these surfing kids to pick

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:19.966
up all kinds of new tricks.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:23.106
And I can actually show you
how a particular move now

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:26.146
on a surfboard takes about
48 hours to propagate

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.736
around the world before
all the key surfers

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:33.096
of the top edge are trying
it out themselves, okay?

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:38.496
And of course any time something
changes they're the first to try it

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:41.736
out and to appropriate
it, so these kids live

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.996
for picking up something new.

00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:45.556
They live for trying
out something new.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:48.346
And some of this stuff, by the
way, is moderately dangerous.

00:03:49.486 --> 00:03:53.506
So these are high-cost mistakes,
but the passion that they have

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:56.346
to do this is really awesome.

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:58.016
Well, guess what.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:02.416
The passion that I see
in the World of Warcraft

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.916
of the high-end high
performers is also awesome,

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:07.546
but it doesn't stop there.

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:10.796
If you look at the artists,
if you look at the musicians,

00:04:10.976 --> 00:04:14.056
if you look at the dancers, if
you look at athletics in general

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:17.436
and to the extreme edge what you
have is kids that are turned on.

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.366
And when they get really turned

00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:22.586
on in the right context
there's almost no stopping.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:36.806
&gt;&gt;Any interest that any kid has,
I am sure there's already existing

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:42.856
out there a passionate community
of interest group or a community

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:47.276
of practice that you can try to join.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.566
And in fact going back to Jean Lave's
classic work in situated learning,

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:55.896
maybe the learning has to do
with learning how to join,

00:04:55.946 --> 00:05:02.006
or you learn to join, and once
you join now you marinate in that,

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:05.016
and learning isn't
something you do consciously.

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:06.456
It is something you absorb.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:10.816
And so there's something that most
serious learning often happens

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:17.346
through an osmosis process
that once I dwell in the set

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:20.196
of the experiences things
are getting integrated

00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:22.536
in my head not necessarily
consciously,

00:05:22.536 --> 00:05:27.966
because there's a tremendous amount
of tacit knowledge that I'm kind

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:31.336
of being exposed to in
these kind of communities.

00:05:31.696 --> 00:05:36.396
And I just start to integrate,
assimilate, let things gel,

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.156
and it's not particularly conscious.

00:05:39.646 --> 00:05:45.296
&gt;&gt;What makes these ideas so
relevant now is in a world

00:05:45.296 --> 00:05:50.456
of rapid change any particular
skill that I've learned is apt

00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:53.776
to have a moderately
short shelf-life.

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:58.976
So what I really need to do is to
know how to create context for myself

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:03.816
that I keep scaffolding and
learning and accelerating what I know

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:06.516
to increase my own performance.

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:11.456
And so there's a sense of what
I'm doing becomes a platform

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:14.346
for doing something new,
learning something new

00:06:14.556 --> 00:06:18.096
and becoming even better and
actually moving potentially

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:20.726
into quite a different type of field.

00:06:21.076 --> 00:06:24.376
So it's kind of like suddenly
now I'm looking at trajectories

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:27.826
through life space as
opposed to fixed points.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:33.626
&gt;&gt;I think the construct that
has been most overlooked now

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:36.356
on the 21st century and
maybe in the 20th century

00:06:36.356 --> 00:06:40.046
as well is the power
and importance of play.

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:44.416
That is to say, how do I take an idea
and how do I kind of play with it,

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:47.526
how do I tinker with it, how
do I come to make it personal,

00:06:47.696 --> 00:06:51.986
how do I come to own it, how
do I dwell in the idea itself?

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:54.846
And this plays out,
for example, in poetry.

00:06:55.146 --> 00:06:59.366
How do I find that magic combination
of now that phrase or that line

00:06:59.366 --> 00:07:02.686
in a poem says exactly
what I mean deep inside me?

00:07:03.116 --> 00:07:06.636
Likewise, how do I work with
engineering systems and kind

00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.546
of see how things couple together?

00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:14.036
How do I tinker with these devices,
things as simple as radios and stuff

00:07:14.036 --> 00:07:17.596
like that or microphones
on cameras to kind

00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:22.016
of really understand what's the
way that these systems really work?

00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:26.386
And how do I kind of learn that by
experimenting with the stuff myself?

00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:29.966
Because you've got to learn
that not everything works.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.226
In fact most things don't work.

00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:33.376
And if the first thing that happens

00:07:33.376 --> 00:07:37.476
when something doesn't work is it
frightens you, then you're not going

00:07:37.476 --> 00:07:40.276
to be very willing to embrace change.

00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:43.886
But if you realize that when things
don't work, which is almost always,

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.646
you can get in there and figure
out how to tinker with these things

00:07:47.146 --> 00:07:48.996
and just absorb what happens,

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:52.676
very often when you're tinkering
it doesn't make pure logic sense.

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:56.496
It's something you begin to feel
in your hands as much as your mind.

00:07:56.906 --> 00:08:00.096
Tinkering brings thought
and action together

00:08:00.186 --> 00:08:02.636
in some very powerful, magical ways.
