00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.669
A newly discovered broken tetrapod bone means
we’ve been on land longer than scientists

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:04.669
thought!

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:08.210
Don’t you just love it when nature throws
science a bone?

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.320
Hey guys, Amy making bad jokes for you on
DNews today.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.240
But jokes aside, bones are pretty useful,
not just for giving us the internal stability

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.470
to not be goopy piles of flesh and organs
but because when they persist over the ages

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.770
they give us vital clues as to the history
of various species.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.640
It’s from fossilized dinosaur bones that
we’ve been able to reconstruct what the

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.650
Earth might have looked like long before humans
roamed, and going back further it’s from

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.800
bones and fossils that we can trace how species
evolved.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.579
The fossil record tells us that life started
in primitive oceans before the first species

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.400
poked their heads out of the water and crawled
onto land.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.129
These are so-called transitional species,
and scientists have been able to determine

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.940
that they first appeared when limbs evolved
from fish fins about 360 million years ago

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.850
followed by the first land-based tetrapods
that showed up around 330 million years ago.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.460
But there’s a pretty big gap in there scientists
needed to fill .

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.140
To figure out what happened during this 30
million year gap, researchers from the Queensland

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
Museum in Hendra, Australia, analysed a rare
tetrapod fossil from that time period, a nearly

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.520
five-foot long Ossinodus that lived about
333 million years ago.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.229
They found from preserved forearm bones that
the species could support itself on land.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.200
Whether or not it did was a different story,
and that evidence came from what might be

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.220
the oldest known broken bone.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.640
In studying the broken bone, the team used
computer software to reconstruct the forces

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.350
required to cause the break.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.460
Turns out, it’s a lot of force, much larger
than the animal itself.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.189
Because water acts as a cushion, there’s
no way such a bad break could happen under

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.189
water.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.729
The transitional animal that left that broken
bone behind must have been on land.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
far too much to have break one of the break,
they found the magnitude of the force was

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.729
so large relative to the size of the animal
that the accident must have occurred on land.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.240
From reconstructing the break, the team concluded
that the animal likely fell from a rock or

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.250
log about three feet off the ground.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.229
Of course, they can’t be sure, but it’s
pretty probable given the bone-based evidence.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.010
So if the Ossinodus broke a bone on land,
it must have spent at least some time out

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.200
of the water, and that makes it the oldest
known tetrapod to be fairly well adapted to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.120
life on the land, getting us one step closer
to nailing down the moment when animals first

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.350
left the water.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.979
Scientists are always learning more about
how we evolved to be the complex creatures

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.979
we are today.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.300
But is it possible for evolution to reverse
itself?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:29.060
Julia discusses that idea in 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:41.170
