00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.870
skilled biologists and bio technicians
all over the world the opportunity for

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880
all over the world the opportunity for
 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.630
all over the world the opportunity for
the smallpox to get into the hands of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
the smallpox to get into the hands of
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.090

group I think are great and growing and
 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.940
group I think are great and growing and
just you know proliferation of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
just you know proliferation of
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.650
just you know proliferation of
antibiotics which speed the evolution of

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660
antibiotics which speed the evolution of
 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.900
antibiotics which speed the evolution of
bacteria and viruses right they responds

bacteria and viruses right they responds
 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.300
bacteria and viruses right they responds
up to the challenge so you get an

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310
up to the challenge so you get an
 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.960
up to the challenge so you get an
emergence of more dangerous bacteria be

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970
emergence of more dangerous bacteria be
 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.600

naturally selected to be immune to the
 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.330
naturally selected to be immune to the
antibiotic so all sorts of dangers lurk

many people are working to try to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
many people are working to try to
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.390
many people are working to try to
contain them but but if you think of the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
contain them but but if you think of the
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.300
contain them but but if you think of the
spread of Baia biological knowledge and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310
 
 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.789
 
no one is trying to control that so you

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799
no one is trying to control that so you
 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.289
no one is trying to control that so you
know we have we do have theirs there is

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
know we have we do have theirs there is
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.020
know we have we do have theirs there is

you know that's a very that's real catch

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989
you know that's a very that's real catch
 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.050
you know that's a very that's real catch

bio weapon you have to develop the bio

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130
bio weapon you have to develop the bio
 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.030
bio weapon you have to develop the bio
weapon as you make vaccines well so then

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040
weapon as you make vaccines well so then
 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.200

you're training all sorts of you know

you're training all sorts of you know
 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.150
you're training all sorts of you know
scientists and how to make a bio weapon

some of them may turn out to be you know

easier to create than nuclear which they

easier to create than nuclear which they
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.530
easier to create than nuclear which they
know nuclear secrets anymore but there's

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540
know nuclear secrets anymore but there's
 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.900

no trick to designing the atomic bomb

no trick to designing the atomic bomb
 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.710
no trick to designing the atomic bomb
but the actual the the bottleneck is the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
but the actual the the bottleneck is the
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.870
but the actual the the bottleneck is the
enriched uranium or plutonium and that's

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880
enriched uranium or plutonium and that's
 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.900
enriched uranium or plutonium and that's
still difficult to come by but but you

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910
still difficult to come by but but you
 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.190
still difficult to come by but but you
don't have that kind of bottleneck in

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200
don't have that kind of bottleneck in
 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.200
don't have that kind of bottleneck in
biological
