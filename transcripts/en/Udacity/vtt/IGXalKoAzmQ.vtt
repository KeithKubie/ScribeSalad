00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So here I've written the utility function.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I called this utility function "The Winning Differential."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And given a state,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it tells me what that differential is--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
expected differential for that state.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And what it says is if we're at the end of the game,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if somebody's won,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
then before, remember that our utility function was 0 or 1,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but here utility function is my score--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is me, and I'm going to reap the pending--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
minus your score.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Otherwise, we just do the same thing with a Q function

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we did before.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And note that we're always careful to memoize these functions,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because they're recursive, they're recalling themselves over and over again.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We don't want to repeat those computations,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so we memoize them so we only have to each date computation once.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, what I want you to do is write the strategy function.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This was the utility function over states, now I want you to write the strategy function.

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You can do it in terms of what we've defined before
