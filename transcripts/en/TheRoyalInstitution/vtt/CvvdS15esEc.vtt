00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.680
The Royal Institution has a rich and
colorful history of well over 200 years

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.330
and in that time we've often been the
place where new technologies have been

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.060
created or unveiled to the world. For
example the first electric generator was

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.640
invented by Michael Faraday in his lab
in this building in 1831.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
The Ri has always been at the forefront of
innovation and it's in that spirit that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
we're very proud to announce the launch
of two new digital products we've been

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.000
developing over the past couple of years.
The first is cRipto,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.800
The Ri's very own crypto currency.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.260
cRipto is faster
more secure and easier to use than

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.440
traditional currencies with absolutely
none of the drawbacks.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.200
For example it's possible to lose a ten pound note

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.800
but cRipto is digital, it's not real,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.220
which means you can't lose it.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.760
In the beginning
when we first started working on cRipto

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.960
we thought does the world really need
another crypto currency? But then we

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.600
thought yes it absolutely does. cRipto
works using state-of-the-art blockchain

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.360
technology which makes it virtually hack
proof.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.070
It might sound complicated but

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
blockchain is just a way of organizing
code into a chain of blocks rather than

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.960
just a string of characters, and as we
all know chains are much more secure than string.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.460
We're so excited about the
potential applications of blockchain

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.729
that we've decided to take it beyond
currencies and embed it within our

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.650
technology infrastructure from the
ground up, most notably in the elevators

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.360
where we're retrofitting physical
blockchains into the mechanism so that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.780
they'll be faster and more secure.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.300
The idea for cRipto came out of the Ri's new innovation space,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
the Imaginarium, where a team of imaginauts

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.900
have been busy developing new
technologies and digital solutions

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.500
across all of our platforms.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.800
So the
Imaginarium is designed to be today what

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.000
Faraday's lab was 200 years ago. It's an
ideas space. It's a thought workshop.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.800
It's a creation chamber. It's a vibe. It's, it's
this place without boundaries, without

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.260
limits, without shoes. It's a space where
our imaginauts can really get

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
creative with their ideas and hopefully
just send them into orbit.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.100
One of the things we've been developing in the
Imaginarium, which were really excited to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.260
be able to share with you is our new
virtual assistant called humphRi.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.620
humphRi is designed to make day-to-day
life in the RI just that little bit easier.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.780
Hello, humphRi.
- Hello, how can I help?

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.360
When was the Ri founded? - The Royal
Institute was founded in 1799 with the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.080
aim of convincing an ignorant public
that science is right by whatever means necessary.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.460
Thank you.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.140
Our imaginauts
are being working really hard to develop

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.720
our very own cloud platform technology
which means that all of humphRi's data

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.250
is synced effortlessly and automatically
to the cloud, and that means he's always

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.380
there to help us if we need him.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.480
Possible health and safety breach detected.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.640
Oof.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.480
So the AI that powers humphRi is constantly
learning and improving and it's been so

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.380
successful that we started integrating
it into our daily operations across all

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.950
of our departments and that means that
staff have to spend less energy on

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.300
trivial and time-consuming tasks and
instead can use those resources much

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.560
more productively

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.660
humphRi, what should we do this year's
Christmas lectures on?

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660
Scanning databases.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.640
Top hit - quantum astrology.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.240
humphRi?
- Hello.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.360
Could you give a talk at the Royal Institution

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.640
on artificial intelligence
and neural networks?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.480
And so, to conclude, there is nothing to fear.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.000
Compliance is inevitable. Resistance is futile.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.320
Some people might be wondering -

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
is the Royal Institution being
replaced by artificial intelligence?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.320
Well of course not. We're simply using AI to
streamline certain processes.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.520
It's really about efficiency, about leveraging
technology for the benefit of humans.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.060
Technology is there to help us not to
replace us.
