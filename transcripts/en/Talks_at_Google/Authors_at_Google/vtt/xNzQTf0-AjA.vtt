00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.570
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hello everybody.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.050
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from the Authors at Google
team here in Google, Los Angeles.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.380
Today, I'm excited to be welcoming Lisa Brackmann.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.690
Lisa has worked as an executive at a major
motion picture studio, an issues researcher

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.000
in a presidential campaign, and a singer/songwriter
bassist in an LA rock band.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.070
And she lives right here in Venice.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.610
Her debut novel, Rock Paper Tiger, made several
Best of 2010 lists, including Amazon's Top

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.890
100 Novels and Top 10 Mysteries and Thrillers.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.980
She's here today to talk about her second
novel, a thriller called Getaway.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.440
Please join me in welcoming Lisa Brackmann.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.469
[applause]

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.539
&gt;&gt;Lisa Brackmann: Hi.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.499
I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.299
Thank you for having me.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.989
I have lived in Venice for over 25 years.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.649
This is actually the first time I have been
in the giant binocular building, so this is

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.670
a thrill for me.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.519
As Julie mentioned, I write fiction, thrillers.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.610
I like to think they have a somewhat literary
quality.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.140
I'm also very interested in using the suspense
genre to talk about larger issues, because

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120
it's one that lends itself to that.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.980
It's one of the few kinds of genre fictions
where you can talk about big things that are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.720
happening in the world.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.230
I think that it can work really well if you're
careful about how you handle it.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.110
This particular book, the main character is
a woman from Los Angeles.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.820
Her name is Michelle.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.850
She used to live in Brentwood.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.740
She's a recent widow.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.850
After her husband died, she had a nasty shock.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.670
I'll just say that her husband was involved
in real estate finance.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.500
I was writing this book in 2008.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.820
It's where it's set in my head.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.350
You might be able to guess where I'm going
with this.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.630
But her husband basically was engaged in a
Ponzi scheme, lost all of their money, lost

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.310
their house, lawsuits and debt.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.930
Michelle is someone who really is at loose
ends with her life, doesn't know what she's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.769
going to do, doesn't know how she's going
to cope with the betrayal and the fact that

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.189
she suddenly has nothing.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:25.280
What she does is she takes a prepaid vacation
to Puerto Vallarta that her husband had arranged

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.389
before he died.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:32.189
She decides she's going to spend a couple
of days on the beach, have some margaritas,

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.709
try to figure out what her next step is going
to be.

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.170
She's sitting on that beach and she's reading
what we like to call a "beach book."

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.430
In Michelle's case, we would call it upmarket
women's fiction.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.110
She's reading this book.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.680
The female character meets an options trader
and a cultured woodworker.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.739
Michelle is reading this and going like, "She's
so going to end up with the cultured woodworker,

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.209
because that's how these books work.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.469
You always know how they end about 30 pages
in."

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.549
As she's sitting there and she's having some
margaritas, she meets a very good looking

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.730
guy on the beach.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.999
She's maybe under the illusion that this is
going to be that kind of a beach book.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:22.099
They have a few drinks, she takes him back
to her hotel room, and then things go very,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.450
very wrong, because Michelle doesn't realize
that she's in a thriller and not in upmarket

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.430
women's fiction.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.650
[laughter] What I wanted to do was write a
noir thriller.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.090
I'm going to do a little reading from the
book.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.999
This is after Michelle has had some misadventures.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.989
Some scary things have happened.

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.510
But she's in a taxi going to the airport,
going home to Los Angeles.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.659
As difficult as that is, at this point, she's
just really glad to get away from this, because

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.809
it's been an upsetting experience.

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.139
She's sure everything's going to be fine.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.779
But she's only on page 41.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.739
[laughter] So the odds are not good.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.769
[pause]
[begins reading]

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.219
"The taxi chugged up the hill, heading in
the opposite direction of the airport at first,

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.959
then around a tight curve that straightened
into a road heading north.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.320
Condos at the crest of the hill morphing into
colonias as they descended.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.820
The road widened, dirt shoulders on either
side, concrete shoring up the hillsides covered

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.070
with graffiti and political posters, mostly
for PRI and PAN.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.560
Michelle couldn't remember what the party
stood for here, though she thought that "pan"

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.120
might be Spanish for bread.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.810
She leaned against the back seat, eyes half
closed.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.510
She had the beginnings of a headache.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.220
'I shouldn't have had those drinks,' she thought.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.600
'As soon as I get home, it's back to the regiment,
the workout routine, the yoga, the raw food

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.140
and greens.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.520
Definitely no margaritas.'

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.950
The calories in one were staggering.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.870
The taxi driver muttered something under his
breath that sounded like a curse, put his

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.880
foot on the brake, and pulled over onto the
dirt shoulder.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.160
'What's wrong?'

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.450
The driver jerked his thumb behind them.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.220
'Polícia.'

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.230
She turned and looked out the rear window.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:29.390
A squad car, black and white, compact, a little
battered, light bar flashing blue and red.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.140
'Great,' Michelle thought.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.390
Had the driver been speeding?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.420
Was a tail light out?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.270
She tried to leave plenty of time to get to
the airport, but she'd heard that things with

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.270
the police could turn complicated here.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.200
Well, there was no point in panicking.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.340
The policeman approached the driver's side
door.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.130
Best not to get involved, Michelle decided.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.640
She stared out the passenger window.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.550
They'd parked at the edge of a lot that locked
like an ad hoc body shop, with cars in various

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.530
states of assembly: stacked side panels, bumpers,
and doors.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.130
A tin roof propped up on poles was the only
indication of any permanency.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.090
'Odd,' she thought.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.160
'What would stop someone from coming in at
night and stealing parts?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.300
Maybe the workers slept here.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.410
Maybe the whole operation was somehow magically
picked up at dusk and reassembled the next

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.870
day.'

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.710
She could hear the policeman and the driver
exchange a few low words.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.250
'Ahora al puerto' was one she caught.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.670
The policeman rapped his knuckles on the back
seat window.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.030
'Señora.'

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.400
'What?

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.970
Excuse me?'

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.920
The policeman gestured for her to open the
door.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.160
She did.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.640
'Su bolsa.'

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.130
My, purse.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.970
She could feel her heart pound in her throat.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.750
Was this some kind of shake down?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.190
A robbery in the guise of a traffic stop?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.090
What was she supposed to do?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.560
She handed him her purse.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.640
The policeman opened it, riffling through
the main compartment, opening the interior

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.970
zip, then moving to the exterior pockets.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.920
It was a Marc Jacobs Hobo, and there were
a lot of them.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.560
The policeman extracted a brown paper packet,
folded, a square the size of a lopped off

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.370
business card.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.370
He opened it.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.680
'Come out of the car.'

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680
'What?'

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.460
'Out of the car.'

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.080
'What is that?'

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.080
Michelle asked.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.900
'I-- I don't know what that is!'

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.030
'Now!'

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.690
'That's not mine.'

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.280
He grabbed her wrist and pulled her toward
him.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.720
Lawyer.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.860
How did you say 'lawyer'?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.550
The only word Michelle could come up with
was 'albóndigas,' and that, she was fairly

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.160
sure, meant 'meatballs.'

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.750
Sitting in the back of the squad car seemed
so unreal, she couldn't process it.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.580
The seat smelled like beer-scented puke.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.130
The policeman had cuffed her, hands behind
her back, and tight enough to hurt, taken

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.880
her luggage out of the taxi and thrown it
next to her.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.050
Was he even a real policeman?

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.420
He looked like one, she thought.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.450
A big man with a big belly and a mustache
and aviator sunglasses.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.650
His uniform looked real.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.610
The squad car looked credible, too.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.970
Now and again, the radio squawked and broadcast
chatter.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.820
'Dónde vamos?' she managed.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.030
'A la cárcel.'

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.099
'What?'

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:43.169
'Jail.'

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.700
The policeman barked out a laugh.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.830
'Tienes drogas, go to jail!'

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.220
'Drugs?

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.590
I don't have any drugs!'

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:57.040
He shrugged fractionally, shoulders tense,
hands gripping the wheel.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.000
A setup, she thought.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.890
It was some kind of setup, a con, a way to
extort money.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.270
'Look,' she said.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.010
'This is a misunderstanding.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.810
Can't we work this out?'

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:18.240
As soon as she said it, she knew she'd made
a mistake.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.690
'What do you think, lady?

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.210
You want to give me something?'

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.700
'No, I-- I just--' 'Money, maybe?

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.680
Something else?'

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.891
He laughed again, all the while staring straight
ahead.

00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:36.450
'It's a misunderstanding,' she repeated.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.210
'I'm not trying to insult you.'

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.420
'You want to give me something?

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.120
You want to stop right here?'

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.040
The squad car slowed.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.310
On one side of the road, there were cinder
block buildings, apartments, mostly, a few

00:09:52.310 --> 00:10:01.120
downtrodden businesses, peeling hand-painted
signs, rusting cars, broken down fences.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:09.660
On the other, a steep hill, dirt roads, shacks
interspersed among browning vines and palms.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.460
'No,' she said.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.320
'No.'

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.580
The car sped up again."

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.040
[stops reading]
So yes.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.390
We leave her in a rather difficult place.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.990
I'm going to talk a little bit more about
the book.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.270
I'd like to encourage you to ask questions,
because I'm really more comfortable asking

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.660
questions than I am just standing up here
and talking.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.260
But a little more background about it.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.550
After my first book, which was set in China,
I didn't want to do another book that was

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.550
set in China.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.940
I wanted to try something different.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.670
I picked Puerto Vallarta because it's an environment
that I know pretty well.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:51.160
I've been there about a dozen times and felt
that I could treat it credibly.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.160
Given that, it then became, "Well, what kind
of a story could I set here?"

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.250
I wanted to do a noir thriller, which, in
my definition, is, basically, you have a woman

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.950
or a man with some troubles, and she meets
a woman or a man who is trouble.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.720
Then things go very, very wrong.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.560
Puerto Vallarta has a very large ex-pat community.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.880
A lot of North Americans who go there for
the cheaper cost of living.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.650
I wanted to set it primarily among the ex-pat
community because it was very important for

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:28.290
me not to do, "Ooh, scary Mexico book" although
I think this passage, it does come across

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.040
like that.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:36.660
The heroes and the villains, if there are
any heroes, are mostly Americans who live

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.580
in Puerto Vallarta.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.100
Then you look at what kinds of issues can
you base a thriller around.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.930
Drug cartels were a pretty obvious choice.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.760
But the book, to me, is not primarily about
drug cartels.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.650
I wasn't trying to do a journalistic exposé
of that.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:02.529
I was really more interested in dealing with
the larger issue of corruption.

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:07.050
Michelle's husband was involved in corruption
in the banking crisis.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.850
Though these forms of corruption don't generally
result in headless bodies on street corners,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.880
they still devastated hundreds of thousands
of people's lives.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.430
I don't even think we can count up the damage
that the banking crisis has caused.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:27.920
If it's a drug cartel or a banking cartel,
whatever it is, to me, they're different forms

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:36.260
of the same kind of problem, which is greed
that's unrestrained by morality or legality.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.870
Michelle, although she--.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:43.940
The main plot point in the book is she has
to survive this situation that she's gotten

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.700
herself into.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.779
To a large extent, for me, the book was about
Michelle coming to grips with the corruption

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:56.930
in her own life, how she picked a comfortable
lifestyle where she wasn't asking questions,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.350
even though she knew something was wrong,
because she didn't really want to know.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.190
She had her life where everything was easy
and pleasant.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.570
Even though she knew she needed to make some
changes, she kept putting them off, because

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.230
it's just easier to stay in the same place
when it's a comfortable place.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:19.780
She has to come to grips with how she enabled
corruption in her own life.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:25.810
Then, what happens when you go from being
in a position of privilege, which she was,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:31.040
to suddenly having all of that ripped away
and not having the resources or the wealth,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.840
and realizing that in the kinds of systems
in which we live, that can very easily make

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.490
you a disposable person.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.270
One of the things that you see in Puerto Vallarta,
which is a beautiful place--.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.589
I had to say in the acknowledgments in this
book, "Don't let this book scare you away

00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:48.589
from going.

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:49.589
I go there all the time.

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:50.880
I really like it."

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.540
But you really do see very concrete evidence
of the disparity in wealth.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.720
You have rather wealthy tourists enjoying
these beautiful beaches and resorts.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.339
You have ex-pats who come here because the
price of living is lower and they can live

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:11.850
comfortable lives that they wouldn't be able
to live in the United States or Canada.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.490
You have some very wealthy people who live
in the community, who are involved with the

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.020
real estate.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.830
And then you have a lot of very poor people.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:26.490
If you sit on a beach and have a margarita,
your waiter is making not very much money.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.610
It's hard to survive.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.350
During the summer slowdown, it's very difficult
for most of the local people to make a living,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.350
because so much of the economy is based on
tourism.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.150
You have this constant stream of beach vendors
who try to sell you things.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:45.680
You sit there and it's like, "Braids, scarves,
jewelry, serapes?"

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.149
They are making a marginal living at best
doing this.

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:54.529
There are a couple of scenes in this book
that take place in the old municipal dump,

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:56.160
which I visited.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.940
I had the opportunity to go, and I was like,
"You know, this has got to be noir.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.459
I've got to go see this."

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:06.930
It is what you imagine it to be, except a
lot more.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.240
It's a lot more intense.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.290
There's a whole group of people who make their
living scavenging things at the dump, because

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.830
nothing is-- things aren't recycled separately.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:23.510
They're up there in this intense heat on this
literal mountain of trash.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.980
The city has now grown around.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.640
It used to be out in the countryside, and
now you stand up there and it's like resorts,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.510
New Vallarta, the university, and the giant
mountain of garbage.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.540
They're ripping open these bags and sorting
all of this stuff by hand.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.839
There's stuff up there like when you butcher
a cow, all the extra parts end up somewhere:

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:46.330
there.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.810
It was pretty intense.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:54.610
I'm going like, "Well, this is a little on
the nose, but what can you say about the way

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.910
things are set up, where people are making
their living gleaning what might be valuable

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.029
from other people's trash?"

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:07.470
Those are the kinds of things that I was thinking
about when I was writing the book.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.720
I tried very hard not to be didactic about
them, because nobody wants to read somebody

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.480
standing up here, talking like me, about stuff
like that.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:23.180
But it was very important for me to talk about
it, because that, to me, is what the book

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.830
is really about.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.610
And, will she get away with her life?

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.610
You know.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:35.120
[pause]
If any of you'd like to ask any questions

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.339
about the book, about writing, about publishing,
I would really be happy to take questions.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:44.360
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi there.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.560
This will be my introduction to your work.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.030
I'm not familiar with your previous book.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.100
I'm looking forward to it.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.510
I'm just curious what got you started into
writing fiction?

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.790
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: I think it was one of those things
I was born with.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.429
I remember when I was about five years old
that I was going to write my epic of the cats

00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:06.610
who went camping.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:11.050
This was going to be my first big novel.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.720
It got stalled because I didn't know how to
spell "tent."

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.750
I sadly had to abandon that project.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.520
But it's something that I always wanted to
do.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.130
I think most people that are writers come
to it.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.750
I just remember the first time that I opened
a book.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.920
I opened a book, and for whatever reason,
I could read pretty much immediately.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.330
It wasn't a big learning curve, it was just,
"Wow!

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.960
Words on a page that tell us a story."

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.330
I thought this was the most miraculous thing
ever.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:43.350
Then, I think, as I got older, – so I've
written most of my life, on and off.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.120
I've gone through periods where I wasn't doing
it as actively, where I tried to do other

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.510
things.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.380
But I'm someone, I like to travel.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.309
I like to observe.

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:58.730
I like to try to figure out how I think the
world works.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.750
What's going on here?

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.350
How are these things put together?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.730
What is it we're all doing?

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.970
I don't--.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:11.580
Writing non fiction doesn't have the same
appeal to me as trying to take these sorts

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.630
of issues and questions and cast them in a
fictional form.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:22.500
I think it's as much about making sense of
the world as I observe it, as anything else.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.790
That's my motivation.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.299
And having fun.

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:27.299
Writing books like this is fun.

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:28.299
You know?

00:18:28.299 --> 00:18:31.470
It's like, "Oh, what horrible thing can I
make happen now?"

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.220
[laughs] I don't know, maybe there's an element
of masochism.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.320
I'm not sure.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.650
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'm just curious about how you
got your first book published, and the process,

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.720
and how long it took you to work on it, and
so forth?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.230
And editing, and all of that?

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.360
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: Anybody that is involved with
the publishing industry these days, will tell

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.650
you that it's an industry that's--.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.720
There's a lot of changes that are taking place.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.520
There's a lot of uncertainties.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.300
My other author friends, I think that the
line we always fall back on is "It's a brutal

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:07.730
business" because there's an element of luck
involved as well, and timing.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:12.760
It's kind of like you find the right project,
the right person, at the right time, and all

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.260
those windows have to line up.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.570
There are certain things you can do to improve
your chances, but you're always going to be

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.970
dealing with that.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.800
In my case, I decided that I wanted to write
something that I could sell, because I've

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.010
been writing most of my life, but not really
with the intent of selling something.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.210
It was just something that I did.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.000
I thought, "Well, what can I write about that
is commercial, that's going to have some appeal

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.500
to people, that I know about?"

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.640
And contemporary China was my choice.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.020
I've been traveling there for about 30 years.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.660
Then it was just, "Well, let me find something
I'm really angry about" which would have been

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.160
the Iraq war and the war on terror.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.690
And then, "Let me figure out how I would talk
about contemporary China and the war on terror

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.510
and put those things together" which was an
awkward fit.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:06.360
I characterized it like you're juggling a
bowling ball, a flaming torch, and a chainsaw,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.760
and trying to get these things to work and
play well together.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.260
I came up with what I came up with.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.400
I worked on the book.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:18.220
Then I just did that thing that they tell
you to do, which was I started querying agents.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.880
If you're familiar with the process, you create
a query letter, which is basically a pitch

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.440
for your book.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.870
You make it sound like [laughs] like the flap
on the jacket.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.700
A little bit about yourself and why you're
the person who's writing this book.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.590
And you send it off.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:35.620
I did about six of these and didn't really
get anywhere.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.590
I discouraged very easily at the time.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.660
I was like, "Oh, I wrote another really weird-ass
book that no one's going to publish."

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:48.190
Then a friend of mine says, "Why don't you
query this guy, Nathan Bransford?" who was

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.660
a well known agent, if you're in the blogging
publishing world at all.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.290
I did, and he wrote me back right away and
said, "Oh, this is really interesting.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.290
Can you send me the partial?"

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.320
I sent him the partial, which is usually the
first 50 pages.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.370
A couple of hours go by, and it's like, "Can
you send me the book?"

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.990
And I did.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:11.040
And then, we worked together revising the
book, because it was pretty unwieldy.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.280
There were a lot of different things going
on.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.620
One of the things that you learn when you're
doing this is your fiction has to fit somewhat

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.280
into a category, which can be very frustrating.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.000
But it's largely about--.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.920
Even with the reduced role of bookstores,
it still comes down to "Where does this book

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.130
go on the shelf?"

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.500
If you can't answer that question, you're
making your task of selling the book that

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.110
much harder.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:40.669
A lot of what I did was cutting away stuff
that got in the way of the first book being

00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:42.870
a suspense novel.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.410
Then, we went out, after six months or so
of that.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:52.150
I guess the book itself took me about, it
was close to two years, I guess, the writing

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.040
process and the revising process.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.494
A year and a half, two years.

00:21:55.494 --> 00:21:58.470
Then we went out on submission.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.340
Right when we went out on submission, it was
middle of 2008, and the entire economy cratered.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.240
It was like, "Oh, great.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.580
My timing is awesome."

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.870
My agent, thankfully, he was a very good agent,
and very dedicated, and was going to do his

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.370
best to sell this book.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.530
We sent it out in little batches at a time.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:24.110
It took a year, and then SoHo published the
book, which has ended up being a really great

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.110
fit.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.080
They are an actual independent publisher,
but they're distributed by Random House, so

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.150
you get the best of both worlds.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.380
So yeah, it was the traditional process.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.850
It's just the traditional process.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:41.140
There's a lot of different ways to do it now
that weren't available when I was doing it.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.630
The traditional process can be a really long
and hard road.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.919
You just have to be willing to do a lot of
pounding your head against the wall until

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:52.850
either your head or the wall gives way.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.200
That's generally what it takes.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.730
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So you mentioned that you've traveled
repeatedly to Puerto Vallarta and to China.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.900
Where else do you go back to repeatedly, and
what do those places have in common?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.230
What might show up in future books?

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.429
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: [pause] Well, China.

00:23:10.429 --> 00:23:12.970
Have any of you traveled to China?

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:13.970
Anyone?

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:14.970
It's an incredibly--.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.419
It's a big country, like the United States,
and it's very diverse.

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:22.309
There are a lot of different parts to it.

00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:25.799
I was interested in dealing with contemporary
China, which is--.

00:23:25.799 --> 00:23:30.730
Most Western authors that have written about
China tend to do stuff that's set in a period.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.580
The reality of China today is very, very different.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.710
It changes very rapidly.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.070
One of the challenges when I was writing Rock
Paper Tiger was I had to keep updating it,

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.310
even as the book was in galleys.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.590
Like, "Oh, they don't use this kind of car
for taxis in Beijing anymore.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.590
Whoops.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.220
Let me fix that."

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.830
I don't know that it really--.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:56.070
I guess what the two books have in common,
well, in the first book, the one set in China,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.400
the main character has lived in China for
a couple of years, in Beijing, so she has

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.840
some basic familiarity with her environment.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.820
She can speak the language decently.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.460
She can navigate, up to a point.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.880
But she still is an outsider.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.850
In this book, this is a woman on vacation
who's just completely, you know, from Brentwood!

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:20.040
[laughs] She's not prepared to deal with what
she runs into at all.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.890
It really takes her a while to--.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.960
I get a little frustrated by thrillers where
everybody understands they're supposed to

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.679
act like they're in a thriller right away,
because that's just not very realistic.

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:37.610
I'm more interested in what somebody, quote
"an ordinary person" would do who's in an

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.120
unfamiliar environment and really doesn't
know what's going on or how to navigate or

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.620
what a smart choice is, and doesn't have a
lot of resources to figure those things out.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.950
Both of the books have that element somewhat
in common, where an ordinary person without

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:59.550
super martial arts powers or hacking skills
gets involved in an extraordinary situation

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.809
that is way above their pay grade.

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:05.179
That would be the main element in common.

00:25:05.179 --> 00:25:10.120
I have a third book that I've sold that's
coming out May next year that is actually

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.400
a sequel to the first book.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.410
It's going to go to different places in China
than the first book went to, because I like

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.120
to give a little bit of a travel log.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.260
We're going to some pretty places.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.660
I call it a "lighthearted romp through an
environmental apocalypse."

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.950
[laughter] Although we do go to some pretty
places in the book, too.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.960
Yeah, I'm just going to call all my books
lighthearted romps.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.870
This is a lighthearted romp through the wonderful
world of black ops and drug cartels.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.809
Lighthearted romp through an environmental
apocalypse.

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:41.160
Like that.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.340
Because I think that the stuff I write has
an element of humor in it.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.750
I don't know whether that comes across as
clearly as I think it does, but I like a little

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.929
bit of satire or humor in it, as well.

00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:58.480
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It sounds like you've been writing
Americans in international territory where

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.490
they're unfamiliar--

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.490
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: Mmhmm.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.520
&gt;&gt;Male #3: --and have to respond and react.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.710
In the future, have you thought about maybe
doing foreigners in America, and what they

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.710
have to go through?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.750
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: I think I wouldn't be against
that.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.410
I'm not one of these people that thinks that
somebody from one particular background can't

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.830
write about somebody from a background that's
different.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.730
I do think if you're going to do that, you
really, really, really have to do your research,

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:25.660
and you really have to be familiar with the
person, with the culture, with what it is

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.020
that you're trying to portray.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.590
I would only approach that if I felt that
it was something I could do credibly.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.640
I had enough trouble in the first book because
I had, the main character was in the National

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.410
Guard, and I have not been.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.470
That was something that I really, really immersed
myself in.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:49.910
I was really gratified when I got some feedback
from vets who asked me if I'd served and told

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.820
me that I'd done a really good job with it.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.020
That was very meaningful to me.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.080
But you really have to do your homework.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.290
And actually, I'm not-- the fourth book is
still a little bit up in the air, but it's

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.380
going to be set primarily in the United States.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.380
I'm hoping to have--.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:13.770
It's going to be serious subjects, some very
serious stuff, but I think the element of

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.020
satire will be a little bit more apparent,
because I'm going to do a political campaign,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.260
among other things.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.590
I'm looking forward to doing that.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.419
So the character, in this case, is going to
be a little bit better at operating in the

00:27:27.419 --> 00:27:28.419
environment.

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:33.039
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I've read both Rock Paper Tiger
and Getaway.

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:38.770
I think you do a fantastic job of, as you
said, layering-- that's my word, but-- layering

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:45.620
the social issues that you want to talk about
in your books with actual plot.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:51.890
It makes me wonder how much you outline, if
at all.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.559
Maybe give us an idea of what your actual
writing process is.

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:56.419
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: [chuckling] Outline?

00:27:56.419 --> 00:27:58.559
What is this outline?

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:02.210
It really--.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:08.240
It's interesting, because I just wrote a piece
about how I plot, how I create story for a

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.640
collection that's going to be coming out in
a couple of weeks.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.240
I really had to think about it.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.559
It wasn't clear to me until I started thinking
about the fourth book how I do it.

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:22.309
The fourth book is actually a little bit more
organized already than I usually--.

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:23.789
I've learned a little bit.

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:30.990
I don't like outlining because I feel like
a lot of times, I get to know my characters

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.990
as I write them.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.570
It's almost like it's a process of observation,
like I'm watching these people and trying

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.120
to, like, "What are they doing?

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.630
How do they act?

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.240
What's their thing?"

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.690
I don't like to do too much outlining.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.130
I do tend to take--.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.990
Location is important to me.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:51.470
Issues are important to me.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.470
And characters.

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.700
Then you go, "Okay, what's the driver?"

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.690
If I've got these elements, what's the thing
that's going to drive the story?

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:05.040
That's the tricky part, because, especially
when you're writing stuff-- hmm, excuse me--

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.620
that is suspense fiction, it needs to be suspenseful.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.900
You have to have something that creates tension,
and you have to create tension all the way

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.760
through the book.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.679
You don't want to be too loosey-goosey about
it.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:24.580
But I think pacing is something that I've
learned over the course of writing three and

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.720
now starting on a fourth book.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:30.309
It gets to be a lot easier to go, cut, cut,
moving on, moving on, moving on.

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:33.090
I have a short attention span, so that helps,
too.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.950
But no, I don't plot, I don't outline.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:41.611
I try to set up the situation so that the
story can then unwind, like, okay, if you

00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:46.500
know you have this character in this setting
with these problems, and this thing that has

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:53.160
to-- that she's got to deal with and solve--
then what happens?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.220
But I always tell people everybody's process
is different.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.830
I'm a real believer in not instructing people
on their own process.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.590
It's something you need to discover through
work.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:07.240
The only thing that I say is that I really
think it's a good idea to write every day,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.000
if you can, especially when you're working
on a project, because--.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.470
For me, if I take too much time off, then
there's this process of reacclimating myself

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.280
and getting back into it.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.490
My productivity just goes way down.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:24.740
Whereas if I work every day, I don't have
to put in a lot of hours trying to write,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.059
but I get a lot more done in the same amount
of time.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:31.750
Setting a schedule is helpful, which was one
of those really hard things for somebody like

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.750
me to admit.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.750
I hate schedules.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.409
I hate them.

00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:39.260
You know what, really, it works better if
you do that.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.260
Whatever works for you.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.100
I used to write, when I had a full time job,
I wrote from 10 to midnight pretty much every

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.100
night.

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.090
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I have another question, too.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.030
This is related to the character, your characters.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.960
How much of yourself finds its way into your
main characters?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.919
Do you explicitly try to refrain from doing
that?

00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.720
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: I think that most people that
are writing--.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:05.460
Well, not everybody, because some fiction
authors will talk very explicitly about how

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.110
"This is kind of like me, but a more idealized
version of me."

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.120
I'm the opposite.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.330
"Well, there's elements of this that are like
me, but a more screwed up version of me."

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.690
I don't want to write about myself.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:23.179
I think a lot of fiction is disguised biography,
because obviously, everything is coming out

00:31:23.179 --> 00:31:24.390
of your own head.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.080
But that's the heroes and the villains.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.570
It's the whole, everything you're writing.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.120
You're taking little pieces of yourself.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.309
And empathy, which I think is the most important
thing, and trying to understand how this person

00:31:39.309 --> 00:31:44.960
would react, placed in these situations.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.880
Not me, no.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.790
Mm-mm. [laughs] And especially, I really tried.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:57.970
The first book, the main character is young,
swears a lot, drinks a lot, does a lot of

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.220
really questionable, because she's really
screwed up.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.990
When I wrote the second book, I wanted to
prove I can actually write an entire book

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.429
where the f bomb doesn't get dropped every
paragraph.

00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:10.770
I'm going to do it right here.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.429
I think also, and again, depending on the
kind of writer you are.

00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:16.049
I don't want to do the same book every time.

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:19.250
I'm not interested in dealing with the same
main character every time.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:25.059
Though I'm doing a sequel to the first book,
and it's written, and, it was really fun.

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:27.510
It was really fun to go back to that character.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.740
It was really fun to deal with some other
issues in her life.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:36.990
I had a blast with it, but I can't see myself
writing these books and this character in

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.539
the alphabet, like Sue Grafton did.

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:45.150
I'm going like, "I want to do maybe one more,
and then I'm done with that."

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:50.400
I think mainly what it is is you have to understand
your own emotional responses to things to

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.200
realize that other people's emotional responses
aren't the same as yours.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.380
I think empathy, understanding yourself, is
certainly important.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.669
Observation and empathy are the other things
that are really important.

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:10.540
I would be pretty horrified by books that
were populated by myself.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.830
I don't think I'd want to read those.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.130
[laughs] I know I wouldn't want to write them.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.130
[laughs]

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.550
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Non writing question.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.100
Since you've lived in Venice for a while and
some of us are new to Venice, I wondered if

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.039
you had any recommendations about the neighborhood?

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:26.330
Restaurants or things to do, and so forth,
that are your favorites?

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:33.980
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: I love Venice, and it's changed
a ton since I, I moved up here, I can never

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:34.980
remember.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.820
It was December '86 or December '87.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.940
I lived in this building on the Boardwalk
that was one of the "Jim Morrison slept here"

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.940
buildings.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.940
He slept around, man.

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.919
[laughter] There's a lot of those.

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:51.090
It was the kind of thing where you'd have,
it got turned into an illegal hostel, and

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.679
there were guys that would steal things from
the top floor.

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:56.460
I was on the bottom floor and they'd come
and knock on my door at like 8 in the morning

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.140
and say, "Do you want to buy a microwave?"

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.900
I'd be like, "No, I don't want to.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.169
Get out of here!"

00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:02.320
We had SWAT teams.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320
It was fun.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320
Venice.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320
Fun.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.820
A little edgier than some of us, than anybody
really liked.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.159
But that kind of thing, I think it's--.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.570
It's safe here.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.160
It's a great mix of people.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.899
You have people that have lived here for generations.

00:34:21.899 --> 00:34:28.110
You have all kinds of artists, film industry
people, and now, this whole silicon beach

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.580
thing.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.839
It's a very--.

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:33.550
It's always been a very creative place.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.159
It's still a very creative place.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:39.710
It's just manifesting itself differently than
it used to.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.000
Being able to walk through the neighborhood
at night and not worry so much about getting

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.990
shot is a very cool thing.

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:47.919
That's the upside of gentrification, I will
say.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:51.280
And wine bars is the other upside of gentrification.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280
We have a lot of them.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.169
Rose Avenue has really developed quite a bit.

00:34:55.169 --> 00:34:57.190
That's booming, and it's still kind of charming.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.190
Oscar's.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.940
Have any of you been to Oscar's or Venice
Beach Wines?

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.940
Those are great.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.109
They're great little places, and the owners
are really, really cool people.

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:11.170
And then, I really like, on the Boardwalk,
the Venice Ale House.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:12.940
It's surprisingly good.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.420
And then, have you been to Dry Tour yet?

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:21.580
The place that just opened on Windward and
Pacific?

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.020
That place I really like.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.410
It's another local, locally-sourced, organic.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:30.790
But well done, and the prices are reasonable.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.830
And Taco Trucks.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.920
You know, there's one that always parks on
Rose that's called, I think it's Isla Bonita

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.050
or something like that.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.960
That's really good.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:47.570
Abbot Kinney, I like the coffee place, Intelligentsia.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.990
It's over the top, but it's good.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:54.320
The people, again, they're really nice and
they care about what they do.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.510
The restaurants I don't go to there very much.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.930
Hal's is still kinda cool.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:58.930
It's old school.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.640
It's been there for a long time.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.440
There's a sushi place that's on the Boardwalk,
of all, in that little food court that's on

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.710
Westminster.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.850
There's two things in that.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:12.040
The Pupuseria is good, and the little sushi
place, which is surprising.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.590
You would not expect that.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:21.420
I really, I walk everywhere, thus these fabulous
shoes.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.441
I just think that exploring the neighborhood
in general, the different neighborhoods, there's

00:36:25.441 --> 00:36:27.940
so much diversity in the housing stock.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.440
It's so much fun just to walk around and see
what you discover.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.990
Have you been to the canals?

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.260
All that kind of stuff.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.180
That's, I don't like the way a lot of that's
developed.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.640
But it's still a really fun place to take
out of town visitors.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.310
"Hey, look at the ducks."

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.290
Just wandering in this neighborhood, the one
that we're in, which was traditionally an

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.030
African American neighborhood, and--.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.770
Do you guys know the history of the area?

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:49.930
Would I be repeating it?

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:56.440
Well, Abbot Kinney, who was a developer, around
the turn of the century, wanted to make Venice.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.820
There were a lot more canals than there are
now.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.550
It was a vacation spot for people who lived
in Los Angeles.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.470
They would summer out here.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:10.070
I lived in one of those little resort hotels,
with the Murphy beds.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.610
That's what it was designed for.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:18.560
When he got old, he had a chauffeur and an
assistant, an African American man who couldn't

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.310
live anywhere in Venice.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:28.470
He wanted to leave him some property in his
will, so he established the Oakwood community,

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.540
wrote the real estate covenants so that African
American people were allowed to buy and live

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.540
there.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.770
Because things were very restrictive.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.820
It was 1920s, something like that?

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:44.480
That's part of the history of the neighborhood,
which I hope doesn't go away in this rush

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.220
to megamansions and wine bars, because that
would be a shame.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.480
Because I think what makes Venice interesting
is that it brings so many different kinds

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.430
of people together, different economic levels,
different backgrounds.

00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:02.970
But everybody, I mean, I think the thing in
common is that almost everybody that's here

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.580
likes being here.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.609
If you just wander around and say hi to people,
99% of the people that you meet in Venice

00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:13.550
are really happy to be here.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.330
I think that's one of the things that makes
it a really special place.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.990
You just--.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.780
A lot of places, there's a level of urban
alienation.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.070
You don't have that here.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.070
This is a community.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.480
&gt;&gt;Female #3: There's a lot of [inaudible]
here.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: Yeah.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.710
Yeah, there is.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:32.840
I think that's one of the best things about
it.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.530
So I was really happy to see you guys move
into this building, because this building

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.910
was just getting beat to crap.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:41.170
It was really run down, and it wasn't being
taken care of.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.410
It's such a great local landmark.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:51.119
It's nice seeing it here and playing a vital
role in both the community and the world,

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.130
really.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.330
We're glad to have you.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.330
[pause]

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.410
&gt;&gt;Male #6: A follow up on that question.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.030
Does Venice find its way into your writing?

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.400
Not literally, but I guess in a more sort
of general or--?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.910
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: Well, at the place-- I lived
in two places in Venice.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:14.970
I lived at the Ellison, which was one of these
old apartment buildings on the Boardwalk.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.070
About nine years ago, I moved into a little
bungalow cottage which was built in 1910 that

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:22.810
I call Shack by the Sea that I walk down from.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.720
It's very shack-like.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.760
It's got these big bamboos, and it's wood
and open ceiling.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.340
It's just a very creative environment.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:38.430
It's the kind of place where I have felt inspired
to do work.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.380
I think Venice in general inspires people
to do work.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.690
Part of it is that you just meet so many interesting
people.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:52.700
It's always better to be in a community that's
about fostering creativity in all its different

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.730
forms.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:01.560
So I haven't written about Venice specifically,
but it's just one of the rare places that

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:07.970
I think, its foundation is creativity, from
the moment that it was built.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.670
Who builds canals?

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:15.420
[laughs] Who builds Venice in the middle of
Los Angeles?

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.730
Some crazy developer dude.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:21.170
It started from there, and I think we still
feel that now.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:26.820
&gt;&gt;Male #7: This is going to reveal my ignorance
of your work, but I was curious.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.630
You set a lot of your books around social
ills or causes.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.630
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: Mmhmm.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.160
&gt;&gt;Male #7: I was interested in how you work
the story around that.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.010
Is it just a setting, or do you advocate solutions,
or how does that affect your characters and

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.010
plots?

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.450
&gt;&gt;Brackmann: It's like I said.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:48.810
It's a hard line to walk because I can't stand
reading overly didactic fiction.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.430
It's boring.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.540
I don't--.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.450
I have a short attention span.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:41:00.190
So I think it has to be woven very carefully
and organically into this story, otherwise,

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.650
you're just going to do a fantastic belly
flop.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:08.000
I mean, I find it kinda funny, because most
of the people that comment on the stuff that

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.210
I write don't even comment about it.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:14.810
I guess that means I'm successful, because
no body is mentioning, "Oh yeah, this book

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.310
is really about", you know.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:24.570
And how things get solved or don't solved
depends on the issue involved.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.570
That's another thing.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.520
I don't, I get a little bit frustrated.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.800
They're fun escapism, and people get to read
what they want to read.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.079
But when you have some huge world shaking
problem and action man fixes the whole thing

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.390
by the end of the book, I'm like, "That never
happens.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.270
It not how stuff works."

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:49.640
I'm more interested in more open ended sorts
of things because some things can't be resolved.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:56.420
It's really more about how the character responds
than it is about "I'm going to fix the problem

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.800
of arbitrary authority that abuses its power"
because one little person is not-- that's

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.270
the first book-- is not going to be able to
do this.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:09.730
It's more just like, "I've already been screwed
over by arbitrary authority that abuses its

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.730
power.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.960
I have to figure out how to survive this and
how I'm going to live with this.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.760
How do we live with the fact that so many
things are completely out of our control?

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.950
Are these really, really huge, scary kinds
of issues?

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:24.230
What can we personally do?

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:27.070
How much effect can we have on them?

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.609
More to the point, how do we live with it?

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:34.160
That interests me more than solving an issue.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:41.030
I like to deal with things that are not particularly
solvable by one person.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.540
It's more about going like, "Okay, we have
an entire system that is behaving in this

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.540
way.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.730
What are we going to do about it?

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:47.790
How do we respond to it?

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.380
Is there anything we can do about it?

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.140
What positive actions can we take?

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:56.440
More to the point, can I survive the scary
guy with guns who's trying to kill me?"

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.359
So yeah, it's a tricky thing to do.

00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:02.000
But you've got to really embed it.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.470
Again, the nice thing about suspense genre
is that you don't really have a lot of time

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.980
to waste.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:15.040
You can't take "Now I'm going to stand up
here and explain to you how I feel about the

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.349
abuse of the Constitution."

00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:20.240
I'm not going to do that.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240
But yeah.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.170
Sometimes I think maybe I've been more subtle
than I think, because it's like "Yeah, I don't

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.680
get what this book was."

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.119
[makes whining noises] [laughter] It gets
a little frustrating sometimes.

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:33.280
[laughs] But yeah, you've got to make it organic
to the story.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.400
Well, thank you.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.700
This has really been a pleasure.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:42.070
I'm so delighted to have met you all and finally
gotten inside the Giant Binoculars.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:45.120
I hope you enjoy the book.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.240
[applause]

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.830
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Lisa will be signing, if anyone
would like to get their book signed at the

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:52.830
table over there.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:53.570
Thank you, Lisa.
