JP, how's Hawaii?

00:00:01.546 --> 00:00:02.532
&gt;&gt; What?

00:00:02.532 --> 00:00:04.920
I could hardly hear you over
the sounds of the jungle.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.740
Let me go over to that tree.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, J.P.
&gt;&gt; That's better.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.840
So how are you and

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.740
the developer doing besides all
the craziness with launching 0.5?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.310
&gt;&gt; Pretty good.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.360
I submitted Shopping List Plus Plus
to the Abbie's like you suggested.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.540
We're a bit of a long shot what with
Grocery Grabber having just released

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.990
their next version, but you never know.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.460
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.060
&gt;&gt; And let's see, besides that, well we
finished everything on the wire frames.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.900
&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.360
That's great to hear.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.410
Why don't you take me through everything
you guys have done for old times sake?

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.880
&gt;&gt; Sure thing.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.520
Shopping List Plus Plus is turning
into a fully fledged experience, and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.150
it's all thanks to you, the developer.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.850
Starting with version 0.1, you made a
very basic prototype that just read and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.455
wrote some data.

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:54.000
In version 0.2, you flush this out
more by incorporating FirebaseUI so

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.798
that you could list out shopping
lists and shopping list items.

00:00:56.798 --> 00:01:02.520
In version 0.3, you added user
accounts as well as a bunch of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.050
functionality like letting others know
that you're in the store shopping and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.412
marking that you've bought items.

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:12.610
Version 0.4 might have been
our most triumph moment

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.816
when you overhaul the data structure
to allow for shopping list sharing.

00:01:15.816 --> 00:01:19.377
You also added some pretty
snazzy sorting features.

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:24.640
In version 0.5,
you added offline functionality so

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.540
that the app caches data even
when it's not on the screen.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.780
Also implemented a bunch of read,
write and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.490
validation rules to make sure that
our data is properly formed and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.815
that only the correct
people have access to it.

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:43.250
&gt;&gt; Nice, so I gotta ask, what about
that big security flaw you talked about?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.490
&gt;&gt; Well, for the short term,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.260
I basically got another engineer to
separate our password and email flow.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.280
But we'll be looking into
incorporating a simplistic server,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.050
maybe the later version.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.423
Hey, Gregory and Walter are here,
and they want to say hi.

00:01:55.423 --> 00:01:56.552
&gt;&gt; Dujippi!

00:01:56.552 --> 00:01:58.265
My friend.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.800
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.730
&gt;&gt; Hey guys, great to see all of you.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.430
Actually, I might need to sign off.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.280
I don't like the way that
parakeet is looking at me.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.341
&gt;&gt; Okay, bye.

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.014
&gt;&gt; Bye.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:09.862
&gt;&gt; Bye.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.476
&gt;&gt; Have fun.

00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:15.710
Well, that was an informative blast
from the somewhat recent past.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.660
Man, I can't believe that
just three months ago,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.090
I was sitting at a meeting with
the Bay Area Shoppers Group.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.650
&gt;&gt; You've come a long way, and
you've come a long way too.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.930
You now know how to read
data into Firebase.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.580
&gt;&gt; You also know how
to take that data and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.020
display it in real
time in a Firebase app.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.320
&gt;&gt; Let's not forget users.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.680
You also know how to create
authentication methods for

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.250
email and
another provider such as Google.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.440
&gt;&gt; And you've learned how to create
firebase data schemas to avoid things

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.370
like nesting data while also
denormalizing your data.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.920
This really helps you grow and
scale your apps.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.910
&gt;&gt; You've also learned how to filter and
sort your data.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.975
&gt;&gt; Finally, we learned how to use
Firebase's security rules language to

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.630
make our apps status secure.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.380
&gt;&gt; That's a lot.
&gt;&gt; That is a lot.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.540
You know what?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.390
I feel like you deserve
this API as much as I do.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah but more than a cell phone
duct taped to a cheap trophy,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.130
we hope you feel empowered to
create your own apps in Firebase.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.160
&gt;&gt; Actually that reminds me,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.000
I have another venture that I
wanted to talk to you about.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.020
And I can actually send
over the spec right

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.080
after we all take a well deserved rest,
so yeah, let's go ahead and do that.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.405
Speaking of which, Holder's taking
forever with that Instarito.

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:22.891
&gt;&gt; Yeah, where is he?

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:24.132
Where is he?

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:25.584
Where is he?

00:03:25.584 --> 00:03:26.826
Where is he?

00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:28.185
Where is he?

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:29.566
Where is he?

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:30.971
Where is he?

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.099
Where is he?
