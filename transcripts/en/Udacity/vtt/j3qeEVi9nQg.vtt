00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.660
Because we started out with knowing about the graph, we were able to write our

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.137
equation for this new parabola right away in this form where we can see the

00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:10.762
vertex. What I'm interested in is what this would look like if we wrote it in

00:00:10.762 --> 00:00:14.443
the standard form for the equation of a parabola. So let's try to move toward

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:18.282
that. Start by multiplying out the terms on the right-hand side of the equation.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:21.590
Write that new expression that belongs on the right-side in this box.
