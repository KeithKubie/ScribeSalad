00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.299
A check-valve is an amazing little device
that lets a liquid or a gas flow one way only.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.080
We'll need some to make a low cost water pump,
but buying them can be a little pricy. So

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
in this project we'll be making our own, out
of common materials, and for less than 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.840
a dollar.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.360
For this project, I'm using a 3/4" male PVC
slip adaptor, 3/4" tubing, a 3/4" plastic

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.160
ball, and an O-ring. I chose this adaptor
because there's a little ledge on the inside

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.890
where the O-ring can sit. And it should look
like this. The ball needs to be large enough

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.100
that it won't push through the throat, but
small enough that it doesn't touch the sides.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.250
Attaching the tube at this point won't really
do any good because the ball will roll right

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.190
out. We need a way to secure it in position,
so let's make a mark on our tube 5/8" from

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.059
the bottom and use a 1/16" bit to drill a
small hole in the tube, continuing right on

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.420
through the other side. Now you'll need a
strong piece of metal, like a nail or a thick

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.420
paperclip. I'm using one of these brad nails
that go to my nail gun. Whatever you use,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.320
it needs to be strong, and long enough to
push all the way through the tube. The ends

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.670
of the nail will need to be flush with the
sides of the pipe, so we can go ahead and

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.380
clip the end with the nail head on it, and
now we've got ourselves a retaining bar that's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.409
perfectly flush on both sides. The next step
is to prime our connections and place the

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.689
O-ring into place inside the adaptor. Now
let's drop in the ball and double check that

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.719
everything is seated properly. PVC cement
is added to the pipe, making sure it covers

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.450
the holes where the nail is set. Then the
pipe is pushed down to the point where the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.679
holes dip just below the rim of the adaptor
so that when the glue sets, this connection

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.520
will be completely air-tight. You can build
this valve into any length of PVC pipe you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.720
want, but I'm using this 1-1/2" piece because
it's just long enough to accept another adaptor.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.359
When it's glued and pushed together, it makes
a nice little compact unit, with only a slight

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.840
gap separating the two ends. I took

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.420
the opportunity to make 4 of these valves
and a visual inspection on the inside shows

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.050
that the ball and O-ring are still seated
properly in place, and the retention bar keeps

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.620
it all together. To finish up, I gave these
a quick paint job, and wrapped one end with

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.870
a bit of electrical tape to indicate the direction
of flow, similar to the marking you'd find

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.120
on an electrical diode. A fluid can pass freely
in one direction, but if the valve is turned

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.100
around, the pressure closes the valve and
the fluid is blocked. The quality of the seal

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.030
can be tested by dipping the pressurized valve
in a bowl of water. This will show us if any

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.550
air is escaping at all. The pressure can be
released though, by pushing up on the inside

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.120
of the valve to break the seal between the
ball and the O-ring. I tried using a couple

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.340
of these valves to make a hand pump, which
you'll be able to find in another project.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.560
It'll compress air, and move water at over
5 gallons per minute. You can even create

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.190
enough suction to form a makeshift vacuum
pump. The threaded ends of the valves make

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.760
them easy to connect, replace or rearrange
whenever needed. Just for curiosity, let's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.860
pressure-test the valve by hooking it up to
an air compressor using this pneumatic adaptor

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.960
that we made in the Rocket Rifle project.
The system's set at 20PSI, and you can see

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.390
the valve close off and prevent any air from
leaking. When I crank it up to 50PSI, the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.620
pressure difference is a little more obvious by the compression of the O-ring, and I'm really impressed at

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.410
how well it works. As an alternative, I found
that a rubber bouncy ball could replace the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.760
entire valve mechanism for low pressure applications.
Since the ball is rubber, you don't need an

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.460
O-ring to seal the port. To make it work,
just grab a sharp knife and a cutting board,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.370
and begin cutting the top third of the ball
very slowly, until you've sliced right through

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.340
it. Now re-insert the ball with the round
side facing down, and simply slide the tube

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.220
in overtop. Amazingly it's that easy, and
my kids use it for blowing up balloons. Well

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.240
there's how to make some useful pressure rated
check-valves for as little as 35Â¢. If you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.940
like this project, perhaps you'll like some
of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
