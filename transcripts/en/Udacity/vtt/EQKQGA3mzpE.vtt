00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, we had several questions related to 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.570
extending the search engine to do more things.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.970
We had one from Lotus asking,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.940
"How do we scan for viruses in the search results?"

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.910
and we had another one from McSpark asking, 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.650
"How do we handle relative lengths versus absolute lengths?"

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.550
&gt;&gt;So, it's great that you're thinking about things like this, 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.990
and we're not going to get to all of these things in this class.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.020
Our goal in this class is really to learn about computer science,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.360
and Python, and programming by building a search engine.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.900
To do that we're going to keep the search engine as simple as possible.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.000
What I hope many of you will do after the class--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.470
or during the class if you have enough time, 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.200
is look at going beyond that--

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.800
many of these are interesting and important questions to think about 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040
how to go beyond what we are doing in the class--

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.880
the search engine, the web crawler we'll build only deals with absolute links.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.750
Dealing with relative links is certainly something 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.020
you'll be capable of doing on your own as the course progresses.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.220
Dealing with safety indicators--that is a much tougher problem

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.920
to figure out if a given web page has malicious content on it.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.160
But that is something many people work on for a lot of effort

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360
at places like Google to try to figure out good ways to do that,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.459
and it is an important thing for real search engines to do.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.530
So, I hope as the course goes on, 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.200
you'll start to think of things that you want to do to improve the search engine.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.670
We do have plans for a contest at the end of the course, 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.010
and so the best improvements will be things that will be recognized from that contest,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.980
and we'll invite the winners out to Palo Alto to tell us more about them.
