Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. I've been listening to radio lab on the way over here and um, they have a new episode out about the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs. Yeah. Holy Shit Man. Right. Would you apparently they tell me if I'm right about this before you tell me more because I want to see if I have a little knowledge. Go ahead. There is an under, like there's a very hard layer of rock that covers a large part of the earth. Right. And that is proof that somehow there was an asteroid that hit and it got really, really hot and the Rock God, the morons version of a size that they clearly lay out by the way is the worst thing. I'm also like, there's a rock that got melted day. This was under the ground, undeniable evidence of a rock of from this space as every layer of the earth.

Speaker 1:          01:00          The crust of the earth is super hard because it got really hot after an asteroid hitting. Everybody died and they found dinosaur bones in it. Yeah Bro. They can. They can don't believe in dinosaurs cause I'm, you know I have something called the Bible at home, but some people don't believe in dinosaurs. Do you know that this flat earth folks, while those dinosaurs are fake, why is it that most flat earthers from my experience are generally super good at like a discipline that has nothing to do with astrophysics, like Jujitsu, like they spent a lot of time on a mat, but then they have really strong political opinions about that. Central banks, it think it's just a lack of real education and then yeah, you get caught up in these youtube things that show you a secret and it's very attractive. It's very attractive to look, find out about some hidden stuff like, oh my God, I can't believe they did this.

Speaker 1:          01:52          They hid from us. The fact that the earth is flat. Jesus Christ spaces fake too. Pro Space is fake. Satellites aren't real. They're low flying planes, their planes there. That's the constantly beaming down these information from the sky. Satellites are not real nuclear bombs and not real. Yeah. Not really just big bombs, but then the problem is when you break your leg and you have to set your bone or you get staff and, and you have to trust big Pharma to cure it. Or you use your iPhone and it works and you're talking to somebody in debt, big one. You know what I'm saying? So, but why? Why is that technology something you trust? Your fucking iPhone has a global positioning satellite chip and it stopped porous. It links up with the fucking one that's in the sky and it tells you where you are on the map.

Speaker 1:          02:39          That's why your Google maps works. Jesus fucking Christ. These are probably only five or six flat earthers. No, there's a lot. Yeah, there's thousands of them. Well, okay, but that really means only five or six in the ground. I think the problem with all of them is that they just got married to the idea and then they're fighting it. And if you fight it with someone who doesn't know what they're talking about, not that I do know what I'm talking about, but if you fight it with like a Sean Carroll or like a real assets is a real scientific study, they, there's so much evidence that the earth is round and no evidence that the earth is flat. It's one of those things where it's just like, what are you guys doing? You're chasing your tail. Yeah. This is crazy. Too busy. Way Too busy or youtube.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Okay.
