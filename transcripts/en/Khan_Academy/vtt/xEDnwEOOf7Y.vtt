00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:08.460
So we have 0.79 minus
4/3 minus 1/2 plus 150%.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.460
So we have four
different numbers

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.720
written in different formats.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.250
Here it's a decimal, here
we have two fractions,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.230
and then here we
have a percentage.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.980
So the easiest
thing to do would be

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.350
to write all of these
in the same format.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.950
And for me, the easiest format
to do this computation in

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.920
would be to write
them all as fractions.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.211
And the reason why I want to
do that, in particular, is

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:31.670
because 4/3, when you divide
by 3, when you divide 1/3, 2/3,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.850
4/3, you're going to
have a repeating decimal.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.480
So to avoid that,
I want to put all

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.940
of these-- I want to rewrite
all of these as fractions.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.670
So let's do them one at a time.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.879
So 0.79, this is the
same thing as 79/100,

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.170
so I'll just write it that way.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
So this is the same
thing as 79 over 100.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.350
Then of course,
we have minus 4/3.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.950
Then we have minus 1/2.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.795
And then finally,
we have-- I don't

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.760
want to run out of colors here.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.050
Finally we have 150%.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.570
Well, 150%, percent literally
means per cent, per hundred.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.760
So this is plus 150 per 100.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.734
So now we've written
them all as fractions.

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.900
And in order to do all the
subtraction and addition,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.290
we have to find a
common denominator.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.160
So what's the least common
multiple of 100, 3, 2, and 100?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.690
Well, 100 is divisible
by 2, so 100 is actually

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.287
the least common
multiple of 102.

00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:36.620
So we really have to just
find the least common multiple

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.200
between 100 and 300.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.140
And that's just going to be 300.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.680
There's no other common
factors between 100 and 3.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.830
So let's write all of them with
300 as the common denominator.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.890
So let me do this in
this reddish color.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.300
So 79 over 100 is
the same thing.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.480
If I were to write it over
300, to go from 100 to 300

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.710
in the denominator,
I'm multiplying by 3,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.330
so I have to multiply the
numerator by 3 as well.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.370
So I'm going to multiply
it by 3 as well.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.100
Let's see, 80 times
3 would be 240.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.740
So it's going to be
3 less than that.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.640
So 240 minus 3 is 237.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.490
Now 4/3.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.360
Well, to get the
denominator to be 300,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.570
we have to multiply
the denominator by 100,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.980
so we have to multiply the
numerator by 100 as well.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.920
1/2, if our denominator is 300,
we multiplied the denominator

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.083
by 150 to go from
200 to 300, so we

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:44.310
have to multiply the
numerator by 150.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.350
And then finally, 150
over 100, well, we're

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.630
multiplying the
denominator by 3 to get

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.049
to 300, to go from 100 to 300.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.090
So we have to do the same
thing in the numerator.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.881
So 3 times 150 is 450.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.380
So now we have the
same denominator,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.420
and we can now add
our numerators.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.360
So this is going to be
equal to-- actually,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.050
I could just do it right over
here on the right-hand side.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.970
This is going to be equal
to some stuff over 300.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:29.142
So it's going to be 237
minus 400 and minus 150

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.350
and-- this actually should
be a plus right over here.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.050
This should be plus 450.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.890
And so let's see if we could
simplify this a little bit.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.780
We're subtracting 400,
and we're subtracting 150.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.770
So these two would be the
same thing as subtracting 550.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.630
And then we have a
positive 237, and we're

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.980
adding it to a positive 450.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.540
Or actually, maybe
another easier way

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.730
to think about this is
negative 550 plus 450

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.770
is going to get us negative 100.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.680
And so this simplifies
things a good bit.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.370
Now we have 237 minus
100 is going to be 137.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:24.120
So it equals 137 in
the numerator over 300.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.890
And this is about as simplified
as I can think of making it.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.126
And so this is our
final answer, 137/300.
