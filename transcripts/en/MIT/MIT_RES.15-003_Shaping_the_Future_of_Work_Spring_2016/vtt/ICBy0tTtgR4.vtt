00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.980
The 1980s turned out
to be a pivotal decade

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.900
in the history of work.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.290
So let's take a look at what
happened during that decade

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.490
and why we should care
about these developments

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.680
because it will affect the
future of work going forward.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.140
The 1970s are going
to go down in history

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.280
as a decade of status quo.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.960
The pressures were building, but
managers and workers and unions

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.770
and the government behaved as if
the 1960s and 1950s were still

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.270
in vogue.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.440
Unions were declining.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.280
New industries were coming along
with new ways of introducing

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.130
flexible job designs.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.230
The economy was experiencing
this high rate of inflation

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.230
with no growth in wages.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.380
Labor law was getting outdated.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.670
But Congress couldn't
do anything about it.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.370
So the pressures were building
like this proverbial frog that

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.630
was in warm water,
stayed in the water

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.810
too long until it
started to boil.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.180
Never jumped out because
the challenges were only

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.630
being felt incrementally
until it was too late.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.560
So what happened in the 1980s?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.220
The President of
the United States.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.850
Well, Ronald Reagan
got elected president,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.140
a change from a Democrat to
a conservative Republican

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.700
with very strong ideas about
how to run the economy.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.590
The second thing
that happened is

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.950
it coincided with the
great recession of 1981

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.830
to 1983, where the
effort was to try

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.560
to break the back of inflation
by the Federal Reserve Board.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.500
The third thing that
came along in coincidence

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.590
with these pressures
was the growth

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.300
of Japanese and other
global competition.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.200
Now companies in Japan could
build autos and other products

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.030
as productively at lower
cost as the United States

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.820
and build them in
high qualities so

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.180
that they were strong
competitors to this country.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.190
So what did we see happen?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.800
Well, somewhere in
this time period,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.170
that great social contract from
the 1940s through the 1960s

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.200
broke down.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.950
This nice coincidence of
wages and productivity

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.200
moving together during
this time period,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.940
you can see it began
to fray in the 70s.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.660
And then after 1980, they
depart, never to return again.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.530
So how did this happen?

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.620
Well, again, it starts
with Ronald Reagan.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.580
In the August of 1981, the
air traffic controllers

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.190
went on strike illegally.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.770
And Ronald Reagan said
this is an illegal strike.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.510
I'm going to take
decisive action.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.850
I'm going to fire them if
they don't come back to work.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.770
He did so.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.720
He broke that strike
and it fundamentally

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.360
changed the tenor
of labor relations.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.680
Companies in the private sector
became much more aggressive,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.360
building on the model
of what Reagan did.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.640
They demanded wage
concessions to try

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.140
to become more competitive.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.710
They put in what were
called two-tier contracts.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.080
So new workers were starting
that work at a lower wage

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.410
rate than more senior workers.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.190
That, in fact, continues
today in many cases.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.320
Auto workers would
understand this

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.010
because new hires
come in about 30% less

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.780
than workers who are doing the
same work alongside of them.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600
And so this persisted.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.340
Basically, what happened is
pattern bargaining, that engine

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.060
that helped to spread wage
increases across the economy,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.130
broke down.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.840
The bargaining power that
workers got from strikes

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.160
was no longer there.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.070
Strikes became
defensive weapons.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.470
And companies like Greyhound
Bus Lines or Eastern Airlines

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.510
where strikes occurred, the
companies either won the strike

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.990
or in Eastern's case, the
company went out of business.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.930
And all the jobs were lost.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.000
And so this has continued.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.190
Workers lost their
source of power.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.960
They don't have a new source of
bargaining power in place yet.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.020
And so this social contract
continues to be broken.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.780
The challenge that
we face today,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.029
the challenge as next
generation workers you face,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.570
is to figure out what is a
social contract that might work

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.560
in the modern economy for
you as a modern workforce

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.360
and for society?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.220
We have not figured
that out yet.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.880
That's going to
be your challenge.
