00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk about percentile. Percentile is kind of the same thing.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The kth percentile is so to speak k% through the data.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's many ways to split.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The one I'd adopt is, let's say, for the 10th percentile--this is 10% and this is 90%.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The kth we applied on one side could be applied on both sides.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For our age example, we removed the upper 20 percentile, we removed or exit data items here.

00:00:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check the ones that we removed.
