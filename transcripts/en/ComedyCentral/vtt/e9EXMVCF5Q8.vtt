00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.140
- What is the problem here?

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.310
Are you embarrassed of me
because I'm a has-been?

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.980
Because you know that
I'm writing that book

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.070
that is gonna make
everybody love me again!

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.060
- You're not really writing a book.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.520
- Well I already spent my
advance, so that's a first step.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.080
- Look, this has been a lotta fun,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930
but I need to start
thinkin' about my future.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.950
I mean, you don't even respect me enough

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.090
to have a baby with me.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
- Whoa, what?

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:20.790
I never explicitly said that.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.400
- You said it with your actions.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.638
- What actions?

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:24.471
(horn honking)

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.380
- Oh, look at that baby!

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.340
Isn't he the cutest baby you ever saw?

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.173
- What, what, what?

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:30.006
(thudding)
No, no, what?

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:31.265
(car horn honking)

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.931
(glass shattering)

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:33.787
(engine revving)

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:34.620
(tires screeching)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.571
(crashing)

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.567
(engine revving)

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:38.485
(tires screeching)

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:39.344
(crashing)

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:41.425
(sirens wailing)

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:43.270
- [Police Officer] Step away
from the stolen vehicle, sir!

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.170
- [BoJack] No, no,
misunderstanding, officer.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.680
I was running away from my girlfriend

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.874
whom I don't respect
enough to have a baby with.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:51.790
- Oh, face it, you're
afraid of commitment.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.150
- I'm not afraid of commitment,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.800
I commit to things all the time!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.540
It's the following
through on that commitment

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.590
that I take issue with.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.460
- Hey, stupid, isn't that
your friend over there?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160
- Ugh, Mr. Peanut Butter?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.660
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.950
- Is that BoJack Horseman?

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.200
- Oh jeez, here we go.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.430
- Mr. Peanut Butter and BoJack
Horseman in the same room.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.990
What is this, a cross-over episode?

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.830
- You know, that gets funnier every time.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.790
- You're being sarcastic,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.160
but I think it does actually
get funnier every time.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.890
- We're actually in the middle
of breaking up right now,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.180
so if you could just...
- Yeah?

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.210
You're in the middle of it?

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.043
- Yeah, that's right.

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:26.010
- So would it be awkward
if I joined you right now?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.070
- Yes actually, it's very
awkward, is that not clear?

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.260
- Yeah, this is awkward, right now?

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.590
- Yes, please leave.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.990
- How are you, Mr. Peanut Butter?

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.670
- Ah, livin' the dream,
P.C., livin' the dream.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.100
- Why are you making conversation?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590
- Oh, let's see, it's the English word.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.500
It's called being polite, BoJack.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.620
- But am I crazy that this is a bad time?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.840
- Always a Clydesdale
never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.673
- What?

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.000
- You'll get that one later, man.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.080
Erica!

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.020
Get outta here with that...

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.460
- Would it kill you to be civil?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.770
This is why we're breaking up.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.930
- So it's not because of
the thing with the baby?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.850
- It's because of a lotta things!

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.030
Waiter, could we please have the check?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.863
Thank you.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:00.760
- We haven't even ordered yet.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.840
- I have wasted so many dinners
on you, BoJack Horseman.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.110
I don't know how you can
expect anyone else to love you

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.430
when you so clearly hate yourself.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.631
- Lemme see that.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.501
(car horn honking)
$10 for bread?

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.070
(wings flapping)

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.510
I don't wanna live in a society

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.490
where the pre-meal bread isn't free.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.360
- It is free if you order a meal.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.500
- Can you take me home please?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.280
- Yeah, but I didn't
even eat that much bread.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.440
What did I have, I must've had...

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.500
- You ate nine baskets, sir.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.090
- Nine, really?

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.590
Great, now I'm gonna feel
like a fat-ass all week!
