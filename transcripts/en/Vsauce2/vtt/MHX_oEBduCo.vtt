Sebastian Huber, Robert Pohle and Johannes
Timpernagel built an interactive framework

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.090
that transforms a user and the surroundings
into a system of particles.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.210
With audio by Berlin-based Kling Klang Klong
- the body movements trigger sounds as well

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:35.520
as visuals and the motion-tracking is done
with Xbox Kinect.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.210
Carol Milne knits with glass.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.200
She created a technique of knitting strands
of wax together and then encases the sculpture

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.410
in refractory mold material into which she
pours molten glass.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.370
And she wishes for her work to be viewed as
a metaphor for social structure.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.340
As individual strands are weak and brittle
on their own, but deceptively strong when

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.559
bound together.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.769

He takes pictures of suggestively shaped clouds
and illustrates them with the first thing

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390
that comes to mind.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.830
As a child he was told that clouds’ shapes
were created by balloon-twisting clowns that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.100
live in the sky and this project is an exploration
of that memory.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.330
Eric Standley uses lasers to cut intricate
designs into hundreds of sheets of paper.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.920

and his overarching goal has been to recreate

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.000
