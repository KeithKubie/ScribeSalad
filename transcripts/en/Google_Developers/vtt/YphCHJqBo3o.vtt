ED: Hi, I'm Ed from
the Google Maps team

00:00:22.302 --> 00:00:24.760
and we're here in London today
as part of our Code the Road

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.530
tour.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.520
We're going to be
walking some developers

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.970
through building an Android
application with Google Maps.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.095
We're going to be displaying
some data on the map

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:35.080
and building some
functionality to do check-ins

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.230
and saving the data
back to Google's cloud.

FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm not
a software developer

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
but it was still easy to be
aware of what's happening.

MALE SPEAKER: Very, very
helpful and very, very friendly.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.475
MALE SPEAKER:
Pretty interesting.

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:54.922
I ended up with a working
app, so that's always good.

MATT TOON: Thank you
very much for coming

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.303

people who were at the code lab

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:04.370
this morning for staying.

MALE SPEAKER: A
guy from Google who

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:23.005

Map API helped me out a lot.

I like days where

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.588
