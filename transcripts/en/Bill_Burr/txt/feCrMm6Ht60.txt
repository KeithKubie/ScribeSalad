It's like if they didn't do it, they're completely fucked. They're fucked either way. Either they did it and they go into jail and they getting gang raped. You know what? You know let's what you get for doing that shit. But on the other side, if you didn't do whatever you, you know what do, what are you doing? How do you make your money then?
