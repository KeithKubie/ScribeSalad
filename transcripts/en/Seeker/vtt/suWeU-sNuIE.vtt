00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.260
Keeping up with the Joneses in 2015 means,
an overpriced apartment with a white picket

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.710
fence, no kids, maybe a dog and a great sex
life.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.330
But what does that last one even look like?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.509
Hey Joneses, Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.900
You’re always looking over the fence to
check in on the neighbors, how are they doing?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.760
How does my life compare against theirs?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.230
Do I have the right TV, the right laptop?

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.009
But what about what goes on behind closed
doors?

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.470
How will you ever know if you’re having
enough sex?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.910
But like, what is the “normal” amount
of sex to have?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.590
It’s really hard to know.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.630
Studies about sex are mostly about heterosexual
couples and some are even sponsored by some

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.630
company.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.710
And sex surveys probably aren’t super accurate,
because well, people lie.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.460
People in relationships might beef up their
bedroom habitats.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.830
Men might add a few trysts to their list,
while women might underreport.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.000
So take these results with a grain of salt.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.350
One survey from the Durex Condom Company found
that 53% of Americans claim to have sex once

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.260
a week, which is close to what other studies
have found.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.600
According to the General Social Survey, on
average straight men over 18 have sex 63 times

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.210
a year, so that’s like a little more than
once a week.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.240
Straight women over 18 say they have a little
less sex, 55 times a year.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.869
But it depends on a few obvious factors, like
age and relationship status.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.640
Data from the National Survey of Sexual Health
and Behavior from Indiana University shows

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.640
that young couples do it like they do on the
Discovery Channel, more often than single

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640
people.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.410
But these numbers deal with vaginal sex, it
doesn’t take into account the wide variety

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.780
of sexual behavior.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.950
Almost 46 percent of married men ages 18 to
24 report having sex 2 to 3 times a week.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.560
Compared to single men their own age, 57 percent
of which haven’t had sex in the past year.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.390
While men in their late 20s, both married
and in relationships, had sex a little less

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.860
often, a few times a month to once a week.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.050
As for women in the same age range, for both
partnered and married, pretty similar story.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.729
32% of 18 to 24 year old women in relationships
had sex a few times a week.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.330
But for women a little older, they have slightly
less sex, 48% of married women got it on a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.799
few times a month or once a week.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.830
But that’s still more than their single
friends, 50% of single women 18-24 and 43%

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.180
of single women 25 to 29 haven’t had sex
in the past year.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.290
The same goes for queer women in relationships
too.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.760
One survey from queer women’s site Autostraddle
found that about 35% of women in relationships

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.310
had sex a few times a week.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.139
While their single friends had less sex.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.680
And according to a Match.com’s Singles In
America study, that’s what most men and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.300
women want, getting busy about 2 or 3 times
a week.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.489
And that’s just enough, not too much.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.239
On the other hand only 15 percent of men and
12 percent of women wanted to have sex every

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.239
day.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.629
And that’s about how often the happiest
couples do the deed according to some sources.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.450
But some researchers, like Acacia Parks, an
assistant professor of psychology at Hiram

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.349
College think that happiness leads to more
sex, not the other way around.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.269
So will more sex make you more happy?

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.269
Probably not.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.610
One study published in the Journal of Economic
Behavior &amp; Organization, found that having

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.620
more sex doesn’t make you any happier.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.599
In fact making the beast with two backs more
often leave you wanted it less and finding

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.010
it less enjoyable.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.080
Not to mention that fussing about how much
sex is “right” or “healthy” or “normal”

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.530
might make things worse!

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.019
One study published in the journal Social
Indicators Research found that happiness about

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.590
the amount of “getting busy” you're doing
depends on how much sex you think OTHER PEOPLE

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.590
are having.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.121
The large study of over 15,000 people found
that the more you believe you’re keeping

00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.510
up with the Joneses boning next door, the
happier you are.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.040
The researchers agreed that in general people
were happier the more they had sex.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.569
Like those people who are having sex at least
two to three times a month were 33 percent

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.730
more likely to report a higher level of happiness
than those who reported having no sex during

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.989
the last year and those that have sex once
a week were 44 percent more likely.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.909
And those who had sex frequently, two to three
times a week, were 55 percent more likely

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.000
to report a higher level of happiness.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.209
BUT that level of satisfaction decreased if
they thought other people, like those in their

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.940
peer group were having more sex than them.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.209
So maybe stop asking if you’re having “enough”
sex.

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.680
Stopping looking over your neighbor’s fence.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.329
And start asking if you’re happy?

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.329
Is your partner happy?

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.480
And really it’s all about quality over quantity
people.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:01.059
And just you know, you do you.
