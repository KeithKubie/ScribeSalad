00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.500
Break ups are hard.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.540
Whether you're the dumper or the dumpee, it's a very difficult thing to deal with.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.940
It might feel like you'll never make it out of the heart-shattering sadness.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.480
But you will.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.760
Here are 5 things you can do to help put yourself back together after a break up.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.040
Number one: experience it.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
The only way to really get over a break up is to deal with it.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.580
Don't distract yourself. Let yourself feel the emotions, one at a time.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.020
There will be good times, and there will be bad, but the most important thing is to give yourself time.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.500
If you feel like crying, cry. Crying has a bad reputation but it's extremely therapeutic.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.280
Crying isn't losing control, it's gaining it back through owning your emotions.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.240
Number two: focus on yourself.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.220
After being the second half of a couple for a while, we tend to forget what it feels like to be on our own again.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.300
Be your own person.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.380
Do whatever you feel like doing. Try thinking about you and only you for a little bit to regain that awesome sense of independence that you lost while being someone's significant other.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.700
This can be done in a number of ways. Treat yourself to something nice, like a delicious dinner or a day out and about.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.600
Maybe take the time to reevaluate your health goals, or even set personal goals for yourself.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.960
Indulge a little. Buy yourself a nice outfit or something you've had your eye on.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.980
Get your favorite food or a bottle of wine and enjoy it with, or without friends.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.460
Take time to remind yourself of who you are.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.120
Number three: try new things.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.560
Have you always wanted to take guitar lessons? Take a yoga class? Finally read that book you bought three years ago.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.240
Well, now you have the time.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:25.940
Find a new hobby or take a class you've been wanting to take. You'll get out more, meet new people and, most importantly, get that pesky ex off your mind.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.300
Number four: reach out to family and friends.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:39.600
Friends and family are around for a reason. You know all those times you've had to console your loved ones when they've been in a rough place?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.140
Now it's time for payback.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.680
True friends are people who love and support you, no matter what.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.720
You deserve their time and attention and shouldn't be afraid to reach out and ask for it.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.380
Spend weekends reconnecting with your parents, grandparents, and siblings.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.080
Too often, we take family for granted, so this a great chance to sneak in some home cooked meals and show your family that you care.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.860
Not only that, consider volunteering to help others. This also lets you go out and meet new people.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.660
You'll make new friends, and, possibly, a new love interest.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.680
Number five: move on.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.540
It's not uncommon for two people to break up and want to remain friends, but the most important thing you can do is distance yourself from that person.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.500
If that means taking a month-long vacation to New Mexico, so be it.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.200
Don't text, call, or email them. What you both need at this point is space.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.260
Break ups create emotional wounds, and if you are in constant contact with your ex, you will never give yourself the time you need to heal.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.520
After the healing process, go out and meet new people.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.220
There's some truth to the old adage: the best way to get over someone is to get under someone.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.560
Join Tinder, or some other dating and go out.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.900
You're sure to meet someone new, someone you can connect to on a deeper level.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.760
Break ups are difficult, but they aren't the end of the world.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.300
In fact, they're the start of something new and better.
