00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here I introduce to you to a web page rendered by the web browser

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we'll have built by the end of the class.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this problem, we asked you to generate the HTML that creates this page.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A skill in becoming a computer scientist and a programer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is the ability to look up information on your own.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We ask you to look up a few of the tags that are used here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and figure out how they apply in order to generate this page.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will briefly go over the tags that are used to generate various parts of the page,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and then I'll quickly show you the HTML as a finished product.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Every web page begins with and ends with HTML tags.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To use the level 1 heading, we had H1 tags.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We created paragraphs using the P tag and we had two paragraphs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We created this unordered list--unordered because each item in the list

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is just a bullet and not a number using the UL tag.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Each item in the list begins with an LI tag--standing for list item.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Within the list item, we can have another list, in this case it's an ordered list,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is define using the OL tag--standing for ordered list.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In each item, like in the unordered list is defined with an LI tag.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And now we have most of the structure for these webpage, I want to go back

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and highlight a few instances of tags that change how the page looks.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
For bold, we use B tags, for italics we use I,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and there is also small and big tags that change how large or small the font size is.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We can change how the font looks with TT tags.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One last thing to note for changing how the text looks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is the strong and emphasized tag elements.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We use the strong instead of the bold when we want to describe the meaning of the text

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
oppose to the formatting of the text.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We went over how hyperlinks works in class but as a reminder

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we put the text of the link in between two anchor tags,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and we set the target as the hyperlink reference.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
For an image, we use the IMG tag as the source of the image,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
as a URL, or relative pass to the image.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In this case, we've defined cs26.png, the same directory as this page is being rendered.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
For details like that, we recommend that you check out Steve Hoffman's class cs253.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now, to look at the finish products, let's go quickly to the ID.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Here I have the finished HTML and it should look strongly similar

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to what we worked out together with just the output.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Keep in mind that the HTML that you created can look different in many, many ways

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for reasons such as different white space and things like new line spaces, etc.

00:02:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
while the output of the HTML page looks the same.
