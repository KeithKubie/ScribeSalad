Vsauce! This is your home for some of the
coolest creations from everyday people. This

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.380
is BiDiPi.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.950
Three separate Czech companies have come together
to create the world's first fully capable

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.080
flying bicycle. Using what looks like a mountain
bike frame, and two large turbine fans, they're

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.240
able to create enough lift for 5 minutes of
flight with a test dummy on board. The idea

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.039
stems from a famous Czech comic strip character
named Jan Tlesklac, who was always trying

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.019
to create a flying bicycle.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.949
Inspired by Dutch engineer and sculptor Theo
Jansen, Jason Allenman built this unique variation

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.549
of a Strandbeest sculpture out of Lego. A
Strandbeest, which means Beach Beast in Dutch,

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:44.519
is a large animal-like sculpture made out
of lightweight materials. They're propelled

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.829
by wind and have a distinctive style of motion
defined by their many spindly legs. Jason's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.769
motorized LEGO version is a walking steam
punk inspired fortress, complete with working

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.420
windows and doors.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.670
Handcrafted from high density plywood, mahogany
veneer, solid brass trim, and glass, Colin

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.009
Johnson's the Emperor's Cabinet is a wet bar
built to look like an AT-AT walker from Star

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.890
Wars. It's currently on display in Vancouver
at the Hot Art, Wet City gallery for their

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.520
May LaForge be with You exhibition, which
focuses on art based on Star Wars and Star

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.060
Trek.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
Anthony Howe is a sculptor who builds intricate,
wind powered metal sculptures. About Face

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.289
is his examination of the human face, and
is built from copper and stainless steel.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.700
At almost 7 1/2 feet tall, About Face is made
up of 100 individually balanced and weighted

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.429
copper panels - some free swinging and others
articulated by spinning stainless cups. As

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.439
wind interacts with the sculpture, it creates
a hypnotic, surreal effect of changing expressions

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.829
and distorted symmetry.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.960
AMMO is a photo series by artist Sabine Pearlman
that reveals the inner workings of various

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.389
pieces of ammunition. The series was shot
on a WWII era bunker in Switzerland. He believes

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.329
that the intricate beautiful nature of the
form inside the ammunition is so vastly different

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.200
than the destructive purpose of the object.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.140
Artist Kode Logic created "Iron Mash" a series
of prints that mix Iron man with a variety

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.610
of other fictional characters including Darth
Vader, Superman, Wolverine, and Predator.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:31.549
And now for the book paintings of Ekaterina
Panikanova

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.010
Evolution is a project from Tyler Rhodes that
was made to teach people about evolution and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.870

of 5 groups of people and 460 drawings. This

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.090
one is from the Patrick Henry School of Science
and Art and is made out of around 100 of their

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.349
handmade creatures.
