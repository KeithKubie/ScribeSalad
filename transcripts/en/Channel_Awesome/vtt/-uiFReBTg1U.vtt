00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.940
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
Y’know, I was walking down the aisles of the video store the other day,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.120
and I noticed something I haven’t seen in years:

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.640
Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.060
Immediately, a pool of disappointing memories came flooding back to me,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.720
and I just knew I had to see this piece of shit again.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.380
Now for those of you who don’t remember this special, I’ll give you the skinny:

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.120
In the early 90s, ABC said they were gonna do a half-hour special featuring kids’ favorite cartoons.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.820
You name it: Duck Tales, Chipmunks, Looney Tunes, Ninja Turtles, the works.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
When you’re a kid, this is the equivalent of, like, Elvis meets the Beatles.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
I mean, the world could just explode right there.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.020
So for weeks, we’d been waiting in anticipation, and finally, the big day came.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.940
It was Saturday morning, all the kids are up, and we’re hyped as hell.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.340
And who do they get to start off this groundbreaking event?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.580
None other than the GODDAMN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HIMSELF.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.020
Oh my God, George Bush is starting this thing off!

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.640
Oh my God… George Bush is starting this thing off.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.100
That can’t be good…

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.220
He goes on and on about how listening to your parents is important and about how to maintain the American family.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.940
But when you’re a kid hyped up as hell, all you can hear is:

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.180
BLAH BLAH BLAH, I’M AN OLD PERSON,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.940
BLAH BLAH BLAH, I’M KEEPING YOU FROM YOUR CARTOONS,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.360
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.480
So after he’s done blabbing, the show finally begins.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.120
And it’s just like the commercials say.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.100
Everybody’s there!

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.900
The Smurfs, Ghostbusters, Garfield, Alf… for some reason.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.040
I don’t know, maybe he snuck in the back, I dunno.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.200
But bottom line, everybody’s there. It’s unbelievable. It’s a dream come true.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.060
So, now that all our favorite cartoon characters are together in one spot, what are they gonna talk about?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.260
Simon:
Marijuana.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.460
...

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.980
…Scusi?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.240
Simon:
Marijuana.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.420
Di—

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380
Did Simon of the Chipmunks just say “marijuana”?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.540
Wh—what would possess Simon of the Chipmunks to say “marijuana”?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.360
No, no no no no, this—this has gotta be some kind of mistake.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.460
It—it can’t be the same marijuana we’re thinking of.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.500
Simon:
An unlawful substance used to experience artificial highs.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960
Oh my God…

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.560
Wh—

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.200
Why is Simon of the Chipmunks talking about marijuana?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640
Wh—what kind of a slap in the face is that?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.980
I mean, Simon shouldn’t know what marijuana is!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.160
Simon is one of the embodiments of childhood! He’s from Alvin and the Chipmunks, for crying out loud!

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.040
Jesus, I feel so dirty!

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.600
Simon of the Chipmunks just said marijuana!

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.500
Is there any other American icon that can smash the foundations of my childhood any quicker?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.340
Bugs:
What’s this? A joint?

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.240
*smack*

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.120
WHY DOES BUGS BUNNY KNOW WHAT A JOINT IS?!

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.280
Bugs Bunny shouldn’t know what a joint is!

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.140
If Bugs Bunny knows what a joint is, that means he knows what drugs are!

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.500
If Bugs Bunny knows what drugs are,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.520
that means the rest of the Looney Tunes know what drugs are!

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.600
And if the rest of the Looney Tunes know what drugs are,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.240
well, that…

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.920
JUST EXPLAINS TOO GODDAMN MUCH!!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320
Hoo…

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.320
So, if you haven’t put it together yet:

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.060
All our favorite cartoon characters, that we grew up with,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.100
are coming together… to talk to US about…

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.380
…drugs.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420
This is going to be a long half-hour.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.000
So it turns out the special’s not even about the cartoon characters.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.020
It’s about a little twerp named Michael, who has a stinkin’ drug problem.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.640
He sinks to a new low when he steals his sister Corey’s piggy bank.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.060
He uses it to get more drugs, which he hides in a box that he keeps under his bed.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.080
And what exactly does he keep in that box?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.100
A Silly Putty egg, four turds, and two cinnamon buns glued together.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.260
Because hey, he was high, and he thought it was a good idea at the time.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.120
Corey thinks about telling her father, but he’s too busy being an alcoholic…

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.000
…and gay… and the Brawny Man.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
To make matters worse, Michael is followed around by this obnoxious puff of smoke, voiced by George C. Scott.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.360
Smoke:
Hey, he needed me! All his cares went… poof.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.620
Okay, that was lame.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620
But I like his next speech a whole lot better:

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.520
(VO from “Patton”):
This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.520
The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality…

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.100
…don’t know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating!

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.360
Now THAT’S a puff of smoke I can follow!

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.460
Garfield:
Bizarre.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.080
But tell me, where did this slippery slope of marijuana abuse begin?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.780
Well, luckily, Bugs Bunny has a time machine that’s able to show us.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.080
Bugs:
Heheh, I borrowed it from some coyote.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.340
*wah-wah*

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.060
We find out that Michael just wanted to fit in, and that’s why he started smoking marijuana in the first place.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.760
And once you listen to how he talks, can you really blame him?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.700
Michael:
You guys cruisin’ for lung cancer, or what?

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800
Somebody give that kid a joint!

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.020
After that, we get some more narc speeches from the Ninja Turtles, Duck Tales, and the Muppet Babies.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.100
Because when I think drug abuse, *oh yeah* I think Muppet Babies.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.720
Baby Kermit:
ABANDON BRAIN!

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.680
Now after some long-winded speeches, the characters get together and they do the most logical thing they can think of:

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.340
They have an intervention.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.640
With an Alan Menken song.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.380
♪There’s a million wild and wonderful ways to say no!♪

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.020
Ah-choo! Guess I’m allergic.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.500
♪And a good excuse is something you never outgrow♪

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.980
It’s bad for my complexion!

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.640
♪Go on, push eject, protect yourself♪

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.720
♪Get up and gooo!♪

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.280
Those drugs are so boring!

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.460
*make it stop*

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.880
♪There’s a million zillion wonderful ways to say—♪

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.040
*BLAM*

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.740
If you survived your suicide attempt, the special ends pretty much as you would imagine it:

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.240
Michael gets off the drugs, he makes up with his sister, the puff of smoke disappears,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.280
and his attentive parents are none the wiser.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.880
So, what kind of message are kids supposed to get from this special?

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.700
That if they smoke weed, all their favorite cartoon characters will appear?

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.980
Yeah, that’s a top-notch moral right there.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.560
Alvin:
Is he kidding?

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.700
And if you don’t get off the drugs, these suckers get violent!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.760
In fact, I was shocked at how cruel some of these cartoon characters really are. I mean, look at this:

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.800
They lock people in burning buildings, run them over with a roller coaster,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.080
blow ‘em up, drown them.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.160
Even Winnie the Pooh gets his ass handed to him.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.100
Pooh:
BOTHEEEEEER!

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.720
Jesus, these suckers are mean!

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.580
Baby Piggy:
GYAAAAAH! *crack*

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.060
Another problem I have with this special is that everybody cries at the drop of a hat.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.400
Watch:

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.200
*CinemaSins ding*

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.020
You see?

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.720
So, okay, what exactly are these cartoon characters trying to tell us?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.680
There’s nothing cool about a fool on drugs!

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.300
*hat magically reappears*

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.540
Eh, fair enough, I guess. So the next time that you—

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.100
What’s up, doc, is your life, if you don’t cut it out!

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.180
Okay—

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.540
You’re excellent just the way you are!

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.220
Got it!

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.400
We don’t always see things the way they are.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.940
Okay, I—

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.860
Just believe in yourself!

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.440
Well, I—

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.500
We care about you!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.300
Well, maybe—

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.100
Everyone’s got problems, kid.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.660
Yeah—

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.080
Why don’t you just say no?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.620
Got it—

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.540
You gotta believe in yourself!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.360
Would you shut up?

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
Listen to us!

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.080
Yeah, I heard you—

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.720
You use, you lose!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.080
OKAY! GOD!

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.040
You know, I thought this would be really cool, but you know what? This really blows!

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.020
All my cartoon characters are fuckin’ narcs!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.300
I mean for crying out loud, how many times do you have to hammer this shit in?

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.600
If everyone was jumpin’ off a cliff, would you go too?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.280
Maybe after seeing this shit!

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.220
I mean for crying out loud, do you know what the irony is?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.800
I think that most of these cartoon characters were on drugs long before this special ever came out.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.780
I mean, look at it:

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.140
Garfield’s always hungry, Pooh’s happy as hell,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.920
Daffy’s hyped up on speed, and Michelangelo—well, listen to him!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.760
Your brain must be, like, REALLY messed up!

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.900
I even think our beloved President smoked a doobie before he came out. I mean, look at him!

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.200
He’s looking at Barbara’s head like it’s a giant cheeseburger!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.240
*sigh*

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.080
Maybe I’m being too harsh on this special.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.860
After all, they are trying to get across a very moral lesson.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.120
Drugs aren’t your pal, pal! They’re your enemy!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.100
A very sound point. Any objections?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.120
I make ‘em feel good!

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.660
He’s got me there!

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.420
