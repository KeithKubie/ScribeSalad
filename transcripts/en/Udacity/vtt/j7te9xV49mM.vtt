00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.706
Alright. Let's take out the words that accurately fill

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:05.480
on this concept map. Here in lesson four we

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.920
learned that the human genome can be divided between

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.725
the non-coding DNA and the protein coding DNA. The

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:16.670
non-coding DNA represents about 98% of our genome whereas

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.270
protein coding DNA represents about 2%. No matter how

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.600
you divide it you've got two copies of the

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.970
human genome in every cell. Now non coding DNA includes

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.430
three main types of non coding sequence

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.320
that we discussed. One type was a promoter.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.930
Another type was an enhancer. Now enhancers are

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.090
bound by activators. So that's how we knew

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.760
enhancers went here instead of here. You know

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.890
that if promoters and enhancers are two of

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.590
the types, then the third type are silencers.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.020
Silencers are bound by repressors and activators and

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.810
repressors are types of transcription factors.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.050
Transcription factors specifically bind around the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.000
TATA sequence. Which is essential to drive initiation of transcription via the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.620
promoter. So everything in this lesson

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.930
really centers around the promoter sequence.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.910
Because the promoter is the main

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.250
effective non-coding DNA region that regulates transcription

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.960
of a protein coding gene. Now, transcription

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.030
factors generally are proteins that bind any regulatory

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.830
region of DNA. Activators and repressors are

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.080
very specific types that bind certain regions like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.540
enhancers that promote transcription initiation via promoters

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.560
and repressors that bind silencers which silence or

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.530
inhibit Transcription from a promoter region. But no

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.260
matter what promoters sit in front of protein

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.380
coding genes, which are essentially the divisions

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.320
of protein coding DNA here. Now our

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.590
transcription factors that bind regulatory regions of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.260
DNA thus regulate the expression of protein

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.810
coding DNA. Or genes. We also learn very specifically that, just like in lesson

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.110
three, that different sequences of protein coding

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.259
DNA can be called alleles. The same

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.280
is true for non coding DNA. We can

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.860
have different sequences called alleles, and these all

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.900
originate from mutations which we'll learn about more

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.740
in lesson six. Overall, In the human genome

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.650
both protein-coding DNA, even though it represents only

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.530
about 2% or less, or non-coding DNA, which

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890
represents the vast majority of our genome, they

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.400
work together to specify thousands of different cell types.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.770
And together these are organized by the process of development that makes

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.780
us Who we are, all of our complexity, all of our traits.
