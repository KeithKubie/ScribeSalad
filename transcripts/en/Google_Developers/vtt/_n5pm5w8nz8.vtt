COLT MCANLIS: If you're a
developer who finds that

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.540
you're pushing the edges of
the web platform, you're

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.790
really butting up against what
is sort of available with our

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.640
tooling chain, and what the
web and the W3C, and the

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.210
specs, and the standards bodies
are exposing, and it's

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.770
hampering you from really
realizing the vision of what

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.360
you have for your product, you
should be at this conference.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.500
Because we want to hear your
voice about what's going on in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.710
your company and how we
can make it a reality.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.540
This is going to be one of the
first times where we're trying

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.120
to get the managers and the
engineers who are writing the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.250
Chrome code in the same room
with the people who are using

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.170
our platform.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.360
And so it's really important
that developers actually show

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.730
up with a sense of what they
want to get out of that

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.490
conversation.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.840
So come with your bug list.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540
Come with performance repos.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.190
Come expecting that you can
sit down with the product

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.460
manager of Chrome and tell him
exactly what he's doing wrong

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.110
in his day to day
job and why that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.950
matters to you as a developer.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.050
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.410
And at Chrome Dev Summit, I'm
going to be giving a talk

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.050
that's going to overview
everything you need to know to

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.710
become a performance ninja,
using Chrome dev tools for

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.110
your web applications.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.860
Come find me.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.980
I want to talk to you.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.710
I want to hear about the
problems you're having with

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.330
performance and what I can
do to make your web

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.580
application a success.
