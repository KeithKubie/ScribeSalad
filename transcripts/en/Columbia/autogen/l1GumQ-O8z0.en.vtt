or three papers together and decided
 

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.160
or three papers together and decided
that we should really get serious sent

and plot out six chapters or so and
 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.949
and plot out six chapters or so and
create a book and then over the last I

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959
create a book and then over the last I

that's what we did so there's really

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000
that's what we did so there's really
 

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.640
that's what we did so there's really
four elements that we thought quite

industrialization processes begin and
 

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.330
industrialization processes begin and
spread and so one of our arguments is

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:13.340

variations within a unit from those
 

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.820
variations within a unit from those
variations between units clearly there's

is that Europe has fragmented political

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.020
is that Europe has fragmented political
 

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.690
is that Europe has fragmented political
boundaries so the the difficulty of

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700
boundaries so the the difficulty of
 

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.250
boundaries so the the difficulty of
thinking about economic problems within

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260
thinking about economic problems within
 

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.060
thinking about economic problems within
political units becomes a challenge what

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:53.070
political units becomes a challenge what
 

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.680

is international trade in Europe is

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:54.690
is international trade in Europe is
 

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.750
is international trade in Europe is
simply trade within the Empire in China

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760
simply trade within the Empire in China
 

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.670
simply trade within the Empire in China
but what we observe and what people have

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:01.680
but what we observe and what people have
 

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.110
but what we observe and what people have
known for a long time is that in early

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120
known for a long time is that in early
 

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.930

modern Europe trade across Europe was

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940
modern Europe trade across Europe was
 

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.480
modern Europe trade across Europe was
largely informal that is to say there

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:08.490
largely informal that is to say there
 

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.270

was a inability to enforce contracts

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280
was a inability to enforce contracts
 

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.550
was a inability to enforce contracts
formally at long distance China had this

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560
formally at long distance China had this
 

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.560
formally at long distance China had this
was not international trade in China but

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:18.570
was not international trade in China but
 

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.570
was not international trade in China but
it was also long-distance trade and we

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580
it was also long-distance trade and we
 

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.010
it was also long-distance trade and we
discovered long distance trade it was

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020
discovered long distance trade it was
 

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.490
discovered long distance trade it was
also informal there was the the relative

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500
also informal there was the the relative
 

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.520
also informal there was the the relative
importance of formal contract and as the

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:28.530
importance of formal contract and as the
 

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.910
importance of formal contract and as the
source of formal adjudication was also

00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:31.920
source of formal adjudication was also
 

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:37.850
source of formal adjudication was also
fairly small so we this observation then

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:37.860
fairly small so we this observation then
 

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.130
fairly small so we this observation then
led us to say all right so how do we

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:40.140
led us to say all right so how do we
 

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.830
led us to say all right so how do we
model this how do you actually sort of

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:42.840
model this how do you actually sort of
 

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.750
model this how do you actually sort of
explain what we're likely to find

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760
explain what we're likely to find
 

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.550
explain what we're likely to find
historically is there a parsimonious way

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560
historically is there a parsimonious way
 

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.910
historically is there a parsimonious way
to explain this so we ended up designing

00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:49.920
to explain this so we ended up designing
 

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.590
to explain this so we ended up designing
that we would just think about two

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:51.600
that we would just think about two
 

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.920
that we would just think about two
factors the frequency of transactions

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:54.930
factors the frequency of transactions
 

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:57.280
factors the frequency of transactions
and the distance between the two parties

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.290
and the distance between the two parties
 

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:01.810
and the distance between the two parties
transacting so the the graph on the left

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:01.820
transacting so the the graph on the left
 

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.390
transacting so the the graph on the left
has the the value of the payment on the

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400
has the the value of the payment on the
 

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.040
has the the value of the payment on the
vertical axis and has the distance

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.050
vertical axis and has the distance
 

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.930
vertical axis and has the distance
between the borrower and lender this is

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940
between the borrower and lender this is
 

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.180
between the borrower and lender this is
a credit issue the way we'd this is a

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.190
a credit issue the way we'd this is a
 

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.130
a credit issue the way we'd this is a
slide that shows credit on the

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140
slide that shows credit on the
 

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.280
slide that shows credit on the
horizontal axis so the blue line that

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:16.290
horizontal axis so the blue line that
 

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.400
horizontal axis so the blue line that
stays fixed is the value of the loan and

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.410
stays fixed is the value of the loan and
 

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.490
stays fixed is the value of the loan and
the red line that rises is the cost of

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500
the red line that rises is the cost of
 

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.170
the red line that rises is the cost of
enforcing that contra the loan agreement

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:26.180
enforcing that contra the loan agreement
 

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.270
enforcing that contra the loan agreement
that's and the and the intuition of this

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280
that's and the and the intuition of this
 

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.580
that's and the and the intuition of this
is the further apart the borrower and

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:31.590
is the further apart the borrower and
 

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.980
is the further apart the borrower and
lender the higher the cost of enforcing

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:33.990
lender the higher the cost of enforcing
 

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:37.400
lender the higher the cost of enforcing
the loan and beyond a certain in a court

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:37.410
the loan and beyond a certain in a court
 

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.410
the loan and beyond a certain in a court
formally and so beyond a certain

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420
formally and so beyond a certain
 

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.790
formally and so beyond a certain
distance you're not going to rely on

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800
distance you're not going to rely on
 

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.580
distance you're not going to rely on
formal institutions like courts you're

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:43.590
formal institutions like courts you're
 

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.800
formal institutions like courts you're
going to have to enforce these

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:45.810
going to have to enforce these
 

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.020
going to have to enforce these
agreements in some other way so that's

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:48.030
agreements in some other way so that's
 

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.329
agreements in some other way so that's
the issue of

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:49.339
the issue of
 

00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:52.789
the issue of
on the right side is issue of frequency

00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:52.799
on the right side is issue of frequency
 

00:35:52.799 --> 00:35:54.519
on the right side is issue of frequency
of transactions or the time between

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:54.529
of transactions or the time between
 

00:35:54.529 --> 00:35:57.859
of transactions or the time between
transactions here the again the the

00:35:57.859 --> 00:35:57.869
transactions here the again the the
 

00:35:57.869 --> 00:36:01.400
transactions here the again the the
horizontal blue line is the value that

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:01.410
horizontal blue line is the value that
 

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.029
horizontal blue line is the value that
someone receives if he cheats right now

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:05.039
someone receives if he cheats right now
 

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:07.880
someone receives if he cheats right now
and gets away with it and the red line

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:07.890
and gets away with it and the red line
 

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:15.229
and gets away with it and the red line
is essentially you you get you get 10

00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:15.239
is essentially you you get you get 10
 

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:18.259
is essentially you you get you get 10
units of value from each transaction but

00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:18.269
units of value from each transaction but
 

00:36:18.269 --> 00:36:21.529
units of value from each transaction but
what happens then is the frequency of

00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:21.539
what happens then is the frequency of
 

00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:25.579
what happens then is the frequency of
transactions changes so that the more

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:25.589
transactions changes so that the more
 

00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:27.019
transactions changes so that the more
transactions you have that it's the

00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:27.029
transactions you have that it's the
 

00:36:27.029 --> 00:36:29.779
transactions you have that it's the
closer you are to the origin the more

00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:29.789
closer you are to the origin the more
 

00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:32.809
closer you are to the origin the more
value you get and it's actually worth it

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:32.819
value you get and it's actually worth it
 

00:36:32.819 --> 00:36:35.569
value you get and it's actually worth it
to you not to cheat but the less

00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579
to you not to cheat but the less
 

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:41.140
to you not to cheat but the less
frequent your transactions then in fact

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:41.150
frequent your transactions then in fact
 

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.569
frequent your transactions then in fact
cheating is a it turns out to be a good

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:44.579
cheating is a it turns out to be a good
 

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:46.939
cheating is a it turns out to be a good
idea and and the issue is how does

00:36:46.939 --> 00:36:46.949
idea and and the issue is how does
 

00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:50.650
idea and and the issue is how does
reputation keep you from cheating and

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:50.660
reputation keep you from cheating and
 

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.699
reputation keep you from cheating and
you're going to have to choose one of

00:36:52.699 --> 00:36:52.709
you're going to have to choose one of
 

00:36:52.709 --> 00:36:55.430
you're going to have to choose one of
these mechanisms as basically being more

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440
these mechanisms as basically being more
 

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.759
these mechanisms as basically being more
effective than the other that's so the

00:36:58.759 --> 00:36:58.769
effective than the other that's so the
 

00:36:58.769 --> 00:37:01.009
effective than the other that's so the
intuition is that that whether you

00:37:01.009 --> 00:37:01.019
intuition is that that whether you
 

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:03.380
intuition is that that whether you
choose formal or informal mechanisms is

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:03.390
choose formal or informal mechanisms is
 

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.799
choose formal or informal mechanisms is
a function of distance and time so let

00:37:06.799 --> 00:37:06.809
a function of distance and time so let
 

00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:09.380
a function of distance and time so let
me I'll fill this in more imperior give

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:09.390
me I'll fill this in more imperior give
 

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.479
me I'll fill this in more imperior give
you examples of this first a simple two

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:11.489
you examples of this first a simple two
 

00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:14.209
you examples of this first a simple two
by two table we say that if the distance

00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:14.219
by two table we say that if the distance
 

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:17.390
by two table we say that if the distance
is closer than a certain distance it's

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400
is closer than a certain distance it's
 

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.279
is closer than a certain distance it's
easier to enforce contracts through

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:19.289
easier to enforce contracts through
 

00:37:19.289 --> 00:37:22.549
easier to enforce contracts through
courts and you're especially likely to

00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:22.559
courts and you're especially likely to
 

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:24.559
courts and you're especially likely to
do that if the frequency with which you

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:24.569
do that if the frequency with which you
 

00:37:24.569 --> 00:37:26.900
do that if the frequency with which you
do these things is infrequent so that

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:26.910
do these things is infrequent so that
 

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.880

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:24.510
informal mechanisms more fully in an
 

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.720
informal mechanisms more fully in an
earlier stage than Europeans did and

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:26.730
earlier stage than Europeans did and
 

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.180
earlier stage than Europeans did and
therefore the capacity of informal

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:29.190
therefore the capacity of informal
 

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.370
therefore the capacity of informal
mechanisms to work well we'll cover more

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380
mechanisms to work well we'll cover more
 

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.310
mechanisms to work well we'll cover more
cases than it will in Europe conversely

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320
cases than it will in Europe conversely
 

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.710
cases than it will in Europe conversely
because Europeans develop formal

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720
because Europeans develop formal
 

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.960
because Europeans develop formal
institutions that is courts and

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:38.970
institutions that is courts and
 

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:42.290
institutions that is courts and
contracts in larger numbers earlier on

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.300
contracts in larger numbers earlier on
 

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.540
contracts in larger numbers earlier on
that is to deal with kinds of

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:44.550
that is to deal with kinds of
 

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.030
that is to deal with kinds of
transactions closer at hand they were

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040
transactions closer at hand they were
 

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.310
transactions closer at hand they were
because they had developed these they

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320
because they had developed these they
 

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.690
because they had developed these they
could extend them

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700
could extend them
 

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.170
could extend them
more easily so the extension of the

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180
more easily so the extension of the
 

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.849
more easily so the extension of the
kinds of institutions you initially

00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859
kinds of institutions you initially
 

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:58.609
kinds of institutions you initially
develop covers space coming from either

00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619

direction Chinese are more likely to use
 

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.640
direction Chinese are more likely to use
certain kinds of informal institutions

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:01.650
certain kinds of informal institutions
 

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:04.690
certain kinds of informal institutions
in areas where either could be used and

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:04.700
in areas where either could be used and
 

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.000
in areas where either could be used and
Europeans are more likely to use formal

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.010
Europeans are more likely to use formal
 

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.109
Europeans are more likely to use formal
that's essentially what these

00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119
that's essentially what these
 

00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:13.700
that's essentially what these
inequalities express in sort of a

notional form so what we're trying to do
 

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.270
notional form so what we're trying to do
is give it an explanation for how China

develops earlier in China and develops

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700
develops earlier in China and develops
 

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.660

to a greater degree the use of informal

to a greater degree the use of informal
 

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.880
to a greater degree the use of informal
institutions is going to have more

potential for extension that it does in

potential for extension that it does in
 

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.680
potential for extension that it does in
in Europe and the converse the converse

in Europe in terms of formal
 

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.760
in Europe in terms of formal
institutions and what this means then as

unwillingness to provide formal
 

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:14.680
unwillingness to provide formal
institutions in China is not a sign that

informal will always prevail in China it

informal will always prevail in China it
 

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.079

becoming more formal that's one of the

if you have informal institutions you

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300
if you have informal institutions you
 

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.210
if you have informal institutions you
never get rid of them unless you just

never get rid of them unless you just
 

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.670
never get rid of them unless you just
sort of blow them up and import formal

sort of blow them up and import formal
 

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.000
sort of blow them up and import formal
institutions from abroad but rather

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:58.010

and that it in both China and Europe we

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680
and that it in both China and Europe we
 

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.860
and that it in both China and Europe we
can see the relevance of both formal and

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:08.870
can see the relevance of both formal and
 

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.340
can see the relevance of both formal and
informal institutions so the takeaway

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:12.350
informal institutions so the takeaway
 

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.800
informal institutions so the takeaway
