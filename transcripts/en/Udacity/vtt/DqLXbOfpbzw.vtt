00:00:00.668 --> 00:00:03.500
One explanation for missing data is that something maybe

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.340
failing occasionally when collecting your data. For example, if

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.310
you were conducting a traditional door to door survey,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.780
maybe the person handling the documents looses a few, or

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.149
tends to miss some streets at random because they

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.950
don't know the geography of your town very well.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.200
This is a case of a researcher or collection

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.900
technique causing missing data. The offline example of someone conducting

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.270
a traditional door-to-door survey can easily be translated to

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.470
the digital world. Imagine your data collection software fails one

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.910
out of every 1,000 times, or you have a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.950
couple of service outages. You could have similar data loss.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.590
If this were to happen in our baseball player

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.680
data set, we might see some missing values here and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.880
there, just because we made some error in collecting

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.000
them at random. Another more harmful reason values may be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.160
missing is referred to as non response. In

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.550
the case of non response, a certain subset of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.890
people chooses not to answer particular questions. Or

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.560
don't respond at all. This can lead to biases

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.690
in your data and consequently, false conclusions. In

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.220
the case of baseball data, say we were interested

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.710
in the batting average of players. Maybe, since

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.060
they're, I don't know, self-conscious about their batting average.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.510
All outfielders just don't provide a value. This would

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.700
make our results inaccurate and lead us to conclude

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.950
that the average batting average was 312 even though

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.530
that is based only one data point here, Derek Jeter's.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.420
The important point here is this, if the missing

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.160
values from your data are distributed at random. Your

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.970
data may still be representative of the population. However,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.630
if values are missing systematically, it could invalidate your findings.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.410
It's important to design your experiment or

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.940
data collection method to minimize these effects. Beyond

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.480
this, it's very important to check your data to see if such effects are present.
