00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.007
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.670
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.780
I'm Harry Kreisler of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.417
the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.740
Our guest today is Ralph J. Cicerone,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.436
who is the president of the
National Academy of Sciences

00:00:56.436 --> 00:00:59.341
and chair of the National
Research Council.

00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.300
His research in atmospheric
chemistry, climate change,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.640
and energy has involved
him in shaping science

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.730
and environmental policy
at the highest levels,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.720
nationally and internationally.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.280
Dr. Cicerone served as
chancellor of UC Irvine

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.140
from 1998 to 2005.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
He is the 2016 Hitchcock
lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.710
Dr. Cicerone, welcome to our program.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.730
- Thanks and good morning.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.090
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.560
- Western Pennsylvania,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.834
a little city called New
Castle, Pennsylvania.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.321
I stayed there till I
was about 18 years old.

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:38.970
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.883
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.403
- It was a close family.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.055
Not worldly in that sense.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.540
It was a close family,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.276
second generation of Italian immigrants,

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.090
so there tended to be an
extended nuclear family.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
Very warm, lots of
wonderful aunts and uncles.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.920
I would say family-centered.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.992
So not much thinking about
the outside world actually.

00:02:02.992 --> 00:02:06.724
- And when did you get the science bug?

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:11.090
In high school or earlier
or was it later in college?

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.600
- It was later.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.420
I was not a, I guess what
you'd call a science fair

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.540
kind of a kid.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.810
I didn't do that kind of thing.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.110
I was all about sports, athletics,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.503
anything that was in
season that's what I did.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.329
The school was not very challenging,

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.030
the schools where I went.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.293
So I was able to make it through
without too much studying.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.150
- And you were a baseball player,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.050
back then or was it later?

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.780
- Both, both and football
and basketball and golf.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.319
Just anything that was in season.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.220
So that's what I loved and
it wasn't till I went away

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.737
to college that I learned at all about

00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:51.300
what it was like to learn
and what college meant.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.398
Even later than that I began
to hear about graduate degrees,

00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:57.512
which I had no inkling of what they were.

00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.360
- And looking back, what
do you think you learned

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.664
from sports that may have impacted

00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:05.570
your later career in science?

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.073
- I think quite a bit.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.710
Assessing one's owns
strengths and weaknesses

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.166
and realizing that you can
compensate for some of those

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:20.340
with teammates and help each other out.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.555
Then, I'm making this up now but,

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:26.460
just thinking back, the
idea of meeting challenges

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.110
and that it's not always gonna be easy.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.652
That was good for me to learn. (laughs)

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:33.340
- And then you went to MIT?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.400
- I did.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.681
- And at MIT what did you major in?

00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:38.640
- Electrical engineering.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.400
It wasn't what I started out thinking,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.831
but at the time, electrical
engineering was just

00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:47.363
very, a sweeping kind
of a subject involving

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:50.632
mathematics and physics
and it had a reputation

00:03:50.632 --> 00:03:54.150
for being hard and that it was important.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.711
It was attracting students
left and right at MIT.

00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.741
So I didn't really know what I was doing.

00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:01.010
I had a little bit of
interest in chemistry,

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.690
but I didn't like the first
year's chemistry at all.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.590
So I just moved immediately
into electrical engineering,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.969
which so many other students were doing.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.691
It turned out to be
exciting and challenging

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.590
and I had a hard time at first.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.352
I wasn't very well prepared.

00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:18.670
- But then you went on to graduate school

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.046
at the University of Illinois.

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:22.323
Undergraduate work was at MIT.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.400
So when did the change to
climate studies begin and why?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.320
Why did you move from
one field to the other?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.486
- That came much later.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:34.940
I didn't have much of a plan.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.330
I didn't know what careers meant.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.290
I went to college to be able to get a job.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.630
Western Pennsylvania,
when I grew up and still,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.083
has a lot of unemployment,
a lot of instability.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.590
So my idea of going to college
that no one in my family

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.305
had ever gone to college before.

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.830
So I didn't know what I was
doing and I thought it was

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.576
all about being employable.

00:04:57.576 --> 00:05:02.061
So going into engineering in
the wake of the Sputnik flights

00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:05.677
seems like a national priority
and a way to get a job

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:07.480
so that's what I did.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.900
It wasn't until, I think a
required research project

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.632
in my senior year at MIT,

00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:15.650
that I began to see that
there were other things

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.520
than just textbooks and
learning what somebody put

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.080
in front of you but a
more open ended challenge

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.580
of doing research.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.870
I really liked it.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.741
I spent so much time on
my senior research project

00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:30.670
and I probably really didn't achieve much,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.063
but I thought it did, it was fun.

00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:36.520
- When did you undertake climate studies?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.277
Was in late in graduate school?

00:05:38.277 --> 00:05:40.720
- Way after that.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.012
I finished a PhD in electrical engineering

00:05:43.012 --> 00:05:46.930
and the physics of
plasmas and got interested

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.773
or was assigned to work
on the earth's ionosphere.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.100
You know, you and I may look
old to some of our viewers,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.788
but this wasn't that long ago.

00:05:57.788 --> 00:06:00.090
But the world was different.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.360
To communicate, let's say,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.160
from the United States to
Australia around the world,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.950
we didn't have communications
satellites catching

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.770
these signals and relaying them.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.690
We had to shine beams

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.844
of radio transmission and reflect them

00:06:15.844 --> 00:06:20.150
off of the ionosphere, which
is a natural feature of nature,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.210
ionized gas and through those reflections

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.600
community around the world, for example.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.853
So this was important stuff,

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:30.320
commercially and even for the military.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.020
So it was an exciting
field and I began to learn

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.038
that a little bit about
the earth using these

00:06:36.038 --> 00:06:39.758
electromagnetic pulses
of energy, radio waves,

00:06:39.758 --> 00:06:42.845
to communicate around
the world and also to

00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:47.520
study this layer of ionized
material around the earth.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.968
That began to get me interested
in where the atmosphere

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:54.061
came from, where does this
air come that we breathe,

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:57.233
how does it remain so stable and so forth.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:02.948
Probably over the next
15 years I inched my way

00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:07.948
to climate change but I went
through the ozone layer.

00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:10.404
(laughs)

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.980
- I like to ask my guests...

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.110
We'll get back to your
research in a minute,

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.110
what they see as the skills
and temperament required

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.540
for doing what they do.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.080
So, to be a scientist,
how would you advise

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.625
or how should students think
about the skills they need

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.960
and the temperament to
do the work of science?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.330
- Well, the wisest advice
that everybody always says

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.471
is that you have to be as well prepared

00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:44.770
by learning the fundamentals
of serious subjects

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.462
like mathematics and physics
and chemistry and so forth

00:07:47.462 --> 00:07:51.240
and then by being prepared
you might be able to make

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:56.203
a leap that's based more on
intuition or imagination.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.553
I'm not sure I agree with that.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.690
I think a little bit of
everything is needed.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.394
Certainly some preparation and
doing well in one's studies

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:12.250
but it's very different
to study out of a book

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.580
and to pass an examination,
whether the examination

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.118
is a test of what you've learned

00:08:18.118 --> 00:08:21.759
or your readiness to move
on to something else.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.332
That's very different from
doing research, in my view.

00:08:25.332 --> 00:08:29.350
To step out into something
new without anything

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.410
to rely on is very different than it is

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.730
to simply reproduce something
that's already been done.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.130
But both skills are needed,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.650
so it's really a beautiful
pursuit, I think,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.070
because once again, you
realize that different human

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.240
qualities and attributes are needed.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.173
Perseverance is almost always required,

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:51.963
because you make mistakes.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.690
Instead of just kicking yourself
you have to hang in there.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.133
So perseverance is important.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.260
Preparation.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.100
There's two P's.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.833
I don't know what the third P would be.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.150
But I think incentive is really important,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.650
being interested in something.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.350
- Curiosity is important
because at one point

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.210
I read where you said that you

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.050
moved into climate sciences
because you thought

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.750
there were a lot of interesting
problems and discoveries

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.583
to be made.

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:27.180
- Yes and that was the
case when I first started

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.910
the research on the ozone layer too.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.500
So little was known that when
we finally plunged into it,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.130
we were able to make some
discoveries and some movement

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.010
forward because so little was known.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.030
So that's another thing
there are, perhaps,

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.755
two kinds of people who do this work.

00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:49.140
One is the type who wants
to be able to start off

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.620
in a library and read all
the background and what has

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.619
been tried, what has not
been tried and so forth

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:57.930
before moving forward.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.164
The other kind is perhaps more cavalier.

00:10:01.164 --> 00:10:05.540
Just jump into the
unknown and learn things

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.259
in kind of a back filling way.

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:10.436
Again, I think both kinds
of people are valuable.

00:10:10.436 --> 00:10:14.350
- To be the second kind, you
really have to be comfortable

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.160
with yourself and able
to deal with uncertainty

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.993
and criticism.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:20.943
- And maybe over confidence.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.330
Over confidence, right.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.710
Because as you know from what
we all know about history

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.783
of any endeavor,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.270
so many of the ideas that we think are new

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.660
turn out be old ideas and
if we just would have taken

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.710
the time to look into the history,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.370
we would have known that.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.560
But it's really fun to discover
something for yourself,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.730
even if it's not new.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.770
Even if you find out later
that you did something

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.480
that other people have already done,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.700
but you did it yourself
with nobody telling you

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.147
how to do it, that's fun.

00:10:55.147 --> 00:10:58.870
- A lot of times, you're
doing things that,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.877
in other words, calls into
question what your colleagues

00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:05.522
have been saying about a
particular subject matter.

00:11:05.522 --> 00:11:10.522
- Well that's true, even
today in scientific research.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.600
A scientist doesn't become respected

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.340
and the object of other
people's trying to imitate

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.723
if he or she simply repeats
what other people have done

00:11:23.723 --> 00:11:26.090
and gets the same answers.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.210
It's the breakthroughs
that show that something

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.450
has been missing or that
there's an important connection

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.975
that hasn't been made or a consequence.

00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:38.303
So that's what we all try
and it's pretty competitive.

00:11:40.245 --> 00:11:43.235
- I think I read somewhere
that you talked about,

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.620
what did you call it?

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.180
You called it the combination
of freedom and responsibility.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.930
So that in a way, you're asking a question

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.930
but it has to be tested
against the facts and reality

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.327
and that's very important.

00:12:01.327 --> 00:12:04.370
- I think this is one of
the biggest breakthroughs

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.510
in human pursuits of all kinds

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.170
the last several hundred
years, to be able to measure

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.050
something and compare with a reality

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.050
and that science really should have

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.890
some predictive capability as well.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.341
So when we think about
theories and implications,

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:26.010
we should be able to generate a prediction

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.530
that can then be verified or falsified.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.620
That's how we make progress.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.700
But it doesn't always
have to be so formal.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.823
Sometimes it's just a random walk.

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:44.800
- You make the point that
the beauty of science,

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.060
you touched on it a minute ago,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.270
is that it's self correcting.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:53.260
It's a system that where you
wind up correcting yourself

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.020
based on the facts because
of the question you've asked,

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.460
but also your colleagues

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.680
and people working in the field will also

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.740
be a test for you of the
validity of what you're saying.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.373
- And that's what makes
science progressive.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.040
But from a broader societal point of view,

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.010
that self correcting attribute of science

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.440
is really important.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.217
Sometimes we make mistakes,
but if it's an important

00:13:22.217 --> 00:13:26.261
area, for example a medical matter

00:13:26.261 --> 00:13:29.720
that has wide attention
people who are suffering

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.760
who are looking at the implications,

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.970
something important like that
with commercial applications

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.460
or security or

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.799
environmental, things like this,

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:46.080
anything that attracts
attention and if it's in error,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.122
it will be caught very soon.

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:52.750
So for example, the times
when people try to falsify

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.590
anything in science,
they're really very limited

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.750
because the odds are if
it's anything important

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.270
you're gonna get caught quickly.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.430
But of course the most
common type of error

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.960
is one that was unintentional.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.470
It could be because of
biases or it could because

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.049
just of a bad experiment
that wasn't done right.

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:14.570
But that self correcting
attribute of science

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.853
is really important from
a human point of view.

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:24.400
- When you think of science,
you think of maybe mistakenly,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.340
of somebody alone in a lab working away,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.680
but one of the interesting
things for you is

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.940
that it's not just doing the science,

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.612
the pure science and getting it right,

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:43.920
but also the implications
of that science for the way

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.050
we live in our environment.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.590
Talk a little about that
because that seems to have been

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.690
an important factor in
your motivations about

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.523
what you studied.

00:14:54.523 --> 00:14:55.683
- For me, yes.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.251
Not for everybody.

00:14:59.251 --> 00:15:03.140
There are some rare very
important scientists,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.009
whether they be economists
or mathematicians

00:15:06.009 --> 00:15:10.400
or physicists, who focus on

00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:16.250
a deep implication or some new
kind of test or measurement

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.360
that can be made that no one
else has ever done before

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.160
and no one else is interested in it.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.390
That kind of individual
progress is absolutely stunning

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.385
and it's necessary.

00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:33.385
Many other projects though,
do require group participation

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.250
and complimentary capabilities
that we can teach each other

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.637
but in the end, there may be
a group of people over there

00:15:41.637 --> 00:15:44.560
who are doing part of the
experiment that you and I

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.760
would never understand
but yet we need them.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.320
But the awareness of
implications, for example,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.064
societal or human, for
let's say the sustainability

00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:58.450
of the planet or whether
it's an economic consequence,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.564
this also drives a lot of scientists.

00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:05.230
To know that after all
those years of studying

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.730
and mastering a subject
they can now apply it

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.683
in some way that will have real
implications on real people.

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:18.500
Even there though, you have
this bifurcation again.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.630
You can do an experiment in a laboratory,

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.030
let's say in biology,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.879
that could understand a universal truth

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:28.509
that effects all organisms,
even though you weren't

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:31.350
interested in the implications at all

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.956
but it can still have these
sweeping implications.

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:37.990
Being aware of all these
implications though

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.073
is really important.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.740
- Talk a little about
creativity in science,

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.350
because you're going down

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.268
on a course, you've identified a problem,

00:16:47.268 --> 00:16:51.510
you're observing, getting
the data to disprove it,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.573
or prove what you're assuming.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.110
But then there's that eureka
moment when you see something

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.500
and open up a field.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.360
Talk a little about that.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.300
- That's really fun.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.030
It doesn't happen to
most of us very often,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.850
but when it does, it's
very self reinforcing.

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.556
I think part of it comes out
of self criticism though.

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:18.900
I remember in graduate
school toward the end of my

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.900
PhD work, I heard that one professor had

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.480
a kind of a metric or a
criterion, it was a man,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.900
that he used evaluating students.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.400
When the student began
to be able to detect

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.473
his own errors,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.630
and he was that self critical
that he could find out

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.680
his own mistakes before
someone else pointed them out,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.540
that was a sign that he or
she was ready to get a PhD.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.430
That registered on me
and I think it's true.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.600
Being self critical so that

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.880
you don't make erroneous
discoveries and you can always

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.007
check what you're doing
as go along and say,

00:18:02.007 --> 00:18:04.200
"Gee, I'm really into something new now

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.810
and it's not because I've made mistakes,

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.190
but because I've checked my
progress all the way through

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.330
and I've arrived at a
point that no one else

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.130
has ever seen before."

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.368
That's the light goes
off and it's really fun.

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:21.790
- Does part of that come,
that self criticism,

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.310
come from the universe you're embedded in,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.720
that is you're anticipating
the criticism that

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.943
your colleagues will make?

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.050
- Yes, yes.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.320
Like most endeavors,
it's pretty competitive.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.686
So and we're also educated and trained,

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:41.090
as upcoming scientists,
to not make mistakes.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.710
We don't want to mislead people.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.918
We want to be right.

00:18:43.918 --> 00:18:47.900
We want to show that the
measurement is really accurate

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.865
and that if it's off a
little bit it's not too far.

00:18:50.865 --> 00:18:54.823
So this is deeply ingrained
in us to not make mistakes.

00:18:56.482 --> 00:19:00.622
There is some caution also
when a scientist makes

00:19:00.622 --> 00:19:04.220
a truly big discovery that everybody wants

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.880
to pay attention to,
newspapers and interviewers

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.110
and so forth, there's
an element of jealousy.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:16.263
Maybe even some suspicion
if the same person,

00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:19.540
his face is out there all the
time claiming something new

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.825
and how important it is,

00:19:20.825 --> 00:19:24.005
the competitors get a little tired of that

00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:26.670
and they want to make
darn sure that this person

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.595
who's maybe bragging, maybe posturing,

00:19:29.595 --> 00:19:32.280
maybe announcing something important,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.433
but very sure he's right.

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:37.255
We don't want any false posturing.

00:19:37.255 --> 00:19:39.643
- Let's now go back to your early work,

00:19:39.643 --> 00:19:42.928
because you did some early
work that was very important

00:19:42.928 --> 00:19:47.928
on the ozone layer and the
effect of chlorine gases.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.383
Talk a little about that
and how you got into that.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.253
- Well, I was trying to switch fields,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.350
to switch my area of emphasis
from these ionized gases

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.600
around the Earth to something
that was more relevant,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.000
more related to day to day existence

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.165
or at least life processes and so forth.

00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:14.670
In those days, we didn't know
much about the ozone layer

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.873
but it was starting to
become clear that it was part

00:20:17.873 --> 00:20:22.050
of the Earth's environmental
stability system.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:27.050
In this case the natural
ozone layer absorbs

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.930
ultraviolet light that
comes out of the sun

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.310
and if it weren't for the ozone layer,

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.633
that ultraviolet light
would reach the surface

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:38.490
where it can break up
proteins in your skin,

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.142
cause skin cancer amongst
light skinned people

00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:43.970
and damage plants and so forth.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.700
So we knew that it was important
but we really didn't know

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.513
what was controlling it.

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:52.120
It's like you're trying
to create a budget.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.690
How much of it is produced and
how much of it is destroyed.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.526
So somebody here at
Berkeley, Harold Johnston,

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:03.210
had helped to work out how a special kind

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.814
of chemical process called catalysis

00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:10.016
involving nitrogen oxides,
was helping to counterbalance

00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:12.413
the natural production of ozone.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.506
So my colleague and I just
went looking for other

00:21:16.506 --> 00:21:19.510
chemistry that could be
important that would be

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.510
connected to all of that.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.660
We stumbled on the idea
that the chemical element

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.740
chlorine could destroy ozone
under the right circumstances.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.624
So we started researching
it and going back through

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.713
old laboratory studies
and made this proposal.

00:21:37.376 --> 00:21:39.710
It was original, it was good.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.640
It turned out to be right but
we missed the most important

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.473
part of it.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.380
The most important part was
that humans were already

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.940
involving some chlorine
compounds in their daily lives

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.580
and commerce that were already
damaging the ozone layer.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.529
These chlorofluorocarbon
gases in aerosol spray cans

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:06.110
and refrigerators, that
turned out to be the important

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.330
discovery by someone who had just finished

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.120
Berkeley grad school,
actually, Mario Molina

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.823
and his colleague Sherry Roland.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.180
This set of discoveries
really opened up a lot of new

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.200
research that many many of
us knew that it was important

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.483
to get to the bottom of
this whole phenomenon.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.970
How much more growth in that
industry could be accommodated

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.480
by Earth's natural healing
processes versus when we

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.253
would go past a tipping
point and cause a breakdown

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:40.230
in the ozone layer of some kind.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.610
So for the next...

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.808
Gee, people are still
working on these issues

00:22:43.808 --> 00:22:47.600
and it's led to international
agreements that were

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.373
remarkably successful.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.530
- Talk a little about the
evolution of the field

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.838
of climate studies.

00:22:55.838 --> 00:22:59.020
When you started in people
had been working on this,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:04.020
but the field really
took off as you became

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.190
interested in the subject matter yourself.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:12.190
- Well, it was probably the opposite,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.870
that I became more and
more involved because I saw

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.970
that the field was taking
off in the sense that it was

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.411
getting to look important.

00:23:19.411 --> 00:23:22.470
This was years and years
and years before the public

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.600
was aware of it, but we
began to see data coming in

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.400
that suggested that climate
change was going to occur

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.653
ever more rapidly.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:38.100
It was much the same set of
notions and scientific input

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.980
that got me involved in the ozone layer.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.690
In this case, the notion
is that human activities

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.640
are on a large enough scale
and of a particular type,

00:23:51.665 --> 00:23:55.624
that they can effect the entire
global physical environment.

00:23:55.624 --> 00:23:58.910
Not just dirtying our own
nest with air pollution

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.004
in one city,

00:24:00.004 --> 00:24:04.158
but causing very stable
chemicals to spread all through

00:24:04.158 --> 00:24:07.300
the global atmosphere that can then

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.700
leverage the entire Earth's energy budget

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.240
and change the climate.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.930
This had become clear
conceptually and all the pieces

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.193
that we could evaluate
looked pretty solid.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:23.350
Today, in 2016, of course
people are digging more and more

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.760
deeply into the details to figure out

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.723
what are the detailed implications

00:24:28.723 --> 00:24:32.121
for regional, geographically
regional climates,

00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:36.683
what's the time scale going
to be, sea level rise.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.140
All of those possibilities
were alive back in the

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.970
early '80s, late '70s,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.970
but awful lot of exploration
remains to be done.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.320
- In addition to being a leader
in this particular field,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.450
you've been someone who's
led in the organization

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.781
of the settings in which
this kind of research

00:25:06.781 --> 00:25:08.390
could occur.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.390
You came to UC Irvine and helped establish

00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:17.630
an interdisciplinary department
there in geosciences.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.460
Talk a little about that, I mean,

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.600
because that's a different
kind of science leadership

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.600
that is very important as
more and more resources

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.430
have to be made available
to take an even broader

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.320
and deeper picture of what's going on.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.610
- Yeah and this is one of
the few times in my career

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.780
where I've actually planned something.

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.350
Usually I just let things happen

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.880
and do what I'm interested in.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.663
But in that case,

00:25:45.663 --> 00:25:50.663
I had seen these two powerful
examples of human activities

00:25:50.804 --> 00:25:53.383
capable of effecting the entire planet.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.290
Not necessarily in a limited way.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.503
It wasn't clear that
things could remain stable.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.350
I began to think, you know, we need a

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.460
better way that those of us involved

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.810
can learn the other
components of the actions

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.900
so that we don't make a
bunch of stupid mistakes,

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.560
but also begin to educate
the next generation

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.130
of young people.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.240
I was pretty young at the
time, so I'm not saying that

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.233
we were focusing on teenagers.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.530
I waited to see what would
happen around the world's

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.263
universities, say how are
universities going to respond

00:26:31.263 --> 00:26:33.493
and I wasn't seeing much action.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.410
So when I heard about
and opportunity to start

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.430
a completely new approach
in a graduate program

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.563
at one of the UC campuses, Irvine,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.018
I looked into at first and
I volunteered to help them

00:26:49.018 --> 00:26:51.870
to plan the program.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.894
But after a couple of visits
I began to realize, you know,

00:26:54.894 --> 00:26:58.652
nothing else is going on
when I look around the world.

00:26:58.652 --> 00:27:01.290
Everybody seems to be
waiting for somebody else

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.313
to make a move.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.720
There were some disciplinary issues,

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.660
like should everybody had a PhD in physics

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.090
before they start this kind of work?

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.773
Should everybody have a
PhD in chemistry before

00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:16.240
they start this kind of work?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.550
Or could these concepts
be incorporated earlier?

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.710
So we entered that idea
of starting the program

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.080
as a bit of a risk, not
knowing exactly how to go,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.940
but it's gone very well.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.160
The driving notion was,
and I think the summary

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.400
of the mission of the program,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.400
was to detect and quantify

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.000
large scale trends in the
environment like air and water

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.899
and land, to understand their causes

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:52.703
and to predict the future.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.320
So we never used the words
physics or chemistry or biology.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.470
We focused on the
phenomena with the premise

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.935
that human caused
disturbances are going to be

00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:07.123
a serious part of the future.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.749
On the other hand, we always
have to look for natural causes

00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:14.802
so we can separate out
what humans are doing

00:28:14.802 --> 00:28:17.153
from purely natural phenomena.

00:28:18.761 --> 00:28:22.310
- It sounds like you're saying that

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:27.310
in terms of the field in
general, that lot was going on

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.730
in different discreet areas
and part of the task here

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.802
was go bring it all
together and train people

00:28:34.802 --> 00:28:36.072
to take the next step.

00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:40.300
- Yes, from an educational point of view,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.270
what were the rudiments in understanding,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.010
in this case the behavior of the Earth,

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.963
as a linked biological
and physical system,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.360
then how is it going to
happen organizationally?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.313
Where would the resources come from?

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.450
How could we make sure that our graduates

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.460
and the research in the
department were speaking

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.800
to the issues?

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.470
So a lot of things had to be done.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.018
We had to talk to the federal
agencies in the United States

00:29:09.018 --> 00:29:10.762
who support the research,

00:29:10.762 --> 00:29:13.803
what kinds of facilities could be built,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.610
was the University of
California faculty ready

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.740
for something like this?

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.623
But the idea caught on.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.610
- What about technology?

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:32.610
I guess what is going on in
the course of this evolution is

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.630
that new ways of gathering data

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:41.030
become very important and
it opens up a whole new

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:47.170
perspective and a way to
validate the information

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.420
you're gathering.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.640
- I think you're absolutely right.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.711
In fact more than I expected.

00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:55.570
I can look back just
over the last few years,

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.200
10 years, and see when
certain instruments,

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.870
certain technology were
proposed for development

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.750
that I didn't think would ever work.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.670
They're now yielding
incredibly valuable data

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.693
on Earth's climate.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.195
This is stunning.

00:30:10.195 --> 00:30:13.823
The miniaturization of
devices, their stability,

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.563
the places they can look,

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.430
our ability to store data
and to handle the data

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.170
without causing errors in
the retrieval of information,

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.457
just like your handheld devices.

00:30:31.457 --> 00:30:34.131
All of these things were unforeseen,

00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:39.131
to be able to process so
much data without errors

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.760
and to be able to have the
satellite pick out your telephone

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.447
for your personal communication
from all the signals

00:30:47.447 --> 00:30:51.683
without making any errors,
this is fascinating stuff.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.830
- What did you learn from this experience

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.520
in essence organizing a new discipline,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.730
a new interdisciplinary discipline

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.110
and then you moved on to being chancellor.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.952
In other words, were
there surprises for you,

00:31:08.952 --> 00:31:13.260
insights about leadership
that you didn't have

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.960
until you actually were doing it?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.520
- Yes, again, you hit on a good point.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.350
I didn't appreciate
the value of leadership

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.400
for most of my life.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.310
Now I realize that with
the right circumstances,

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.273
a leader in a position
can make a big difference.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.530
So it's a combination, obviously,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.780
of balancing the interests
and capabilities of people

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.820
against what might be the task at hand.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.073
But in many institutions,
leadership really does matter.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.000
I began to learn that.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.360
So in between,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.973
I was dean of the college of
physical sciences for a while.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.020
I was dealing with physics,
chemistry, mathematics

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.240
and this Earth system science

00:31:59.516 --> 00:32:02.379
and learning what the
different pursuits were

00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:06.721
and how the education of
students in the programs

00:32:06.721 --> 00:32:09.070
could be effected by the others.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.910
It was really important
and allowed me to make

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.960
better decisions when I
became chancellor, I think.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.690
- When you left the
chancellorship you became

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.330
president of the National Academy

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.720
and chairman of the National Research.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.762
So talk a little about that role

00:32:24.762 --> 00:32:28.034
and the differences with
the other roles you've had.

00:32:28.034 --> 00:32:31.597
- In the middle of the Civil
War in the United States,

00:32:31.597 --> 00:32:34.750
the Congress and President Lincoln created

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.960
the National Academy of Sciences.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.540
It's amazing to me, the
more I've learned about it,

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.420
that they did this because here you were

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.500
in the middle of this

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.660
brutal civil war with the
outcome not determined.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.590
Whether there was going to be one country

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.273
that emerged or not,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:57.580
they did two or three amazing
things in 1862 and 1863.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.420
One of them was the creation of

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.502
the National Academy of
Sciences to help to lift

00:33:03.502 --> 00:33:07.950
the future United States
of America to be on a par

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.080
with Europe scientifically,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.000
by raising standards,
by organizing pursuits,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.700
by helping to prioritize
resources and so forth.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.600
But they also created the
Morrill Land-Grant Act,

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.410
which as you know, founded,
created some of the best

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.430
public universities in the United States

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.270
as we see them today

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.390
to permit higher education
to be more accessible

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.137
to a much larger number of people than was

00:33:38.137 --> 00:33:42.023
and could go to these small
private universities in 1862.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.040
These were amazing feats.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.567
Well getting back to the
National Academy of Sciences,

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:51.346
the mission was not only to elevate

00:33:51.346 --> 00:33:55.510
the standards and quality and
activity of American science,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.210
but also to be available
to help the government.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:01.820
So of all the world academies of sciences

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.440
in different countries,
as I've now learned,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.440
ours is almost unique,
certainly distinctive,

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.890
that we have no direct payment
from the federal government.

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:16.060
They don't pay us to exist.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:20.330
But they will ask us to do
projects that are important

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.263
in the public policy arena.

00:34:23.886 --> 00:34:26.440
On a project by project basis,

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.000
we then do help the government
as a completely independent

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.223
analyst and advisor.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.830
Sometimes the tasks that they give us

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.000
are kind of prosaic,
kind of everyday things.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.440
Sometimes they're kind of
cosmic tasks that we have

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.410
to undertake but the
idea of the government

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.460
creating a body that, in some cases,

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.040
would have a almost decisive role

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:56.170
that would not be under the
control of the government,

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:59.020
that was really rather
bold of the United States

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.950
government to do in 1863.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.485
We try to live up to it.

00:35:02.485 --> 00:35:07.485
We try to be independent,
objective, nonpartisan.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.760
Some of the requests are kind of strange.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.752
We have to argue back and
forth with the government

00:35:14.752 --> 00:35:18.730
what the focus should
be, but we try to play it

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.830
completely straight and
objectively and we produce

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.831
about 150 reports every
year on these topics.

00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:27.233
- And how are you funded?

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.280
- Pretty much project by
project by parts of Congress

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.857
or different federal agencies.

00:35:33.857 --> 00:35:38.857
Sometimes by private
foundations, philanthropy.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.973
So it's a complicated mix.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.870
- Now before you became president,

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:50.870
President Bush asked you to chair a report

00:35:51.826 --> 00:35:53.883
on climate change.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:00.830
What I'm curious about, were you surprised

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:05.830
by the politicization that
followed in the debate

00:36:06.693 --> 00:36:09.250
about climate change,
not just from the report,

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.560
but just the general
setting of the way science

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.793
is viewed today because
of that politicization?

00:36:16.793 --> 00:36:20.330
- Yes, we could talk about
that particular report

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.040
from 2001 maybe a little later.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.755
But yes, the degree to which
this whole discussion about

00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:31.090
Earth's climate change has
become politically partisan,

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.690
especially in the United States.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.170
There are only one or two other countries

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.280
where it's become partisan.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.740
But in the United States
it's terribly partisan.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.396
I just don't even understand
how this has happened.

00:36:42.396 --> 00:36:45.967
Not only is it unnecessary
and destructive,

00:36:45.967 --> 00:36:48.760
but it's not even understandable,

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.610
because historically, for example,

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.310
the republicans have
been pretty supportive

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.273
of basic research in this country.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.019
So to have so many of
them turn on this issue

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:06.220
and say that it's somehow
erroneous or even fraudulent

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.190
is just stunning to me.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.630
I don't understand how it's happened.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.760
- Is it because of the interest involved?

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.050
Because if you're talking
about cutting carbon

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.840
you're talking about the use of petroleum,

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.290
among other things.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.183
- We could probably talk all
day on all of the reasons.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.130
Some of them is that
the situation could lead

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.600
to a regulatory environment,
which is not favored

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.563
by many people in different industries.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.733
It's inconvenient.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.680
For example, fossil fuels,
liquid fuels like gasoline,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.030
have a real advantage when you're trying

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.290
to create transportation.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.500
We now know that that's not the only way

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.650
to fuel transportation.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:54.530
Electricity, for example,
from renewable sources

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.100
can also fuel transportation.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:01.610
But there's a convenience to
using what we've always had.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.042
The availability of
coal has been a big part

00:38:04.042 --> 00:38:09.040
of western civilization
for what, 150 or 200 years,

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.580
300 years and to suddenly you know,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.790
turn our back on it is, I
think it leaves a lot of people

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.762
cold and I don't mean that

00:38:19.762 --> 00:38:21.260
(laughs)

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.053
literally, I mean it figuratively.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.230
So there's a lot of reasons
why you can look back

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.080
and say this issues has become partisan.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.860
Certainly the way the
newspapers and many commentators

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.070
talk about climate change,
there might be one sentence

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.940
on the science and something
that's been measured,

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.113
and then the next 350 sentences
are about the politics

00:38:42.113 --> 00:38:45.020
or competing interests.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.050
So it's a tough issue.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.280
- What about the...

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.210
Let's go back to the report that you did

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.180
before you were president.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.720
What do you see as the main
contribution of that report,

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.853
the main insight?

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.140
- Well, it was structured...

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.090
The White House asked the
Academy to give them answers

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.650
to 12 or 13 questions.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.475
Specific questions and
I'll mention one of them

00:39:08.475 --> 00:39:09.886
to illustrate it.

00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:13.570
So I was not asked to be
chairman by the White House.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.947
The Academy usually decides those things.

00:39:15.947 --> 00:39:18.630
They try to be very independent.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.115
The previous president of the Academy,

00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:24.820
who was from UC San Francisco actually,

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.510
I think chose me to be
the chairman of the study

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.030
and we had a very short timeframe.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:34.623
We had something like five
weeks to not only gather,

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.716
focus on the questions, provide answers,

00:39:37.716 --> 00:39:40.699
and to have the whole thing
anonymously peer reviewed

00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:43.780
from people all over the country.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.640
But one of the questions was

00:39:46.566 --> 00:39:51.070
how reliable are these
international reviews

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.215
or assessments that have
been published now for

00:39:54.215 --> 00:39:58.160
25 or 30 years, 25 years,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.390
the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.600
which is a very very

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:08.820
comprehensive organization that goes into

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.389
every aspect of climate change,

00:40:10.389 --> 00:40:13.423
involves scientists from
all over the worlds.

00:40:13.423 --> 00:40:15.910
There is some government participation,

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.000
so some people have
been worried about that.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.470
We were asked to say
to answer the question

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.620
for the White House, how
good are their assessments?

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.490
Are they biased?

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.634
Are they exaggerating or the opposite?

00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:32.480
It was a very specific set
of questions they had us.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.370
You know, what could we say
about future human health

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.993
impacts of climate change.

00:40:37.993 --> 00:40:39.973
Rather specific questions.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.890
So that's the way it was
couched and we delivered

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:45.100
in five weeks.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.810
It turned out the President
Bush was trying to decide

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:52.675
what his government would
do with the Kyoto Protocol

00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:57.590
that was trying to
stabilize Earth's climate

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.000
by dealing with the greenhouse gases.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.018
So in the midst of our
working on that report,

00:41:03.018 --> 00:41:06.920
his White House decided not to participate

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.840
in the Kyoto Protocol.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.714
So I'm not sure our report
had the immediate impact

00:41:11.714 --> 00:41:13.640
one way or another.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.890
But certainly, the report
go the country's attention

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.230
that we said yes, there is climate change,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:21.150
it's measurable, it's growing,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.003
it's likely to grow much
bigger and so forth.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.440
- The reaction to that
report and the climate

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.740
that we've described with regard to

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.599
partisan politicization
of our understanding

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:41.755
of what we should do about climate change,

00:41:41.755 --> 00:41:45.570
that is in part, shaped
your goals has head

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.403
of the Academy.

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:48.770
I mean, in other words, because science

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.260
has in this environment,

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.248
not necessarily because
of anything it done,

00:41:55.248 --> 00:41:59.420
some communication problems in making.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:00.650
Shall we say that

00:42:01.887 --> 00:42:05.085
the attack on climate change

00:42:05.085 --> 00:42:09.923
has led to a questioning
of the legitimation

00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:11.980
of scientific research.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.300
What have you tried to
do about that in terms of

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.410
communicating broadly,
the kinds of things you've

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.340
been saying about science here?

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.050
- This is a very big set of issues.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.800
Certainly climate change is involved,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.250
but there are many other too.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.650
Like the teaching of evolution,
biological evolution,

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.610
everything we've learned
about how central biological

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.733
evolution is to the way life works,

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.380
genetically modified crops,

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.093
the effectiveness of different
medical interventions.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.565
You name it.

00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:52.580
The communication with the general public,

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.090
people who are not
scientists, but who are aware

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.820
of trends and who want
to know what's going on,

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.473
this is just very important.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.730
I don't remember how
many different scientists

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.900
have said it, but it's that

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.970
we live in a world now
that is just evermore

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.859
dependent on science and
technology to provide

00:43:14.859 --> 00:43:19.859
everyday needs as well as
those of the next generation

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:24.640
and yet, we understand
less and less as a people

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.900
of where the resources are coming from,

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:28.244
how they're being manipulated,

00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:31.733
how we deal with the waste and so forth.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.832
We've got a kind of a separation

00:43:35.832 --> 00:43:40.240
of the importance of the
subject and our dependence on it

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.000
with knowledge of it.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.630
How do things really work?

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.110
What would happen if we lost the internet?

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:50.630
What would happen if we lose electricity?

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.688
So I think the communication
among scientists

00:43:53.688 --> 00:43:58.110
and the general public
is evermore important

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.960
and yet it's getting harder.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.055
Scientists are using more and more jargon

00:44:04.055 --> 00:44:07.723
and specialized language
when they describe things.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.213
It's partly because that's
the way science works.

00:44:11.213 --> 00:44:13.980
The so-called reductionist method,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:18.170
where we go deeper and deeper
into a narrow set of topics

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.150
to be able to understand
fundamentally what's going on

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:22.821
or how to make a new discovery,

00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:26.240
that makes it harder to
communicate, not only across

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.840
scientific disciplines, but
with the general public.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.358
So I've been putting a lot of time

00:44:31.358 --> 00:44:33.563
into these communication issues.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:39.313
How do we avoid just out
and out misunderstandings?

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.680
How do we help scientists to understand

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:48.410
the importance of communication,
how to do it better,

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.611
how not to exaggerate,

00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:55.611
but also how to describe
the legitimate prospects

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.620
for fantastic advances but
without over promising.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.520
These are really challenges
and I think important.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.514
So I've been putting
a lot of time in them.

00:45:04.514 --> 00:45:06.703
- Also, at stake here,

00:45:07.934 --> 00:45:11.130
is making the data that is
gathered open to public sources

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.810
and among other things

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:16.830
and there's also the issue of the way

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.465
publications now have a
faster and faster tempo

00:45:20.465 --> 00:45:22.275
and so we, so...

00:45:22.275 --> 00:45:25.150
In other words, science in a way,

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.510
has to really think about these things

00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:33.247
because it's effecting
its communication skills

00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:36.040
by responding to technology,

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.236
the new way of publishing and so on.

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:42.660
- And there are practical
applications and implications too.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.414
For example, some
environmental regulations

00:45:46.414 --> 00:45:49.683
that are designed to
protect the public health,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.103
people whose industries are being effected

00:45:54.103 --> 00:45:56.730
or who are otherwise skeptical,

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.740
want to see all the data
on which these decisions

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.383
are being based and yet
the scientific journals

00:46:03.383 --> 00:46:07.386
are trying to limit the
amount of space that's

00:46:07.386 --> 00:46:10.200
being take because they're filling up.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.640
New journals are being
created where these results

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.560
are being presented and everybody's trying

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.923
to save space, make the
articles easier to read,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.628
but still make them understandable.

00:46:21.628 --> 00:46:24.510
Then from a fundamental point of view,

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:28.350
one fundamental tenent
of science is to be able

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.275
to reproduce someone else's
experiment or calculation.

00:46:32.275 --> 00:46:37.275
Well, if I do a calculation
and you're trying to check me

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.260
you know, did I do it right,
am I misleading people

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:43.470
unintentionally, you would
have to see all of the input

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:46.036
that went into my experiment
or my calculation.

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:48.480
So when I publish that result,

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.882
I have to provide you,

00:46:49.882 --> 00:46:52.974
as the critic who wants to test things,

00:46:52.974 --> 00:46:57.350
enough of the essential
information so that you can

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.620
reproduce or try to replicate it,

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.616
try to check whether it works.

00:47:01.616 --> 00:47:05.150
If it does you can then move
on to whatever you want to do.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:07.841
But if it doesn't, you
have to call me on it.

00:47:07.841 --> 00:47:10.740
So that gives us all a responsibility

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.922
to provide all the necessary information,

00:47:13.922 --> 00:47:16.275
all the necessary assumptions.

00:47:16.275 --> 00:47:20.236
So this set of issues
has become a big one now,

00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:24.320
not only in communication
but how to optimize

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.806
the whole enterprise

00:47:26.806 --> 00:47:30.664
and to avoid instances
that might look like fraud

00:47:30.664 --> 00:47:35.410
or misleading or somebody pursuing

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.560
a particular financial
advantage, something like this.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.760
So there's a lot of action
in the scientific community

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.070
now to do this.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.580
- How do you communicate these

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:50.329
new realities and the changes

00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:54.582
in scientific behavior
without changing science

00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.900
in a negative way?

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.250
- That's a great point
because some of the actions

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.160
that are underway now

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.800
to try to make the whole
enterprise more transparent.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.050
That is to see through to the bottom line,

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.683
where did this stuff come from,

00:48:10.683 --> 00:48:14.023
how reproducible is
it, how valuable is it,

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.420
is putting a crimp on certain practices

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.800
and the question is how necessary is it.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.735
For example, there's some fields

00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:29.820
where now there are
requirements in the journals

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.680
that when you write and publish

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.720
a new result, you are required
to produce just literally

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.420
everything that went into the calculation,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.420
including if someone asks
access to your old lab notebooks

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:49.060
that are sitting in a hallway somewhere,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.528
not just what you've published
but access to everything

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.960
so they can check everything.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.887
This is hard because the
resources don't exist

00:48:56.887 --> 00:48:59.720
for you to be able to catalog everything,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.700
store them, make them
available to anybody who asks

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.150
from all over the world,

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.240
some of these things
are being proposed now

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.610
and some of them are frankly, impractical.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.966
So we're trying to come up
with a balanced approach

00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:15.310
that will balance the
legitimate need to know

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:18.320
the details with one's ability to store

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.950
all the information, for example.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.230
Drug companies, there have
been some notable cases

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.497
in the last several years,

00:49:25.497 --> 00:49:29.030
of companies that have their
own research laboratories

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.586
who are trying to decide whether,

00:49:31.586 --> 00:49:35.410
for example, to proceed
with the costly development

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.852
of a particular drug.

00:49:36.852 --> 00:49:40.280
So they do experiments
that try to check on what

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.408
the early ideas maybe that
came in from another country,

00:49:44.408 --> 00:49:48.190
what they look like and
can they be substantiated.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.253
In some cases, quite a few cases,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.140
the researchers in a
pharmaceutical company

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.130
are unable to substantiate
what someone else

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.590
has already claimed,
so they have to decide

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:04.803
whether to continue to
develop the drug or not.

00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:10.120
So far, what I think is some of the work

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.329
on medical development
involves such complex systems

00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:17.520
that even the things you
put into the experiment

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:22.020
aren't quite the same as your
competitor may think it is,

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.910
so that a great deal of
preparatory work has to be done

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:28.613
to sort this out and it's adding cost.

00:50:29.512 --> 00:50:33.120
We don't want to see more
cost added to the system.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.410
- What would you like to see down the road

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.783
in terms of climate research?

00:50:40.357 --> 00:50:43.550
You're very attuned to what's
going on in that field.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.683
What do you think we
need to be looking at?

00:50:45.683 --> 00:50:47.450
- Well two main things.

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.840
One is to continue the
observations of the important

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.135
things on the Earth.

00:50:52.135 --> 00:50:55.464
The temperatures, the ocean currents,

00:50:55.464 --> 00:50:58.630
the wind patterns,

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.510
the precipitation patterns

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.320
and the ice amounts and sea level.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.960
Those are the key variables.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.820
It turns out, to measure those things

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.950
requires a real commitment,
'cause you can't go out

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:13.390
and measure something once and say gee,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:16.627
at 10 o'clock in the
morning the temperature was

00:51:16.627 --> 00:51:20.400
something in Philadelphia, PA

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.200
and something different in San Francisco.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.940
You need an enormous amount of data,

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.970
a number of observations and
they have to be continuous.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:32.600
So it requires a commitment
and the technology

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.590
to measure things,
variables like temperature,

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:40.290
repeatedly in many places,
in a continuous way,

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:42.070
without any offsets.

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:43.571
If you bring a new thermometer in,

00:51:43.571 --> 00:51:47.400
you better make darn sure
that it gets the same answer

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.755
as the previous thermometer

00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:52.490
so that you're not just
introducing an offset.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:56.225
The second thing is
looking forward, of course.

00:51:56.225 --> 00:52:00.940
How do we make predictions
based on the current state

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.450
of all of these variables as we

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.430
figuratively light a
fire under the system?

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.390
That we keep adding
greenhouse gases that will

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:14.130
heat up the surface, how
does everything change

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.229
around the world in important regions?

00:52:17.229 --> 00:52:21.320
It's not just averaging
over the whole planet,

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.700
but we have to be able to speak to

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.665
individual locations, London,

00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:29.890
Sydney Australia, Moscow,

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.252
places like this, as
well as all the different

00:52:32.252 --> 00:52:35.440
separate climates of the United States.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.175
So looking forward, we
have to know how to process

00:52:38.175 --> 00:52:42.640
all the data and do the
mathematical calculations.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.350
It's a little bit similar
to weather prediction

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:47.890
with some notable differences.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.007
So looking at what we have now,

00:52:50.007 --> 00:52:53.170
we have to maintain these
continuous observations,

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.880
high quality, some of
them involve satellites

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.221
and then looking forward

00:52:58.221 --> 00:53:02.170
more mathematical talent
and computer resources

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.470
just have to be maintained
so that we develop

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:05.804
our predictive skills better.

00:53:05.804 --> 00:53:08.130
Otherwise, humans are
not going to know what

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:10.488
to expect or how to adapt to it.

00:53:10.488 --> 00:53:12.400
- One final question,

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.930
what would you advise a student

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.030
to prepare for the future as a scientist

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:19.240
in whatever field?

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.750
- I'm pretty conservative there.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:24.803
I think there's no substitute that's

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.150
dependable without
knowing the fundamentals,

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:30.473
say of mathematics,

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:35.900
but to assess the human
impacts of all of these changes

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.060
we're undergoing, clearly we need

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.452
university outputs of all kind.

00:53:41.452 --> 00:53:44.566
People who understand
regional economic development,

00:53:44.566 --> 00:53:47.480
history, languages, of course.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.430
But on the science side,
a really solid grounding

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:54.770
in mathematics and physics and biology

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:58.683
is needed to take on these problems.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.750
- Then finally,

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:04.571
do you think we'll get
agreements on some of these

00:54:04.571 --> 00:54:08.130
climate change issues world wide?

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:08.963
- I do.

00:54:08.963 --> 00:54:11.570
I've become a little more
optimistic in the last

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:12.850
several months.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:15.470
I think, for example, the
political partisanship

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.080
in the United States is not gonna last.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:23.080
I know enough people on the
side of the republicans who

00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:27.363
understand that they don't want

00:54:27.363 --> 00:54:30.913
the situation to become evermore partisan.

00:54:30.913 --> 00:54:34.820
We can't expect any of our
politicians to really understand

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.960
all of this in detail.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.883
I've learned that.

00:54:36.883 --> 00:54:39.010
But they're smart people.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.150
But of course, they don't
have the time or background

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:42.570
to understand things in detail,

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.070
so we're not waiting for that.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.793
There are ways to attack
these problems by,

00:54:50.793 --> 00:54:54.700
for example, more renewable
energy that's affordable

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.071
and reliable and transportable.

00:54:57.071 --> 00:55:00.330
There are companies, in
fact young people working

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.097
in companies all around the world,

00:55:02.097 --> 00:55:05.410
who are really refining solar energy

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.282
and storage of solar energy

00:55:07.282 --> 00:55:10.991
and wind energy in remarkable ways.

00:55:10.991 --> 00:55:13.960
Some of these technologies
are now competitive

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.028
even with low oil prices.

00:55:16.028 --> 00:55:19.530
It's gonna take a while because the scale

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.980
of our energy infrastructure
around the world is so

00:55:24.397 --> 00:55:27.800
imponderably large, it's gonna
take a while to replace it.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.050
But I'm optimistic.

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.168
I think technology's helping a lot.

00:55:31.168 --> 00:55:33.400
I think the general notion

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.050
that humans are causing a
global planetary problem,

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:39.960
that notion is growing,

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.190
especially amongst young people.

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:44.246
So I'm becoming more
optimistic and there is

00:55:44.246 --> 00:55:47.200
a forerunner of an international agreement

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.610
that came out of Paris
in December of 2015,

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:52.615
which has some good potential to it.

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:56.100
- Well on that positive note Dr. Cicerone,

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.589
I want to thank you very much

00:55:57.589 --> 00:56:00.985
for being on our program
and helping us understand

00:56:00.985 --> 00:56:04.118
what science is all about.

00:56:04.118 --> 00:56:05.547
- Thank you.

00:56:05.547 --> 00:56:08.289
- Thank you very much for joining us

00:56:08.289 --> 00:56:11.699
for this conversation with history.

00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:15.282
