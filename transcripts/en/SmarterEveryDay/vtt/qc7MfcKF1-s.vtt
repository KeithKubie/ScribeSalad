00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey, it's me Destin, 
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.460
We've all heard about solar eclipses, right?

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.060
and you're probably aware that there's a huge one coming very soon

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.980
so, you think about how to prepare and you're thinking, maybe I gotta get some special goggles

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.320
so that when I'm looking up at the sky and I see the moon come across I don't hurt my eyes

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.100
so I can see totality by looking directly at the sun or something like that, right?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
It's actually far more complicated and far more beautiful than that.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.160
There are very specific moments that happen during a solar eclipse

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.680
That if you're prepared for 'em, down to the second, you can see really neat things that you didn't know about before.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.920
So, today on Smarter Every Day, there's this hyper-meticulous guy in my hometown.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.580
when I say meticulous, just look at what he does for a living

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.320
Anyway, this guy has chased eclipses all over the world--eclipsees, I don't know,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.080
Anyway, this guy is like, having a meeting right now, with all his buddies

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.240
They're going to plan, down to the second, where they're going to be.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.120
So they can see these individual events, not just totality, but there's other stuff that happens.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.120
Anyway, let's go bust up in here

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.120
And let's figure how to scientifically watch

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120
an eclipse. Let's go.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.120
Can I bust up your meeting and ask you a question ?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120
Yes, sir. This is Dr.Gordon Tulipan.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.100
He's a well-respected plastic surgeon by day

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
known for great attention to detail.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
So why are you guys here listening to this guy?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
*Laughter* 'Cause he's the man?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm here because he's known as

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.060
an eclipse fanatic.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.800
He's travelled the world to film eclipses

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
And he's even been invited to give talks at NASA.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
At the meeting, I told Dr. Tulipan

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
I wanted to go to my son's baseball game so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
he agreed to meet with me the following day

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
in his conference room.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
By the way, my oldest son found his baseball swing this year

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
and I love to watch him play.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
I came back the next day for a one-on-one

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800
eclipse study session with Dr.Tulipan.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
I got a good show for you.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.800
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So I guess your ultimate goal is to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
prepare people for this eclipse

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
GORDON&gt;&gt; and to inspire them not to miss it.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
This eclipse is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800
going to be a once in a lifetime thing for

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800
a lot of people. People are not going to travel

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800
all over the world to go to eclipses

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
like I do. It's a wonderful thing to have

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800
an eclipse in your country

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800
you can drive to, and when I show you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.800
the world map of the eclipses that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.100
are going to happen in the next twenty years,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100
you'll understand how difficult it is

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100
to get to a total solar eclipse with you son.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.100
He started with the basics. He first explained

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100
how magical it is that our Moon and Sun

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100
are almost exactly the same size

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
in the sky even though they're very

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.100
different celestial bodies. The Moon orbits

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100
the Earth in an ellipse.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
This means as it gets closer to us, it looks bigger

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100
and as it gets further away from us, it looks smaller.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
The really cool thing about this is that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920
at the smaller size, it doesn't quite cover the Sun.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920
But at the largest size, it does.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.920
This means that there's two major types of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
eclipses. An anular eclipse

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920
occurs when the Moon doesn't totally block out

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920
the Sun. It looks like

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.920
a bright glowing solar disk poking from behind

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920
the Moon. When the Moon is larger,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920
it does block out the Sun.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
This of course is a total eclipse.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Eclipses are few and far

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920
between but only a few hitting each continent

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920
over the course of several decades.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920
The red curves here show annular eclipses

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920
where the Moon is smaller than the Sun.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.920
So as you can imagine the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.920
total eclipses which are shown here in blue

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920
are extra special sweet.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.920
If one of these is in the country where you live,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920
you really need to figure out how

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.220
to drive to it. These narrow bands where

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.340
the eclipse Moon shadow moves over the ground is called the totality plane.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.960
You have to be within the band to see

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.960
a total eclipse, but it's not just ok to be within the band,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960
You goal should be to get to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.960
the very centre of the band. At the edges,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.960
the totality only lasts a few seconds.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.960
But down in the centre, it can last for

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.960
several minutes. Gordon explained that the most

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.960
important thing about wherever you're watching the eclipse from

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960
is called the contact times.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960
C1, or Contact Time 1,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960
is the exact instant

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
when the lunar disk touches the solar disk

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.960
in the sky. The Moon then continues

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.960
to move accros the Sun for quite some time.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
This can usually take over an hour.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Then,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
C2 happens. C2 is the exact

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.960
second when the lunar disk

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.960
covers the Sun.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.960
C3 is the moment that the Sun pokes out from behind

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960
the Moon again. It then traverses for

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.960
probably an hour or so and then C4

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960
happens.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.960
C4 is the exact moment that the Moon quits

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960
covering the Sun at all.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.960
GORDON&gt;&gt; What I'm telling people to do is

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960
not to miss the partial phase phenomenon

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.960
which are the other things

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960
that happen before totality.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.960
You're surroundings change.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.960
The temperature changes,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.960
the lighting changes, the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960
animals get confused because they think

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960
that nighttime is falling, and if

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960
you're really lucky, you'll get to see

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.960
shadow bands, and shadow bands don't happen

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960
at every eclipse and they don't

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.960
happen at every observing area.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960
DESTIN&gt;&gt; What are shadow bands ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; It bends the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.960
light and causes

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960
motions of

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960
serpentine shadows

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960
accros the ground

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960
that look like thousands of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960
snakes crawling

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.960
in unison...
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Shut up !

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.960
GORDON&gt;&gt;... in parallel going away from you
DESTIN&gt;&gt; This is bull.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960
GORDON&gt;&gt; and to the side.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; There's no way that happens.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960
GORDON&gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. I saw them in 2002.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.960
DESTIN&gt;&gt; No !
GORDON&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.960
DESTIN&gt;&gt; You're saying...

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960
You're saying it's gonna... it might...

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960
look like snakes

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
crawling on the ground ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Very thin

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960
cause they're little ground shadows

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
and the way I perceive them

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960
is, picture thousands of

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960
parallel snakes, going like this

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960
going away from you

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960
and to one of the sides depending on...

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.960
DESTIN&gt;&gt; WHAT ??? Snakes ?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.960
I thought an eclipse was like, you know,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.960
I'm gonna look at the... NO !

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960
It's about shadow bands for me now.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.960
Here's the deal, in 1842, this guys

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.960
was like "it was so striking

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960
that children were running around trying to

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960
grab those things with their hands".

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.960
This is a real phenomenon.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960
I've looked it up, and scientists

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960
do not know what causes it.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.960
They have like

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.960
a ton of theories. They don't know. To me, it sounds like

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.960
an optical interference thing.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960
But they don't know. And not a good video on

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.960
the internet. There's some videos

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960
but it such a low contrast event

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960
that nobody has ever captured it really well.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.960
So the obvious question,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960
for Mr Solar-Eclipse-Expert,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.960
is how do we get a good

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.960
video of shadow bands ?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.960
How do we capture it ? When does it happen ?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Just before C2 ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Just before C2 and

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.820
just after C3 when

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.820
the Sun is a slit. It has

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.820
to be that final little narrow slit

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.820
otherwise it doesn't work.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; How long does it last?

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; For about 20 or 30 seconds.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.820
You have to catch it.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So you have to know

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.820
it's about to happen.
GORDON&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; I rarely ask people to do things,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.820
on SmarterEveryDay videos, but

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.820
we have to have to catch videos of shadow bands.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.820
That has to happen. I think...

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; So the way to do it is setup

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.820
a video camera on a manual exposure

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.820
on a kingsize

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.820
white sheet.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Or light concrete or something
GORDON&gt;&gt; Or light concrete.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Ok, the next thing is called

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.820
the diamond ring.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.820
The diamond ring is the part just before C2

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820
where it actually looks like a diamond ring

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.820
if you're taking a photograph of the Sun.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.820
What happens immediately after that

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.820
is fascinating. It's called Bailey's Beads.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.820
Now Bailey's Beads is

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.820
when the lunar disk is right

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.820
about to cover the top of

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.820
the solar disk. What's really cool is that

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.820
it should be just a really skinny crescent

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.820
all the way around right?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.820
But the fact is the Moon has valleys

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.820
and mountains.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.820
And those start to close over the solar disk

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.820
and you can see the light coming

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.820
around those mountains.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.820
It's really cool. It's breaking that solar

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.820
light up into beads.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.820
It's called Bailey's Beads. Anyway,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.820
you have to know the exact second that

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.820
happens cause it's such a fast phenomenon

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.820
you have to be taking photos like at

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.820
that instant in order to catch it.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; So in 2001, I

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.820
programmed, I paid a programmer to

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.820
program the first eclipse talking timer.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.820
This is from 2002, and

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.820
I still have one that works.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.820
So you ...

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.820
So you made this back then.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.820
So there's the original talking timer.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; You..

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; From 2002.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; You made this

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.820
Ok, I don't know

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.820
what's more impressive : that you made this in 2002 or that

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.820
you have one of these things that still works.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.820
Ok, you know all

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.820
the words, it's time to plan out the day

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.820
of the solar eclipse.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.820
Step 1: Get to the totality plane,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.820
preferably in the centre of the totality

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.820
plane, at that point, you're gonna wait for

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.820
the lunar disk to touch

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.820
the solar disk, that's C1,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.820
Game on. At that point,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.820
weird stuff starts to go down. The temperature starts to decrease

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.820
Animals start to freak out cause it's getting

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.820
dark, they think it's about to be night.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.820
All that happens over an extended period of time

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.820
well over an hour. After that,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.820
we're approaching C2 and that's

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.820
where things get crazy. The three phenomenon

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.820
that you're gonna look out for. Number one :

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.820
Shadow Bands. I've already figured out

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.820
I'm gonna use a big ol' piece of white plastic

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.820
to try and see the

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.820
shadow bands. I'm excited about that. The second one :

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.820
The diamond ring. That's about 5 seconds

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.820
before C2, immediately

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.820
after that, if you're a good photographer,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.820
you're gonna catch Bailey's Beads. I'm going for it.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.820
Okay? Bam ! C2 hits.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.820
After C2, that's

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.820
when you're in totality. You can remove your glasses

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.820
and you can look directly at

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.820
the Sun. At that point,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.820
somewhere in there is max totality.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.820
I'm told to scan the horizon cause it looks like it's

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.820
a 360° sunrise

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.820
after that, right before C3,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.820
get your glasses back on, because

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.820
the Sun is about to pop out and you don't want to hurt your eyes.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.820
Immediately after C3,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.820
first you've got the Bailey's Beads,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.820
and then you have the diamond ring,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.820
and then, again, if you're lucky,

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.820
for 60 seconds after that, there's a possibility

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.820
of Shadow Bands.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.820
After that, we're moving towards C4

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.820
the temperature is coming back up, everything

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.820
is going to be awesome except

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.820
it's going to be over. The cool thing about it is

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.820
you have to know exactly when

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.820
it's gonna happen cause you get one shot

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.820
at seeing all this stuff. Back in the day,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.820
you had to send a self-addressed

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.820
stamped enveloppe to a space bycenter.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.820
These are Gordon's. He was like, didn't want

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.820
to let me borrow them because they're so valuable to him.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.820
Anyway, the way it worked,

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.820
is you've got these solar eclipse bulletins

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.820
and you had to calculate the exact

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.820
moment by interpolation

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820
when your contact times were

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.820
for wherever you were on the globe. It was

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.820
very, very cumbersome. However,

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.820
we have good news,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.820
we live in the age of

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.820
smartphones and we also

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.820
have a plastic surgeon in Alabama

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.820
who decided to create

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.820
an App so that you can take your phone out,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.820
geolocate wherever you are

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.820
and instantly calculate

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.820
your contact times for your position.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.820
And that's flipping awesome, which is why I asked him

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.820
if it was real and if

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.820
it was gonna work and if he could go with me

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.820
to go to Tennessee where the totality plane exists

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.820
and test the contact times

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.820
inside and outside of the totality

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.820
plane. Remember, you want to get to the centre.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.820
I wanted to test his app on the edge.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.820
Check it out. Okay, we're in

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.820
the parking lot of a church in

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.820
Brentwood, Tennessee.
GORDON&gt;&gt; We're..

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.820
We're in this sidewalk.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Uh huh.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; Right here
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Yeah

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; So this sidewalk is in totality,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.820
that tree over there

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.820
where that sign is

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.820
is not in totality.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm gonna

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.820
try this. So I got the app

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.820
here. Solar Eclipse Timer App.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.820
So I'm going to get my location

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; Right.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; And then...
GORDON&gt;&gt; We're in.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; That's my location right there, right?

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.820
Latitude, longitude...

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; And four contact times.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; C1, C2, C3,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.820
C4. Okay.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.820
Load my contact times so I have a

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.820
6 seconds duration totality right here.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; Right.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Does that make sense ?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; It probably would be a little bit shorter

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Somebody's calling me.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.820
Alright, a little bit shorter ?

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we need...
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Oh we need to turn that off the day of

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.820
You don't want people calling you during the...

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; I have that in the instructions

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay
GORDON&gt;&gt; a 15 minutes shut off

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.820
texting and phone receiving.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay. That's a really good point.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.820
Okay, so, let's go to where

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.820
it's not in totality.
GORDON&gt;&gt; Right, so we're right here

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.820
and we were able to pick it up.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, so we should go

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.820
like, to that tree

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; And we should just get a partial eclipse.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.820
Let's do it. So seriously, like

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.820
right here, load my times...

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.820
get my location...

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.820
Look at that.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.820
I've got C1,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.820
and I've got C4

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.820
I have no C2

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.820
and C3.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.820
I'm not in the totality plane.
GORDON&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; We just walked accros a parking lot

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.820
and this

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.820
tells us if we're gonna se the eclipse or not.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; How long have you worked on this ?

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; I've worked on this since last

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.820
August and I've tested in the parking lot

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.820
about 6 times prior to today.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Really ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Yes.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Are you excited that it works?

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; I am.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; I'm not very impressed Gordon.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; So, what's it now here ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Oh, here, now wait.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Solare Eclipse Timer ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; That's what you get in the AppStore.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; Now.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; I'm trying to sell his app. He's just like

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.820
so into that. Go ahead.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.820
GORDON&gt;&gt; You see this is a 6 and it's actually not.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay, I came back into the car to review

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.820
the footage.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.820
The man has spent a lot of his time

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.820
making this app so that

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.820
you can watch the eclipse.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.820
He's testing it. It's a really big deal so

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.820
if you want this, you can go to the AppStore

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.820
and it's Solar Eclipse Timer and

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.820
it talks to you as the eclipse

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.820
goes to tell you C1, C2,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.820
C3, and C4.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.820
It's a pretty big deal.
GORDON&gt;&gt; It's 9 seconds

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.820
over there.
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Is it ?
GORDON&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820
DESTIN&gt;&gt; Okay. Seriously, this is the best.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.820
I love this man.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.820
Oh okay, that's so good. Alright.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.820
Erm, yeah.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.820
There's the Moon.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.820
Shoot the gap right there.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.820
Alright, I hope you enjoyed this episode

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.820
of SmarterEveryDay. I'm doing our yearly

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.820
tradition with my daughter where we go out and we watch

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.820
fireworks in our kayaks, but I want

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.820
to say thank you to the sponsor this time

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.820
which is 23andMe.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.820
If you've never heard of 23andMe,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.820
the term 23 comes from the fact that we, humans,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.820
have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.820
This looks like a good place to backup sweetheart.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.820
Now,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.820
this is not a sequencing service.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820
This is a genotyping service. Now there's a difference.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.820
A genotype is like looking for a

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.820
word in your DNA sequence

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.820
that will show you if you're

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.820
genetically predisposed to certain things.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.820
I hear the fireworks. Alright so erm

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.820
real quick. If you want to do this test,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.820
which I highly recommend cause it's really cool,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.820
it's pretty simple. You just open the box when they send it to you.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.820
There's a little test kit

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.820
in there. All you have to do is spit

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.820
in this little thing... I think I can do this

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.820
right here in the kayak. Yeah, check it out.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.820
You take this and you spit in it

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.820
you fill it up to the line with your spit.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.820
and there's a, basically a stabiliser,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.820
a liquid stabiliser there

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.820
you fold it over, you seal it up and mail it off

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.820
and you get all kinds of information like your

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820
ancestry, you get erm..

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.820
if you're genetically predisposed to certain

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.820
health issues. It's a really

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.820
neat service, so if you wanna check it out,

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.020

and check it out, that will support SmarterEveryDay

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.020
and it will also help you

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.020
learn more about your ancestry and

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.020
your own body. It's pretty cool. And it's time

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.020
to look at fireworks.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.340
Aw, it's pretty cool.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.320
If you wanna support SmarterEveryDay, please go to

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.320
23andMe.com/smarter

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.320
and check it out, this is a hilarious finale

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
to a video

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.900
Okay, I know you're turbo smart, do you ever

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.900
get the glasses that are proved for direct solar viewing?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.900
Because if you get the wrong kind,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.900
they can actually open you pupil up more

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.900
and let harmful UV in, so

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.900
get the right kind and then do your homework

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.900
and then you can take them off and look directly at the total solar eclipse.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.900
And more importantly, know when to put them back on

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.900
before the Sun pops back out.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.900
And get to see your C3.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.900
Thanks again to 23andMe for supporting

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.900

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.900
here because I learned a lot.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.900
These are my favourite videos where I don't know what's going on

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.900
until I just start asking the expert.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.900
I love these videos. Anyway,

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.900

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900
your life, please consider subscribing,

It's the internet. Do whatever you want.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.900
Also

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.900
I have some other stuff on SmarterEveryDay2

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.900
I've got a little background

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.900
description on how to use

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.900
your camera to video

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.900
the eclipse. Gordon has a thing called the drift method. I'll put

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.900
that on SmarterEveryDay2, also

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.900
the conference tape will talk. I'll put that over there too.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900
I really appreciate you and I really

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.900
want video of shadow bands.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.900
Anyway, I'm Destin
