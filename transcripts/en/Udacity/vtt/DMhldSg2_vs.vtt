00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.190
In the last exercise, we used alpha and jitter to reduce

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.080
over plotting, but it turns out that there's more that we can

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.210
do. Let's hear from Mora about how she used her domain

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.520
knowledge and a transformation to make an adjustment to her scatter plot.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.500
&gt;&gt; The next thing that I did, was

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.590
to take again, the perceived audience size, and their

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.610
actual audience size, but this time I transformed

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.010
the axes. So this time, it's as a percentage

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.540
of their friend count. Some people in this study had

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.270
50 friends, some had 100, some had 2,000, and so,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.668
it actually makes more sense to think about your audience

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:38.680
size as a percentage of the possible audience. All of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.530
the people in the study had shared their post with

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.140
friends only privacy, so you'd expect that it would be

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.390
bounded by their friend count. So, what we found when

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.640
we plotted it this way was that all of the points

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.240
are below this line of perfect accuracy, this diagonal line, really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.860
well below. And one other thing I should note about this

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.320
plot, we actually ran two different surveys. We ran one survey

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.870
where we asked people in a single post, how many people

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.840
do you think saw, saw your post? But we also asked

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.350
a different set of people, in general, how many people do

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.310
you think see the content that you share on Facebook? So

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.920
that's what this plot is showing. This is the in general

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.940
question, and their guesses are a little bit

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.265
higher. But still, people typically think people that maybe

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.070
10% of their friends see their content when in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.860
reality it's more like 40% or 50%, even 60%

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.770
of their friends will see their content in

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.530
a given month. So that's what this plot is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.490
showing, is the percentage of friends who actually saw

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.050
their content in the last month, again, they're underestimating.
