retrogressive restoration of the persona
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
retrogressive restoration of the persona
and<00:00:17.630><c> so</c><00:00:18.630><c> it's</c><00:00:19.199><c> a</c><00:00:19.260><c> complicated</c><00:00:19.920><c> idea</c><00:00:20.130><c> but</c>

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 align:start position:0%
and so it's a complicated idea but
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.740 align:start position:0%
and so it's a complicated idea but
basically<00:00:20.970><c> what</c><00:00:21.210><c> it</c><00:00:21.240><c> means</c><00:00:21.330><c> is</c><00:00:21.720><c> that</c>

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 align:start position:0%
basically what it means is that
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
basically what it means is that
sometimes<00:00:22.939><c> you</c><00:00:23.939><c> take</c><00:00:24.150><c> a</c><00:00:24.180><c> leap</c><00:00:24.510><c> forward</c><00:00:24.960><c> and</c>

sometimes you take a leap forward and
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes you take a leap forward and
you<00:00:25.920><c> learn</c><00:00:26.160><c> some</c><00:00:26.430><c> things</c><00:00:26.640><c> but</c><00:00:26.849><c> you</c><00:00:27.090><c> can't</c>

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 align:start position:0%

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
can't ask that anymore is because they
 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.090 align:start position:0%
can't ask that anymore is because they

actually don't know any more than you do
