00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.236
In 2011, I wanted to cover
the uprising in Libya.

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:07.173
<i>So, like so many journalists
we snuck in through Egypt.</i>

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.809 line:0%
We knew that one of the
great risks for us journalists

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.711 line:0%
was getting caught
by Qaddafi's forces.

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:15.581
So, on March 15th 2011,
I was working with

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.084
Tyler Hicks, Anthony Shadid
and Steve Farrell

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.220
and we were covering the
frontline in Ajdabiya.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.289
We knew that the city
was going to fall

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.958
all the signs were there,
civilians were fleeing.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.761
<i>The mortar-rounds were walking
 towards our position.</i>

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.831
<i>That's a sign that they are
zooming in on a position.</i>

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.234
<i>We wanted to stay as long
 as we possibly could</i>

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:36.736
<i>to get the freshest reporting.</i>

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.504
Our driver started
getting calls saying

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.172
Qaddafi's troops
were in the city

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.742
and that we had to leave,
and we ignored him.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.145
That's the first mistake,
you never ignore your driver.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:50.583
We stayed, we kept photographing
and working on the frontline

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.852
and by the time we
decided to flee

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.788
we drove directly into one
of Qaddafi's checkpoints.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:59.325
<i>This is the exact position
that we were taken hostage.</i>

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.960
<i> If you look at
 Bryan Denton's name</i>

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.595
<i> he's a photographer for
 the New York Times</i>

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.463
<i> that's where our
 car was stopped.</i>

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.965
You have to make a decision

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.967
when you approach a
hostile checkpoint.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.403
"Do you stop and announce
yourself as journalists

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:11.938
and hope that they
don't kill you.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.873
Or do you try and drive
through the checkpoint

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.875
and hope that they
don't open fire."

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.776
We are all yelling
something different

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.845
"Drive, go, stop."

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.914
Our driver panicked,
he stopped the car

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.950
and jumped out,
he said we're journalists.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.619
At that point Qaddafi's troops
ripped us out of the car.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:27.921
The rebels that we were with

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.956
started opening fire
on that checkpoint

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.057
and we were caught in
a wall of bullets.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.292
There were bullets everywhere.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.795
I did not get out of
the car at that point.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.097
All the men had jumped out
and had been pulled out.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.465
I was still sitting behind

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.901
where the driver had been
sitting on the left-hand side.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:43.603
I put my head in
my lap and started

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.039
sort of prayed that it would
all go away. And it did not.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.675
And so, I felt the
bullets everywhere

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.209
and I said, "Okay, I have
to get out of the car."

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.212
because a car is not armored,
it does not protect you.

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.982
I crawled across the
backseat, jumped out

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.151
and one of Qaddafi's troops
was immediately on me

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:01.454
pulling my cameras, of course
I'm pulling back instinctively

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.923
which is not very smart,
and so he's pulling back

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.057
and we're in the
middle of the road

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.626
and I feel bullets everywhere.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.928
So, I suddenly thought, "Okay,
I have to make a run for it."

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:12.398
So, each one of us tried to get
behind this cement building.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:14.233
When we got behind the building

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.602
we were told to lie
face down in the dirt.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.804
Each one of us had a
gun put to our heads.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:22.108
They were about to execute us,
and the commander came over

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.277
and said, "You can't kill them,
they're American."

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.811
And we don't know
why he said that

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:28.213
but Anthony later
translated that for us.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.783
In that moment they took
my shoes off my feet

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.718
tied me up with my shoe laces

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.955
my wrists and my ankles
together and carried me away.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:39.658
They put me and Steve in one
vehicle on the frontline

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:41.426
and Tyler and Anthony in another

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.962
and they kept us there for hours

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.699
while sniper-fire, bullets
and bombs rained around us.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.835
We were tied up,
we couldn't go anywhere.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.537
At that point as the
fighting got closer

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.472
they decided they
wanted us to live.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.775
The entire time we were
punched in the face.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.378
The men were smashed in the
back of the head with gun-butts

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.913
and I was groped.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.015
That went on for the
first three days.

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.752
We were eventually put in prison
we spent a night in prison

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.419
which actually was
the first time

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.522
we were allowed to speak
to each other openly

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.356
because before we
were blindfolded

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.693
so we were scared to
speak to one another.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.761
Then we were flown to Tripoli

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.095
and we were held
there for three days

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.898
and eventually we were released.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.135
<i>This is our release as we were
brought to the Turkish embassy.</i>

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.303
<i> The Turkish government
 was acting as a proxy</i>

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:25.838
<i> for the American
 government because</i>

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.074
the Americans had
pulled out of Tripoli

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.508
<i> And this is our car.</i>

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.711
<i> Two weeks later
 Bryan Denton went back</i>

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.545
<i> to see if they can
 find our driver.</i>

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.281
Our driver was never seen again.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.182
We don't know if he was
killed in that moment

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.052
when he jumped out of the
car, or if he was executed

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.121
or if he was put in prison.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.956
But the New York Times
sent a team back

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.324
to try and look for him

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:47.293
and they found our car
on the side of the road

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.895
and they found my shoe.
