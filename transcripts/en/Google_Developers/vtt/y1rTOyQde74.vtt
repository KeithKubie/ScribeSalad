DAVE DAY: Hi.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.460
Good morning everyone, and
welcome to Empowering Your

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.370
Business with Google Maps.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.600
My name's Dave Day.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.050
And this is my good friend,
David Owens.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.250
And today we're excited to be
sharing with you some of the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.710
projects we've been working
on in the Google Maps

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.960
team down in Sydney.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.030
So the question we're trying to
answer in today's session

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.800
is a pretty broad one.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.550
Where's my stuff?

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.520
It's a broad one.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.380
But for businesses today, it's
an increasingly crucial one.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.910
And it transcends that age old
question of where did I leave

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.650
my car keys?

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.280
For businesses today,
it's more about

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.530
where are my people?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.060
Where are my vehicles?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.270
Where are the packages that I'm

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.210
delivering through my system?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.710
And even once I know where they
are, what are they doing?

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.590
And how can I help them
be more effective?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.310
So even though it's an important
question today, as

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.400
time goes on it's going
to become an even

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.519
more important question.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.480
By 2015, it is projected there
will be 1.3 billion mobile

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.430
workers out there
in the world.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.780
That's a huge number.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.990
And it represents more
than 1/3 of the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.270
entire global workforce.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.350
And so we will have to be
answering questions like, how

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.200
can I get my taxi driver
to her next fare?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.260
How can I get my plumber
to a leaking tap?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.230
How can I get my sales people
and my engineers out of my

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.670
office and into my clients'
offices so they can sit down

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.900
and help them?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.950
How can I get one of my founding
members onto a sky

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
plane so he can skydive onto
the Moscone Center.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.396
And even though the questions
are increasing, the tools that

00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:51.320
are at our disposal are also
going to be increasing too.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.140
I'm sure there's not a single
person listening here today

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.230
who doesn't have in their hand
or in their pocket an internet

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.780
enabled device already.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.330
In fact, almost 2/3 of mobile
workers are carrying around a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.960
tablet throughout the day.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.110
And they're spending almost
2/3 of that day in the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.360
presence of a Wi-Fi network.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.380
And so with that in mind, in
an attempt to answer these

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.270
questions, today we're going to
be talking about two paid

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.410
enterprise products
to help solve that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.640
question, where's my stuff?

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.380
First, Dave will be walking
through the new Google Maps

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.950
Coordinate project.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.140
And then I'll be taking a look
at how we have exposed the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.020
powerful infrastructure behind
Google Maps Coordinate for

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.900
developers in the Google
Maps Tracks API.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.170
DAVID OWENS: Thanks, Dave.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.220
Good morning, everybody.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.220
My name is David Owens.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.430
As Dave said, I'm here to talk
to you about Google Maps

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.730
Coordinate.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.950
So let's go back to here.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.155
Thank you.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.520
And go to Google Maps
Coordinate.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.080
What is Google Maps
Coordinate?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.600
Google Maps Coordinate is a
mobile and web application

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.110
that helps enterprises manage
their mobile workforce.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.900
That's as clean as
I can say it.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.880
There's also an API to this.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.550
Let's talk about it
a little bit more.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.230
It is a tool that includes job
management functionality,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.980
communications functionality.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.610
It's enhanced by real
time location.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.930
And it's all presented
on a Google map.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.190
In the context of our where's my
stuff question, Google Maps

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.750
Coordinate organizes your stuff,
whatever it may be,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.010
into two different categories.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.120
First, jobs.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.800
This is work to be done.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.010
It could be sales calls to make,
trees to trim, telephone

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.020
poles that need retrofitting.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.690
It could be corporate security
incidents that need to be

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.510
followed up on, whatever
work needs get done.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.360
Secondly, we have a team.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.750
And this is the set of people
who together work together to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.370
get that work done.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.900
Now a lot of the people on
this team are going to be

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500
those people that Dave mentioned
before, those 1.3

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.690
billion mobile workers, who
are out there retrofitting

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.320
those poles, or dropping
off the [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.250
supplies that have been
requested, or checking up on

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.690
the security incidents.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.080
But then also includes
dispatchers, who play a

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.620
critical role, and
administrators, just like in

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.520
any kind of system.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.850
Great.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.540
So there are three primary
interfaces that we're going to

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.110
talk about today for Google
Maps Coordinate.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.850
I'll go over them quickly.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.690
And then we'll go over them in
more detail in a little while.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.600
First-- and these are
overlaid here--

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.550
I've got a web UI
at the bottom.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.190
It says Google Maps Coordinate
up at the top.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.800
And that's our primary tool
for the administrators and

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.540
dispatchers to do their work.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.570
Administrators need to be
able to administrate,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.640
configure the system.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.710
The dispatchers need to be able
to create, assign, and

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.070
monitor jobs as they're going
through their life cycle.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.440
The second thing we have
is a mobile UI.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.720
This is for smartphones and
tablets, GPS enabled, that are

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.840
ever present in the pockets,
bags, trucks, that the mobile

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.370
workers use to do their job.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.570
As the mobile workers are out
there, this is collecting the

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.640
GPS information that provides
the real time location

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.280
information that we have.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.930
But instead of me standing up
here waving my hands around,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.180
you looking at the screen that's
static, let me show you

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.040
some of this in action.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.360
And in order to do that, I
click to the next slide.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.700
And it says demo.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.700
So I'm going to switch over to
device number three here.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.170
And this is a live picture of
Google Maps Coordinate.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.940
Google Maps Coordinate
is a live product

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.740
that's available now.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.740
It just recently-- we delivered
it last Friday.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.860
So its paint's just dry.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.020
But it's doing very well.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.400
This is, as I said before,
the web UI.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.810
This is used by administrators
and dispatchers, dispatchers

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.410
for creating, assigning, and
monitoring those jobs in

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.300
progress, and administrators
to do their administration.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.120
The primary UI here shows the
location of a number of jobs

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.150
that we've got on the map.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.030
I could select any of these
jobs or tap on one.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.310
But first, let me tell
you a little story.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.440
The story that I'm going to use
through our demonstration

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.110
today is all about
your company.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.900
You, audience, are the owner
of a fantastic premium ice

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.380
cream supply company here
in San Francisco.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.940
And your job, as you have
to be attentive to your

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.750
customers, is to take calls, get
emails, or understand when

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.890
your customers are going to need
more of your specialty

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.430
ice creams, and deliver them
throughout the city as quickly

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.380
and as efficiently as you can.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.630
Dave and I in this scenario
are going to be your

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.340
trustworthy truck drivers
that do the delivers.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.020
Here is a set of jobs that show
the deliveries that need

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.670
to be made.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:12.730
I could click on a pin here or
touch a job to get detail

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.110
about this job.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.300
Here I can see who the job is
for, Spear Street Treats--

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.120
excuse me--

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.810
whether it's assigned, whether
it's been accepted, what stage

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.340
of its life cycle it's moved
through, details about the

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.950
job, who it's assigned
to, and history

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.240
information about the job.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.280
I can change the status
if I need to.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.780
But I don't need to at
this point in time.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.670
Let's go back to jobs.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.820
I could also look at the jobs
that are being worked on today

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.170
or, slicing and dicing all
this data a number of

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.900
different ways, I can see which
jobs are unassigned.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.900
Luckily none of them are.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.340
I can look at them
by job name.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.980
I can see the job history.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.460
So here's the single job
that we've already

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.240
accomplished today.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.365
Dave has delivered to
Google I/O 100 hand

00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:03.060
dipped vanilla cones.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.440
I can go back in history
to see jobs

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.670
that we've done recently.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.190
So you get both the immediate
information, as well as

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.440
information over time.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.440
As I said, the two kind of
organizing concepts that we

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.600
have are jobs and the team.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.390
If I switch to look at
the team, I can see--

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.940
let's bring this in view
a little bit--

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.170
where my mobile workers
are on the map.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.530
I can look at the
active ones now.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.559
This says that we've gotten GPS
information in from those

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.270
mobile workers very recently.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.260
If that information is old,
it'll say we haven't had

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.870
information for 10 minutes
ago, something like that.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.000
But as of just now means that
we've got live information for

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.730
both Dave and I, which is why
we're both here on the map in

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.690
Moscone Center.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.880
I can look at all the
mobile workers.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.400
And you'll see there's one
more gray one down here.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.520
That person's probably off shift
right now or not working

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.290
at this point in time.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.140
So he does the night shift for
any immediate important night

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.850
deliveries of ice cream.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.410
Let's see.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.060
I'm going to switch
back to here.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.580
So we've done teams and jobs.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.370
Those are administrative
roles.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.110
I want to get to one more thing
before we actually get

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.570
into assigning a job.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.690
I'm sorry.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.680
Teams and jobs were dispatcher
kinds of things.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.000
I want to get into what the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.080
administrator can do with this.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.340
First of all, the administrator
can attach any

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.856
kind of metadata to the
members of a team.

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:34.120
So I just did metadata.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.680
The administrator can
assign roles to

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.560
individuals of the team.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.690
This Is straightforward stuff
that you would expect to see.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.740
In this case, Dave is the
only person who can play

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.460
the admin role here.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.000
But everyone else on the
team can be either a

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.800
dispatcher or a worker.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.890
And lastly, but certainly not
least important-- and I want

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.940
to focus on this--

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.650
is configuration of the job
information itself.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.000
So far, what you've seen--

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.350
Google Maps Coordinate focuses
down this kind of work and

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.810
teams information into
just jobs and teams.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.850
But every business has custom
information that they need to

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.910
track in order to really deal
with their customers.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:19.710
So on every job that Google Maps
Coordinate manages, the

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.610
administrator can assign
custom fields.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.630
So we can add fields this way.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.440
And this field can be anything,
any data you want

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.660
collected during the
process of the job.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.190
The data can be optional or it
can be required in order to

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.350
complete the job.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.105
So for instance, what I've
already done in this scenario

00:10:37.105 --> 00:10:42.610
is I've already said that every
job has a next order

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.700
field in that.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.910
And so when the mobile worker is
delivering three gallons of

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.970
peanut butter rocky road
peppermint stick ice cream,

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:59.465
which is tasty, they also have
to fill out that OK, stock at

00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:02.950
this shop is good for
three more days.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.630
But maybe after three days, we
want to come back proactively

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.080
to try and help this purveyor of
our fine tasty treats sell

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.730
our product.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.540
So let me go back at
this point in time.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.430
And let's see what a dispatcher
would really do

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.350
during their day.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.870
Let's create a job.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.410
So I'm going to go
to the Jobs tab.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.660
I'm going to click Add a Job.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.940
And this is going to
be Google I/O--

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:39.060
we need 1,000 dipped
vanilla cones.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.730
And we want this--

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.670
let's see--

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.420
we're going to go
and distribute

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.750
these to Moscone Center.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.660
Now as you would expect, from
any Google Maps product, I

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.320
just typed in Moscone Center.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.150
And Maps has figured out where
that really is based on the

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.600
location, based on all the
information that we have

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.390
collected together.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.960
So that's going to go
to Moscone Center.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.380
So this has placed a tentative
pin on my map.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.180
I can pick this pin up and move
it around if that's not

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.520
the right place for it to go.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.240
So for instance, where the pin's
shown up is at the main

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.970
south building, I think,
for Moscone Center.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.880
And I want to pick this pin up,
and move it over here to

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.590
the building where
we really are.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.230
Great.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.940
Now I can assign this job so
that it happens at a certain

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.880
date and time.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.350
Or I can assign this job--

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.260
I just put it into the queue.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.450
It happens for the worker when
they're done with the current

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.440
jobs that they have going.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.480
I'm going to assign this job to
Dave because I'm lazy, and

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.250
leave it there.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.500
Now the other thing that I need
to know is that I want

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.930
this to go to Moscone room--
we're in room 11, aren't we?

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.910
That's what we're in?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.490
Great, thanks.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.480
Let's have it go to
our room here.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.660
OK.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.360
Here's the next order field just
like we had configured.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.140
And that will show up
throughout the life

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.550
cycle of this job.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.730
I'm going to click Create Job.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.580
And Dave will be notified
momentarily that this job is

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.950
now in process.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.160
So let's look at this a little
bit from what happens

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.540
on the mobile UI.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:22.200
And for that, I need
to come over here.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.370
Sorry.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.180
I'm just typing in my password,
which I don't think

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.430
I will project.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.710
Great.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:37.100
So here we see our smartphone
running Google Maps Coordinate

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.990
mobile application.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.150
And very much like you might
expect, this has pins on it

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.280
for the various jobs that--

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.270
this is my account, Dave,
the truck driver--

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.500
pins on it for the various
jobs I need to complete.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.960
And it also shows the location
of other members of my team.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.750
If we weren't distributing ice
cream-- well, let's say we are

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.220
distributing ice cream,
and my truck is just

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.480
out of rocky road.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.540
And so I need to transfer
a job to Dave

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.110
or to someone else.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.510
It might be very, very, very
valuable for me to know who's

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.570
in my proximity, and be able to
communicate with them then

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.140
and find out who's
got rocky road.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.960
Because I've got a customer who
really needs it right now.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.700
But I can go ahead and tap
on any of these jobs.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.460
And it will give me the job
information that's there.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.690
In this case, I haven't even
accepted this job yet.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.720
I'm going to start working
on this job.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.190
So I'm going to tap Accept.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.370
And this will now change the
job status, now accepted.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.670
The job history is there.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.030
If there were other job details
that the dispatcher

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.870
had put in, say nice things
to the owner.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.140
Their dog's name is Fifi.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.080
Any of that information
would be valuable.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.520
That could be here on the job.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.690
I can also, at any point in
time, update more information.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.090
If I already know--

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.380
maybe I haven't given them all
the rocky road that they need.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.550
But I already know that
their next delivery

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.110
should be on Monday.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.850
I could go ahead and fill that
information in here.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.410
As you might expect, not only
can I get to the jobs that are

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.570
interesting to me by
tapping on them.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:17.006
But I can go list the jobs that
are available for me.

00:15:17.006 --> 00:15:18.610
And I can see all
of them there.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.560
In the same way, I can list the
other team members that

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.310
are available.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.140
And in the case that Dave
weren't right on my map

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.490
somewhere that I could see,
I could tap on him.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.770
And it would show me exactly
where he is.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.340
Now a few other things
about this interface.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:42.410
Clearly, we're using the
smartphone to collect the real

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.950
time GPS location or Wi-Fi
based location

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.270
for the mobile workers.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.280
And location and location
information, location history,

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:57.610
is sensitive information and
information that we want to

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.690
treat with the utmost respect.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.680
So there's a number of different
things that we do.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.980
I'll get back to one on the
web UI in just a moment.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.280
But the mobile UI always allows
the user to tap this

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.030
Visible button down there
in the bottom right.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.110
If they need to step out of
work for a moment for some

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.430
reason and don't want to be
tracked, they can turn the

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.530
tracking off there.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.440
Secondly, we have the ability
to adjust the

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.300
location sharing options.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.180
So if they are in a
scenario where--

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.950
let's say the corporate security
scenario that I

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.990
brought up earlier.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.060
If there's a corporate security
scenario where the

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.580
corporate security team needs to
know exactly where all the

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.570
people are right now, we can
give real time information.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.500
But if the kind of work that
they're in that says that a

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.110
job is going to take four
hours, and they don't

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.350
necessarily want to spend their
battery on updating that

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.620
GPS information every five
seconds, they could also set

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.120
this to 5 minutes, 10 minutes,
something like that, or stop

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:07.030
sharing in the case that it's
a kind of secrecy issue.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:07.619
Not secrecy.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:08.730
Secrecy is the wrong word.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.609
But sensitivity.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.290
A few other things about
the mobile app here.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:21.010
First of all, when Dave gets to
Moscone Center, which we've

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.440
correctly positioned the pin
for, and he needs to know

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.150
where to take that ice cream,
we've told him on the job

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:32.360
ticket that he needs to take
it to room 3014, room 11.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.720
Now here, this is a great use
of what we have with Google

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.310
Maps with indoor mapping.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.560
So you can see that as Dave
arrives, he can see

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.220
what's on level one.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.130
And this should just fill in.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.990
There's not a lot
on level one.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.906
On level two, we have a certain
number of rooms.

00:17:47.906 --> 00:17:49.500
He knows he's still not
to the right room.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.940
But if he goes to the third
level, he can see that here is

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.330
where 3014 is.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.210
He can even find the bathrooms
after he's done his work.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.790
So Wi-Fi location, indoor
mapping, really fantastic, GPS

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.960
based location.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.890
Lastly, Dave mentioned already
that a lot of these mobile

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.480
workers are within Wi-Fi
connect range for about

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.830
60% of their day.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.290
So what about the other 40% of
the day, very important time.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.900
They're still doing
their work.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.360
The application is set up so
that it's collecting the

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.210
information even if it has no
one to send it to immediately,

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.460
will keep that information
around, will keep changes

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.090
around-- state changes that
they make to tasks--

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.290
and update those when they
can get back online.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:39.530
So the idea is it's a very low
barrier tool for the mobile

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.180
worker to be using that provides
terrific information

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.950
on efficiency and effectiveness
as well as

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.330
what's been completed
to the enterprise.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:56.320
Let me, at this point in time,
switch back to the web UI.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.570
I get that?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.740
And I wanted to show you one
last thing, another kind of

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.010
security and sensitivity
issue.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.680
If we get back to an individual,
I'm going to go

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
into Dave Owens.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.610
And not only can we see the work
that Dave's got going.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.770
But we have this location
history section down here.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.460
We can switch back and
forth in days.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.410
And I'm going to pull out.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.820
Because we should be able
to see more data.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.200
Oh, we're not seeing
anything today.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.030
You can see blue dots.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.200
I came up on the train from--

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.960
No.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.050
DAVE DAY: The other Dave.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.490
DAVID OWENS: There we go.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.200
OK, well it's not showing.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.930
Well, it's showing just a little
bit of information.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.170
Location history's tracked
and is displayable.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.160
And you can look at that
in various different

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.990
granularities.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.710
So when you want to go back, not
just know what's happened

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.350
today, and what was successfully
delivered and

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.430
what jobs were done today, but
you want to know how well we

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.420
did over the quarter.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.480
What was the spread?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.010
What was the efficiency
of the trucks?

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.280
That's data that's captured
and available.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.640
Now at this point in time, I
know you're saying, hey, Dave.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.610
Sounds great.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.470
Love your work.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.930
Love what you're showing us.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.160
But how does this help
me and my job?

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.230
And that's where we get to
interface number three, which

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.960
is the interface, the API
programming interface for

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.930
Google Maps Coordinate.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:29.220
And to get to that, I need to go
back to here, pick up this.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.870
This is a little bit
of a review slide.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.550
What does Coordinate
do for you?

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.540
Location, communication, job
management tools, seeing all

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.680
the assets on your map.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.380
Notification, instant updating,
and the ability to

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.020
report and review.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.460
So let's talk about
report and review.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.720
And to do that, Google
Maps Coordinate API.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.715
So this is primarily
a product.

00:20:52.715 --> 00:20:55.270
The API is not the biggest
API you're

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.350
going to see from Google.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.820
But it does allow you
to do a couple of

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.940
very important things.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.530
It's an OAuth2, REST based API,
very simple to adopt.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.040
And it allows you to essentially
create jobs,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.410
assigned jobs in a team,
and list those jobs.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.880
So the point here is that it's
easy to integrate with

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.230
existing systems of some kind--
ticketing systems, CRM

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.510
systems, in house systems,
perhaps, that you've got.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.480
If the dispatching and job flow
management functionality

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.600
that's available through
Coordinate sounds valuable in

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.980
conjunction with some kind of
tool that you know or have,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.200
then we'd love to talk
to you about this.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.110
A couple of quick
examples here.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.230
These should not
be surprising.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.910
Really simple is what
we've gone for.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.500
Creating a job, post a URL,
REST based, we give

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.560
you some data back.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.200
You can see that there's an ID
there, the second line of the

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.160
response, 16726.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.390
That's the ID that you can use
to talk to us further about

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.510
this job in the future.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:02.810
Assigning a job--

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.720
again, hopefully this isn't
too surprising.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.880
It's another post.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.560
You can see in the URL that I've
got a little space there

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.340
that says team.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.080
This is a [? GUID ?]

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.460
that you will use that
comes from the

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.940
team that you've built.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.280
And it's important to have
in the path there.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.770
But it's very easy to get.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:22.730
So assign a job--

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.760
I want to assign a job to me.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.930
And then here we go,
response back.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.605
Lastly, and this is the real
meat and potatoes call here.

00:22:32.605 --> 00:22:34.740
It's the getting,
listing jobs.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.870
What jobs do I have open?

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.210
There's many variants to this.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:42.160
But you can ask for what's the
state of a specific job?

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.420
So if you want up to the minute
tracking on a specific

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.670
job or you can get all the jobs
that have been completed,

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.480
say, in the last 24 hours, all
the jobs that were completed

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.590
in the last quarter, things
like that, so that you can

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.100
build and integrate
on top of that.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.920
My question for you today is
how do you want to use it?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.760
And I'd love to talk to you
either in questions or office

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.790
hours, after the session-- any
time you can find me--

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.940
about interesting use cases.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.140
Now I love Google
Maps Coordinate.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.610
But I know that it's a product
that's not necessarily the

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.900
perfect fit for everybody.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:23.210
So what do you do if you have
more things to deal with than

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.820
Coordinate is necessarily set up
for, if you already have a

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.980
significant in house investment
on some kind of

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.370
data that just doesn't fit with
the simple API that we

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.230
have provided?

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.520
And that's where the Google Maps
Tracks API comes in, and

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.150
I hand it back to Dave.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:41.400
DAVE DAY: Thank you.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.510
DAVID OWENS: His is better.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.180
His is better.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.830
Don't clap for me.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.250
DAVE DAY: We'll see.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.780
So like you've heard, the Tracks
API is built on and

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.100
leverages that same
infrastructure that Google

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.250
Maps Coordinate is built on.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.590
But instead of providing it
and wrapping it up in an

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.380
application, instead we provide
you with a raw and

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.870
powerful API upon which you
build your own application.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.620
So maybe you need something,
a more bespoke solution,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.290
something customized
to your business.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.650
Maybe, for example, the metaphor
of jobs just doesn't

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.100
really fit with what
your business does.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.500
Or you'd like to start
integrating location

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.160
information into existing
systems you have.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.490
Or maybe you have another
type of problem.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.760
Your ice cream business
has just gone global.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.380
And you have thousands and
thousands of things you need

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.360
to start worrying about.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.300
You have thousands and thousands
of vehicles, or

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.430
employees, or packages.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.760
And as you can probably imagine,
if you're sending

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.930
location data throughout the
day for thousands and

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.550
thousands of things, pretty
soon you're talking about

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.000
millions and millions of
points that you need to

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.680
record, you need to analyze,
and you need to understand.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.700
And really that's where storing
your location data in

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.490
Google's Cloud really comes
through for you.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.550
Because instead of having to
have infrastructure in your

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.000
own office, your own server
room, where you are receiving,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.380
processing, storing data,
instead, each of the entities

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.360
out in the field--

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.030
your workers, your vehicles--

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.760
can upload their data directly
to Google's Cloud.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.250
So you don't have to pay
for the bandwidth.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.040
You don't have to pay for the
additional storage, computing

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.710
power, to have that location
data stored in your office.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.880
And similarly, when it comes
time to download the data, you

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.380
can access the Cloud directly
from your office.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.530
And the Google Cloud is both
geographically distributed and

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.350
highly reliable.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.620
So you know you're building
on a solid base.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.270
This also means that how
you're recording your

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.670
information and how you're
retrieving it

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.200
is completely decoupled.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.530
And it gives you a lot of
flexibility in what sort of

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.660
devices you are using
to record.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.550
So the Tracks API is a location
based database.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.860
And there are three main aspects
which we think are

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.340
important about it.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.020
The first of these is that
it's very specialized.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.260
It's designed, it lives, and it
breathes for location data.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.270
So it has a lot of concepts
and metaphors that make

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.350
working with location data
both easy and natural.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.970
The second is that we have
designed it to be secure.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:17.840
Because your location data is
both sensitive and valuable.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.320
And the third thing is it's
designed to be scalable.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.390
So as your business grows,
we will cope with all the

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.990
additional data that you're
throwing at it.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.800
And lastly, it's a
simple HTTP API.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.640
It talks in JSON.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.140
It talks in XML.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.310
So there's a lot of flexibility
about how you

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.340
integrate with it, whether it's
a small embedded device

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.360
inside a truck, or a smartphone
application, or a

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.010
systems back end, pretty much
anything should be able to

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.060
talk to it.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.160
But it's worth pointing out that
it isn't a replacement

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.720
for your generic relational
database, maybe your App

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.490
Engine Data Store that
you're already using

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.720
to keep your data.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.180
It really is designed only
for location data.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.290
And that's where it will
act the most strongly.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.230
And it also isn't an end to end
out of the box solution

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.690
like you get with Google
Maps Coordinate.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.100
So just to harp on a little bit
more about the security,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.100
because it's such an important
concept, there are a number of

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.190
steps we have taken to make
sure that you can feel

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.740
comfortable and confident
that your data is safe.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.790
The first of these is we make
sure that all your data to and

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.470
from the Cloud is encrypted
with SSL.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.180
And we also use OAuth2 to make
sure that we know that you're

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.410
the person we're talking to.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.290
And therefore, you can be
confident that someone else

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.480
isn't accessing or changing
your data.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.840
Once the data hits the Google
Cloud, it's also encrypted

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.550
with a key that's unique to
your organization, another

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.550
layer of security.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.050
And finally, we have designed
the database to have full

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.210
right consistency.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.320
So even though you can be
throwing thousands and

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.760
thousands of these updates at
it, you can be sure that one

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.560
update isn't accidentally going
to clobber the next one.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.050
So to dive a little bit more
deeply the Tracks API and how

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.970
you can actually use it, I'm
going to introduce the first

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.060
three building blocks upon which
the Tracks API is built.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.895
And the first of these is an
entity, or, in your case, an

00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:10.990
ice cream truck.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.140
But it could be anything.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.970
It could be vehicles.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.130
It could be packages.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.130
It could be people.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.330
The Tracks API doesn't really
care what sort of thing you're

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.020
interested in tracking.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.570
The second piece is what we
like to call a crumb.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.360
And a crumb is just a little
piece of data which describes

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.710
where your entry was at a
particular point in time.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.870
And when you join your entity
up with a series of these

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.550
crumbs, we get what
we call a track.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.210
And a track simply describes how
your entities moved around

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:45.660
the surface of the Earth as
time has gone forward.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.570
So to get started with the
Tracks API, the first thing

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:53.320
you'll want to do is start
creating entities.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.370
And this, like all the actions
in the Tracks API, is achieved

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.660
with a simple HTTP post.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.645
So in this case I'm creating two
new entities, Fred's ice

00:29:04.645 --> 00:29:07.510
cream experience and The
Susie Soft Serve.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.260
And already this is sort of
highlighting two of the design

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.300
decisions we have taken
with the Tracks API.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.800
One is that, wherever possible,
all our methods work

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.730
on as many objects as
they can at once.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.120
So here we could be creating
two entities.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.470
We could be creating hundreds.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.150
And that saves you and your
servers a lot of bandwidth, a

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:28.020
lot of processing power.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.920
The second thing is this
use of a name.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.880
The name is any label you'd like
to attach to an entity.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.370
So in this case, I've got a
pretty accurate description of

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.190
what I'm sending.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.800
But it could be something like
your vehicle's license plate

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.050
number or the idea you're
using within your

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.400
own existing database.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.190
It doesn't matter.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.185
Tracks API doesn't
introspect on it.

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:49.290
So whatever you'd like
to use it for.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.090
What is important
is the response.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.050
And that contains the entity
IDs that the Tracks API

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.040
[? emits ?] for you.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.960
And use those IDs in the future
when you're talking

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.870
about those entities.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.840
So we have an entity.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.740
Now, of course, what we're going
to want to do is start

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.960
recording data for
that entity.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.840
And again, a simple post.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.920
Here you can see where we
specified the identity that

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.300
we're interested in recording
the crumbs for, and then,

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.450
again, a list of as many crumbs
as you'd like to store.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.780
So for example, if you're
driving through tunnels and

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.220
you've lost connectivity, you
can batch them up, and send

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.170
them all at once.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.350
Or maybe for efficiency reasons,
you only want to send

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.500
them every few minutes
or every few hours.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.060
Another very interesting aspect
is that we let you

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.860
attach arbitrary data to any
point that you record.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.230
So in your ice cream business,
you're going to want to make

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.800
sure your ice creams are smooth,
and fresh, and cold.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.550
And so every time you check in,
you can also record the

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.820
freezer temperature.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.150
And then later on, when you're
analyzing this data, you can

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.980
maybe identify how can you
optimize the equipment, or the

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.540
routes, or the way you your
drivers behave to keep that

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.790
temperature low.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.620
And finally, the track.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.060
We've recorded the crumbs.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.080
So now it's time to
get them back.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.750
The simplest way is just to
specify which entity we want

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.030
to talk to and what's the
maximum time that we're

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.910
interested in.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.970
And then the Tracks API will
return a series of crumbs up

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.750
to and including that
time stamp.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.330
So this is great if you just
want to look at what's the

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.920
history from now, or you can use
this to page back through

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.700
history download everything.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.680
But on the other hand, you might
be more interested in

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.890
trying to get a general idea of
where was your truck over

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.250
the last week?

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.130
And downloading every single
crumb for that entire week

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.990
isn't really going to make
that picture any clearer.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.200
You just want the summary,
not exactly when

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.830
did they turn left?

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.080
When did they turn right?

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.390
And so to achieve that, you're
also able to specify a minimum

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:52.920
time stamp.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.120
So you can specify a complete
range, and then also how many

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.110
samples you'd like the
Tracks API to return.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.430
And then we'll take an even
sampling across the entire

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.980
week, and return you just
that summary done.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.640
Then if you notice something
interesting, you can shorten

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.600
the time range and get more
detailed data for that range.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.700
So again, it's helping you be
more efficient in the way

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.910
you're retrieving and
analyzing the data.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.480
But most of the time, you're
probably going to want to talk

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.710
about more than one
entity at once.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.280
You have hundreds or thousands
of trucks out there.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.850
And you're going to want to know
for example, where are

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.460
they all now?

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.600
I want to see an up to date
view of the world.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.970
And so we've introduced the
concept of collections

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.350
to help with that.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.890
Collections let you talk about a
group of entities at once. .

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.180
And one of the main things
they're used for is getting

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.300
the live location of everything
in that collection.

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.280
Again, the Tracks API doesn't
really care about semantics or

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.250
hierarchies in collections.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.970
So you can define them
however you want.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.150
They can be overlapping.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.490
They don't need to intersect--

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.940
whatever actually makes sense
for your business.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.770
So in our business, we
know that there are

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.800
two important things--

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.780
trucks that have sprinkles
and trucks that

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.170
play musical sirens.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:07.360
And so they're the two
collections we're

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.260
going to set up.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.590
We don't care that some trucks
might have both, some trucks

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.380
might have neither.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.790
It doesn't matter
to Tracks API.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.820
Again, once we create them,
we would get returned two

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:19.510
collection IDs.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:23.110
And that's what we'll
use in the future.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.350
Setting up collections does
take a second step.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.300
And that's once you've actually
made the collections,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.360
you start adding entities to
it to actually define which

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.160
entities are contained
in each collection.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.510
And there are other end methods
too, such as removing

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.130
collections and adding
and removing entities

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.030
once they're set up.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.730
So we've set up our
collection.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.540
It's simple to see where
is everyone right now.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.200
All you need to do is specify
a collection ID.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.740
And the result is an array of
all the different entities,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.660
one per entity, and for each of
those entities where did we

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.250
last see them?

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.500
When did they last check in?

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.770
So that's all well and good.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:08.010
But often when you're wanting to
get this location data and

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.760
see where things are, you're
actually more interested in

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.389
what constraints you have.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.460
For example, you might say, I
want to make sure that none of

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.150
my trucks are ever leaving
California.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.489
Because that's maybe where
our license runs out

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.510
or something similar.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.830
Maybe you want to know when your
trucks are getting close

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.560
to your factory, so you can
be prepared for them.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.719
And so you might set a 10
kilometer ring around your

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.239
factory and want to be notified
when your trucks are

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.100
getting close.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.639
In Sydney, we have a pretty
notorious area known as the

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.659
Gelato District.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.340
And we've lost many a
good ice cream truck

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.449
in the Gelato District.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.210
So we just want to
steer clear.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.560
For this we use geofences.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.739
Geofences are essentially
just a polygonal

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.080
region on the Earth.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.280
And whether that's the entire
Earth minus a little bit or a

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.050
little bit of the Earth, it's
just you want to keep your

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.300
trucks within that geofence.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.850
And so, again, creating
a geofence is a

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.640
simple post to the API.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.290
It works in the same way that
entities and collections did.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.970
But with geofences, we need one
additional piece of data.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.790
And that's actually what polygon
are we interested in?

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.380
And as we saw in the other ones,
once we have created it,

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.600
we get minted our own geofence
ID, a new one.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.970
As with collections, when we set
up the geofence, we need

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:32.785
to tell the geofence what
entities or what collections

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:34.210
are we interested in?

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:38.260
So in the case of geofences, you
can monitor more than one

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.380
collection at once.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.220
So as before, we specify a
geofence ID and the collection

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.740
IDs that we'd like it
to be applied to it.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.280
And finally, when we need to
look up that data, we specify

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.670
the collection ID,
and then, again,

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.300
get an array of results.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:00.260
And this time for each result
we'll find one entity, the

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.980
geofence that it activated, and
the crumb which was the

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.630
offending crumb.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.220
So when did it cross
the boundary?

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.890
What was the first
crumb we saw?

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.510
And so here we have a simple
way to set up a lot of

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.730
geofences against one collection
and then get a

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.750
summary of which are
the entities I

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.850
should be worried about?

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.810
Which are the crumbs that have
caused that alarm to go off?

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.990
And in this way get a really
simple quick summary about the

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.240
state of the collection.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.710
So those are some of the very
broad brush strokes across the

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.140
Tracks API.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.280
We create entities.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.820
You record against them.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.920
And then once you've done that,
you can get historical

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.990
tracks or put them in

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.980
collections to get live locations.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.180
And then you can also
start to set

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.020
boundaries using geofences.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.690
The Tracks API is in an early
developer preview.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:48.930
So we're still aggressively
building out features.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.970
And what we'd really like to
hear from you is what would

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.690
you use something like this
for in your business?

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.920
And what are the features you'd
really like to see that

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.800
would help you solve
your problems?

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.040
DAVID OWENS: Great.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.080
So the question is kind of where
to next, in a sense?

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.510
Dave and I are both really
interested in that.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:16.470
From a Google Maps Coordinate
point of view we have--

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.910
Sorry.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.530
Are we on?

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.770
DAVE DAY: Thank you.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:27.280
We have an I/O special Bitly URL
set up that includes the

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.740
opportunity for registering
for some swag.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.630
It's so secret, I don't
even know what it is.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.210
But then our outside
of conference URL,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:39.380
maps.google.com/coordinate is a
terrific place to go to find

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.690
more information.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.450
DAVID OWENS: And likewise, we've
got a short link there

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.640
to get you in contact with us
if you're interested in

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.200
learning more about
the Tracks API.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.480
We'd be really excited
to hear from you.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.585
And so now if anyone has any
questions they'd like to ask

00:37:52.585 --> 00:37:54.700
straight away, we would be more
than happy to field them.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.730
Just step up to the mic.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.840
Otherwise, thank you very
much for your time.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.260
DAVE DAY: And we'll also be--

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:00.560
Sorry.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.980
Not to cut off clapping.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.910
We will also be at the Developer
Sandbox downstairs,

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.080
the green Maps podium, for as
long as it would be valuable

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.680
for anyone.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.930
But please, questions
if there are.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.640
AUDIENCE: So we just got
done specifying.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.680
And we're about to start
building a logistics

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.360
application, basically doing
what you're doing.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.810
There's some features that are
missing that we were including

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.530
in our spec.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.300
We're wondering if they're
kind of on your radar.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.090
One was the routing
optimization.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:35.660
So as you get 10 jobs, and you
assign them to two drivers,

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.530
will you be doing like turn by
turn and routing optimization

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.710
for those drivers to help them
get from point to point in an

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.970
efficient manner?

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:44.610
DAVID OWENS: Well they aren't
in the interfaces

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.070
that we've got here.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:51.050
But those are clearly valuable
features that Google has some

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.980
insight on.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.580
And we could talk more
about that offline.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.640
AUDIENCE: The second feature is
to be able to do analytics

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.640
over the driver's performance.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.760
So how are they getting from
place to place based on

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.050
distances so that we can analyze
their efficiency and

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.370
be correcting bad
driving habits.

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.820
I don't know if there's
any plans for that.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.030
DAVID OWENS: Yeah, again,
very interesting.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:19.260
I'd look at that and say, we'd
more likely encourage you to

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.680
use the API to get location
information out of the system

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.720
and apply analytics yourself
at this point.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.320
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:26.920
Thanks.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.142
DAVID OWENS: Thank you.

00:39:29.142 --> 00:39:30.010
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:35.510
I would like to ask how much
would the Tracks API cost?

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.440
Because I have seen the
Coordinates API.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.130
DAVE DAY: Yeah.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.400
The Tracks API pricings
are still under flux.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.455
But we're looking at the
maximum price of

00:39:45.455 --> 00:39:47.725
about $12 per asset.

00:39:47.725 --> 00:39:48.840
AUDIENCE: Then another
question would

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.250
be could you share--

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:53.410
perhaps Sandbox question, but
what stack did you use to

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.430
build the product
like Coordinate?

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.960
So what software
would you use?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.140
DAVID OWENS: OK.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.390
I was going to give you the flip
answer and say, to build

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.030
Coordinate we use Tracks.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:11.160
But part of it is with the
application mobile

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.630
apps that we have.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.500
So we are using the mobile
stacks for those.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.150
That's obvious.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:18.860
And then we are using Java
technology for our front

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.130
ending and our back ending.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.650
Do you use GWT or some other
JavaScript software?

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.757
DAVID OWENS: We're
not using GWT.

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.711
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:27.711 --> 00:40:30.580
OK, thanks.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.920
AUDIENCE: Is there any
way to connect

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.230
this to Google Contacts?

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.020
DAVE DAY: Yes.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.030
Not explicitly, but definitely
they'll be designed to work

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.960
well together.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.610
They will definitely have
similar fields and

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.530
authentications through
the API stack.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.730
AUDIENCE: So if I created a
mobile app that my clients'

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.180
clients can use to enter some
information, their contact

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.030
information could be pulled
in and added to--

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.300
DAVE DAY: Right.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.490
That would be a manual step on
your end rather than something

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:02.950
that we'd do.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:03.480
But yeah, definitely.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.680
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.830
Through the API.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.080
DAVE DAY: Yes, yep.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.610
DAVID OWENS: I'd follow that
up by saying that from the

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:18.570
Google Maps Coordinate point of
view, certainly, as I said,

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.770
we're a young application in
that we've just been released.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:26.720
But there are many integrations
with other parts

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.990
of the Google infrastructure
that we'd love to see.

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.160
AUDIENCE: Can I just ask what
kind of scale you're thinking

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.850
of for the application that
you're demonstrating?

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.290
Obviously, Google scales big.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.710
But are you scaling big too?

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.040
DAVID OWENS: We'd love to.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.040
We'd love to, absolutely.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.800
I think the place that we're
seeing the most feedback right

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.520
now from early customers is not
on the scale of the 10,000

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.640
member teams, but smaller
than that.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.240
Now the truth is it's
still a Google app.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.750
It's operating at
Google scale.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.510
And it's operating
at global scale.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:10.420
So we have our geo data
all around the world.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:16.070
And there's no reason why we
can't be looking at teams that

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.420
are tens of thousands large.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.800
AUDIENCE: What about tens
of thousands of jobs?

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.970
DAVID OWENS: Oh, jobs, sure.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.290
No worries.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.400
I mean we have to deal with that
because of job history.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.270
It's a new tongue.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:35.060
Even if it's a small team, that
team could be dealing

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.190
with hundreds of jobs a day.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.360
And over time we'd need to
be dealing with many,

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.165
many, many, many jobs.

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:42.640
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.115
Catch you later.

00:42:43.115 --> 00:42:44.365
DAVID OWENS: Sure, thank you.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.010
That's a terrific way to build
interest in the question.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:55.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.990
I was going to ask about the
asset tracking licensing that

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.600
exists today.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.700
We are a reseller.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.090
And we sell Maps
implementation.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:09.830
So there's an asset tracking
scale that we have.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.660
Does this replace all the old
asset tracking products?

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.630
DAVID OWENS: That's a great
question that I don't have a

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.510
good answer for.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.680
DAVE DAY: I've got someone to
chat with after if you'd like

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.890
to come and learn a bit
more about that.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.650
Yeah.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.920
DAVID OWENS: Great, thank you.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.860
DAVE DAY: Great.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.150
All right.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:29.790
Well, it looks like that's it.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:30.850
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.970
And I hope it was helpful.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
