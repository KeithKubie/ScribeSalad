00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:03.200
ALBERT EINSTEIN (VOICEOVER):
Based on this new phenomenon,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.667
it is conceivable,
though much less certain,

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.800
that an extremely powerful
bomb of a new type

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.300
may be constructed.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.600
FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT:
A single bomb of this type,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.867
carried by boat and
exploded in a port,

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:19.400
might very well destroy the
whole port together with some

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.934
of the surrounding territory.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:22.367
Good god.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.967
I don't need to
tell you what could

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:28.233
happen if the Germans developed
this technology before we do.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.667
I'll be doing the goose step.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:33.700
--[chuckles] Or worse,
which is why I'm asking you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.100
to take charge of a
program to research

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.633
and develop an atomic weapon.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.033
It would require
tremendous resources.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:44.667
Of that, I have no doubt.

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.233
I need wide latitude
to manage the project--

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.367
the scientists, the military,
clandestine operations.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:52.333
Secrecy would be vital, sir.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.734
You couldn't let the
crowds get onto us.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:57.834
Everyone involved will
need security clearance.

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:05.133
EDGAR: Oppenheimer,
Teller, Fermi, Einstein.

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.633
Hm.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.667
No.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.567
[closes notebook]
No, Einstein is out.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.633
MILITARY OFFICIAL: You haven't
even run his background, Edgar.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.200
EDGAR: The Bureau
has been concerned

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.734
about Einstein for years.

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:19.633
He's a radical, most
certainly communist.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.567
MILITARY OFFICIAL: He's the
man who informed the president

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.767
of the urgency of this matter.

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:28.734
He cannot be trusted to
be loyal to our country.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.800
I will support and defend
the Constitution and laws of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.567
the United States of America.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:39.467
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.967
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:46.233
JUDGE: That I will bear arms
on behalf of the United States

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:47.900
when required by the law.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.333
That I will bear arms on
behalf of the United States

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.867
when required by the law.
