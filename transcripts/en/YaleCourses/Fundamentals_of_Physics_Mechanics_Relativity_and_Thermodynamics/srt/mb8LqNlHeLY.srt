1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,880
All right, class. Welcome
back. This is Howard. Uh,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,900
last two weeks we're going
to have a slightly different
schedule for the problem

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,780
sets.
I'm going to assign something today,

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,380
which is due next Wednesday,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,440
giving you enough times so
you can plan your moves.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,700
Then I will probably give you one last
problem set with two or three problems on

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,270
whatever I do near the end.
We'll have to play it by year.

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,331
Okay,

9
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:38,220
so this is another new
topic on thermodynamics,

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,770
a fresh beginning for those who want a
fresh beginning and her songs and stuff

11
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,250
you probably have seen in high school,
some of it at least.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,780
So the whole next four lectures are
devoted to the study of heat temperature,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,940
the heat transfer,
things like that.

14
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,290
So we are going to start
with the intuitive definition
of temperature everybody

15
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:09,000
has. So hang on to that. That's
the right, the right intuition.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,260
But as physicists, of course we want
to be more precise, more careful.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,410
So let's say you have the
notion of hot and cold.

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,610
Even that requires a little more,
uh,

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,050
precision that introduces the notion
of what is called thermodynamic

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,350
equilibrium.
Just like mechanical equilibrium.

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,450
This is a very important concept,

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,480
so I'll tell you what equilibrium
is with a concrete example.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,970
If you take a cup of hot water,

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,270
then you'd take another cup of cold water.
Each cup,

25
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,320
if you wait a sufficiently long,
is set to be in a state of equilibrium.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,120
As long as the cups were isolated from
the outside world and not allowed to cool

27
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:07,480
down or heat up, we think they
maintain a certain temperature.

28
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,550
We say it's in a state of
thermal equilibrium because
this temperature does not

29
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:18,340
seem to change. Now we have not
defined what temperature is precisely,

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,240
but we can talk about whether whatever
it is has changed or not chains,

31
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,740
so it will send me down
to some temperature. It'll
maintain the temperature.

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,210
Be Very careful. If you'd leave
a cup of coffee in this room,

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,440
it will cool down because the room
has got a different temperature.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,130
What I'm talking about, a cup of coffee
that's been isolated from everything.

35
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,900
It maintains the temperature.

36
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:45,730
Here's another cup of cold drink with
at what we feel is a lower temperature.

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,500
You had both in a state of equilibrium.
Equilibrium is when

38
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,270
the macroscopic properties for the system,
I've stopped changing.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,730
If you don't pour one of
cups into the other one,

40
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,840
that's going to be a period when the
system is not in equilibrium in the sense

41
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:07,330
that it doesn't have a well
defined temperature. For example,

42
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,680
if you just bought it from the top,

43
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,260
the hot stuff is at the top
of cold stuff in the bottom.

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,500
That's a period of transition when
you really cannot even say what the

45
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,000
temperature of the mixture is.

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,500
Some parts of some parts are called
that system doesn't have a temperature.

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,970
What'd you wait long enough till the
two parts of gotten to know each other?

48
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,960
They will turn into some undrinkable mass,

49
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:31,420
but nice thing is it'll have
a well defined temperature.

50
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,030
That's again a system in equilibrium,

51
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,060
so you've got to understand
that temperature and thermal
equilibrium represent

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,830
gross macroscopic properties
and that aren't always defined

53
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,090
at the microscopic level.
It's no secret.

54
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,520
We all know that everything is
made of atoms and molecules.

55
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,890
The atoms and molecules that form the
liquid or the gas always have well defined

56
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:00,100
states. Each molecule has a
certain location, certain velocity,

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,740
but at a macroscopic level,
when you don't look into the fine details,

58
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,200
focus on a few things like temperature.

59
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,650
They don't always have a well defined
value. That's what you got to understand.

60
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,470
Things have a well defined value
when they have settled down,

61
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,560
how long does it take to settle down?

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,050
That's a matter of what
system you're studying,

63
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,520
but generally you can all tell when it
has settled down. Here's another example.

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Suppose you take a gas and you'll put
it inside this piston here with some gas

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,330
inside you've put some weights
and everything is in equilibrium.

66
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,940
You say this in equilibrium because the
macroscopic things things so you can see

67
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,720
with your naked eye, nothing is
changing. It's going to just sit there,

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,070
but if you suddenly now remove,
say a third of the weights,

69
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,390
the Piston is going to rise up,
shake it on a little bit,

70
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,610
maybe settled down in the new location.
If you wait a few seconds,

71
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,420
then the new location will act again,

72
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:03,580
settled down and you won't see anything
with the naked eye that looks like

73
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:08,530
anything has happened in between UNC,
the piston moving, the gas is turbulent,

74
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,550
the pressure is high in some region, low
in some regions than it's set in stone.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,600
This is the notion of systems are in
equilibrium and in between the states of

76
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,250
the system which are not in equilibrium.

77
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,080
No benefits system is in equilibrium.

78
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,800
We can assign to the
temperature that we call t,

79
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,330
right? No, we don't know
anything about this temperatures,

80
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:35,710
so we're going to build
it up from scratch.

81
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,470
Other than your instinctive
feeling for what temperature is.

82
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,840
Yeah.

83
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,440
One of the laws of thermodynamics
called the zero plot. Is it a club?

84
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:45,940
Because they wrote down the first law.

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,890
Then they went back and had an idea of
what is even more profound and they said,

86
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:54,891
we'll call it zero o'clock zero law says
if a and B at the same temperature and

87
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:02,090
B and c at the same temperature
than Amc at at the same temperature.

88
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,650
I see this belief in the audience thing.
Why do you call this a lot?

89
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,230
Look,

90
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,120
I think that is the key to would being
able to speak about temperature globally

91
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,060
is the assumption that if I take a
thermometer and measure something there,

92
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,440
then they come back and the thermometer
here and it reads the same number than I

93
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:26,330
may conclude these two entities which
never met each other directly but also at

94
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:30,270
the same temperature. That's not, uh,

95
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,560
that seems pretty obvious to you.

96
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:35,040
But that is the whole notion
of temperature is predicated
on the fact that you

97
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:40,041
can define an attribute called temperature
that can be globally compare between

98
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:43,020
two systems that never met
directly but met a third system.

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,913
Okay.

100
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,170
So once we hate,
once we have some idea of hot and cold,

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,760
let us decide now to be more
quantitative. It's like saying, you know,

102
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:57,750
somebody stall in shot is not enough.
We go into how tall, how many feet,

103
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,110
how many inches, how many millimeters.
So we want to get quantitative.

104
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,960
All we have right now is
notion of hot and cold.

105
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,410
So what we tried to do is to find some
way to be more precise about how hard and

106
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:14,610
how cold.
So what people said is,

107
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,570
uh, let's look at some things in the world
that seemed to depend on temperature.

108
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,080
One thing that seems to depend
on temperature is the following.

109
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,490
You take this meter stick in the
National Bureau of standards,

110
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,500
kept them some glass
case at some temperature.

111
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,380
You pull it out or make a duplicate of it.

112
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,580
You pull it outside and leave it in
the room. What you may find this,

113
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,710
if the room was hotter
than the glass case,

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,870
this rod then expense to a new length.
So one route is outside the case,

115
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,750
one rod is inside the case.
So the comparison is meaningful.

116
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,400
Nothing has been done to this guy
in the air condition glass case,

117
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,450
but this one is expanding.

118
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,330
So one way to define temperature is
to simply ask how long is this rod?

119
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,830
And somehow correlate the length of the
rod with temperature by some fashion.

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,300
So you can do that.
So what do you need to do that?

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,790
What you need to do first is to define,

122
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,250
put some markings on it so that for
each extra, something that grows,

123
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:18,900
we can say the temperature has gone up
by some amount so that we need units for

124
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,520
temperature.
That's completely arbitrary.

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,860
And do you need some standards? Just
like this meter stick, you know,

126
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:29,920
it's not nothing intrinsic in nature. The
water meter, we just made it up and say,

127
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:33,900
let's call that a meter. In the
case of the meter, the zero applies.

128
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,690
If you bring a meter stick
next to mine and we agree,

129
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,770
you can take the meter stick somewhere
else and define that to be the meter.

130
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,670
Because if the stickers, as long as
that one and as long as that one,

131
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,550
then those two are equal in length.
But temperature,

132
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:52,220
you similarly going to use this rod and
say if this rod as a certain length when

133
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:56,280
then when it kept on top of this bucket
of some fluid and at the same length

134
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,510
when I keep it on that bucket,

135
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,850
then the two buckets that
are at the same temperature.

136
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
So we can use markings on this ride
compared to the unexpanded length as a

137
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,740
measure of temperature.

138
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,660
So what people do is to pick something
a little easier than this, right?

139
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,150
They notice the liquids expand when
you heat them. That's why you know,

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,980
summer day if you fill your gas tank,

141
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,230
you have to leave some room at the top
to the overflow can come out at the top

142
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,980
are, you shouldn't fill it completely,
otherwise it'll bust the tech.

143
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,350
So liquids expand. So one way to measure
temperature, maybe fix some liquid,

144
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,160
put it there
and then

145
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,090
put it on hot rooms and maybe watch
the liquid expand to the new height.

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:44,980
Yeah.

147
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,240
And then just try some markings and each
marking can be a certain temperature,

148
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,710
but people had a better
idea than this one.

149
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,480
They add the following idea of thermometer
where you have a lot of fluid in the

150
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:00,314
reservoir,

151
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,950
a very thin tube evacuated at the
top and the fluid then is here.

152
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,490
So what's clever about this is that
if this expanse but 1% you right,

153
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,050
you should be good enough to
see 1% increase in height.

154
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,740
If this fluid expense by 1% in volume,

155
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,360
that one person in volume and it planes
sub this narrow tube can claim to quite

156
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:26,194
a bit.

157
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,530
The extra volume you get by expansion
will be the area of this tube flames,

158
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,140
the extra delta x way with that expense.

159
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,670
So you had a magnifying the expansion by
making all the expander fluid claim of

160
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,300
this extremely narrow too. In
fact, the tube is so narrow,

161
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,250
you cannot probably even see it well,

162
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,770
which is why they're a little
prison that magnifies the,

163
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,620
the Medicare your alcohol
in a thermometer. Okay,

164
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:54,560
so we have some way of
following temperature.

165
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:59,390
Now we can draw some lines,
arbitrary lines. It doesn't
matter. That can be zero.

166
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:03,020
That can be filed, that can be 19 you
just got to make sure there's monotonic.

167
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,570
Then whenever it's on 21 we may
argue that 21 is no harder than 90

168
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,630
what do you want a better scale than that?

169
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:16,430
Even though that's mathematically adequate
and practice what people decide yes

170
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,900
to do it as follows.

171
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,520
They said we want to set up thermometer
so that people all over the world in

172
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,430
different parts of the world, different
countries, different labs can all agree.

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,390
So we will make it possible for
everyone to make their own thermometer.

174
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,550
By the following recipe,

175
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,330
we will dip this guy in a bucket
which has got some ice and some water

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,970
that's called the melting point of water.
So that uh,

177
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,420
are the freezing point of water up melting
point of ice or the freezing point of

178
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:48,440
water.
It doesn't matter.

179
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,730
We notice that as water cools down
in the world around the suddenly ice,

180
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,100
he was big into farm.

181
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,060
We go to the temperature at which that
happens for the first time and we dipped

182
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,820
the thermometer there and
whatever reading they get,

183
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,940
we will postulate to be
zero degrees centigrade.

184
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,910
That is just a definition.

185
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,030
We believe that's a good definition
because people all over the world can do

186
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:16,300
that. Of course, if you live in Kuwait,
that's not going to work for you.

187
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,200
There no ice,

188
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,160
but they've figured out when the
parts of the world where you had ice,

189
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:25,810
this is a very good definition.
You get ice, you got zero degrees.

190
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,580
Then they said, let's find another
universally accessible thing,

191
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,950
which as you all know is
the boiling point of water.

192
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,460
If you put water on the stove,

193
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,560
it heats up and he'd up and heats up and
suddenly it begins to bubble and boil

194
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:39,430
and evaporate.

195
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
That temperature is going to
be called a hundred degrees,

196
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,743
hundred degrees centigrade.

197
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,123
Then

198
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,750
you take this call in between zero and
a hundred and you divided into 100 equal

199
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,584
parts

200
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,210
and that is postulated to
be the temperature anywhere
between zero and a hundred

201
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,850
if you've gone 79% of the way
to the top from here to here,

202
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,010
the temperature is 79 degrees

203
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,950
because that's how the
Dignitas and introducing that
to some degree of scale and

204
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,470
you guys know that are different scales.
You can have the fat in height scale,

205
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:24,490
you can have any other skill in which
what you want to call the freezing point

206
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,440
is different.
Somebody thinks a zero,

207
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:31,330
somebody thinks it's 32 and you can again
call this something else and you can

208
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,810
divide this interval in 200 parts,
180 parts of whatever you like,

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,070
but the philosophy is the same.

210
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,710
You have to find two points which are
reproducible conveniently and divide the

211
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,560
region between them into
some number of equal steps.

212
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,570
If it's a hundred equals steps,

213
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:50,290
you say it's a centigrade scale
provided the lowest one is called zero.

214
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,840
The sow, you have thermometers. Now,

215
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,850
there are some problems with this one
problem is that the boiling point of water

216
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,400
does not seem to be very reliable

217
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,530
because if you boil water
on in Aspen for example,

218
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,720
you know it doesn't seem to boil.

219
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,920
It seems to boil more
readily than in the plains.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,910
You can ask how do you know that maybe
it is still doing the same thing.

221
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,380
I know that because I try to cook
something, Cook some rice or vegetables,

222
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:27,250
I find they don't cook at all.
Then where it boils before it cooks.

223
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,300
That way we know it's probably boiling
earlier in the mountains then in the

224
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,134
plains,

225
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,220
so who's going to decide what the real
temperature is so you have to be more

226
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:43,000
careful when you say a boiling point
and freezing point because things don't

227
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:47,590
boil. The don't seem to boil at a certain
predictable and fixed temperature.

228
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,960
This is very deep arguments I've never
appreciated fully when I was learning the

229
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,690
subject,
et Cetera.

230
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,690
Saws sick like definition because you
may not know that the temperature is

231
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,950
changing because this is the mometer
by postulate it's going to be the

232
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,900
temperature by definition. How can it
be wrong? What's wrong is that it's not,

233
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,010
we know it's not a reliable method
because physical phenomenon,

234
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:16,640
like when your rice, we'll cook. I'd not
reproduced by the boiling point of water.

235
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,220
It cooks in the plains
doesn't Cook in the mountain,

236
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,430
so we know the boiling point
is to blame the rice, the rice,

237
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,680
that's all we know that
that's not a good measure.

238
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,370
So nowadays people are much fancier
measures and I will tell you a little bit

239
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,430
about that, but for a long time
this was a very good start.

240
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't worry about the fact that water
boils at differently in different

241
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,460
altitudes. You could go to sea level
and that's a good enough to definitions.

242
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,490
Sea level is pretty much constant all
over the world and you can see the

243
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,590
pressure that sea level is
the pressure at sea level,

244
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,790
just the road g eight of the atmosphere.
Okay,

245
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,370
so that's the usual
definition of temperature.

246
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,790
Now the trouble started
when people realize that if
you make a thermometer with

247
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,720
your favorite fluid,
maybe mercury and I make one with alcohol,

248
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,740
they will agree at zero and they will
agree with a hundred because that's how

249
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:07,370
you fixed it.

250
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,370
You read it so zero everyone says zero
hundred everyone says hundred but how

251
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,560
bout 74 degrees or 75 degrees?

252
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,190
I saved 75 if my fluid has claimed three
fourths of the way to the top at that

253
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:26,570
point, yours may not have claimed three
fourth of the way. In other words,

254
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:30,770
you've got two things, two graphs
with a zero and a hundred agree.

255
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,120
One graph may be like this one made me
like that so that when I think it is 75

256
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:38,900
you may think of 72 or 100 people agree
because we are cooked it up that way.

257
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,750
In other words, it's not true that
all liquids expand at the same rate,

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,110
so you will have to then pick one liquid
and say we were by that liquid and when

259
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,170
that liquid is gone halfway,
we would say it's 50 degrees,

260
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,050
so you'll have to pick a liquid,

261
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,030
you will have to have an
international convention.

262
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,290
You know that's the alcohol
lobby and those don't know
alcohol lobby. They argue.

263
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,830
Finally they found out a much
better solution than these liquids.

264
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,370
They found out that if you use a gas,

265
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,300
you can define temporary reducing
gases which have some very,

266
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:19,301
very nice properties and this is the gas
thermometer that I'm going to tell you

267
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,470
now. So he had a sub. You'd
build the gas thermometer.

268
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,673
Okay.

269
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,980
You take some gas in their container.

270
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,260
The typical container for me and all,
whenever I draw anything, thermodynamics,

271
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,580
it's going to be gas inside some cylinder,
which then waits on him

272
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,180
and that defines a
pressure that the guests,

273
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,710
of course the pressure will be the mg
of these weights divided the area of the

274
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,980
cylinder. That's the pressure
plus atmospheric pressure

275
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,710
and the volume is this, whatever
the volume is, base times height.

276
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,580
Here's what we asked you to do.

277
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,320
Take the product of pressure at times
volume for any sample of guests.

278
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,220
Take some gas,

279
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,340
put it in this tank and now put it on
different surfaces like a hot plate like a

280
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,921
stove like Pablo water and measured the
temperature using some standard methods

281
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,630
up to that point,
like a mercury thermometer.

282
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,680
What you'll notice is that the temperature
measured by some reasonable scheme

283
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,410
show us that the product that p
times B lies on a straight line.

284
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,420
If you connect the dots,
you find the product.

285
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:43,090
PV is linear in this temperature variable

286
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,050
and this is zero degrees
and this is hundred degrees.

287
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,740
No.
Here's the beauty of the gas thermometer.

288
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,650
If you take a different gas and you put
different amount of different gas in a

289
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:07,060
different cylinder, you want to get
some other graph may look like this.

290
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,810
What do you that does the run?

291
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,930
That's a hundred but most important
thing is that's also a straight line.

292
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,150
That's also a straight line.
It is the following application.

293
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:24,580
You guys can prove out your own leisure,

294
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,520
which is that if I think that my gas has
claimed 56% of the way of this height

295
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:37,360
to the top for the temporary,
that is 56 degrees. I ask,

296
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,290
what's your gas done? You'll find his
answer [inaudible] to 6% of the way.

297
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,850
It's a property of straight lines.

298
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,260
You can show that if it took two
straight lines, whatever, be the slope.

299
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,390
If they agree, if this is zero, this is
a hundred it's got a different slope.

300
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,780
When you have claimed
for the halfway point,

301
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,740
draw a line at 50 degrees and
ask what does any gas done.

302
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,510
They will all have claim to the
halfway point from the 0.2 100 point.

303
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,400
In other words,

304
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:11,401
gas thermometers will not only agree
at the end points where they must buy

305
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,950
construction.
They seem to agree all the way in between,

306
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,260
but that is one requirement.
This gas has to be very dilute.

307
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,423
Okay?

308
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,960
More diluted is the better it comes up
to take neon or freon at whatever you

309
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:33,520
like.
Don't pump it up with a lot of gas.

310
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:37,380
Put the least amount of gas you can
get away with. Then you find all gases

311
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,700
have the property that if you
calibrate them a zero and a hundred,

312
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,340
they agree in between that clear to you.

313
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Take the product p Times v off your gas
by putting it on different surfaces.

314
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,120
Measure the product, plot
this graph, um, been able to,

315
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,640
whenever you're on ice,
you call it zero.

316
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,260
Whenever they run a boiling water, you
call it a hundred, you find the join,

317
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,820
they're connected by a straight line.

318
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Then every point in between you've
divided equally leads to equal increase in

319
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,200
the product p Times v.

320
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,180
So Pre Times v for the gas is better
than the volume of mail courier volume of

321
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,430
water because it doesn't
depend on the gas.

322
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,870
So everybody can use the gas thermometer.

323
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,540
That's why we prefer the gas thermometer.

324
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,750
This is the interesting issue about a
measurement or definitions and sick league

325
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,840
definitions. You gotta be
careful. The last submitted,

326
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,430
I love you to pick anything you like
that varies with temperature and use that

327
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,190
as a definition of
temperature as a thermometer.

328
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,310
So why have some thermometers
preferred over the others?

329
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,380
The preferred over the others.

330
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:51,820
If the laws of nature take the simplest
form when described in terms of those

331
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,420
thermometers, in other
words, stick a meter stick.

332
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,350
What makes a good meter
stick photo standard?

333
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,490
You say the one that doesn't expand but
we don't know what that means because

334
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:06,100
that means the stick is the
standard by definition is right,

335
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,230
but in then you will soon find out.

336
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:11,410
That's not really that simple because
there are good and bad meters sticks,

337
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,950
but example the same meter
stick at one time of the year,

338
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,200
doesn't matter his own length
at a different time of the year.

339
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,550
Then we know that it's not a
good meter sticks. Similarly,

340
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,940
there are good and bad thermometers and
people at Avon, the gas, that moment,

341
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,540
this way
if you have a gas that more metered,

342
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,590
something very interesting came out of it.
Gas at one.

343
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,410
If you cool it below zero.

344
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,480
Okay,

345
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
and you asked which way is it going?
I don't know how low you could go.

346
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,540
In the old days,
people couldn't go far below zero,

347
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,920
but nowadays we can go to 1 billion
of a degree above a certain point.

348
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,640
I tell you now,
uh,

349
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,400
these thermometers indicates somehow
the product PB vanishes at a temperature

350
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,550
which is minus two 73.16.

351
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,763
Yeah.

352
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,560
So I just think that that is something
very special about that temperature

353
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,110
because if you took another gas,

354
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,120
well I'm going to do a little cheating
here that also extrapolate that same

355
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,710
temperature.
So all gases,

356
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,420
all aghast anemometers
say that is something very
special about this temperature

357
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,060
because that's when our
pressures all vanish.

358
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,960
So as you cool if given amount of gas,
even at a given volume,

359
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,660
if you keep the volume constant
and ask what pressure do I need,

360
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,230
how many weights to have to put on
that decreases and vanishes at this

361
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:32,064
temperature?

362
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,390
And this is called the
absolute zero of temperature.

363
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,373
Yeah,

364
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,600
it's called absolute
zero for many reasons.

365
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,430
One is that unlike zero of the Centigrade,

366
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
which is by no means the absolute
lowest possible temperature,

367
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,000
the absolute zero is the lowest
possible temperature. Why?

368
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,820
Because the gas pressure can be
reduced and reduced and reduced,

369
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,180
but the worst that can happen,
it can go to zero. That's it.

370
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,920
You cannot go below having no pressure.
We'll find in other ways.

371
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,754
Also,

372
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,690
this is the temperature at which you will
see conceptually no for the cooling as

373
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:15,320
possible. That'll record you don't
understand what hot and cold mean,

374
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,190
but right now this is all guests.
Anemometers pointed this temperature,

375
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,280
so people decided, you know what calling
this the zero is kind of artificial.

376
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,030
That's based on human obsession,
that water.

377
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,840
But if you think the loss of
scientists claim the whole universe,

378
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,320
what about planets where there's no water,
right?

379
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,060
You cannot describe, suppose you're
talking to at different civilizations,

380
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,530
planet of the Apes. You
want to tell those guys, uh,

381
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,760
we're going to set up a temperatures.
Zero is when water freezes and they say,

382
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,710
what is this thing called water?
You know the stuff you drink? Well,

383
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,190
you don't know what these apes are
drinking. Maybe they're drinking,

384
00:24:57,191 --> 00:25:00,970
meeting or hydrogen gas,
liquid hydrogen, we don't know.

385
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,410
On the other hand, you say, uh,

386
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,450
take any vapor and wait till the product
of the pressure and volume go to zero.

387
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:10,720
Let's call that the zero.

388
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,490
That's a universal standard is not
paid to something called water.

389
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,590
It was fine for a while but it is not
fine as a universal aspiration but the

390
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:25,000
diameters, so zero temperature
is going to be set from here.

391
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,690
Once they did that,
they call that zero.

392
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,260
They needed one other temperature and
they decided that if you're starting the

393
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:38,410
new temperature scale, you will put
the zero knock at the centigrade,

394
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,880
but this is now called Kelvin

395
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,720
and everything will
follow a straight line,

396
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,390
but to define the what one degree means,

397
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,760
you've got to define
one of the temperature.

398
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,150
That's how we defined a straight line.

399
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,630
That temperature would be called two 71
3.16 but at this point it's called the

400
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:01,570
triple point of water.
What's the triple point of water?

401
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,270
You know water and ice can coexist and
you know that water and steam can coexist

402
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,440
at a hundred degrees, but we're burying
the pressure and temperature and volume.

403
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,770
You can actually find a certain magical
point in which bought ice water and

404
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,410
steam can't coexist simultaneously.

405
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,730
It cannot pick between
those three options.

406
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,080
Ice Floating on water is when water is
not decided whether to be ice or to be

407
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,480
water.
That's a coexistence point of two things.

408
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,980
And when the water starts
boiling in your store,

409
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,950
that's been water and steam coexist.

410
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,240
But I'm saying that a certain conditions
of pressure and temperature and volume

411
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,510
so that water ice and will coexist.
No,

412
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:49,830
that is a unique situation.
You cannot get to that by any other means.

413
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,700
And that temperature we will call
plus two 73.16 in this absolute units.

414
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,950
So basically what you've done by going
to the absolute units as your shifted the

415
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:05,010
zero to more natural point
where all grabs meat,

416
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,820
then you define the one degree Kelvin to
be so that to 73.16 that Kelvin brings

417
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:16,410
you to the triple point of water.
So if you find that confusing,

418
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:19,020
I'm just saying the boiling point
of water is not a fixed number.

419
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,820
You go to the mountains to changes,

420
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,840
but only under one condition can
water and ice and steam coexist.

421
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,420
That cannot be,
you cannot get that any other way.

422
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,680
So everybody will agree on that particular
situation and that will be called to

423
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:39,000
73.16 Kelvin.
Now that is a rule.

424
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,030
Apparently you can say degrees centigrade.

425
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,310
You're not supposed to say degree Kelvin.

426
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,490
That's a big deal made and a lot of
books I keep forgetting and said,

427
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,910
in fact I forgot again and nothing
terrible has happened to me.

428
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,420
So I don't think you should pay too
much attention to whether you can call

429
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,670
something degree Kelvin or simply Kelvin.

430
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,260
I think purpose of language is to have
no ambiguity's but when I say degree

431
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,780
Kelvin and I find that you
guys don't get confused,

432
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,190
I don't think that's a big deal.

433
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,010
What you'll find if you're
a very erudite person,

434
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,290
you will never write degree killed.

435
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,640
But having said that,
don't hold me to those standards.

436
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:22,170
I just don't feel any affiliation to
this particular completely are artificial

437
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:23,340
and empty convention.

438
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,660
But you have supposed to remember
if you take the GRE or something,

439
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:32,400
it's not called degree Kelvin.
Okay, so as far as we're concerned,

440
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,960
the Kelvin scale,

441
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,650
it's like the Centigrade scale
except the zero has shifted to here.

442
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:42,690
That's it.
That's the temperature scale you will use.

443
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
That's the absolute temperature.
Whenever I write t from now on,

444
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,260
I'm talking about Calvin,
not centigrade.

445
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,530
Now that's all about heat.
I mean all about temperature.

446
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,730
Now I'm going to talk about heat.

447
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,310
So heat is denoted by the symbol
queue and you got to ask yourself,

448
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,190
what are we talking about when
we talk about heat, again,

449
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:09,420
let's use your intuitive sense
of what heat is. You say,

450
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:13,080
I have a bucket of water, I want to
heat it up, and how do you do that?

451
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,930
You put the bucket on top of something
else which you'd think is harder,

452
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,030
and when the two are brought together,

453
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:21,090
somehow the water begins
to feel harder than harbor.

454
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,200
So we say we've heated the water
and we say we are transferred heat.

455
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,760
Now people were not sure what
really was being transferred.

456
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,740
What is it that's going from
the store to the water? Why?

457
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,540
Why is it that the stove,

458
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,420
if it's not plugged in is getting
cooler and the water is getting hotter?

459
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,420
They just decided to call
it the calorie fluid.

460
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,993
Yeah.

461
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:52,550
They imagined that it a certain fluid
which is abundant in hot things and not so

462
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,860
at and cold things.
When you put hot and cold together,

463
00:29:55,861 --> 00:30:00,720
this magical fluid flows from hot to
cold and in the process heaps up the

464
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:01,643
quality

465
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,380
and they decided to measure it in
calories and so you have to define what

466
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:08,640
accountability is.
In other words,

467
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:13,530
you want to ask how much heat does
it take to heat this bucket of water

468
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,390
and the rules they made up was we
are going to define something called

469
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,190
accountability where the
number of calories you need

470
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,430
is equal to the mass of water,
times the change in temperature

471
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,230
and that's going to be
counted. These other words,

472
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,320
if I had a container with 10 grams
of water and the temperature went up,

473
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm sorry,
this is mass of water in grams.

474
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,730
Okay.

475
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,990
At one gram of water and you did something
to it and the temperature went up by

476
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:56,920
seven degrees. You will have by
definition pumped in seven calories.

477
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,170
If this was a kilogram of water,
listen to be called a kilo candidate,

478
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,050
so sometimes I use grams and calories.

479
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,550
Sometimes you use kilograms
and kilo calories,

480
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:15,750
but the definitions are consistent.
If you put a kilo in the grand,

481
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:16,930
put a kilo in the calories.

482
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,383
Okay.

483
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,650
Now suppose you say,
I don't want to just talk about water.

484
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,080
I want to talk what he thinks.
Something else.

485
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,670
Maybe I want to hit the grandmas copper,

486
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,180
so then you write down the following
rule. Yeah, morning to heat.

487
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,130
It takes the heat up.

488
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,640
Anything pick your own
favorite material goal.

489
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,880
Then the amount of heat I think we can
all appreciate must be proportional to

490
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,610
the amount of stuff you're trying to heat
up. That's somewhat intuitive notion.

491
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,550
If you've got one chunk of gold
that takes some number of calories,

492
00:31:55,551 --> 00:31:58,730
do you have a second, second
identical chunk? By definition,

493
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:01,850
that should take the same number
of calories you put them together.

494
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,610
It is clear that whatever
this calorie fluid is,

495
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,440
you need double that so it's got to
be a proportional to the mass of the

496
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:13,580
substance and has gotten a
proportional to what you're aiming for.

497
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,140
Namely an increase in temperature,

498
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,350
but this is true for any substance whether
they are eating copper or wood gold,

499
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,720
no matter what you're heating
it is through the heat.

500
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:25,700
Nita is proportional to
mass and at the temperature,

501
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,570
so what is it that distinguishes
one material from another?

502
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,930
We put a number here and that number is
called the specific heat speciphic feet.

503
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,000
This is a property off that material.

504
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,280
You got to understand certain formulas
will depend on certain parameters in a

505
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,200
genetic way and some things that
depend on the actual material.

506
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,450
In fact that a similar quantity, I mean
maybe I'll take a second to tell you.

507
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,680
If you go to the liquids that I said we're
expanding, you can do the same thing.

508
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,480
Take a rod and started eating it
and ask how much will it expand

509
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,070
if I,
he did buy some on belt the tea.

510
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,633
Okay.

511
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,710
What will it be proportional to?

512
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,130
Can anybody think of what it
may be proportional to? Yes.

513
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,970
Depends on the original length
of the right and the why is that?

514
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,010
Why do we think it's got to be
proportional to the length of the Rod?

515
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,540
Yeah, it's based on
what it had before. Yes.

516
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,483
Hold on.

517
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,680
That's correct. I think the way you,
one way to say that is take a meter,

518
00:33:43,681 --> 00:33:47,760
stick it expand for some amount,
put another meter, stick next to it.

519
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,900
That expense pay the same
amount by definition of
identical things that for the

520
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:54,120
two meters stick,
we'll expand by twice as much.

521
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,730
So we put the length of that.

522
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,660
So don't matter to what you're heating
a block of wood block of Steve.

523
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:02,494
This is true,

524
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:07,710
but then the fact that he has different
effects on copper versus wood is the

525
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:10,660
pain is indicated by
putting a number here.

526
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,770
That Alpha is called the
coefficient of linear expansion.

527
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,010
And that depends on the material. These
are true no matter what you are heating.

528
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,430
So these specific numbers,
these coefficients,

529
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:30,740
these alphas that come in are
going to come and all the time.

530
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:33,830
So you should get used to that.
He has another one.

531
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,270
Let's play this game one more time.

532
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,080
We can ask how much is the volume of a
body changed when I heat it or the chain

533
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:40,490
of the volume again,

534
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:44,210
would it be proportional to starting
volume times the increase in temperature.

535
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,620
Then you put another number that's called
the Coefficient of volume expansion

536
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,810
and that depends on the material.
So if you take copper,

537
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,100
copper will have a certain alphabet I end,
we'll have a different alpha would.

538
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,740
We'll have a different outfit it material.
We'll have a different alpha.

539
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,460
This is the property of the
material. If you say, well,

540
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,810
I had something and when I heated it up
by one degree, increase by nine inches,

541
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,700
another one increased by two inches.

542
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,730
Is it clear that the first
one expands more readily?

543
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,000
It's not because the first one could
have been a my long second one.

544
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:17,840
Could I be in a foot long?

545
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,640
So you have to pick out certain factors
that are universal and the rest of it

546
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,530
you put into a property of the material.

547
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,230
Okay.

548
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,760
Similarly, many companies, specific heat,
you ask how much he does it take to eat.

549
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,360
Some object. It depends on the mass.
It doesn't matter what your heating.

550
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,320
Depends on increase in temperature because
that's the purpose of adding heat's

551
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,330
always going to be linear.

552
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:44,331
In the Delta t this one is a property
of the material and by definition see

553
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,660
equal do one calories per gram or the
one kilo calorie per kilogram for water.

554
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,700
Once you've got to remember
one calorie per gram for water,

555
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,590
you said definition.
Once you define water to have a specific,

556
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:08,910
either one calorie per gram,

557
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,220
you can define specific kid for other
materials by the following process.

558
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,700
So what do you do? You take a
container, put some water in it.

559
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,140
Let's assume the container, a zero
mass. I don't have to worry about it.

560
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,320
It's an approximation. If you're
worried about that, you know,

561
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:32,520
take a huge container so that the volume
of water dominates the surface area of

562
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,790
the container anyway. Containers
neglected. You got some water.

563
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,600
This water is served some
initial temperature t one

564
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,440
and I have some new material lead
and I want to find its specific heat.

565
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,330
So I take the lead in the form of pellets
and they hit the lead pellets with

566
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,840
some temperature deep too,

567
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,570
and I dropped these guys into this water.

568
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,460
That'll be an example where
initially the led is an equilibrium.

569
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,010
Maybe on a furnace,
a temperature,

570
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,010
tea to water is an equilibrium maybe
in the room, uh, temperature t one.

571
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,380
Then I put the pellets into the water.

572
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,960
There'll be period when the
temperature is not defined.

573
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,790
Then soon they'll settle down for
some common temperature called tea.

574
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,070
We will now postulate this
is a postulate are a lot.

575
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,240
The total change in Q is zero.

576
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
In other words, if Q is lost by one
body and gained by another body,

577
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:40,260
the loss and the gain was equal.
It's the new law.

578
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,500
You can make up all the new laws you want.
You don't have the right,

579
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,190
but this is the law you first make.
In that case,

580
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,620
what can you say in this particular
problem, in any of these heat problems,

581
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:54,750
I urge you to draw.
The following picture is one temperature.

582
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,250
Here's another temperature.

583
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:01,320
Here's the final one which we don't know
what we can measure with a thermometer

584
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,154
and measure it.

585
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,480
Then you say the mass of the water.

586
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,640
Then specifically the water,

587
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:13,590
which is one time Delta t which is the
final temperature minus the initial

588
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,424
temperature

589
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,060
data for the led pellet master.

590
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:24,090
The led that is going to
symbol PB time specific heat,

591
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,080
which I don't know.
Times change in temperature,

592
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,850
which is the final minus
d two is equal to zero.

593
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,970
The summer fall,
the MC Delta t zero.

594
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,290
Wow.

595
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,800
This is the gain of heat of the water.

596
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,540
This if you work it out,

597
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:52,020
we'll be a negative number because you
can see [inaudible] is below initial t.

598
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,920
This will turn out to be negative and
the positive and negative will add up to

599
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:58,970
zero. So what does it
you don't know? Well,

600
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:02,390
you know the mass of the
water specifically to
water is one by definition.

601
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,970
The final anti want to measure it,
but thermometers,

602
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,780
mass of letters for you to measure.
These are known. You can find c,

603
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,700
so this is a birthday present for you
guys. If you ever see this in an exam,

604
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,910
jump on this first because you've
been doing this in high school.

605
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:21,650
I know kids love this kind
of calorimeter problems. Yes,

606
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,330
I'm looking at the volume and expands
linear labor wasn't the problem with the

607
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,420
liquid bettering liquid volume.

608
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,310
Yes,
that's correct.

609
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,420
So the real point is if
everything expanded linearly,

610
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,390
we won't have the disagreement between
between different thermometers.

611
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,930
So it turns out to an
excellent approximation.

612
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,450
The channel length is
proportional to the length,

613
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,270
but it's not exactly proportional to that
will be terms involving higher power.

614
00:39:57,271 --> 00:40:02,070
So like not only that specific either
materials is also not a constant.

615
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,810
We say specifically the waters one, it
turns out at a certain temperature range,

616
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:09,840
it will be one at a different
range. In fact, it's not quite one.

617
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,050
I totally long back.
Everything I tell you is wrong.

618
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,590
It's the question is how many decimal
places do you have to go to before you

619
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:21,240
honored my fallacies? Personally,
keep materials is not a constant.

620
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,430
It's a big industry.

621
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,770
Calculating the specific heat of
materials starting from atoms and quantum

622
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:26,604
mechanics.

623
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,440
So none of the things treated
as constants that ever constant,

624
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,690
including two alphas and Betas.

625
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,550
I can always find it by saying Alpha
itself may depend on the temperature and

626
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:40,410
also the dependence on element.
I'd be linear,

627
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,320
but you should also look at dimensional
considerations and say if it's not l if

628
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,760
you want to put an l square in the as
a correction to the formula to mass the

629
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:53,220
units, the l squared has to be divided
by another length to keep the units.

630
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,390
What are the links do we have? It may
turn out to be the intro comic spacing.

631
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,080
So once the atomic
properties come into play,

632
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,450
then you can find ways
to calculate corrections.

633
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,540
So all these laws are in fact
very tentative approximate.

634
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,120
These are pretty ancient physics. I think
the way I do the physics course here,

635
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:17,070
sometimes I'm the 1600 sometimes in the
1400 sometimes in the year 2000 so it's

636
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:20,550
going back and forth. This is way back
when people did not even know about atoms.

637
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,730
So they would try to do the best they can.

638
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,630
And what you found in empirically is that
once you find a specific heat for lead,

639
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,680
right,
you solve for it,

640
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,440
then you can do another experiment
using that value and you finally use the

641
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:37,840
right values. Delta Q does add up to
zero. Again, when you say adds up to zero,

642
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,860
accept a zero to very good approximation
during that park. Now that he parked,

643
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:46,060
when people do more than what I could
run experiments, everything has shot up.

644
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:48,971
In fact,

645
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:52,320
specific kids of art materials seem to
go to zero and yet when he approached

646
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,200
absolute temperature,

647
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,180
you have to understand the laws of
quantum physics to know why that happens.

648
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,340
Yeah,

649
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,150
so this is the period when people
are probing temperature ranges,

650
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:08,290
which are our own room temperature
are boiling and freezing point water,

651
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,910
which is a very narrow
window and temperature.

652
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,350
We look at the history of the universe.

653
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,670
You've got incredibly high temperatures
near the Big Bang and even now the rest

654
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:19,510
of the is bait at some temperature.
That happens to be very, very low,

655
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,860
which is near three degrees.

656
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,890
It's called the black body
radiation from the big bang.

657
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:28,030
So the temperature of the universe goes
through huge ranges and only when you

658
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:31,390
probe different ranges you see different
physics. If you come to Sloan lab,

659
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:35,830
you can go to temperatures were below
one degree Kelvin or hundreds of Calvin

660
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,150
and we heard a talk last year
physics that 1 billion of a Calvin.

661
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,770
Do you want to cool them and cool
Devon cooldown zero degrees Kelvin.

662
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,070
See that I go zero.
Kelvin is a barrier.

663
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:51,190
We're not able to cross just like the
velocity of light is something we are not

664
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:54,820
able to cross.
You said our big surprises,

665
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,410
the fact that velocity has an upper limit,
not obvious even to Newton. Why not?

666
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,810
Why not put rockets and Papa rockets?

667
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,140
Likewise when I build better
than better refrigerators,

668
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,740
the reason you cannot go below
zero is when you go to zero.

669
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,520
All the mechanical attributes
like pressure simply
vanish and they cannot have

670
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:13,360
negative values.

671
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,040
You will see more about this when you
understand he in greater depth anyway.

672
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,860
Right now Delta Q equals
zero is the rule you use.

673
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,950
I'm sure you guys know how
to do these problems. No,

674
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,580
that is a little twist that comes in.
I just want to mention that to you.

675
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,670
The twist is the following, so
I take some ice ice. By the way,

676
00:43:33,671 --> 00:43:35,810
it's not always at zero.
You know you can go below zero,

677
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:39,370
your refrigerators several degrees
below a several tens below zero.

678
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,720
So let's take ice and let me measure.

679
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,210
I take this container, I put some
ice, I'd say minus 30 degrees.

680
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,160
I've gone to San Degrade now so we can
relate to ice and I put it on some source

681
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:00,190
of heat and I watch how
many calories are coming in.

682
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,120
Let me add in the device that'll pump in
a fixed number of calories every second.

683
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,070
So that's a function of
time. I'm expecting the
temperature of this to go up.

684
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Do you understand that in every second
I get some number of calories and those

685
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:20,530
number of calories that are going
to produce for me and see Delta p,

686
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,910
m and C and constants. So Delta Q
is proportionally developed a t.

687
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,850
If you divide both by the time elapsed
and the rate at which the temperature

688
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:34,760
rises will be the rated with the heat
flows into the system if see it displaying

689
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:38,070
at a steady rate, temperature
should rise and indeed it does.

690
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,750
Temperature of the ice goes from minus
30 to minus 20 to minus 10 and so on.

691
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,600
But once it hits zero,
it gets stuck.

692
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,900
I know heat that's coming in,
but it's not getting harder.

693
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,680
But I notice that the
ice is beginning to melt.

694
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:03,070
That will be a period between here
and here. When I pump in calories,

695
00:45:03,071 --> 00:45:06,790
I don't get any increase in temperature,
but I get conversion of ice into water

696
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,120
and that'd be a PD.
And when this guy,

697
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,270
I looked like some water with
some chunks of ice floating on it,

698
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,760
and until all the ice
is converted to water,

699
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
the whole system is stuck
at that temperature.

700
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,570
That's a very interesting property.
You know,

701
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:31,590
if you really took a real pot
and you put a chunk of ice on it,

702
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,930
you know what will happen, right?
The bottom of the ice will melt.

703
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,080
It may even evaporate.
That's not what I'm talking,

704
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:40,020
but because that's not a system where
there's a globally defined temperature.

705
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,250
I want you to hit the ISO slowly. The
minute you put a little bit of calories,

706
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,000
give it enough time for all these guys
to share that heat so that the whole

707
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:53,001
system has one single common temperature
and let's watch the temperature rise.

708
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:57,360
I'm saying it gets stuck at zero, but
your calories are getting you something.

709
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,230
They're converting ice into
water. Then you can ask, okay,

710
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:02,880
what penalty do I have to pay?

711
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,790
That's called the latent
heat of melting and again,

712
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:10,730
I know only in calories per gram.
It's 80 calories per gram for waters.

713
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,380
Some of your Delta Q now goes
not to raise the temperature.

714
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,250
What do melt? Some amount of stuff, uh,

715
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,320
at the latent heat of melting,
that's so much.

716
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:28,000
Q you need to melt that.

717
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:31,720
I'm on the stuff and the El
varies from substance a substance,

718
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,580
but water is 80 calories per gram.

719
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:38,140
If you want to melt mercury from
solid medicare, the liquid mercury,

720
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:39,010
it'll have a different number.

721
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,590
Then once everybody has become water,

722
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,370
then that uniform system of
water and started growing

723
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,550
and this is called a phase change.

724
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,630
Face changes when it changes its atomic
arrangement from a regular airwaves,

725
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,880
for example, the forms a solid
into a liquid in a solid,

726
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:04,220
everybody has this place,
you can shake it around where you are,

727
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,690
but liquid you can run around

728
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,260
the specific heat of eyes is not the
same as the specific heat of water,

729
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,430
so you've got to be careful. Even though
it's still made up of water molecules,

730
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,740
the calories needed to
hit one grammar wise,

731
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,110
roughly half of what it takes
to heat one gram of water.

732
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,980
So in these problems don't
make the mistake. Okay.

733
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:27,860
Then you go along and I guess you
know what the next stopping point is.

734
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:30,940
When you come to 100 degrees again,
it gets stuck,

735
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,300
delay everybody flip prices
and then you get steam.

736
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,610
Then you can have super heated steam,

737
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,040
which is even higher
than a hundred degrees,

738
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,040
so that's the latent heat of vaporization.

739
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,470
I really don't want even
want to write something.

740
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,230
I think it's 500 and something
calories for the brand.

741
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,410
That's information I
don't carry in my head

742
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,183
so you can,

743
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,560
if I tell you I took some ice at minus
30 and I dumped in 5,000 calories,

744
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,180
where will it end up?

745
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,210
You've got the first spend a few
calories going from here to here.

746
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:08,150
You've got some more money left.
You can start melting this.

747
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,010
Maybe you'll run out of stuff there.

748
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,670
Then that's what you will have some
amount of water and some are more device.

749
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:16,970
You got even more
calories at your disposal.

750
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,830
You can melt it all and start heating it.

751
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,280
You may come this way and you may
be running out of calories if not,

752
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:24,050
keep going here and there and there.

753
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,910
You may end up there if you've got enough
calories or one can ask a question,

754
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,740
how many calories does it take to convert
ice at minus 30 to say water and a

755
00:48:33,741 --> 00:48:35,090
hundred we'll will have to hit.

756
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,480
You'll have to do the MC Delta t for
that m times the latent heat for this Mc

757
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,790
Delta t for that and m times latent
heat of vaporization for that.

758
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,460
So the kind of problems you can get
are fairly simple most of the time.

759
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,160
Yeah.

760
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,070
Only kind of problem where you can
really get in trouble is the following.

761
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,980
I will mention that to you.
Suppose I take some water and some ice.

762
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,180
So this is zero.
The Isis,

763
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:10,650
I'd say minus 40 water.
This at plus eight in fact,

764
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:12,300
let me make that also at plus 40

765
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,500
I bring them together and
ask you what will happen.

766
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,770
No, this is the subtle
problem. If, if you had to,

767
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,050
if he had water that party and he had
water the 20 you can easily guessed that

768
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:32,100
it'll end up somewhere in between.
You can calculate that was more subtle.

769
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,930
You've got water at 40 you've got ice
at minus 40 you bring them together and

770
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:41,190
ask what happens? Well, the answer will
depend on how much of this stuff you have.

771
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,190
If by water at 40 you mean
the Atlantic Ocean and bay.

772
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,630
I assume in a couple of ice cubes,
we know what's going to happen.

773
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,000
These guys are going to get clobbered.
They're going to melt.

774
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,500
You will end up somewhere here.

775
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,050
Then you can easily calculate the
final temperature by saying mc time,

776
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:03,051
this Delta t for water in magnitude
is going to be the he'd given to this.

777
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,810
He'd given to this as the MC Delta t
to come here than the heat to melt some

778
00:50:08,811 --> 00:50:12,240
more device than the heat to raise
this amount of water to that final

779
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:15,090
temperature. Then you can solve
for the final temperature.

780
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,690
So if you want to solve this problem
and I give you some mass for this ice of

781
00:50:21,691 --> 00:50:23,700
water and I give you
some mass for the ice,

782
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,830
you can first make the optimistic
assumption that you will end as water,

783
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,000
but at an unknown temperature, we
call it unknown temperature. T.

784
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,050
This is the t one.

785
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:37,730
This is the t to write your equations
except you like one more term there.

786
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,480
That's the heater takes to
melt the ice you solve for t.

787
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:42,860
If you get a positive answer,

788
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,580
you can use it because he's assumption
that you ended up on water meant you hit

789
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,540
it up.
The ISU melted the ice in the water,

790
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:53,750
then he hit it up the water
from zero to the final water.

791
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,290
But if it did the calculation
got a negative value of t.

792
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,670
That answer cannot be blindly used
because the assumption that you're on the

793
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:06,120
other side of ice is wrong. Then
you can try something else. Uh,

794
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,000
you can assume you're down here.
If you think you're down here,

795
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,140
then you'll simply heated
the ice from here to here.

796
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:19,880
This water you're brought down to
zero sucked out MC Delta t from that,

797
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:23,060
then you've taken out now
the latent heat of melting.

798
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:28,040
You take out heat when you freeze and
then you'd take an even more to come down

799
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:28,670
here.

800
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,450
Then all those losses of the original
water is equal to the gain of the size.

801
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,350
You can assume it here, you can solve
for this STI when you solve for this tea.

802
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,730
If you've got a negative number, then
you're okay. That will be good assumption.

803
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,850
If I say I sprinkled two drops
of water on a big iceberg,

804
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,030
we know it's going to end up his eyes
and that's a good starting point.

805
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,000
But if I give you a numbers
which are kind of wishy washy,

806
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:53,300
but I don't know whether this
will win or that will win,

807
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,950
that is the third possibility.

808
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,650
The third possibility is at the end
of the day you ended up here with some

809
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,050
amount of water and some of
them are device at zero degrees,

810
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,260
so that's a third option. You may have
to consider if neither of them works,

811
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,660
then the question is not what
is the final temperature,

812
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,890
but what's the question then what
do you want to know in that case,

813
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,590
how much his eyes and how much is water?
That's the question

814
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,020
and there are several ways to figure
that out. Let me just say in words,

815
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,500
I don't want to do this Algebra because
for you guys should be fairly easy.

816
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,400
If it's the question of suppose
both of the things I try fail.

817
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:43,210
I took a positive t as soon as I'm up
here and I assume the ice melted and they

818
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:44,900
get a negative answer that shot down.

819
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,410
You take a negative t and assume
everybody froze and that doesn't work.

820
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,980
Then I'm down to this option which is
some amount of water and some are more

821
00:52:51,981 --> 00:52:54,350
device and the question
is how much is left?

822
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,380
You solved that by doing the following.

823
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,210
You say all this eyes
went from here to there.

824
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:07,680
It does that by absorbing that MC,
Delta t you know,

825
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,430
massive VI's and specifically
device times delta t,

826
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,280
maybe it was minus 40
the Delta t is plus 40

827
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,230
you give that heat to this guy
that hit you suck out of this guy.

828
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,100
When you suck that out of this guy
first you'll bring this to zero.

829
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,100
Then you still have some more
heat you can extract from.

830
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:30,470
You will use that to convert water into
ice at the price of 80 calories per

831
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,644
gram.

832
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,120
Maybe you can freeze five grams
or five kilograms of water.

833
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,050
That'd be the extra eyes lest we be.
Whatever water you started with,

834
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,370
the total mass will be the same.
But if you've got 60 grams of water,

835
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,810
you bring the 60 grams to zero and you
still have some more heat to be extracted.

836
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,410
Maybe you'll convert 10 grams to
ice and 50 will remain is water.

837
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,920
So the final answer will
be 50 grams of water,

838
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,430
10 grams of ice plus whatever
grams of ice you started with.

839
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,150
That's what the most complex
heat exchange problem.

840
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,260
If you guys want me to tell you some
more, I will add. I can, we'll want,

841
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,590
I don't know what your you on this.
Do you understand what you have to do?

842
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,530
Any it's problem.
Okay,

843
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,500
so it's the conservation
of a heat that's applied.

844
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,690
So the most tricky part is phase change.
When you got to face change,

845
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,510
you got to remember that the Formula Mc,

846
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:35,470
Delta t delta Q has one more
term that one more turn is this.

847
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,770
Okay.
So next question we ask is

848
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,030
what's the mandate in which
he managed this to flow?

849
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,080
We say you've got this calories man.
How does it flow? What the rate is,

850
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,130
what makes it flow?

851
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:00,140
So it turns out that are the
popular ways where he transferred.

852
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,300
One is called radiation.

853
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,913
Yeah,

854
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,510
radiation.
This,

855
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:12,511
when the heat energy leaves some hot
body and comes to you without the benefit

856
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,780
of any medium like heat from the sun,

857
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,750
so that's really
electromagnetic radiation.

858
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,140
That comes from heart glowing objects
and that actually comes to you and

859
00:55:26,141 --> 00:55:30,040
electromagnetic radiation doesn't need
air, doesn't need anything. In fact,

860
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:30,701
if it needed it,

861
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:34,300
we will not get any heat from the
sun because there is no medium,

862
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,010
which means the earth and the sun.
Most of it just back here.

863
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,900
If you'd pick one of these space heaters,
no,

864
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:43,900
with glowing red cars and you feel warm.

865
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,810
If I pump start pumping the or bedroom,

866
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,870
of course you will be dying very rapidly,
but your last thoughts will be,

867
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:57,250
I am still warm because the
radiation will keep coming to you.

868
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:03,040
Okay. That's radiation heat that
are lots of laws for radiation.

869
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,720
I don't want to give them to you because
there are formulas memorized. Memorize.

870
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,020
Do. You don't understand too much of the
physics right now other than to say it's

871
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,630
electromagnetic radiation, whatever that
means. We haven't gotten to that yet.

872
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:16,120
That's what comes from there to here.
It can come and back.

873
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,910
Vacuum doesn't need a medium is the key.

874
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,180
Then the second way of heat
transfer is called convection.

875
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,190
So convection is explained by this
following example. You got water,

876
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,690
you put it on a hot plate.
Then in the lower part of it,

877
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,990
the water gets hot.
When it gets hot,

878
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,290
it expands and when it expands,
the density goes down.

879
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,640
Therefore by boy lasa buoyancy,
it will start raising up.

880
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,660
Remember I chunk of
water belongs in water.

881
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,690
I chunk of something else who lower
density will float to the top,

882
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,650
but the point is water doesn't have
a fixed density. If you heat it up,

883
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:00,490
the density goes down. So the water
guys downstairs have a lower density.

884
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:04,690
They're like a piece of cork. They will
rise to the top. When the rise to the top,

885
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:08,230
the cold water with the
higher density will fall down,

886
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:12,790
so you will set a bit color
hot races to the drop in.

887
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,600
Coal comes down and this also happens
in the atmosphere. On a hot day,

888
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,870
the ad next to the ground gets really
heated up and it rises in the call.

889
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,690
That comes down and they
set up this thermal cards.

890
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,010
So here you're trying to equalize the
temperature between a region which is

891
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:31,630
called in the region, which is heart
by the actual motion off some material.

892
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:39,160
In radiation you don't have the medium
transferring heat because the medium is

893
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:43,750
not even present in radiation. In
convection, the medium actually moves.

894
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,990
The hot guys physically moved to the
other players in the coal guys come here

895
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,270
and by that process the
heat is transferred.

896
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,960
Heat transfer I want us to focus on
is a little more quantitatively is

897
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:56,794
conduction.

898
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,650
So heat conduction is something
you've all experienced.

899
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:10,820
I mean if you have a skillet, why does
it have a wooden handle? Simple reason.

900
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,920
If you had a steel handle,

901
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,420
okay,
you

902
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,740
put it on the hot stove
and you put your hand here,

903
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,810
the fact that your body is at whatever
98 degrees and this one has gotten us 200

904
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:25,390
degrees, you're going to have
heat flow from here to here.

905
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,610
So we want to understand what's the
rated with heat flows from hot end of the

906
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:35,500
colon. So you can imagine that
rod of some cross section,

907
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,530
a one end of the ride isn't
some reservoirs at some
temperature t one other than

908
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:43,900
there's a temperature t too.
By the way,

909
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:45,880
I'm not introducing a new
term called reservoir.

910
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,590
Reservoir is another body like you and me,
except it's not like you and me.

911
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:55,000
It's enormous. It is so big that
it's temperature cannot be changed.

912
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,600
You can sit on it,
you will fry and you'll evaporate,

913
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:02,650
but it's temperature will not change.
Nobody's really a reservoir.

914
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,990
If you drop an ice cube in the Atlantic,

915
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,490
you lower the temperature of the
Atlantic but were negligible amount.

916
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:12,220
So take the limit of Atlantic, goes to
infinity, then you have a reservoir.

917
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,910
So reservoirs have one label,
namely what? Cyber temperature.

918
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,690
So something big enough can be,
this room is like a reservoir.

919
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:23,480
You put a cup of coffee, you say
it, it'll come to room temperature.

920
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,970
Actually they don't temporaries
that meets the coffee,

921
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:29,240
not halfway but slightly up.
Right.

922
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,330
But the room is large enough so that we
can attribute to the room temperature,

923
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,520
quite independent of bodies
that go in and out of it.

924
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:40,370
So this is connected on the left during
the anonymous tank of maybe a water ice

925
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:45,320
mixture at zero degrees. This is a
water steam mixture, maybe 100 degrees.

926
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,910
You put a rod there.

927
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,460
We know he is going to flow from the
heart body from the heartland of the cold

928
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:55,461
end and we wanted write a formula
for how much heat flows per second.

929
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,800
Again, I'm going to write these
formulas over and over again.

930
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,200
You got to ask yourself
what will it depend on?

931
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,800
What are the properties
it'll depend on in general,

932
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:11,950
independent of what the rod is
made of. Can you think of one? Yes.

933
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:19,520
You said the cross section of where
did we say what reason can you give for

934
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,354
cross?

935
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,183
Yes,

936
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:30,973
yes.

937
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,040
Okay. Let me repeat this argument. You
take one ride, I put convenience listed.

938
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:39,270
Just take it to be a rectangular rod.
Take another Rod, rectangular Rod.

939
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:42,300
They will both transfer the same amount
of heat for a given amount of time.

940
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,570
Just glue them together and say,
here is my new rod.

941
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,750
We know it's going to transmit
twice the amount of heat,

942
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,930
so it's going to be proportional.
The area and why is the heat flowing?

943
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,500
It's flowing because of a temperature
difference, so that's always there.

944
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,780
That's the underlying
force for heat transfer.

945
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:04,770
That's the dynamics in thermodynamics.
That's what makes the heat flow,

946
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:11,120
but then we find as an empirical fact
that if these two reservoirs were

947
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:15,390
separated by that distance,

948
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,240
then the heat flow is a lot
less than when they are closer.

949
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,700
It seems to depend on how much temperature
differences packed in spatially,

950
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,890
so you want to divide by Delta
x is not infinite decimal.

951
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:34,020
It's the length of the rod separating
the heart and cold hands. In other words,

952
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,390
if you dilute the temperature
difference over one mile,

953
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,670
the heat flow will be
correspondingly reduced.

954
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,360
Whereas the pursuit temperature
difference between a very small spatial

955
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:45,810
separation, that'd be very robust flow
of heat. That's what we were saying.

956
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,030
This happened to be true.

957
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:53,150
You realize independent of what material
I'm talking about when I said one rod

958
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:57,060
was one rod is arts. It doesn't
matter what it's made of. Again,

959
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,720
having put all these factors,
which you can argue on general grounds,

960
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,460
you have to now ask
what happens when this,

961
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,090
the copper rod versus silver
rod versus wouldn't drive.

962
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,480
So you've got to put one more number,
which is capped by here,

963
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,900
not care you guys kappa
and it's called the uh,

964
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,790
the thermal conductivity of that material.

965
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,620
Sometimes you put a minus sign,

966
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,470
a minus sign just means
it flows from hot to cold.

967
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:34,460
I don't care whether you put the plus
sign or don't put the minus sign.

968
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:38,000
Anybody knows that the heat is
going to flow from hot to cold.

969
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,030
So just remember that, that action
of flow and that's all I had a board,

970
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,050
the sign here, this cap buys
the property of the material.

971
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,300
Once again, let me tell
you, you can say, well, uh,

972
01:02:50,301 --> 01:02:54,320
I had two reservoirs, hot and cold. I
connected them with two different rods.

973
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,660
This rod carry twice the amount of heat,

974
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,790
but a second I see other rock
isn't necessarily better conductor.

975
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,580
No,
maybe it had 10,000 times across section.

976
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:09,740
So what do you want to do is to make the
playing field level and compare rots at

977
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:13,100
the same cross section. Same
temperature difference, same length.

978
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,690
Then ask who conducts more heat.

979
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,040
That depends on the material and that's
the thing you pulled out specific to the

980
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:22,830
material that is a
property of water, copper,

981
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,350
steel as the heat conductivity.

982
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:32,380
Okay.
Now final topic.

983
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,980
Is this going to be more of a hand waving?

984
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:35,620
Now I don't want to get
into too many details.

985
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,050
It really has to do
with the water is heat.

986
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:45,390
The old days people just said it's a
fluid and they postulated the conservation

987
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:47,970
law for the fluid.
You can postulate what you want.

988
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:51,510
You got to make sure that it works and
it seems to work in the sense that all

989
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:53,700
the delta cues in any
reaction add up to zero,

990
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:00,350
but then people were getting hints that
maybe this thing that we call heat is

991
01:04:01,321 --> 01:04:03,750
not entirely independent of
other things we have learned.

992
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,820
So where do you get the clue? One clue
is long back when we studied mechanics,

993
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,040
we talk about two cars. They come and
collide. They slam into one big lump.

994
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,880
Now you've got no kinetic energy,
no potential energy.

995
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:20,880
Potential energy is always zero.
They're moving on the same height.

996
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,900
Kinetic energy was one half MBA squared
for this one, half MV squared for that.

997
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:29,310
At the end there's nothing, no kinetic,
no potential. We just gave up and said,

998
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:33,720
look, conservation of energy
doesn't apply to this problem.

999
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,670
We just say it's in the lasting.
On the other hand,

1000
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:43,671
we find whenever that happens
we find the bodies become hot.

1001
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,610
Here's another thing you can do.
It can take a cannon ball,

1002
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,150
drop it from a big tower, the south.
Some people in the French army,

1003
01:04:51,151 --> 01:04:54,330
I think first detected this feature.
You drop cannon balls from a big height.

1004
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,470
When they hit the sand,

1005
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,500
they start heating up or you drill a hole
in the canon that what counts somebody

1006
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:01,500
did,

1007
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,760
and you also notice that
you need to constantly pour
water to keep the drill bit

1008
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:06,594
from heating up.

1009
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:12,570
You find very often mechanical
energy is lost and things heat up,

1010
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:16,410
so you get a suspicion,
whatever the underlying mechanism,

1011
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,200
maybe that is a rule that says if you
lose so much mechanical energy that you

1012
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:24,250
cannot account for, then it translates
into a fixed number of calories.

1013
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,440
If that is the case,

1014
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,860
then we'll at least get a dictionary
on between calories and Jules.

1015
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:37,360
So Jules is energy.
You can see calories as energy.

1016
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:39,460
You cannot see that was
going to be the premise.

1017
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,580
But first you've got to prove that every
time you lose some number of jewels,

1018
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:47,290
you get a fixed amount of calories
and that experiment is do the jewel,

1019
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,460
is a jewel experiment. It's very, very
simple and tells you the whole story.

1020
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:59,800
You have a little container
in with that is a pattern.

1021
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:05,710
This is a shop with a pulley.
And then so wait here.

1022
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,740
So I try to imagine this guys,

1023
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:13,480
you got rope wrapped around the top pulley
and when you let this weight go down,

1024
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,930
you're going to go down like this.
It's going to spend the shop.

1025
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,580
I put some water in here and I have
some friends that are sticking out,

1026
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:26,200
so the return up the water,
so it's like this thing,

1027
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,800
the egg beater, right? In fact, I try to
do the experiment with the egg beater,

1028
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:34,780
the summer to a bunch of high school
kids and I got totally humiliated because

1029
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:38,620
nothing happened as planned,
okay? But the idea is the same.

1030
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:40,420
You agitate the water in some fashion,

1031
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,210
but this guy did it in
a particular simple way.

1032
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,970
My egg bidding was not good enough.
You'll see them maybe in a while.

1033
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:49,630
Why that's not good.
What he did was to put these parents,

1034
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,210
let the weight go down from there to here.

1035
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,450
Now we can keep track of how much
mechanical energy is lost, right?

1036
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,080
Because of this mass was
addressed and it dropped the hide.

1037
01:07:02,081 --> 01:07:05,710
AMG dropped high date.
It's supposed to have MGH can energy.

1038
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,910
Let's say it's got some kinetic energy,
which is not equal.

1039
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:14,560
The MGH MGH minus kinetic
energy is missing.

1040
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:20,530
Some number of jewels are gone.
The water gets hot.

1041
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,050
When the water gets hot,

1042
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:27,160
you can immediately ask how many
calories was supplied the water,

1043
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,370
because that water,
it heats up the same way.

1044
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:33,940
Whether or not you put it on a hot
plate or whether or not you churn.

1045
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,300
It doesn't seem to depend on how it
got hard. This has the same effect.

1046
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:40,030
This is water is hard in every real sense.

1047
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,020
So you must have put some calories so you
can find out how many calories you put

1048
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:46,510
in by looking at the
master water specifically,

1049
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:49,630
the water is one looking at
the increase in temperature.

1050
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,980
So some jewels are missing, some
calories have been pumped into the water.

1051
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,640
The new ask is of a proportionality
between jewels and the calories.

1052
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:01,690
And you find that is,

1053
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:07,570
and that happens to be four
points to Jewel's for a candidate.

1054
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,010
In other words, if you can expand
4.2 joules of mechanical energy,

1055
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,750
you got yourself one calorie to be
used for whatever heating purposes.

1056
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,210
So in the example of the collide in cars,

1057
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:28,550
this had some energy that has some energy,

1058
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:31,070
all measured in juggles the
slam together they come to rest.

1059
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,000
That means you can take
those many jingles,

1060
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,560
divide by 4.2 and get
some number of calories.

1061
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,230
Imagine the whole car
is made out of copper.

1062
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,800
Then those calories will produce
an increase in temperature,

1063
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,340
right equal to Delta Q is Mc,
Delta t.

1064
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:50,370
That will be the rising
temperature of the car. In fact,

1065
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:52,700
there'll be other losses because
you heard the sound well,

1066
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:55,880
that's some energy gone. You won't get
it back. Maybe it sparks are flying.

1067
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:58,880
That light energy that's gone.
If it's a project all that out,

1068
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:04,570
you find that in the end the calories
explain the missing jewels so that made

1069
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:10,100
people think
that this is just another form of energy

1070
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:15,050
because if you add this
to your energy balance,

1071
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:18,770
there is no reason to go on apologizing
for the law of conservation of energy.

1072
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:23,240
Law of conservation of energy is not
in fact violated even at the inelastic

1073
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:24,020
collisions.

1074
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:29,020
If you include heat as a form of energy
and the conversion factor is 4.2 joules

1075
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:34,220
per calorie, but the question is,
what right do you have to call it?

1076
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:36,740
Energy.
Energy.

1077
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:39,650
We think primarily when he says
somebody is energetic, give me that.

1078
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:41,960
Someone's running around my
endlessly back and forth.

1079
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,030
Entities associated with motion.

1080
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,870
These two cars were moving and where
every right to say they have energy.

1081
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,360
How about potential energy will live.

1082
01:09:50,361 --> 01:09:53,060
This star card starts climbing
up the hill and slows down.

1083
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,850
We think it's got potential.
You let it go.

1084
01:09:55,851 --> 01:09:59,220
It'll come back and give you the kinetic
energy. So most people's idea of energy,

1085
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,030
just candidate energy that is lost

1086
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,910
and yet you get calories in return.
So you ask yourself, what can it be?

1087
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:08,691
Well,

1088
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:11,990
the correct answer to that came only when
we understood that everything is made

1089
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:16,520
up of atoms. Once you grant that,
everything is made up of Adams.

1090
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,960
Then it turns out that kinetic
energy of Adams is what we call heat,

1091
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,110
but it can be very careful.
Take a tank full of gas.

1092
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:32,930
I throw it at you. That whole tank is
moving. That's not what I call heat.

1093
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,480
Okay.
That motion,

1094
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,990
you can see I'm talking about a tank
of gas that doesn't seem to be going

1095
01:10:38,991 --> 01:10:40,850
anywhere yet.

1096
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,910
It got motional energy because the
little guys are going back and forth.

1097
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,070
So what we will find this,

1098
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:51,071
what I'm going to show you next time is
that if you kept track of the kinetic

1099
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:54,800
energy of every single
molecule in this car,

1100
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:59,780
every single molecule in that car
before and after, and you added them up,

1101
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,370
you will get exactly the same number.

1102
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:07,870
The only difference will be originally
the car has got global common velocity,

1103
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,800
macroscopic velocity.
You can see on top of it,

1104
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,980
it's random motion of the molecules that
make up the car. So does the other car,

1105
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,270
when they slam together,

1106
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:22,250
the macroscopic motion is completely gone
and all the motion is thermal motion,

1107
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:26,310
but it's still Kennedy, Kennedy. And
that's what we will see the next time.
