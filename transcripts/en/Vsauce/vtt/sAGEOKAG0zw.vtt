00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:08.380
Hey, Vsauce, Michael here,
and today we are going to ask a question—

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.583
why don't any animals
have wheels?

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:17.273
I mean, animals use a plethora
of complicated locomotive techniques—

00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:21.917
slithering, fins, legs, wings—

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:25.376
but yet, no animal has wheels.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:28.395
What's really paradoxical
about this question

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:32.017
is that us humans seem
pretty technologically advanced.

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:35.775
We've mastered the wheel,
but we have yet to design something

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.817
that fully takes advantage
of the limb,

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:42.996
which is why this contraption seems
so eerie.

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:45.825
It may be the closest we have come
to mimicking

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.888
what nature is already
quite natural with.

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:53.603
Of course, nature,
the source of these miraculous limbs

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:55.832
that we have yet
to adequately reproduce,

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:58.920
doesn't use wheels.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.401
The wheel gives a mechanical advantage
to the user,

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:06.280
allowing them to move heavy things
more easily,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.387
but if the wheel is so simple
and seems like such a no-brainer,

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.975
why don't any animals have them?

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.992
Well, to be sure, let's take a look
at the wheel spider.

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:20.774
When escaping from a predator,
this spider will turn its body

00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:24.369
into what is essentially a tire
rolling downhill.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.970
And who can forget tumbleweeds?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.360
These things roll around in the wind,
spreading seeds everywhere.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.745
An even crappier example
is the dung beetle,

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:37.716
who takes pieces of poop
and turns them into rollable balls

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:39.716
that can be easily moved.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.814
But those are examples of rolling,
not wheels

00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:44.814
as we are looking for them today.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.782
Wheels on axles—
something that's a part of a whole,

00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:51.243
but yet exists independently of it

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.816
and can spin indefinitely
in one direction

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:55.905
without having
to wind itself back again.

00:01:55.905 --> 00:02:00.284
Bacterial flagella
actually operate in this manner,

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:03.581
but we don't see it
in any larger life form,

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.459
which brings us to the first problem
of finding wheels on animals.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.685
How can a living wheel
be completely separate from the animal

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:14.726
and still receive nutrients
and expel waste?

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:17.954
Or, if that wheel was made
out of a dead material

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.601
the animal produced,
like fingernails or hair,

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.387
how would it build
into the shape of a wheel

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:26.707
while maintaining separation
from the host?

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:30.585
For that matter,
how does developing a wheel

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:33.348
on your body
help you along the way?

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:36.158
I mean, look at a giraffe—
having a neck

00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:38.982
that's just a little bit longer
still means

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:41.351
that you'll be able to reach food
that's a bit higher,

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:43.766
you'll have more food,
will live longer,

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:47.457
and will have more babies,
making longer necks more common.

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:52.055
But if your mutation is a wheel
that's only a little bit round,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:54.237
it doesn't provide the same benefit.

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:58.695
It doesn't equal you making
more babies.

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:01.017
And as much as I hate
to admit it,

00:03:01.017 --> 00:03:04.779
the wheel may be
a bit overrated.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.519
Think of it this way—
in order for a wheel

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.421
to be useful for movement,
it sort of requires

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.439
a prior invention—
roads.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.574
Without a smooth surface
to roll on,

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:19.987
like a road or rails,
the wheel falls short,

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:23.656
and wings and fins and limbs
do a better job

00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:26.137
for the terrain found
on Earth.

00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:28.831
Even when humans knew
about the wheel,

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:31.756
they had little use for it
across rough terrain

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.868
or muddy, debris-ridden streets,

00:03:34.868 --> 00:03:37.213
which is why wealthy people
in the past

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:40.812
simply got carried around
in litter—

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:43.505
no, not rubbish—
a litter,

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:48.149
a vehicle that uses no wheels
and is carried by people or animals.

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.378
Fancy, rich people
would get carried around

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:53.071
in chair sedans,
but another type of litter

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:55.416
was simply a sling
made out of fabric

00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:57.599
that would help you carry, say,
wounded soldiers

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.828
across the terrain
of a battlefield.

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:03.473
The modern-day stretcher is an example
of a litter.

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:07.557
Okay, so in order for the wheels
on your body to be useful,

00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:09.557
you have to build roads.

00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:13.060
So what gives, animals?
Why didn't you ever build roads?

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.009
I mean, you guys are capable
of some pretty awesome things—

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.399
complicated burrows,
nests, dams—

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.744
why didn't you ever build roads?

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:25.389
Well, this question is fundamental
to Richard Dawkins' analysis

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.479
of the wheeled animal problem.

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.033
He says that the problem
with roads

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:33.376
is that they're not selfish enough.

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:37.463
A nest, a burrow, a dam—
these are things that you can defend;

00:04:37.463 --> 00:04:40.226
that you can build
and then only use for your own benefit.

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:44.266
Because hey, you were smart enough
and industrious enough to build it,

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:47.703
but roads can be used
by anything that stumbles upon it.

00:04:47.703 --> 00:04:52.416
I mean, you lost energy
and resources to build that road,

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:55.434
while a moocher can just come up
and use it anyway

00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:59.219
and have time left
to make a bunch of babies and prosper.

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.230
So the road is a really cool example
of how humans got benefits

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.290
from breaking the mold
and doing things

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.866
not just for themselves,
but for everyone.

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:12.838
In fact, of all the animals,
only humans

00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:16.878
have ever invented taxes—
money that we force others to pay

00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:19.641
to build services
that they might not even use.

00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:23.193
So the next time you see a wheel,
say, "Thanks, wheel.

00:05:23.193 --> 00:05:26.096
"You're a great symbol of the fact
that humans can cooperate

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:28.096
and be unselfish."

00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:30.298
And as always,
thanks for watching.

00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:32.481
I wheel-y mean that.
