00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.635
On Saturday, the presidency

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.570
of Donald Trump
passed the 100 day mark,

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:05.972
meaning this prank
has officially

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.640
gone on for way too long.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.108
(laughter)

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.309
With the Donald unable

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:12.178
to get much of his agenda
through Congress,

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.047
he's fallen back
on what he does best--

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.082
bull(bleep)
about how great he is.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.950
-(laughter)
-He's the best. Just ask him.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:19.719
In fact, though the next

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.621
presidential election is still
three and a half years away,

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.724
his 2020 campaign
is spending $1.5 million

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.459
to run this ad
touting his accomplishments.

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:30.696
MAN: Donald Trump, sworn in
 as president 100 days ago.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.866
 America has rarely
 seen such success.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.602
 A respected Supreme Court
 justice confirmed.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.906
 Companies investing
 in American jobs again.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.341
-(laughter)
-Doesn't that...?

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.645
That sounds like the action
news guy voice, doesn't it?

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.613
It wasn't the only
newsworthy piece of video

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.915
about the 100-day milestone.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.183
In yet another instance

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.518
of the most over reported
political story of the year,

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:56.556
ABC went to the Midwest to check
in with working class voters.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.891
If you had to give a grade,
what would it be?

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.294
Um, I think
I would give him a B-plus.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.396
-B-plus? And why is that?
-Yeah.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.764
It's just that twittering.

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:06.332
The tweets bother you?

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.334
Well, I don't really
read 'em, so...

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.136
(laughter)

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:12.538
-(applause) -HARDWICK:
It's only a matter of time

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.540
before Trump responds
on Twitter,

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:17.110
"Hey, old bag in a diner
who gives me a B-plus,

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:20.113
-I give your dumb sweater an
'F,' Titanic lady!" -(laughter)

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.647
"Yeah, you should have followed
that necklace

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.683
"down to the bottom of the
ocean. Oh, I'm still tweeting.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.885
I'm running out
of characters."

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.854
Comedians,
what grade would you give

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.789
President Trump
on his first 100 days?

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.390
Pardis.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.392
Well, they grade restaurants
"A" to "D,"

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.628
so I'd have
to give Trump... Chipotle.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.263
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.564
(applause and cheering)

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.199
-Ana Marie.
-A.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:43.035
He is sort of skating by on
Obama's accomplishments anyway.

00:01:43.068 --> 00:01:45.938
All right, I'm gonna give you
points on there. Gina.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:49.542
-Ugh. What's the grade
you'd give dog meat? -(laughter)

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:53.079
Come on. This president has been
nothing but lips and assholes.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.512
-HARDWICK: All right. All right.
Points. -(laughter)
