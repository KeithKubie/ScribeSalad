after they've been using their watches
 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.159
after they've been using their watches
for a week so we didn't give them any

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:38.169
for a week so we didn't give them any
 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:39.779
for a week so we didn't give them any
instructions on how to set up their

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:39.789
instructions on how to set up their
 

00:07:39.789 --> 00:07:42.089
instructions on how to set up their
watch faces they customized these all on

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:42.099
watch faces they customized these all on
 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:44.100
watch faces they customized these all on
their own and I'll point out a couple of

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110
their own and I'll point out a couple of
 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.219
their own and I'll point out a couple of
interesting examples so when this watch

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:47.229
interesting examples so when this watch
 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:49.200
interesting examples so when this watch
face on the bottom the user wanted quick

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.210
face on the bottom the user wanted quick
 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.210
face on the bottom the user wanted quick
access to their music so they set a

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220
access to their music so they set a
 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.279

notification count so when user research
 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:11.899
notification count so when user research
we also learned something that

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:11.909
we also learned something that
 

00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:14.390
we also learned something that
frustrates users and that watch faces

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400
frustrates users and that watch faces
 

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.519
frustrates users and that watch faces
that look like they have complications

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:16.529
that look like they have complications
 

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.709
that look like they have complications
but the data is actually not editable

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:18.719
but the data is actually not editable
 

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:21.140
but the data is actually not editable
the users quickly become used to being

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:21.150
the users quickly become used to being
 

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.570
the users quickly become used to being
able to change the data on the watch

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580
able to change the data on the watch
 

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.089
able to change the data on the watch
faces to be whatever they want so if

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099
faces to be whatever they want so if
 

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:28.010
faces to be whatever they want so if
you're a watch face creator then don't

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020
you're a watch face creator then don't
 

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.170
you're a watch face creator then don't
just display a static set of information

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.180
just display a static set of information
 

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.389
just display a static set of information
on your watch face adopt the Android

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399
on your watch face adopt the Android
 

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:35.209
on your watch face adopt the Android
wear complication API to let your users

00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219
wear complication API to let your users
 

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:37.370

choose the data that they want to see

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380
choose the data that they want to see
 

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.860
choose the data that they want to see
and if you're an app developer then

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:39.870
and if you're an app developer then
 

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.719
and if you're an app developer then
think about what information that your

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:41.729
think about what information that your
 

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:43.579
think about what information that your
app provides that users might want to

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:43.589
app provides that users might want to
 

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.400
app provides that users might want to
see at a client

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.410
see at a client
 

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.389
see at a client
all right so we learned that

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399
all right so we learned that
 

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.610
all right so we learned that
complications are great and users love

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620
complications are great and users love
 

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.800
complications are great and users love
them so why haven't all watch face

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:51.810
them so why haven't all watch face
 

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.220
them so why haven't all watch face
creators implements them the answer that

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.230
creators implements them the answer that
 

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.750
creators implements them the answer that
we hear from you is that it's hard

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760
we hear from you is that it's hard
 

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.460
we hear from you is that it's hard
especially if you're implementing

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.470
especially if you're implementing
 

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.129
especially if you're implementing
everything from scratch so watch face

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:01.139
everything from scratch so watch face
 

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.990
everything from scratch so watch face
developers have the freedom to draw

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000
developers have the freedom to draw
 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.240
developers have the freedom to draw
complications however they want but that

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.250
complications however they want but that
 

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.189
complications however they want but that
means they have to handle everything

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:07.199
means they have to handle everything
 

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:09.230
means they have to handle everything
themselves including the text size

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240
themselves including the text size
 

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.939
themselves including the text size
position style and layout so to make it

00:09:13.939 --> 00:09:13.949
position style and layout so to make it
 

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:16.160
position style and layout so to make it
easier we've added two components to the

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.170
easier we've added two components to the
 

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.220
easier we've added two components to the
wearable support library text renderer

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:19.230

the power draw increases substantially
and that means that the battery life

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.070
and that means that the battery life
 

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:30.060
and that means that the battery life
will decrease so the takeaway here is

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.070
will decrease so the takeaway here is
 

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.789

sometimes you might need to continuously

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:51.490
sometimes you might need to continuously
 

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.389
sometimes you might need to continuously
show information to the user and in

00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:54.399
show information to the user and in
 

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:57.480
show information to the user and in
those cases you should implement ambient

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.490
those cases you should implement ambient
 

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.480
those cases you should implement ambient
mode so in ambient mode you should

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:00.490
mode so in ambient mode you should
 

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.549
mode so in ambient mode you should
switch your UI to a black and white

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559
switch your UI to a black and white
 

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:05.100
switch your UI to a black and white
color theme and only update the display

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.110
color theme and only update the display
 

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.860
color theme and only update the display
once a minute and this will allow the

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:07.870
once a minute and this will allow the
 

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.440
once a minute and this will allow the
application processor to go to sleep in

you should consider is using dark themes

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:18.070
you should consider is using dark themes
 

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.539
you should consider is using dark themes
now in our experiments we notice that an

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:21.549
now in our experiments we notice that an
 

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:24.539
now in our experiments we notice that an
all-white display can use up to seven

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:24.549
all-white display can use up to seven
 

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:26.759
all-white display can use up to seven
times more power than an all-black

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:26.769
times more power than an all-black
 

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:30.060
times more power than an all-black
display in interactive mode and so if

you re creating a watch face or an app
 

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.129
you re creating a watch face or an app
where you expect a lot of user

00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:35.139
where you expect a lot of user
 

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:37.950
where you expect a lot of user
interaction time you should switch to

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960
interaction time you should switch to
 

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.409

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:51.720
 
and remember that display power chart

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:51.730
and remember that display power chart
 

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.740
and remember that display power chart
from a few slides ago here's how it

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:55.750
from a few slides ago here's how it
 

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.620
from a few slides ago here's how it
looks with animation power usage in the

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:58.630
looks with animation power usage in the
 

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.940
looks with animation power usage in the
mix now before you panic remember that

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:02.950
mix now before you panic remember that
 

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.299
mix now before you panic remember that
most animations only last fractions of a

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:06.309
most animations only last fractions of a
 

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:08.789
most animations only last fractions of a
second and so aren't usually cause for

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799
second and so aren't usually cause for
 

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:12.060
second and so aren't usually cause for
concern it's a different story however

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:12.070
concern it's a different story however
 

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.700
concern it's a different story however
if you're working with a long-running

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:14.710
if you're working with a long-running
 

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.290
if you're working with a long-running
animation such as a loading spinner

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:19.300
 
 

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.440
 
this is why in where 2.0 we switch our

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.450
this is why in where 2.0 we switch our
 

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.510
this is why in where 2.0 we switch our
framework loading spinner from the one

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520
framework loading spinner from the one
 

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.690
framework loading spinner from the one
on the left to the one on the right the

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:28.700
on the left to the one on the right the
 

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.760
on the left to the one on the right the
difference here is that we're only

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:30.770
difference here is that we're only
 

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.300
difference here is that we're only
rendering one out of every three seconds

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.310
rendering one out of every three seconds
 

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.910
rendering one out of every three seconds
in our low-power spinner and just by

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:36.920
in our low-power spinner and just by
 

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.040
in our low-power spinner and just by
doing this we saw a 3x power improvement

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.050
doing this we saw a 3x power improvement
 

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.470
doing this we saw a 3x power improvement
so if you use the default framework

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480
so if you use the default framework
 

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.320
so if you use the default framework
spinner on where you will also get these

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.330
spinner on where you will also get these
 

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:52.440
spinner on where you will also get these
battery savings which you should do

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.420
 
another example of animations is with

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:55.430
another example of animations is with
 

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.840

Left uses substantially more power than
 

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.910
Left uses substantially more power than
watch faces that use a ticking second

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:06.920
watch faces that use a ticking second
 

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.180
watch faces that use a ticking second
hand so if a ticking second hand works

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:10.190
hand so if a ticking second hand works
 

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:12.700
hand so if a ticking second hand works
with your watch way stylistically you

with your watch way stylistically you
 

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.940
with your watch way stylistically you
should stick with that one to save power
