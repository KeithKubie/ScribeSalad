00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.905
All right, so we know that 16
over 20 reduces to eight-tenths.

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.770
Eight-tenths can be reduced even more,
though.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.940
I notice that eight and
ten have another common factor.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.780
So, what is the greatest
common factor and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.220
what is the fraction that
eight-tenths reduces to?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.330
Write the greatest common factor
here and the reduced fraction here.
