looking at going it was I still remember

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
looking at going it was I still remember
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299

I can still remember exactly that moment

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309
I can still remember exactly that moment
 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760
I can still remember exactly that moment
and I looked at this huge Diplodocus it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
and I looked at this huge Diplodocus it
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799
and I looked at this huge Diplodocus it
was the Carnegie Diplodocus which had

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
was the Carnegie Diplodocus which had
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720
was the Carnegie Diplodocus which had
been donated to the nati schmooze iam

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
been donated to the nati schmooze iam
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600
been donated to the nati schmooze iam
and from that moment on I was hooked on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610
and from that moment on I was hooked on
 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.029
and from that moment on I was hooked on
dinosaurs but that was when we lived

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
dinosaurs but that was when we lived
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.350
dinosaurs but that was when we lived
near London and we moved down to the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
near London and we moved down to the
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690
near London and we moved down to the
southwest of England and when I was

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
southwest of England and when I was
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360
southwest of England and when I was
about six or seven years old and in my

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
about six or seven years old and in my
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.490
about six or seven years old and in my
garden I started finding fossils and if

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
