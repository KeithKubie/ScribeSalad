00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:04.233
So there are some signals
that exist in the record books.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.300
Right?

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.233
And to some, that
means the aliens have

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.834
already tried to contact us.

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:13.066
In 1977, the Ohio
State University

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.533
had a big radio telescope.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.567
It's been turned, I think,
into a golf course now.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.000
But one morning, one of the
astronomers, a guy by the name

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
of Jerry Ehman,
he comes in and he

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.867
looks at the last
night's observing, which

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:24.133
is all printed out on paper.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.467
That's the way
computers used to work.

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:26.734
Paper.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:29.400
And he's going through
these papers-- remember paper?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.900
And he finds this big signal.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.033
And he writes with
a magic marker,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.400
he writes wow next to it.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.200
So that's become known
as the wow signal.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.533
Now, the big question
was could this

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.767
have been the aliens trying
to get in touch with Ohio?

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.266
And the answer is, we
don't know the answer

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.667
because that instrument
automatically looked again

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.367
70 seconds later, a little
over a minute later,

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:52.934
and didn't find the signal.

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.533
People have continued
to look for it.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.667
We've been looking for it.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.433
And we haven't found it either.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.433
So what do you
conclude from that?

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.166
It could be that
the aliens broadcast

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.467
once and then went on vacation.

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:03.500
It could be.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.767
But you would never
call that science.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:06.100
If you don't find
it another time--

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.467
We can't repeat it.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.633
So that's one.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.533
And how about the
Kepler object that had

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:16.567
this weird eclipsing material
in orbit around the host star?

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.867
Yes, KIC 8462852.

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.266
It kind of rolls off the tongue.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.266
Is that his phone number?

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.400
We'll check it out later.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.667
Anyhow, this is a star
that's quite far away actually.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.000
It's almost 1,500
light years away.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.400
That's pretty far
for most stars.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.900
And it is seen-- Kepler measured
its brightness over the course

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.266
of years really.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.300
And you know, stars don't change
their brightness very much.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.700
But this one suddenly
dipped in brightness

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.233
by more than a fifth, 22%.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.033
Very unusual.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.100
The sun never does that.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.066
Thank goodness.

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.433
OK?

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:47.867
It wasn't because there was a
planet going in front of it.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.367
That would never
dim it that much.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.300
So the question is, what was it?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.066
And one suggestion, made maybe
semi-seriously, was well,

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.667
maybe there's a
civilization there,

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.500
and they built some
astro-engineering project which

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.867
is blocking some of the light.

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.533
And they're taking
that energy and feeding

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.467
their planet with it.

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:05.600
For example.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.266
They could be doing that
so-called Dyson sphere.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:11.266
Yeah, OK, so now, just
keep it in the list here,

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.333
a few months ago, Russians
made an announcement

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:19.767
of a radio signal that could
represent intelligent life.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:23.934
Indeed, the
Russians back in 2015

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.066
had used a big antenna
down close to the Caucasus.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.100
It's called the RATAN-600.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.333
It's from the Soviet era.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.533
It has big women turning
cranks and stuff like that.

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.800
But it's a big antenna.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.667
And they found a signal
coming from the star

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.133
HD 164595, another
wonderfully named star.

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:42.567
That star is known
to have planets.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:44.133
And they thought,
maybe this is it.

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.100
But they didn't make
any noise about it.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.500
They didn't tell people.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.066
And that's a strong indication
that they themselves thought

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.333
it might be interference.

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.767
But somebody wrote
a blog about this.

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.233
And so for a week, the media
went nuts about this star.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.200
We tried to check
out the signal.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.433
The Berkeley people tried
to check out the signal.

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:01.600
No signal.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.900
The Russians were forced
to announce, look, we think

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.900
it was a military satellite.
