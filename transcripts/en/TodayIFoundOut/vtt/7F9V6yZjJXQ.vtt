00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:12.580
How Much Land do You Really Own Above and
Below Your Property?

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.029
On paper, the concept of land ownership sounds
very simple- you pay money and in return you’re

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.599
given unfettered access to a predetermined
amount of land.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.609
But how much of that land do you actually
own?

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:25.880
Do you own the sky above it?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880
How about the land below it?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.929
What about all the animals that may live there;
do you own those too?

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.860
All of these questions and more define what
exactly it means to “own” a piece of land.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.649
Surprisingly, many of the answers aren’t
well defined from a legal standpoint as you’ll

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.810
soon see.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.850
(Note: The laws governing one’s rights as
a landowner vary considerably depending on

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.970
location, even within a given country or state.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.660
With that caveat noted, we’ll endeavor to
answer the above questions and a couple more

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.589
in the general case for places like the United
States and the UK.)

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.760
First of all, let’s deal with how much of
the air above your property you own since

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.879
that particular question has been one of the
more common queries about owning or buying

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.890
land we’ve received here at Today I Found
Out over the years.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.079
Historically speaking, if you owned a piece
of land, you owned everything both above and

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.250
below the soil from the deepest reaches of
the Earth right up to the heavens themselves,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.060
giving you a near infinite amount of property
in the universe with your property ever changing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.970
as the Earth rotates and the various celestial
bodies move around.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.820
A popular maxim in regards to this concept
is, “Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.020
coelum et ad inferos” which basically translates
to: “whoever owns the soil, holds title

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.540
all the way up to the heavens and down to
the depths of hell“.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.880
Within the legal world, this maxim is described
as “the traditional starting point of property

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.969
law” and it is considered to have been instrumental
in shaping what we understand as property

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:44.969
law today.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.900
Curiously, despite its ancient sounding nature,
the specific maxim can only be traced as far

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.479
back as the 13th century and it is largely
believed to have been the brainchild of Italian

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.720
scholar, Accursius.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.189
It’s commonly assumed that the maxim made
its way into English and subsequently American

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.310
law thanks to Accurius’ son, who was invited
to England to teach law at the request of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.600
the then King, Edward I.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.790
Its first use in court is attributed to the
case of Bury V Pope in 1587, during which

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.180
the maxim was cited as justification for a
large structure being erected that blocked

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.400
out the natural light to another property
owner’s home.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.190
Since back in those days there was no such
thing as the “right to light” (essentially

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.769
the right to not have the flow of natural
light to your home impeded), it was decided

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.819
that the building of the structure was entirely
legal, since the owner of the land owned all

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.349
of the air above his land too.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.190
Today, the maxim is still used as a guideline.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.599
However, as a property owner you only really
have the right to the airspace above your

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.269
land located in the lower stratum, the precise
boundaries of which are not explicitly labelled.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.550
In the end, you are supposed to be entitled
to enough airspace to reasonably enjoy the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.970
land below that air.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.830
However, exactly what this means is up for
debate.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.239
For example, you can’t ask commercial planes
to stop flying over your house, because the

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.060
sky is considered to be a public highway.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.239
You could potentially, however, prosecute
an overzealous news helicopter for hovering

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.290
over your house if it was impeding your enjoyment
of the land.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.530
Again, this would vary on a case-by-case basis
but there have been instances of people being

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.440
fined for trespassing for flying over someone’s
land; so it’s not unheard of in US or British

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440
law.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.330
The most famous case of this kind comes from
1945 when a chicken farmer named Thomas Lee

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.629
Causby sued the US government for flying approximately
83 feet above his property, the noise of which

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.470
caused a bunch of Causby’s chicken’s to
accidentally kill themselves by running into

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.520
walls.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.440
Causby won his case and the courts agreed
that although a property owner wasn’t entitled

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.620
to own all of the air above their land, they
were entitled to enough so that planes flying

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.459
overhead wouldn’t kill their chickens.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.459
Progress!

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.590
Today in the UK thanks to the Civil Aviation
Act of 1982, the generally accepted amount

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.510
of air above one’s roof a person is entitled
to is approximately 500-1,000 feet, though

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.730
again this isn’t a hard definition.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.320
Likewise, the United States has a similar
estimation of about 500 feet, though this

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.610
has never been officially ruled on by the
Supreme Court.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.050
In both cases, this may be soon changing with
the widespread introduction of drones, both

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.450
personal, commercial, and those owned by the
respective governments.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.030
As such, the U.S. federal government particularly
has recently been looking into significantly

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.380
lowering the airspace “public highway”
floor to accommodate this type of aircraft.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.430
With that out of the way, what about the earth
below your land?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.700
Well, again, this varies because owning land
doesn’t necessarily mean you own the mineral

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700
rights to it.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.150
In a nutshell, the owner of the respective
mineral rights to a piece of land is entitled

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.770
to those substances that could potentially
be sitting below a given property and it’s

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.300
not uncommon for them to be sold separately
to land and property rights.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.560
And there have been cases in the past of home-owners
finding out that there is a huge deposit of

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.060
gas under their home that they don’t have
rights to, and have no right to stop the owner

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.600
of the mineral rights drilling for.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.380
Beyond the loss of money from that gas if
you didn’t own the mineral rights, this

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.660
can sometimes kill any property value your
land may have previously had.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.120
However, if you own both the land and all
the mineral rights to a property and you live

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.600
in the US, everything below the ground belongs
to you, unless you happen to stumble on an

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.100
Indian burial ground or something, in which
case you have to report it.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.160
Other than that, practically everything is
fair game, you can drill for oil and gas or

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.710
even mine, assuming you have the relevant
permits, and anything you find is yours to

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.010
sell or keep.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.400
However, if something below the ground of
your property extends to the property of someone

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.690
else, like a pool of oil or vein of gold,
they have an equal claim to the portion of

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.390
the material on their side of property line.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.090
This can get messy very quickly since determining
exact boundaries underground is difficult

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.130
and costly, unless you live in the UK, in
which case, the Crown has first dibs on all

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.050
coal, oil, silver, gas and gold found on public
or private property.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.840
It should also be noted that in the United
States, thanks to compulsory integration,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.750
gas companies potentially have the right to
drill under your land from an adjacent property

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.160
if they have leased or been deeded a certain
percentage of land surrounding your land,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.580
with this percentage varying from state to
state.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.040
As for how much of the land below your property
you own, there’s no real limit enforced

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.670
by courts and there have been cases of people
being prosecuted for trespassing on other

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.240
people’s property for digging even in the
thousands of feet below the ground in the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
search for oil.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.740
Of course, in reality there is a practical
limit in that if there is a country on the

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.000
other side of the world from your land, it’s
probably not one where your country has jurisdiction.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.240
Further, there is the matter of the giant
layer of magma inbetween.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.230
But beyond that, you can generally dig away
to your heart’s content as long as you’re

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.290
not breaking any environmental laws and have
the appropriate permits.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.050
If you happen to live next to water, your
rights again, vary greatly depending on the

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.390
exact situation and it’s covered by a totally
different set of laws and rules called, riparian

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.390
rights.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.150
If you have a stream or the like running through
your land, in Britain you’re entitled to

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.880
fish while they’re in the water on your
land, but you can’t do anything that would

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.780
impede the flow of water to other people’s
land since all running water eventually flows

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.160
into the public ocean.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.820
Likewise, if navigable water flows across,
through or otherwise near your property, you’re

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.390
not allowed to do anything that would upset
its natural course since the ground beneath

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.790
all navigable water is owned by the state,
so the public can use it freely.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.530
If your property borders a large body of water,
on the other hand, in general you have the

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.150
right to access the water and if you so wish,
construct a pier or wharf.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.780
However, you have no right to stop people
using the water for navigational purposes

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.920
and your rights to the land beneath the water,
if any, only extends to a reasonable level

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.010
of depth which has never been precisely defined.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.170
If you happen to own a chunk of non-navigable
water, that’s generally yours to do with

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.990
as you please (barring breaking any environmental
laws).

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.590
As for animals, you cannot claim ownership
of any wild animals on your land; you are,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.820
however, allowed to hunt them if they’re
not endangered.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.230
Trees, plants and fruit, on the other hand,
are yours to do with as you please as long

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.410
as the plant was originally planted or seeded
on your land.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.840
If your neighbour owns any plants or trees
that overhang onto, or the roots spread out

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.020
under, your property, you’re within your
rights to trim them back (even the roots)

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.490
as long as doing so wouldn’t kill the plant.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.599
However, the original owner still has the
rights to any cuttings and can request that

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.520
they be returned after you’ve cut them off.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.390
The same can be said for any fruit that happens
to grow on the tree.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.920
So, technically, taking fruit from such a
branch hanging on your property is theft.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.940
However, any leaves that fall off of the tree
are your problem to deal with, unless they

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.070
cause damage to your property (for example
by blocking up your gutters, or in the case

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.761
of roots, growing into your septic drainage
field or damaging your house foundation) in

00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.500
which case, you can ask your neighbour to
pay for the damage and if they refuse, you

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:21.120
can sue and will likely win.
