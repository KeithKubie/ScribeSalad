00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:52.430
automations and all that why don't we do
 

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.410

that any notion of that kind was just

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:55.420
that any notion of that kind was just

viciously shut down people really wanted

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.340
viciously shut down people really wanted
 

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.550
viciously shut down people really wanted
this free thing but the problem is that

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560
this free thing but the problem is that
 

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.370
this free thing but the problem is that
that project to make this kind of free

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:03.380
that project to make this kind of free
 

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.120

service would still be embedded in this

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.130
service would still be embedded in this
 

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:08.710

commercial world where people have to

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720
commercial world where people have to
 

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.480
commercial world where people have to
pay their rent and people were making

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:10.490
pay their rent and people were making
 

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.220

the business plans that are left if you
 

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.630
the business plans that are left if you
make everything free are pretty indirect

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:22.640
make everything free are pretty indirect
 

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.550
make everything free are pretty indirect
and strange and so you can say

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560
and strange and so you can say
 

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.280
and strange and so you can say
advertising but then here's the thing if

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.290
advertising but then here's the thing if
 

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.790
advertising but then here's the thing if
your Google started out placing outs but

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800
your Google started out placing outs but

if you're constantly measuring somebody

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:32.690
if you're constantly measuring somebody

and then changing the feedback they get

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:34.520
and then changing the feedback they get
 

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480
and then changing the feedback they get
you've you crossed this threshold where

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.490
you've you crossed this threshold where
 

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.890
you've you crossed this threshold where
you're no longer doing advertising and

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:38.900
you're no longer doing advertising and
 

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.540
you're no longer doing advertising and
now you're in the world of behaviorist

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:40.550
now you're in the world of behaviorist
 

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.490
now you're in the world of behaviorist
manipulation you're doing direct

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:42.500
manipulation you're doing direct
 

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.920

to call that advertising completely

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:47.450
to call that advertising completely
 

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.450
to call that advertising completely
misses the point but the problem is that

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:49.460
misses the point but the problem is that
 

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.950

so I started writing cautionary essays

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.370
so I started writing cautionary essays
 

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.600
so I started writing cautionary essays
around 92 I was the timeline is I built

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:23.610
around 92 I was the timeline is I built
 

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.550
around 92 I was the timeline is I built
this the first reality company in the

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560
this the first reality company in the
 

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.010
this the first reality company in the
80s and then I left it in 1992 and

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.020
80s and then I left it in 1992 and
 

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.020
80s and then I left it in 1992 and
that's where this this memoir cuts off

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.030
that's where this this memoir cuts off
 

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.090
that's where this this memoir cuts off
and then shortly after that I started

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100
and then shortly after that I started
 

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.480
and then shortly after that I started
writing cautionary essays and if I may

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.490
writing cautionary essays and if I may
 

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:40.040
writing cautionary essays and if I may
say so I wish they were bad essays I

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.050
say so I wish they were bad essays I
 

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.800
say so I wish they were bad essays I
wish I was wrong I wish I had not been

prescient because unfortunately some of
these things which seemed rather dark

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:45.930
these things which seemed rather dark
 

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.980
these things which seemed rather dark
and paranoid have come true almost you

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:48.990
and paranoid have come true almost you
 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.320
and paranoid have come true almost you
know very closely to what I what I wrote

know very closely to what I what I wrote
 

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.840
know very closely to what I what I wrote
and I hate that I want to be wrong when

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:53.850
and I hate that I want to be wrong when
 

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.140
and I hate that I want to be wrong when
I'm dark you know but the the what the

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.150
I'm dark you know but the the what the
 

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.880

the notion that concerned me was well

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:01.890
the notion that concerned me was well
 

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.480
the notion that concerned me was well
first of all if you have little programs

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.490
first of all if you have little programs
 

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.820
first of all if you have little programs
that are giving feedback to people and

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:07.830
that are giving feedback to people and
 

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.180
that are giving feedback to people and
manipulating them those programs well as

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.190
manipulating them those programs well as
 

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.120
manipulating them those programs well as
a matter of course cluster people into

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.130
a matter of course cluster people into
 

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.130
a matter of course cluster people into
groups that oppose each other

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.140
groups that oppose each other
 

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.230
groups that oppose each other
and this is just a natural optimization

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240
and this is just a natural optimization
 

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.269
and this is just a natural optimization
this is like this is just a thing that

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279
this is like this is just a thing that
 

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.949
this is like this is just a thing that
will happen it's it's not it doesn't

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959
will happen it's it's not it doesn't
 

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:25.490
will happen it's it's not it doesn't
have to be planned and so then you start

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500
have to be planned and so then you start
 

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.680
have to be planned and so then you start
organizing people into these opposing

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:27.690
organizing people into these opposing
 

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.509
organizing people into these opposing
groups and then they become annoyed with

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519
groups and then they become annoyed with
 

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.740
groups and then they become annoyed with
each other they become more and more

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:30.750
each other they become more and more
 

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.009
each other they become more and more
addicted more and more involved but then

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019
addicted more and more involved but then
 

00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:35.569
addicted more and more involved but then
there's this other thing so I have I had

00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579
there's this other thing so I have I had
 

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:39.259
there's this other thing so I have I had
a hypothesis called the PAC switch and

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:39.269
a hypothesis called the PAC switch and
 

00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:43.130
a hypothesis called the PAC switch and
so the notion is that people are similar

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.140
so the notion is that people are similar
 

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.889
so the notion is that people are similar
to say coyotes or some other animals

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899
to say coyotes or some other animals
 

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:47.840
to say coyotes or some other animals
that can either function as loners or as

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:47.850
that can either function as loners or as
 

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.230
that can either function as loners or as
members of packs and when that switch is

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240
members of packs and when that switch is
 

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.449
members of packs and when that switch is
turned inside of inside us and we feel

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459
turned inside of inside us and we feel
 

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:56.030
turned inside of inside us and we feel
we're a member of a pack our whole sense

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040
we're a member of a pack our whole sense
 

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.220
we're a member of a pack our whole sense
of perception our ethics our morality

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.230
of perception our ethics our morality
 

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.470
of perception our ethics our morality
our personality changes and it becomes

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480
our personality changes and it becomes
 

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.720
our personality changes and it becomes
all about the pack and and what we must

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:02.730
all about the pack and and what we must
 

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.269
all about the pack and and what we must
do is avoid setting that switch we must

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279
do is avoid setting that switch we must
 

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:06.949
do is avoid setting that switch we must
remain individuals in order to be decent

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959
remain individuals in order to be decent
 

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.900
remain individuals in order to be decent
to each other when we turn into a mob

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:08.910
to each other when we turn into a mob
 

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.160
to each other when we turn into a mob
and this is what I meant by digital

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.170
and this is what I meant by digital
 

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.880
and this is what I meant by digital
maoism what was interesting to me about

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:13.890
maoism what was interesting to me about
 

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.100
maoism what was interesting to me about
some experiments on the left as well as

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.110
some experiments on the left as well as
 

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.350
some experiments on the left as well as
on the right is there were occasions

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360
on the right is there were occasions
 

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.439
on the right is there were occasions
when people started with good intentions

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:21.449
when people started with good intentions
 

00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:22.790
when people started with good intentions
but they ended up with this horrible

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800
but they ended up with this horrible
 

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.829
but they ended up with this horrible
violence and these atrocities and I I

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839
violence and these atrocities and I I
 

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:26.840
violence and these atrocities and I I
suspect what's happening as they under

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:26.850
suspect what's happening as they under
 

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.610
suspect what's happening as they under
appreciated this this switch that's

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620
appreciated this this switch that's
 

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.980
appreciated this this switch that's
inside all of us so the question I asked

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:30.990
inside all of us so the question I asked
 

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.560
inside all of us so the question I asked
is if we start manipulating with these

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:33.570
is if we start manipulating with these
 

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.400
is if we start manipulating with these
digital loops why won't we create social

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.410
digital loops why won't we create social
 

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.230
digital loops why won't we create social
catastrophes of people turning on each

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240
catastrophes of people turning on each
 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.110
catastrophes of people turning on each
other turning tribal why won't this

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120
other turning tribal why won't this
 

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.530
other turning tribal why won't this
destabilize society completely and this

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540
destabilize society completely and this
 

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.910
destabilize society completely and this
is what I fear is happening this is some

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920
is what I fear is happening this is some
 

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.740
is what I fear is happening this is some
of the outcome maybe we are seeing now

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:48.750
of the outcome maybe we are seeing now
 

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.300
of the outcome maybe we are seeing now
do you think well ultimately of what you

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
do you think well ultimately of what you
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.400
do you think well ultimately of what you
were writing in the 90s yeah it

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.410
were writing in the 90s yeah it
 

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.110
were writing in the 90s yeah it
certainly appears to me to be a

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120
certainly appears to me to be a
 

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.460
certainly appears to me to be a
description of what's going on in the

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:55.470
description of what's going on in the
 

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.960
description of what's going on in the
u.s. now yeah what was it in the is it

00:16:59.960 --> 00:16:59.970
u.s. now yeah what was it in the is it
 

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.790
u.s. now yeah what was it in the is it
the business model is the advertising

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800
the business model is the advertising
 

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.769
the business model is the advertising
model is the algorithms they use are

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779
model is the algorithms they use are
 

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:05.900

they like betting company so they they

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:05.910
they like betting company so they they
 

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.460
they like betting company so they they
have these heart-stopping moments so

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:07.470
have these heart-stopping moments so
 

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.900
have these heart-stopping moments so
they are addictive you talked about they

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:08.910
they are addictive you talked about they
 

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.579
they are addictive you talked about they
did you talk about the addiction yeah

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:10.589
did you talk about the addiction yeah
 

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.740
did you talk about the addiction yeah
what is it that they are using a funny

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:12.750
what is it that they are using a funny
 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.569
what is it that they are using a funny
thing happened last week there was an

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579
thing happened last week there was an
 

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.159
thing happened last week there was an
interview of me published in the New

00:17:16.159 --> 00:17:16.169
interview of me published in the New
 

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.809
interview of me published in the New
York Times about this addiction thing

00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819
York Times about this addiction thing
 

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.329
York Times about this addiction thing
and the next day one of the Facebook

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:20.339
and the next day one of the Facebook
 

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.429
and the next day one of the Facebook
founder Sean Parker came out and said

00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439
founder Sean Parker came out and said
 

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:24.230
founder Sean Parker came out and said
yeah actually we intentionally did that

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240
yeah actually we intentionally did that
 

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.270
yeah actually we intentionally did that
which was an open secret everybody has

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280
which was an open secret everybody has
 

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.289
which was an open secret everybody has
known that but now

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299
known that but now
 

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:31.009
known that but now
the record so if you wish to addicted

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:31.019
the record so if you wish to addicted
 

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.729
the record so if you wish to addicted
creature you give them feedback in

00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:34.739
creature you give them feedback in
 

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:36.710
creature you give them feedback in
exchange for the actions you wish them

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720
exchange for the actions you wish them
 

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.869
exchange for the actions you wish them
to perform but slightly inconsistent

00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:38.879
to perform but slightly inconsistent
 

00:17:38.879 --> 00:17:40.369
to perform but slightly inconsistent
feedback so that it's not too mechanical

00:17:40.369 --> 00:17:40.379
feedback so that it's not too mechanical
 

00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:43.070
feedback so that it's not too mechanical
so they have to keep on grasping it how

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080
so they have to keep on grasping it how
 

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.509
so they have to keep on grasping it how
to get there to make the feedback more

00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:44.519
to get there to make the feedback more
 

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.940
to get there to make the feedback more
more consistent so if you have a rat in

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:46.950
more consistent so if you have a rat in
 

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.009
more consistent so if you have a rat in
a behaviorist experiment and the rat is

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:49.019
a behaviorist experiment and the rat is
 

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:51.489
a behaviorist experiment and the rat is
supposed to hit a button to get a treat

00:17:51.489 --> 00:17:51.499
supposed to hit a button to get a treat
 

00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:53.600
supposed to hit a button to get a treat
sometimes it works sometimes it does and

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.610
sometimes it works sometimes it does and
 

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.950
sometimes it works sometimes it does and
sometimes it's a little delayed and you

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960
sometimes it's a little delayed and you
 

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.659
sometimes it's a little delayed and you
have to vary it a little bit to get the

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:56.669
have to vary it a little bit to get the
 

00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:58.369
have to vary it a little bit to get the
rat super obsessed with how to really

00:17:58.369 --> 00:17:58.379
rat super obsessed with how to really
 

00:17:58.379 --> 00:17:59.539
rat super obsessed with how to really
get this thing going

00:17:59.539 --> 00:17:59.549
get this thing going
 

00:17:59.549 --> 00:18:02.090
get this thing going
and people find it hard to resist that

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100
and people find it hard to resist that
 

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.970
and people find it hard to resist that
and so if you set up a feedback loop

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980
and so if you set up a feedback loop
 

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.739
and so if you set up a feedback loop
with that quality you redic to people

00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:06.749
with that quality you redic to people
 

00:18:06.749 --> 00:18:08.960
with that quality you redic to people
and this is something casinos know all

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:08.970
and this is something casinos know all
 

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.940
and this is something casinos know all
about this is something Kahneman know

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:10.950
about this is something Kahneman know
 

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:17.299
about this is something Kahneman know
all about and we formalized it into code

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:17.309
all about and we formalized it into code
 

00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:19.759
all about and we formalized it into code
or well you know Facebook did and some

00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:19.769
or well you know Facebook did and some
 

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:23.169
or well you know Facebook did and some
of the other social media companies and

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:23.179
of the other social media companies and
 

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:27.769
of the other social media companies and
it it's a it's a legacy of behaviorist

00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:27.779
it it's a it's a legacy of behaviorist
 

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:30.440
it it's a it's a legacy of behaviorist
research in manipulating behavior and

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:30.450
research in manipulating behavior and
 

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.289
research in manipulating behavior and
and this is something that can be done

00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299
and this is something that can be done
 

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:35.599
and this is something that can be done
but should not be done we can't have a

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:35.609
but should not be done we can't have a
 

00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:38.539
but should not be done we can't have a
decent society we can't have people with

00:18:38.539 --> 00:18:38.549
decent society we can't have people with
 

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:40.519
decent society we can't have people with
their own volition we can't have a

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:40.529
their own volition we can't have a
 

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:44.289
their own volition we can't have a
society that progresses we can't have a

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:44.299
society that progresses we can't have a
 

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:47.269
society that progresses we can't have a
society based on empathy or kindness if

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:47.279
society based on empathy or kindness if
 

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:49.159
society based on empathy or kindness if
people are constantly being manipulated

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:49.169
people are constantly being manipulated
 

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.690
people are constantly being manipulated

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700
from some central source no matter what
 

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.359
from some central source no matter what
type of source that is do you think it

type of source that is do you think it
 

00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:56.090
type of source that is do you think it
was a cynical act was it a cynical act

well see what happens is there's a
 

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.250
well see what happens is there's a
pattern to how this works and this is

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:53.260
pattern to how this works and this is
 

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.930
pattern to how this works and this is
actually in a way we're getting into

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:54.940
actually in a way we're getting into
 

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.370
actually in a way we're getting into
what I'm writing about in a follow-on

what I'm writing about in a follow-on

what I'm writing about in a follow-on
book that isn't announced this isn't

book that isn't announced this isn't

book that isn't announced this isn't
really in the present book but the

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:00.790
really in the present book but the
 

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.570
really in the present book but the
pattern is that initially people who are

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:03.580
pattern is that initially people who are
 

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.070
pattern is that initially people who are
trying to do good works and there are

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080
trying to do good works and there are
 

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.440
trying to do good works and there are
spectacular good works that occur over

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.450

me2 movement right now which i think is
doing a lot of good but that one hasn't

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440
doing a lot of good but that one hasn't
 

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.510
doing a lot of good but that one hasn't
played out yet so let me talk about

happening in various variations and so
 

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.590

they organized but the thing is while

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:48.850
they organized but the thing is while
 

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.940
they organized but the thing is while
they were doing that and there's and I'm

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:50.950
they were doing that and there's and I'm
 

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.740
they were doing that and there's and I'm
not in any sense questioning the

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:52.750
not in any sense questioning the
 

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.300
not in any sense questioning the
validity of it and in fact I'll even go

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:54.310
validity of it and in fact I'll even go
 

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.700
validity of it and in fact I'll even go
further and I'll say in the u.s. black

gradually it turns those two groups

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120
gradually it turns those two groups
 

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.790
gradually it turns those two groups
against each other because if we can use

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:17.800
against each other because if we can use
 

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.260

they see that the algorithms are

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:32.330

starting to divide people to increase
engagement and then all they have to do

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:35.629
engagement and then all they have to do
 

00:24:35.629 --> 00:24:37.509
engagement and then all they have to do
is latch on that and they can make it

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:37.519
is latch on that and they can make it
 

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:40.180
is latch on that and they can make it
worse and worse so suddenly black lives

anymore everything became more and more
crazy so despite the the validity and

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799

disconnected from reality so the

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.460
disconnected from reality so the
 

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.369
disconnected from reality so the
question is will this happen to the me2

00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:06.379
question is will this happen to the me2
 

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:08.080
question is will this happen to the me2
movement now and the answer is yeah

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.090
movement now and the answer is yeah
 

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.489
movement now and the answer is yeah
probably because that's how this works

00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:09.499
probably because that's how this works
 

00:25:09.499 --> 00:25:11.739
probably because that's how this works
so there's a powder is a natural

00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:11.749
so there's a powder is a natural
 

00:25:11.749 --> 00:25:13.840

well what is it okay let me ask you what

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.090
well what is it okay let me ask you what
 

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.840
well what is it okay let me ask you what
engages you so if I if I come to you and

I say oh what a pretty flower you might

00:25:21.369 --> 00:25:21.379
I say oh what a pretty flower you might
 

00:25:21.379 --> 00:25:22.779

so it just by the mere fact that it's
 

00:25:42.379 --> 00:25:45.070
so it just by the mere fact that it's
the more engaged response it's the one

the thing is I mean but the audiences
are literate and so in the US all the

optimistic thing maybe I'll start with a

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:48.980
optimistic thing maybe I'll start with a
 

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.220
optimistic thing maybe I'll start with a
very simple question is there such a

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:51.230
very simple question is there such a
 

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.740
very simple question is there such a
thing as making a virtual reality system

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:53.750
thing as making a virtual reality system
 

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.629
thing as making a virtual reality system
that's good enough for all time you make

00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639
that's good enough for all time you make
 

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.720
that's good enough for all time you make
goggles that are so good that they

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:57.730
goggles that are so good that they
 

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.270
goggles that are so good that they
outpace the retina for a number of

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280
outpace the retina for a number of
 

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.840
outpace the retina for a number of
detectable points you make very high

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:04.850
detectable points you make very high
 

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.210
detectable points you make very high
quality sensors and I won't go into the

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:07.220
quality sensors and I won't go into the
 

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.010
quality sensors and I won't go into the
details since you haven't even tried it

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:09.020
details since you haven't even tried it
 

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.359
details since you haven't even tried it
but but basically they're all these

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:10.369
but but basically they're all these
 

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:13.450
but but basically they're all these
components so so some people say if you

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:13.460
components so so some people say if you
 

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:14.890
components so so some people say if you
make all this stuff good enough then

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:14.900
make all this stuff good enough then
 

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.660
make all this stuff good enough then
you're done you have a VR system that

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:16.670
you're done you have a VR system that
 

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.609
you're done you have a VR system that
will fool people but see I think that's

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:18.619
will fool people but see I think that's
 

00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:20.050
will fool people but see I think that's
wrong because I think what happens is

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.060
wrong because I think what happens is
 

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.180
wrong because I think what happens is
with each stage of development in VR

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:22.190
with each stage of development in VR
 

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.490
with each stage of development in VR
people get used to it and then their

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:24.500
people get used to it and then their
 

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.010
people get used to it and then their
powers of perception increase and stay

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:27.020
powers of perception increase and stay
 

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.130
powers of perception increase and stay
ahead so the thing is that the big

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:30.140
ahead so the thing is that the big
 

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.920
ahead so the thing is that the big
mistake we make for better or for worse

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:32.930
mistake we make for better or for worse
 

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.840
mistake we make for better or for worse
and it goes both ways is to think of

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:34.850
and it goes both ways is to think of
 

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.550
and it goes both ways is to think of
ourselves as fixed quantities the

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560
ourselves as fixed quantities the
 

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.960
ourselves as fixed quantities the
optimism we need to have in ourselves

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:37.970
optimism we need to have in ourselves
 

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.940
optimism we need to have in ourselves
and the remarkable thing about people is

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:39.950
and the remarkable thing about people is
 

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.040
and the remarkable thing about people is
our elasticity that we can grow and

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.050
our elasticity that we can grow and
 

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.470
our elasticity that we can grow and
change we can learn to perceive in new

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480
change we can learn to perceive in new
 

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.880
change we can learn to perceive in new
ways we can become smarter with

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:45.890
ways we can become smarter with
 

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.180
ways we can become smarter with
experience so as you start to use the

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.190
experience so as you start to use the
 

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.940
experience so as you start to use the
latest VR you start to you get it you

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:51.950
latest VR you start to you get it you
 

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.490
latest VR you start to you get it you
know I have an 11-year old daughter

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.500
know I have an 11-year old daughter
 

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.290
know I have an 11-year old daughter
who's done a lot of VR and she's really

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:56.300
who's done a lot of VR and she's really
 

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.820
who's done a lot of VR and she's really
not impressed anymore and I think that's

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:57.830
not impressed anymore and I think that's
 

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.090
not impressed anymore and I think that's
great you know she does she end up doing

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:01.100
great you know she does she end up doing
 

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.130
great you know she does she end up doing
it no she still enjoys it but she's not

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:03.140
it no she still enjoys it but she's not
 

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.020
it no she still enjoys it but she's not
impressed right like there has to be

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.030
impressed right like there has to be
 

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.880
impressed right like there has to be
some really beautiful or good design the

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:06.890
some really beautiful or good design the
 

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.160
some really beautiful or good design the
the thing itself is really old to her

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:09.170
the thing itself is really old to her
 

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.800
the thing itself is really old to her
and I see this a lot with with VR use

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:11.810
and I see this a lot with with VR use
 

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.970
and I see this a lot with with VR use
and I think that's actually a very

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:12.980
and I think that's actually a very
 

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.140
and I think that's actually a very
positive quality so what I think we have

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.150
positive quality so what I think we have
 

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.510
positive quality so what I think we have
in order for our in order to overcome

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520
in order for our in order to overcome
 

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.640
in order for our in order to overcome
the illusions of Technology we have to

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:21.650
the illusions of Technology we have to
 

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.800
the illusions of Technology we have to
engage in it in such a way that we learn

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:23.810
engage in it in such a way that we learn
 

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.340
engage in it in such a way that we learn
and grow and see through the illusions

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:26.350
and grow and see through the illusions
 

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.620
and grow and see through the illusions
let's say I'll compare it to magic which

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:29.630
let's say I'll compare it to magic which
 

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.930
let's say I'll compare it to magic which
reality is kind of like a silicon

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:31.940
reality is kind of like a silicon
 

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.060
reality is kind of like a silicon
version of stage magic if you like so

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.070
version of stage magic if you like so
 

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.190
version of stage magic if you like so

the same way like people have to become
 

00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:46.569
the same way like people have to become
educated and also there could be

this is all very doable but it can't be
 

00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:03.370
this is all very doable but it can't be
done from a central planning station you

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:03.380
done from a central planning station you
 

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.439
done from a central planning station you
can say oh Silicon Valley fix this for

00:38:05.439 --> 00:38:05.449
can say oh Silicon Valley fix this for
 

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:07.299

take responsibility to become literate
 

00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:13.120
take responsibility to become literate
in a new way if they're going to use the

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:13.130
in a new way if they're going to use the
 

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.130

then you must take it upon yourself to
 

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:23.829
then you must take it upon yourself to
really learn how it works learn how the

realization that this could be this path

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920
realization that this could be this path
 

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.620
realization that this could be this path
to shared dreaming that I dreamed of

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:07.630
to shared dreaming that I dreamed of
 

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.020
to shared dreaming that I dreamed of
when I was in my early teens and it was

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:10.030
when I was in my early teens and it was
 

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.050
when I was in my early teens and it was
it kept me going for a few years and

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:13.060
it kept me going for a few years and
 

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.990
it kept me going for a few years and
then I had exactly the opposite

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000
then I had exactly the opposite
 

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.910
then I had exactly the opposite
revelation so how many of you have heard

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920
revelation so how many of you have heard
 

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.660
revelation so how many of you have heard
of Norbert Wiener okay that's pretty

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:21.670
of Norbert Wiener okay that's pretty
 

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:22.200
of Norbert Wiener okay that's pretty
good

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.210
good
 

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.480
good
so Norbert Wiener is one of the first

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:24.490
so Norbert Wiener is one of the first
 

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.070
so Norbert Wiener is one of the first

kind of really crude digital technology
because right now I mean what you get

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:28.770
because right now I mean what you get
 

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.680
because right now I mean what you get
with social media or really anything you

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:30.690
with social media or really anything you
 

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.150

is really pretty crude it's like as

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:34.910
is really pretty crude it's like as

really interact through it so this is a

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:44.190
really interact through it so this is a
 

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.760

super low tech crude version of digital

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:46.770
super low tech crude version of digital

interaction and so it's not very intense

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:49.470
interaction and so it's not very intense
 

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:51.260
interaction and so it's not very intense
yet and it still is bad enough to

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:51.270
yet and it still is bad enough to
 

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.800

disrupt the world's democracies so what

we should we need to figure this out
 

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.770
we should we need to figure this out
before it gets more intense and if I may

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780
before it gets more intense and if I may

it's not an option so we have to figure
 

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.440

the way this is the way this works let's

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200
the way this is the way this works let's
 

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.390
the way this is the way this works let's
say you have a bunch of particles and

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400
say you have a bunch of particles and
 

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.890
say you have a bunch of particles and
each of them might be one way or another

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900
each of them might be one way or another
 

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.509
each of them might be one way or another
way they have different properties like

00:51:41.509 --> 00:51:41.519
way they have different properties like
 

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:44.180
way they have different properties like
spin and stuff there's only a

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:44.190
spin and stuff there's only a
 

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.519
spin and stuff there's only a
probability that some combination of

00:51:46.519 --> 00:51:46.529
probability that some combination of
 

00:51:46.529 --> 00:51:48.620
probability that some combination of
those properties will be true provided

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:48.630
those properties will be true provided
 

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.480
those properties will be true provided
they're connected together and a certain

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:50.490
they're connected together and a certain
 

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.099
they're connected together and a certain
particles are connected in a certain way

00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:52.109
particles are connected in a certain way
 

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.099
particles are connected in a certain way
and what but the number of probabilities

00:51:55.099 --> 00:51:55.109
and what but the number of probabilities
 

00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:57.559
and what but the number of probabilities
is very large because there's one

00:51:57.559 --> 00:51:57.569
is very large because there's one
 

00:51:57.569 --> 00:51:59.089
is very large because there's one
probability for each possible

00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099
probability for each possible
 

00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:01.519
probability for each possible
combination and so if you're very very

00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:01.529
combination and so if you're very very
 

00:52:01.529 --> 00:52:03.410
combination and so if you're very very
tricky you can actually use that

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420
tricky you can actually use that
 

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.779
tricky you can actually use that
extended set of probabilities as a new

00:52:05.779 --> 00:52:05.789
extended set of probabilities as a new
 

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:07.910
extended set of probabilities as a new
kind of computer memory but you have to

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920
kind of computer memory but you have to
 

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.180
kind of computer memory but you have to
be very tricky indeed but hypothetically

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:10.190
be very tricky indeed but hypothetically
 

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.259
be very tricky indeed but hypothetically
we might be able to build these things

00:52:12.259 --> 00:52:12.269
we might be able to build these things
 

00:52:12.269 --> 00:52:13.789
we might be able to build these things
so that we can perform much more

00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799
so that we can perform much more
 

00:52:13.799 --> 00:52:15.739
so that we can perform much more
elaborate computations because there's

00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:15.749
elaborate computations because there's
 

00:52:15.749 --> 00:52:18.140
elaborate computations because there's
all this extra memory from this range of

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:18.150
all this extra memory from this range of
 

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:20.979
all this extra memory from this range of
probabilities it's a very strange idea

00:52:20.979 --> 00:52:20.989
probabilities it's a very strange idea
 

00:52:20.989 --> 00:52:23.029
probabilities it's a very strange idea
there are a lot of different ideas about

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:24.229
how to do it
 

00:52:24.229 --> 00:52:26.509
how to do it
Google's doing this one where they put a

00:52:26.509 --> 00:52:26.519
Google's doing this one where they put a
 

00:52:26.519 --> 00:52:28.460
Google's doing this one where they put a
bunch of quantum bits together and they

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:28.470
bunch of quantum bits together and they
 

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.469
bunch of quantum bits together and they
all kind of find their way to a balance

00:52:30.469 --> 00:52:30.479
all kind of find their way to a balance
 

00:52:30.479 --> 00:52:32.749
all kind of find their way to a balance
together which is called a never mind I

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:32.759
together which is called a never mind I
 

00:52:32.759 --> 00:52:33.979

won't go into that and we're doing this

00:52:33.979 --> 00:52:33.989
won't go into that and we're doing this
 

00:52:33.989 --> 00:52:35.299
won't go into that and we're doing this
other one where we get them to type

00:52:35.299 --> 00:52:35.309
other one where we get them to type
 

00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:36.769
other one where we get them to type
Microsoft we're doing this one where we

00:52:36.769 --> 00:52:36.779
Microsoft we're doing this one where we
 

00:52:36.779 --> 00:52:39.739
Microsoft we're doing this one where we
get them to tie little knots together so

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:39.749
get them to tie little knots together so
 

00:52:39.749 --> 00:52:41.779
get them to tie little knots together so
it's in logically it so anyway they're

00:52:41.779 --> 00:52:41.789
it's in logically it so anyway they're
 

00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:43.700
it's in logically it so anyway they're
all these different ways to do it it

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:43.710
all these different ways to do it it
 

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.359
all these different ways to do it it
might be able to do crazy stuff like

00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:46.369
might be able to do crazy stuff like
 

00:52:46.369 --> 00:52:48.380
might be able to do crazy stuff like
solve problems that are currently

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:48.390

all kinds of stuff wait a few years to

00:52:52.519 --> 00:52:52.529
all kinds of stuff wait a few years to

all kinds of stuff wait a few years to
see if this thing is really working I

00:52:53.779 --> 00:52:53.789
see if this thing is really working I
 

00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:55.400
see if this thing is really working I
mean like I it's kind of exciting right

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:55.410
mean like I it's kind of exciting right
 

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.079

work does it have anything to do with

00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700
work does it have anything to do with
 

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.779
work does it have anything to do with
virtual reality yeah sure I mean sure he

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:02.789
virtual reality yeah sure I mean sure he
 

00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:04.549
virtual reality yeah sure I mean sure he
could make really interesting virtual

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559
could make really interesting virtual
 

00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:07.700
could make really interesting virtual
worlds with it I'm sure we can make all

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:07.710
worlds with it I'm sure we can make all
 

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:09.739

a bit early I you know what I found with

00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:11.789
a bit early I you know what I found with
 

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:14.269
a bit early I you know what I found with
technology is that there's some visions

00:53:14.269 --> 00:53:14.279
technology is that there's some visions
 

00:53:14.279 --> 00:53:15.769
technology is that there's some visions
you can have far in advance and then

00:53:15.769 --> 00:53:15.779
you can have far in advance and then
 

00:53:15.779 --> 00:53:17.479
you can have far in advance and then
there's other ways that the particulars

00:53:17.479 --> 00:53:17.489
there's other ways that the particulars
 

00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:19.670
there's other ways that the particulars
present themselves as you get closer and

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680
present themselves as you get closer and
 

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.709
present themselves as you get closer and
I think with quantum stuff we've all

00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:21.719
I think with quantum stuff we've all
 

00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:22.880
I think with quantum stuff we've all
been talking about it for decades

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:22.890
been talking about it for decades
 

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.589
been talking about it for decades
there's all these fantastic predictions

00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599
there's all these fantastic predictions
 

00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:26.089
there's all these fantastic predictions
we're getting so close to getting some

00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099
we're getting so close to getting some
 

00:53:26.099 --> 00:53:27.680
we're getting so close to getting some
sense of the particulars that I think we

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:27.690
sense of the particulars that I think we
 

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.839
sense of the particulars that I think we
should just shut up now and find out

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:29.849
should just shut up now and find out
 

00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:31.339
should just shut up now and find out
what it's actually like to the degree we

00:53:31.339 --> 00:53:31.349
what it's actually like to the degree we
 

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:32.930
what it's actually like to the degree we
can get it to work we're very close to

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940
can get it to work we're very close to
 

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.940
can get it to work we're very close to
having some answers but it basically

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:34.950
having some answers but it basically
 

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:39.440
having some answers but it basically
just boosts computer power hugely if it

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:39.450
just boosts computer power hugely if it
 

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:40.640
just boosts computer power hugely if it
could be made to work I mean I

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:40.650
could be made to work I mean I
 

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.130
could be made to work I mean I
interviewed Satya Nadella here and he

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140
interviewed Satya Nadella here and he
 

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.130
interviewed Satya Nadella here and he
said the quantum mechanic imputing was

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140
said the quantum mechanic imputing was
 

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.989

one of the big things that Microsoft

00:53:47.989 --> 00:53:47.999
one of the big things that Microsoft
 

00:53:47.999 --> 00:53:50.029
one of the big things that Microsoft
would be pushing on because it could end

00:53:50.029 --> 00:53:50.039
would be pushing on because it could end
 

00:53:50.039 --> 00:53:52.009
would be pushing on because it could end
that kind of Moore's law all they've

00:53:52.009 --> 00:53:52.019
that kind of Moore's law all they've
 

00:53:52.019 --> 00:53:53.569
that kind of Moore's law all they've
been living with us so long and actually

00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579
been living with us so long and actually
 

00:53:53.579 --> 00:53:57.109
been living with us so long and actually
changed substantially the power of

changed substantially the power of
 

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:59.299
changed substantially the power of
computing in terms of creating right but

00:53:59.299 --> 00:53:59.309

quirky particular ones and so there so

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880
quirky particular ones and so there so

you got that back-up plan in New Zealand
 

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:53.730
you got that back-up plan in New Zealand
together and I'm like no we can't cut a

terribly but I want to point out that we
 

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.450
terribly but I want to point out that we
have faced much more difficult problems

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:27.460
have faced much more difficult problems
 

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.120
have faced much more difficult problems
in the past and come through you know

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:30.130
in the past and come through you know
 

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:32.100
in the past and come through you know
like for all the problems we face now at

least so far I mean I don't know where

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520
least so far I mean I don't know where

because the way things go it's likely to

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:39.820
because the way things go it's likely to
 

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.550
because the way things go it's likely to
get worse before it gets better but

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:41.560
get worse before it gets better but
 

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.860
get worse before it gets better but
would it get as bad as I don't know

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:43.870
would it get as bad as I don't know
 

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.020
would it get as bad as I don't know
world war two I don't I don't think so

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.030
world war two I don't I don't think so
 

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:49.470
world war two I don't I don't think so
and we made it through that right so I'm

and we made it through that right so I'm
 

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.060
and we made it through that right so I'm
not optimistic in the sense that

not optimistic in the sense that
 

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:53.310
not optimistic in the sense that

because the underlying incentive

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:14.260
because the underlying incentive

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:04.940
users from emotional harm and that
 

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.849
users from emotional harm and that
transition and I wonder where you see

01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859
transition and I wonder where you see
 

01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:10.130
transition and I wonder where you see
that going next and how you think tech

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:10.140
that going next and how you think tech
 

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.140
that going next and how you think tech
brands can because you know emotional

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:12.150

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:13.890
safety of users of really important
 

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:17.270
safety of users of really important
things so how do you what's next for so

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280
things so how do you what's next for so
 

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.070
things so how do you what's next for so
they can finally how can they protect

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:19.080
they can finally how can they protect
 

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.510
they can finally how can they protect
their users while at the same time

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520
their users while at the same time
 

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.830
their users while at the same time
protecting free speech so I think the

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:24.840
protecting free speech so I think the
 

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:27.050
protecting free speech so I think the
answer looks approximately like this

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:27.060
answer looks approximately like this
 

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:31.130
answer looks approximately like this

monetized system then there would be a

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680

within that system so instead of just

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:18.530
within that system so instead of just
 

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:20.110

that doesn't challenge the logic

that doesn't challenge the logic

after these horrible wars we ended up
with the regime that created this

of you know some kind of multivalent
 

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.210
of you know some kind of multivalent
program of that kind ought to be able to

program of that kind ought to be able to
 

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:15.710

come to pass beyond this that's much

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:15.720
come to pass beyond this that's much
 

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.060
come to pass beyond this that's much
better

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.070
 

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:21.870
so I don't believe that monetizing the

so I don't believe that monetizing the
 

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.460
so I don't believe that monetizing the
internet by itself would be some sort of

internet by itself would be some sort of
 

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:25.200
internet by itself would be some sort of
panacea that would solve everything I

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.210
panacea that would solve everything I

panacea that would solve everything I
just think that if you have such if you

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:28.870
just think that if you have such if you
 

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:30.810
just think that if you have such if you

correction is gonna undo that that's

correction is gonna undo that that's
 

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.050
correction is gonna undo that that's
just the first step that you have to

01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:37.060
just the first step that you have to
 

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.050
just the first step that you have to
take so I viewed as a first step not a

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:40.060
take so I viewed as a first step not a
 

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:45.660
take so I viewed as a first step not a
last step and I I really believe it

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:45.670
last step and I I really believe it
 

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:46.980
last step and I I really believe it
actually be better for everybody this

01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:46.990
actually be better for everybody this
 

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.450
actually be better for everybody this
isn't an attack on the companies I think

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:48.460
isn't an attack on the companies I think
 

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.250
isn't an attack on the companies I think
it's I think we need big tech companies

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:50.260
it's I think we need big tech companies
 

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.660
it's I think we need big tech companies
actually really like big tech companies

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:51.670
actually really like big tech companies
 

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:53.100
actually really like big tech companies
but I think this would make them better

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:53.110
but I think this would make them better
 

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:54.060
but I think this would make them better
I think this would make them more

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.070
I think this would make them more
 

01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:55.680
I think this would make them more
sustainable and it would be more

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:55.690
sustainable and it would be more
 

01:13:55.690 --> 01:14:01.620
sustainable and it would be more
positive for everybody involved you may

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:01.630
positive for everybody involved you may
 

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:03.600
positive for everybody involved you may
have answered this but we regulate

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:03.610
have answered this but we regulate
 

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:06.450
have answered this but we regulate
addictive drugs we regulate addictive

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:06.460
addictive drugs we regulate addictive
 

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.820
addictive drugs we regulate addictive
services like gambling do you think we

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:08.830
services like gambling do you think we
 

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:10.920
services like gambling do you think we
should regulate addictive algorithms

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:10.930
should regulate addictive algorithms
 

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:12.930
should regulate addictive algorithms
yeah and you know the good thing in this

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:12.940
yeah and you know the good thing in this
 

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.520
yeah and you know the good thing in this
case is that we can define them more

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.530
case is that we can define them more
 

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.900
case is that we can define them more
clearly basically if there is a feedback

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:18.910
clearly basically if there is a feedback
 

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.750
clearly basically if there is a feedback
route from measurement of you that

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760
route from measurement of you that
 

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.270
route from measurement of you that
affects the so called customized or

influence that that is precisely the

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:28.690
influence that that is precisely the
 

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:31.380
influence that that is precisely the
thing to outlaw so I think we can we can

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:31.390
thing to outlaw so I think we can we can
 

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:33.420
thing to outlaw so I think we can we can
detect it we and I think it should be

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:33.430
detect it we and I think it should be
 

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:34.950
detect it we and I think it should be
outlawed I mean we can't do it instantly

01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960
outlawed I mean we can't do it instantly
 

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.240
outlawed I mean we can't do it instantly
because we need to give everybody a

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:36.250
because we need to give everybody a
 

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.710
because we need to give everybody a
chance to come up with other ways of

01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:37.720
chance to come up with other ways of
 

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.960
chance to come up with other ways of
doing things but I think it I think

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:39.970
doing things but I think it I think
 

01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:41.250
doing things but I think it I think
that's where we should end up I think

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:41.260
that's where we should end up I think
 

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.560
that's where we should end up I think
that that's a that's the government to

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:43.570
that that's a that's the government to
 

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:45.900
that that's a that's the government to
do well I think by whatever means

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:45.910
do well I think by whatever means
 

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.520
do well I think by whatever means
presumably government it might vary in

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:47.530
presumably government it might vary in
 

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.080
presumably government it might vary in
different parts of the world but but

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:49.090
different parts of the world but but
 

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.270
different parts of the world but but
that should be considered an immoral and

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280
that should be considered an immoral and
 

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.370
that should be considered an immoral and
unethical configuration that should not

01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:53.380
unethical configuration that should not
 

01:14:53.380 --> 01:15:00.600
unethical configuration that should not
exist I would see hi there thank you so

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:00.610
exist I would see hi there thank you so
 

01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.260
exist I would see hi there thank you so
much for the presentation was fantastic

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:03.270
much for the presentation was fantastic
 

01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:05.880
much for the presentation was fantastic
my first question I think it's mainly

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:05.890
my first question I think it's mainly
 

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.490
my first question I think it's mainly
touched on before but you mentioned how

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:08.500
touched on before but you mentioned how
 

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.680
touched on before but you mentioned how
you would have Internet services being

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:10.690
you would have Internet services being
 

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:12.470
you would have Internet services being
monetized so that the ad revenue

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480
monetized so that the ad revenue
 

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.640
monetized so that the ad revenue
wouldn't be the driving force behind the

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:14.650
wouldn't be the driving force behind the
 

01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:17.220
wouldn't be the driving force behind the
algorithms that spy on us anymore but

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:17.230
algorithms that spy on us anymore but
 

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:18.630
algorithms that spy on us anymore but
wouldn't the algorithms still remain

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640
wouldn't the algorithms still remain
 

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.430
wouldn't the algorithms still remain
there only a fundamental part of many of

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.440
there only a fundamental part of many of
 

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.580
there only a fundamental part of many of
these systems for example Facebook you

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:23.590
these systems for example Facebook you
 

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.260
these systems for example Facebook you
know suggesting you friends only knows

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:25.270
know suggesting you friends only knows
 

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.390
know suggesting you friends only knows
that by looking at the people you your

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400
that by looking at the people you your
 

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.160
that by looking at the people you your
friends were currently and then

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:29.170
friends were currently and then
 

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.300
friends were currently and then
looking at who their friends would and

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:30.310
looking at who their friends would and
 

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:33.120
looking at who their friends would and
so on how would these algorithms be

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:33.130
so on how would these algorithms be
 

01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:35.550
so on how would these algorithms be
changed even if the systems have become

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560
changed even if the systems have become
 

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.540
changed even if the systems have become
monetized they would I mean the broad

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:39.550
monetized they would I mean the broad
 

01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:40.980
monetized they would I mean the broad
question is that they should cease to

question is that they should cease to
 

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.090
question is that they should cease to
exist I think there are unethical

01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:42.100
exist I think there are unethical
 

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.910
exist I think there are unethical
algorithms but I think something very

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920
algorithms but I think something very
 

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.130
algorithms but I think something very
similar to them could be ethical I mean

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:47.140
similar to them could be ethical I mean
 

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.450
similar to them could be ethical I mean
this is the thing is that you could have

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:48.460
this is the thing is that you could have
 

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.250
this is the thing is that you could have
a version of all this stuff that's just

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:50.260
a version of all this stuff that's just
 

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.350
a version of all this stuff that's just
like three percent different that could

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360
like three percent different that could
 

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.190
like three percent different that could
be much better so if if there's an

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:56.200
be much better so if if there's an
 

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.210
be much better so if if there's an
algorithm that's so this thing about

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:00.220
algorithm that's so this thing about
 

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.920
algorithm that's so this thing about
finding your friends my algorithm is

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:01.930
finding your friends my algorithm is
 

01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:05.010
finding your friends my algorithm is
that it then starts to do little

01:18:49.589 --> 01:18:49.599
that doesn't screw up the climate
 

01:18:49.599 --> 01:18:52.260
that doesn't screw up the climate
further so that's blockchain blockchain

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:52.270
further so that's blockchain blockchain
 

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:54.810

and the problem here's this is actually
 

01:19:13.389 --> 01:19:14.310
and the problem here's this is actually
a bit of a mystery to me

so later speculators once them all do

01:19:40.410 --> 01:19:40.420
so later speculators once them all do
 

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.640
so later speculators once them all do
well and this is called a Ponzi scheme

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:41.650
well and this is called a Ponzi scheme

your solution okay early computers first
and then me okay what did you put what

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:50.390

was close to White Sands Missile Range

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:00.230
was close to White Sands Missile Range
 

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.710
was close to White Sands Missile Range
where the atomic bomb was first tested

where the atomic bomb was first tested
 

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.530
where the atomic bomb was first tested
and so there was an incredible early

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:18.830
programming experience was punching
 

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.980
programming experience was punching
these cards you'd feed these punched

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:20.990
these cards you'd feed these punched
 

01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:23.080
these cards you'd feed these punched
cards to the computer and then in the

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:23.090
cards to the computer and then in the
 

01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:24.640
cards to the computer and then in the
desert winds you would try to hold onto

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:24.650
desert winds you would try to hold onto
 

01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:26.260
desert winds you would try to hold onto
your cards but instead they fly

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:26.270
your cards but instead they fly
 

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:27.520
your cards but instead they fly
everywhere and your program would be

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:27.530
everywhere and your program would be
 

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:29.830
everywhere and your program would be
dissipated never to be seen again

01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840
dissipated never to be seen again
 

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:32.080
dissipated never to be seen again
and then the computers were actually

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.090
and then the computers were actually
 

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:33.790
and then the computers were actually
pretty slow so you could fake it and

01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800
pretty slow so you could fake it and
 

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.590
pretty slow so you could fake it and
pretend that the computer had run in

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600
pretend that the computer had run in
 

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.150
pretend that the computer had run in
order to fake your result and so we'd

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:37.160
order to fake your result and so we'd
 

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.460
order to fake your result and so we'd
have to do that so that was my first

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:39.470
have to do that so that was my first
 

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:43.390
have to do that so that was my first
experience with competing and then on on

01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400
experience with competing and then on on
 

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.670

the VR thing yeah this is you know I

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:45.680
the VR thing yeah this is you know I
 

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.260
the VR thing yeah this is you know I
kind of regret that we didn't do more on

01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:47.270
kind of regret that we didn't do more on
 

01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:48.940
kind of regret that we didn't do more on
VR specifically but it just seems that

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:48.950
VR specifically but it just seems that
 

01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:51.310

these that all of these other issues are

01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320
these that all of these other issues are
 

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.990
these that all of these other issues are
so urgent and our times that they demand

01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000
so urgent and our times that they demand
 

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.050
so urgent and our times that they demand
immediate discussion so in terms of VR

01:22:56.050 --> 01:22:56.060
immediate discussion so in terms of VR
 

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.390
immediate discussion so in terms of VR
everything you said is correct I can

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400
everything you said is correct I can
 

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.980
everything you said is correct I can
give you a few models of it you might

01:22:59.980 --> 01:22:59.990
give you a few models of it you might
 

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:01.720
give you a few models of it you might
want to look at have you seen something

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:01.730
want to look at have you seen something
 

01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:04.210
want to look at have you seen something

this was a big deal before the iPhone I

01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560
this was a big deal before the iPhone I
 

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.200
this was a big deal before the iPhone I
didn't transfer to the small screen so

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:08.210
didn't transfer to the small screen so
 

01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:09.970
didn't transfer to the small screen so
it kind of lost its currency but this

01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:09.980
it kind of lost its currency but this
 

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:12.100
it kind of lost its currency but this
was a sort of an online virtual world

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:12.110
was a sort of an online virtual world
 

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:13.840
was a sort of an online virtual world
that thousands of people could be in and

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:13.850
that thousands of people could be in and
 

01:23:13.850 --> 01:23:15.280

they all designed their own virtual
 

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.260
they all designed their own virtual
places and they bought and sold stuff so

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:17.270
places and they bought and sold stuff so
 

01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:19.600
places and they bought and sold stuff so

is a whole big thing but I think there's

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:32.870
is a whole big thing but I think there's
 

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:34.450
is a whole big thing but I think there's
a misunderstanding in the industry of

a final we're up to time sadly but give

a final we're up to time sadly but give
us a final notion of where VR can go in

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:54.620
us a final notion of where VR can go in

in that optimistic sense you've talked a

01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:56.990
in that optimistic sense you've talked a
 

01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:58.150
in that optimistic sense you've talked a
lot about you've been asked a lot about

01:24:58.150 --> 01:24:58.160
lot about you've been asked a lot about
 

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.810
lot about you've been asked a lot about
the darker sides and the possibilities

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:00.820
the darker sides and the possibilities
 

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.490
the darker sides and the possibilities
but where can it go to connect with

01:25:03.490 --> 01:25:03.500
but where can it go to connect with
 

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.770
but where can it go to connect with
human but it turns out that humans are

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:05.780
human but it turns out that humans are
 

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.750
human but it turns out that humans are
capable of taking on different bodies

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760
capable of taking on different bodies
 

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.490
capable of taking on different bodies
because our brain remembers all the
