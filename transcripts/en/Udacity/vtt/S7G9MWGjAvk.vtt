00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.740
Now that you have some experience
presenting off the shelf

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.840
view controllers,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.320
you're probably wondering how to present
your own custom view controllers.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.970
Here we have an app that
simulates rolling dice.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.660
The first view controller with
the roll the dice button,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.440
presents a second view controller
that displays a roll of the dice.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.460
The second view controller can be
presented in the same way as the camera

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.280
roll or the activity views and
alert views.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.990
But this time we have full control
over the displayed view controller.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.990
The app is currently incomplete.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.030
In a second, you'll be asked to download
it, and look at the Xcode project.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.470
But before we get into the Xcode files,
let's pause for a second,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.540
to draw the object diagrams for
the two view controllers.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.980
That way we can clarify
which IBoutlets and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.390
IBActions the project should contain.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.110
The first view controller is simple.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.450
It's just a single button
with a single action.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.010
This is the action that should
trigger the presentation

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.870
of the Dice View Controller.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.490
The Dice View Controller
is slightly more complex.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.050
It needs outlets to these two
image views that are for the dice.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680
It also has one button
with a single action.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.740
This action will cause the view
controller to be dismissed.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.204
If you look in the instructor notes
you should see a file called dice.zip.

00:01:07.204 --> 00:01:09.450
Go ahead and download that file and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
then examine the Dice Xcode Project
with the following questions in mind.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.810
Check off each question
as you find the answers.
