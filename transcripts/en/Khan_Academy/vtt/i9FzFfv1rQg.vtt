00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.844
- [Tutor] A set of philosophy exam scores

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:06.083
are normally distributed
with a mean of 40 points

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:09.169
and a standard deviation of three points.

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.002
Ludwig got a score of
47.5 points on the exam.

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:17.981
What proportion of exam scores are higher

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.097
than Ludwig's score?

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.199
Give your answer correct
to four decimal places.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.368
So, let's just visualize
what's going on here.

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:29.334
So, the scores are normally distributed.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.667
So, it would look like this.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.235
So, the distribution would
look something like that,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.769
trying to make that
pretty symmetric looking.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.602
The mean is 40 points,

00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:45.941
so that would be 40
points right over there.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.649
Standard deviation is three points,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.158
so this could be one standard
deviation above the mean,

00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:55.111
that would be one standard
deviation below the mean.

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:57.167
And once again, this is just very rough.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:02.119
And so, this would be 43, this
would be 37 right over here.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.286
And they say Ludwig got a score
of 47.5 points on the exam.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.927
So, Ludwig's score is going
to be someplace around here.

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.926
So, Ludwig got a 47.5 on the exam.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.067
And they're saying, what
proportion of exam scores

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:22.627
are higher than Ludwig's score?

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:24.333
So, what we need to do is figure out

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.817
what is the area under the
normal distribution curve

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:29.400
that is above 47.5.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.256
So, the way we will tackle this

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:36.951
is we will figure out
the z score for 47.5.

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:40.608
How many standard deviations
above the mean is that?

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:42.479
Then, we will look at a z table

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.811
to figure out what
proportion is below that

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:46.441
because that's what z tables give us.

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.166
They give us the proportion that is below

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.666
a certain z score.

00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:53.269
And then, we can take one minus that

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.507
to figure out the
proportion that is above.

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:58.586
Remember, the entire area
under the curve is one,

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.529
so if we can figure out this orange area

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.692
and take one minus that,
we're gonna get the red area.

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:04.786
So, let's do that.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:08.958
So, first of all, let's figure
out the z score for 47.5.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.266
So, let's see.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.766
We would take 47.5

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:17.550
and we would subtract the mean.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.616
So, this is his score.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:20.941
We'll subtract the mean, minus 40.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.501
We know what that's gonna be, that's 7.5.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.278
That's how much more above the mean.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:27.302
But how many standard deviations is that?

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:28.917
Well, each standard deviation is three,

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:31.373
so what's 7.5 divided by three?

00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:34.993
This just means the previous
answer divided by three.

00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:39.076
So, he is 2.5 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:41.918
So, the z score here,

00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:44.501
z score here is a positive 2.5.

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:48.065
If he was below the mean,
it would be a negative.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.570
So now, we can look at a z table

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.367
to figure out what
proportion is less than 2.5

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:54.474
standard deviations above the mean.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.508
So, that'll give us that orange

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.867
and then we'll subtract that from one.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.768
So, let's get our z table.

00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:02.084
So, here we go.

00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:04.703
And we've already done
this in previous videos,

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:07.160
but what's going on
here is this left column

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.797
gives us our z score
up to the tenths place.

00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:13.583
And then these other columns
give us the hundredths place.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:16.016
So, what we want to do is find 2.5

00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:17.818
right over here on the left,

00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:19.976
and it's actually gonna be 2.50.

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:22.921
There's zero hundredths here.

00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:25.525
So, we want to look up 2.50.

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:27.608
Let me scroll my z table.

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:30.963
So, I'm gonna go down to 2.5.

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:34.589
Alright, I think I am there.

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.589
So, what I have here, so I have 2.5,

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.754
so I am going to be in this row.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.541
And it's now scrolled off,

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.482
but this first column we saw,

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:48.565
this is the hundredths place
and this zero hundredths.

00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:51.648
And so, 2.50 puts us right over here.

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:53.894
Now, you might be tempted to say,

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:57.122
okay, that's the proportion
that scores higher than Ludwig,

00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:58.028
but you'd be wrong.

00:03:58.028 --> 00:04:01.060
This is the proportion that
scores lower than Ludwig.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.645
So, what we wanna do is
take one minus this value.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:07.895
So, let me get my calculator out again.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.153
So, what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:13.403
one minus this.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.532
One minus 0.9938

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.385
is equal to, now this is,

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:25.476
so this is the proportion
that scores less than Ludwig.

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:27.095
One minus that is gonna be the proportion

00:04:27.095 --> 00:04:28.593
that scores more than him.

00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:30.428
The reason why we have to do
this is because the z table

00:04:30.428 --> 00:04:34.061
gives us the proportion
less than a certain z score.

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.561
So, this gives us right over here, 0.0062.

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:39.773
So, that's the proportion.

00:04:39.773 --> 00:04:40.818
If you thought of it in percent,

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:45.674
it would be 0.62% scores
higher than Ludwig.

00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:47.836
Now, that makes sense 'cause Ludwig scored

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.174
over two standard deviations,

00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:52.669
two and a half standard
deviations above the mean.

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.752
So, our answer is 0.0062.

00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.324
So, this is going to be 0.0062.

00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:03.031
That's the proportion of exam scores

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.281
higher than Ludwig's score.
