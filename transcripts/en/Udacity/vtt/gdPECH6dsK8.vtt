00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the trick to understanding this quiz

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is noticing that myfun has a formal

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
parameter named x,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and when we're inside myfun,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when we're inside the body, when control

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
has reached these statements,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we need x to refer to the actual

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
argument and not the outside value.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So when we get in here, myfun x = outside x.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This can't happen because we've passed in os lusiadas.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My Portuguese pronunciation needs work.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Imagine I'm pronouncing that correctly, and that's going

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to shadow or replace the old value of x.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
However, there's only 1 variable here, x.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So y never changes.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So we will print out myfun y = outside y.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Similarly, since we are passing in os lusiadas to myfun as x,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we can print out myfun x is os luciadas,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but there is never an assignment of y

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to os luciadas so we'll never end up printing out this variant.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So again, the key concept, we can have

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
multiple values of x in different contexts.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Out here, x is outside x.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In here, x is the value of the actual argument, os lusiandas,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which we often--let's say

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
aggressively pronounce in English as

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The Lusiads , a Portuguese epic poem in 1572,

00:01:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
entirely worth checking out.
