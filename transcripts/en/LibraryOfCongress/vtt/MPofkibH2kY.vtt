00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; The Library of Congress
in Washington DC.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good morning.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.090
&gt;&gt; Audience: Good morning.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.660
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.960
I'm John Cole.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.280 position:56%
I'm the Director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.530
and I'm glad to welcome
you to a special ceremony

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.570
where we are inaugurating or at
a well-known inaugural ceremony,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.370
our Fifth National Ambassador
four Young People's Literature.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.070 position:56%
The Center for The Book is fortunate
to have many important co-sponsors,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.360
of course, in this
wonderful program.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.790
You're going to hear from them
in a minute, but in the meantime,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.380
I'm going to tell you just a little
bit about the Center for the Book,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.240
which was established in 1977
as a public/private partnership.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.940
We have a law authorizing
what we do, but it also infers

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.100
that we will raise private
money to pay for our activities,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.010
which we are pleased to do,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.620
and that's where the
partnerships come in.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.470
Our purpose is to, on behalf of the
Library of Congress, promote books

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.650
and reading and literacy
and libraries.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.260
We accomplish this mission not only
through events such as this one

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.190
at the Library of Congress
and many other events but also

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.380 position:56%
through a major role in the National
Book Festival, which I know many

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.480
of you know about, but also
through the nationwide networks

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.060
of state affiliates, and that's
one of the reasons are so pleased

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.670
to have people from
around the country here,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.630
and that our ambassador will
be visiting various places

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.170
around the country to spread the
good word about the importance

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.140
of reading and books
for young people.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.390
We also have an affiliate
program of organizations,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.930
and the Children's Book
Council, our major sponsor here,

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.890
is one of the members
of that network,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.600
but one of our key endeavors,
in fact, brings us here today.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.930
This program was established
by the Children's Book Council

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.760 position:56%
and the Center for the Book, in this
Children's Book Council Foundation,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.660
Every Child a Reader,
way back in 2008.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.550
It doesn't seem to us, to those
of us who have been involved,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.300
that it's been that long, actually,
but we have living proof here today

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.510
with a couple of the
former ambassadors,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.420
and you will meet them later.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.340 position:56%
Our program's aim is to raise
national awareness of the importance

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.710
of young people's literature as it
relates to literacy, to education,

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.040
into something much
bigger, the betterment

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.470
of the lives of our young people.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.740
Appointed for a two-year term,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.350
the National Ambassador chooses a
personal platform relating to books

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.970
and reading, which you
will also hear about.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.780
It's the Librarian of Congress
takes the appointment based

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.800
on recommendations of a committee
of experts who has helped,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.210
and many members of the
committee are here today.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.280 position:56%
The Center for the Book, in addition
to the programs I've mentioned,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.100
administers the Library's
Poetry and Literature Center

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.280
and its Young Readers Center,
which was created in 2009,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.110
and at the Young Reader's Center,
which I hope you will visit today.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.330
Is in this building, and
you'll be guided there.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.300
We not only have books written
by our new National Ambassador,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.020
whoever he or she may be.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.800
There's a big surprise
announcement coming.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.930
Plus, for their parents
and their caregivers.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.340
Technically, it's down on
room G-29 of the ground floor

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.780
of this beautiful Jefferson
Building.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.390
There also is a special
display, became available today,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.270
in the window leading to
the Young Readers Center

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.160
where you can learn the identity of
our brand-new National Ambassador,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.940
and inside the Young Readers
Center is a display of works,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.430
not only by the new ambassador, but
by all the previous ambassadors.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.520
I want to extend a special
welcome today to guests

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.190
from the Savoie Elementary School.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.770
Where the world can they be?

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.070
Can I hear from them?

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.370
Are they someplace nearby?

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.380
Let's hear another yay!

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.180
Raise your hands.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.290
[ Applause ]

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.770
Let's try that one more time.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.070
We've now rehearsed it.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.010
I want to extend a special
welcome to our guests

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.940
from the Savoie Elementary School.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.550
Can we hear from them?

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.280
There we go.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.470
They will, I must say,
logistically speaking,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.640
will be leaving the room the first
because each of them is then,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.300
after we are done this
part of the ceremony,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.050
because they will each be
receiving a signed copy

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.940
of a book by our new ambassador.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.400
Well, I will say just a quick
word for how many of you,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.600
this is the first visit to
the Library of Congress?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.900
Would you raise your hand?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.200
A lot of the kids.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.360
A number of the adults.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.880
This beautiful building
was opened in 1897.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.960
Our first home was the US
capital because we were created

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.220
when the capital moved
to Washington in 1800.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220
So we have a long history.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.290
Our other big buildings on this
campus are the John Adams Building,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:52.480
which opened in 1980 -- excuse
me, in 1998; 1939, I'm sorry.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.780
I'm a historian.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.080
I haven't got my dates.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.840
I'm in the wrong century
half of the time,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.610
but I do know when the Madison
Building opened, which was 1980.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.560
So we have these three major
buildings, and I hope you come back

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.450
after you visit the
Young Readers Center.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.160 position:56%
You'll see some of the other glories
of this building, and learn more

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.980
about the Library of Congress.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.320
I would now like to introduce you

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.600
to the acting Librarian
of Congress, David Mao.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.810
David oversees this whole entire
library that I've tried to describe

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.190
and its various service units,
and we serve the Congress first,

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.040
but we serve all of
the American people.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.400
We are also a public library, which
lots of people don't seem to know,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.480
but we're working hard
to let them know,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.240
and the Young Readers Center
is the principal way we do it.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.780
David has big picture.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.490
He served as Deputy Librarian
of Congress for a short period.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.020
During his time as
Deputy, David oversaw kind

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.470
of a strategic alignment.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.930
We're trying to figure out where
we're headed, because right now,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.050
the post of Librarian of Congress,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.480
which the presidential
appointment, is still open.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.020
We're still waiting to see
what's going to happen,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.000
but in the meantime, we've
been lucky to have David,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.880
and we've also had an appointment
of a new Chief Operating Officer,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.270
and under David also, the hiring
of a new Chief Information Officer,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.820
and as I mentioned, David
has broad experience.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.940 position:56%
Before being named Deputy Librarian,

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.700
he was our 23rd Law
Librarian of Congress.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.080 position:56%
As Law Librarian, he managed the
operation of one of our major units,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.730
which has the world's biggest --

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.910
there are lots of world's
biggest connected with the Library

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.530
of Congress -- collection
of legal materials,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.210
and it serves as leading
research center for foreign,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.640
comparative, and international law.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.280
David often described the position
as part Lock Librarian to Congress,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.940
part steward for law
collections, and part ambassador --

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.820
there's that word -- to the world's
legal and library communities.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.120
Please welcome David Mao.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.920
David.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:10.160
[ Applause ]

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.460
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Thank
you so much, John,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.150
for that very kind
introduction, and welcome everyone

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.020
to the Library of Congress.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.360
Now, boys and girls, remember when
I came in and you were standing

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.720
down in the hall, what
did I tell you

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.530
about ignoring what your teachers
and your parents always tell you

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.560
about being inside the
building, and inside voices.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.390
I was hoping that you would really
be very generous with their spirit.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.700
So let's try again, I think
John was trying to get you

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.140
to show your spirit here.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.910
So welcome again to the Library
of Congress from the kids and --

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.210
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Savoie.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.510
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Savoie.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.810
Come on. No inside voices.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.270
All right, all right.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.570
Thank you.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.360
Again, it's my pleasure to
welcome all of you to the Library

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.150
of Congress for this very,
very important event.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.190
So we celebrate the
National Ambassador

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.720
for Young People's Literature,
and that is a very important role,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.500
because it is this National
Ambassador that, since 2008,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.940 position:56%
since John has mentioned, going out
and traveling the nation and talking

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.360
to boys and girls and
talking to, well, adults, too,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.170
about the importance of literature,
young people's literature, reading,

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.700
literacy, all of these things that
are very, very important, and,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.730
boys and girls, I hope
you take that to heart,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.070
and you will soon see
why it's so important

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.310
when we introduce our
new ambassador.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.710
But before we do that, we're very,
very fortunate, as John mentioned,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.360
that we have a couple of our
previous ambassadors here with us,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.350
Kate DiCamillo and Jon
Scieszka, who started us off,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.760 position:56%
and both of them did fabulous jobs
during their tenures as ambassadors,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.140
spreading the word about what we
do here at the Library of Congress

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.560
and just generally the word about
literature and books and reading.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.890 position:56%
I want to now officially welcome our
new, and announce our new ambassador

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.790
for young people's literature.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:10.670 position:56%
His name is Gene Luen Yang, and he's
going to come up in just a second.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.040
I wanted to say one thing, though.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.420
I think many of you are
ready knew that he was going

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.480
to be our ambassador, and I
had the fortunate privilege

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.850
of being mistaken for him.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.790
So, if there's one benefit, you
know, nobody knows who I am.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.820
Now people think I'm
the new Ambassador

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.180 position:56%
for Young People's Literature, and
John had mentioned as Law Librarian,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.600
I thought of myself
as the ambassador

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.650
to the world's legal community.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.580
Now I can really say that I'm
ambassador to all of the world,

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.400
and so, thank you, John --

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.620
I'm sorry, Gene, for
giving me that privilege.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.980
So students, are you ready?

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.280
&gt;&gt; Students: Yeah!

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.580
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Okay,
now that's better.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.880
We very much.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.360
We will now introduce Gene, can
I invite John for coming up.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.920
Is that what is to do, Jon?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.720
Am I supposed to invite
you up to introduce him?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.020
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Yes, you may.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.050
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Okay, all right,
we'll do that, and again,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.510
thank you for being here everyone,
and we will now hear from John.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.430
[ Applause ]

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.760
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, we'll hear
from David again, because in one

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.530
of his pockets, I hope, he has a
metal that is going to be presented

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.550
to the Ambassador,
Gene, in a few minutes,

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.860
but I would like to just make
the point that having Gene

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.000
and the ambassador is a
very special thing for us.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.830
Both it shows we have continuity
in this program that is going

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.340
to be stretching across
our country and stretching

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.610
to different audiences
at different levels,

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.650
and we view our Young Readers
Center, which you'll see is kind

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:59.280
of the hope for the activity kind
of effort, but also as a model,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.420
and as our ambassadors have
gone around the country

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.530
and have developed and
learned about new programs,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.560
they've shared those ideas with
all of us, and I know Gene is going

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.070
to the same, but for the
record, and just to get this more

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.330
of a momentous occasion, I
would like everyone to stand

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.860
and applaud our new
ambassador, Gene Luen Yang.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.660
Gene.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:45.750
[ Applause ]

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.900
You will hear from
Gene in a few minutes,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.390
and Kate and Jon, please stand.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.610
Stay up. The work recognition,
actually, of Jon Scieszka

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.510
and Kate DiCamillo,
our other ambassadors.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:05.580
[ Applause ]

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.750
Jon was our first ambassador, and
so we broke each other in in terms

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.170
of what is expected
of an ambassador,

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.690
and one of the things Jon taught
me that he took that metal,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:20.260
and he never took it off,
and the other thing is

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.970
that he still expects me to
come up with a model helicopter

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:30.670 position:56%
that will sort of, he wanted one to
kind of fly him around Washington DC

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.080
as the ambassador and
make appearances.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.070
So it's still on the agenda, Jon.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.370
We're a government agency.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.610
It takes a little while.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.910
As I mentioned earlier,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.220
our cosponsor is a
Children's Book Council,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.770
which is an important partner
for us, and especially important

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.380
for this project, and its
foundation, Every Child a Reader,

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.930
is our major financial supporter
in many ways for this activity,

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.230
and it's my pleasure to
introduce another John.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.280
Not a Jon, a Jon Coleman,
who is the Executive Director

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.090
of the Children's Book
Council, for remarks.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.390
Jon.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.190
&gt;&gt; Thanks, John.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.260
[ Applause ]

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.600
&gt;&gt; Jon Coleman: Hello
everyone, I'm Jon Coleman.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.890
I'm the Executive Director of
the Children's Book Council,

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.500
the nonprofit trade organization
for children's book publishers

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.630
in North America that's dedicated
to supporting the industry

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.580
and promoting children's books and
reading, and Every Child a Reader,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.670
a nonprofit, which works
to instill a lifelong love

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.440
of reading in children.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.150 position:56%
Since the National Ambassador
Program's inception eight years ago,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.300
we have been honored to have
four exceptionally beloved

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.760
and respected children's
books creators take

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.710 position:56%
up the ambassador mental, serving as
the country's preeminent advocates

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.630
for lifelong literacy
and the joy of reading.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.850
Jon Scieszka, our inaugural
ambassador, paved the way in 2008,

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.460
focusing on transforming reluctant
readers into enthusiastic once.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.500
Said Jon, "There is no one book
that is right for all kids,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.350
but there are all kinds
of crazy, interesting,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.830
and amazing books out there.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.430
It's our job to help kids find
that book that will inspire them

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.920
to want to become readers."

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.530
As a children's book writer,
former elementary school teacher,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.650
and founder of Guide's Read, A
Literacy Initiative for Boys,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.420 position:56%
Jon was exceptionally skilled at
generating excitement around reading

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.500
and motivating kids want to read.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.720
Our second national ambassador,
Katherine Paterson's Read

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.090
for Your Life platform, focused on
encouraging reluctant young readers

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.110
to find that truly engage them,
in order to build a strong,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.460
lifelong love of reading.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.380
As Katherine said, "I think all of
the joy of reading has given me --

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.710 position:56%
it's not just because it is good for
you, but it is because it is good."

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.450
Walter Dean Myers,
our third ambassador,

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.060
selected Reading is Not
Optional as his platform.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.480
His stance on literacy was
that it should be positioned

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.570
as a pleasant adjunct
to life, but instead,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.050
is integral to lifelong
growth and development.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.770
Walter said, "I think what we
need to do is say reading is going

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.160
to really affect your life.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.570
You take a man who doesn't have
a job but you say to him, 'Look,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.070
you can make a difference in
your child's life just by reading

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.760
to him for 30 minutes a day.'

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.330
That's what I would like to do."

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.080
Walter was particularly interested
in reaching underserved communities

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.510
and visiting incarcerated teens

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.830
in juvenile detention
centers throughout his tenure.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.730
He was also committed to
getting parents to read

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:05.590
to their very young children
to help close the literacy gap.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.520
Kate DiCamilla, our
most recent ambassador,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.660
championed the community-unifying
power of storytelling.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.110
During her tenure, Kate
participated in a variety

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.180
of community reads
programming from coast-to-coast,

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.960
bringing communities together with
the power of the written word.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.630
In Kate's words, "When we
read together, we can act.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.930
Together we see the world.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.600
Together we see one another."

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.900
Over the last eight years,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.110
the National Ambassador Program has
reached millions of young readers

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.820
and their caregivers in the United
States through schools, libraries,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.970
bookstores, community centers,
prisons, museums, and beyond.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.210
In August of this year, we
convened our suction committee

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.640
for the 2016-2017 ambassadorship.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.030
The committee is composed of the
following individuals, Betsy Berg,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.970
Election Development Manager
of Evanston Public Library,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.000
Shelley M. Diaz, Senior Editor,
Reviews at School Library Journal,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.060
Kate DiCamillo, National Ambassador
for Young People's Literature,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.860
2014-2015, Jonathan Hunt,

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.560

Library Media Services

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.000
at the San Diego County office
of Education, Kimberly L. Jones,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.440

Deborah Taylor, Coordinator
of School and Student Services

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.850
at Enoch-Pratt Free Library,
and Lisa Von Draseck,

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.290
Curator of the Children's
Literature Research Collections

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.830
at the University of
Minnesota Libraries.

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.420
Each of these esteemed
advocates for children's books

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.120
and literacy was asked
to bring a short list

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.710
of their top five candidates
consideration based

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.340
on the following criteria.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.700
1) Their contributions to
young people's to literature.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.620
2) Their ability to relate to kids
and teens, and 3) Their dedication

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.900
to fostering children's
literacy as a whole.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.980
Gene Yang's name appeared
on every, single list.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.730 position:56%
As every committee member well knew,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.200
Gene has been an outstanding
advocate

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.130
for inclusion graphing
novels and reading for years,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.130
and we knew it was about time to
formalize the vital role he serves

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.700
for our nation's young people.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.100
Gene's platform, Reading Without
Walls, will focus on breaking

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.890
down barriers to reading,
championing diversity in all forms,

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.590
and engaging young
readers/nonreaders,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.960
and that could not be
more timely and impactful.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.770
Gene, we are honored and delighted
that you have accepted the position

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.000
as our Fifth National Ambassador
for Young People's Literature

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.980
and could not be more excited to
share your message with children

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.060
and caregivers across the
country for the next two years.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.690
I would also like to
extend our gratitude

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.360
to this year's National
Ambassador Program sponsors,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.010

Scholastic, Simon &amp; Schuster Book

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.550
for Young Readers, and the
Lois Lenski Covey Foundation.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.160
Generosity makes all
this profitable.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.510
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; John Cole: it's my pleasure
to, once again, introduce the time

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.200
for a few comments, Kate DiCamillo,
who is the outgoing, so to speak,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.020
National Ambassador for
Young People's Literature.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:54.650
Kate, as I think Jon mentioned in
part, is an award-winning author

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.190
who did a wonderful job
for us the last two years.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:03.080 position:56%
We have been lucky in all of our
ambassadors, and it's been, in part,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.960
because as Jon mentioned, we've
had a skilled, dedicated crew

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.910
of people recommending, but
in part, it's the individuals.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.650
Once they're in this
position and realize

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.320
that the opportunity is there
to really impress young people

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.600
and their parents about
reading and its importance,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.210
which has developed a new way
of doing it, and Kate is going

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.840
to talk a little bit about herself,
but also about another ambassador

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.960
and the importance of what
we've been doing together.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.140
The final point is that on
the Library of Congress site,

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.400
each ambassador does appear
at our National Book Festival.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.460
It so happens that Gene already has
been at our National Book Festival,

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.870
but Kate, John, Katherine,

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.210
and Walter Dean Myers all became
veterans of the Book Festival,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.450 position:56%
and in that sense, they contributed
greatly to the national book culture

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.970
that we're trying to create
here at the Library of Congress.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.790
Please welcome Kate DiCamillo.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.590
Kate.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:09.070
[ Applause ]

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.140
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: We're going
to get to Gene, I promise.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.640
So how are you all doing?

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.940
Good? Okay.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:22.420
Can I just say something
when I put my glasses on?

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.090
That one of the best things that
happened to me in the two years

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.570
that I was ambassador was
when I was in South Dakota,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.060
and I was in an auditorium
that had 900 kids in it,

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:39.840
and they were fabulous,
and one kid raised her hand

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:45.150
and asked how old I was,
and I said, "I'm 50."

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.800
And she said, "But
how did that happen?"

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.460
And I think of that every time
I put the reading glasses on,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.950
and it's like I don't know.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.980 position:56%
You know, it will happen to you too.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.380
When Walter Dean Myers was
a young man, he read a story

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.910
by James Baldwin entitled
Sonny's Blues.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.570
That story, Walter said,
gave him a permission

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.860
that he didn't know he needed.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.560
The permission to write about
his own landscape, his own map.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.050
Walter Dean Myers felt that there
was no greater calling than to do

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.410
for others what Sonny's
Blues had done for him,

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.370
and Walter did exactly that.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.440
His words give permission.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.360
His books are maps.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.740
He held up the light that let
us see ourselves and the others.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.800
Two years ago, Walter
stood at this podium

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.780
and passed some of his light to me.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.700
I tried my best to carry it high,
to honor Walter, to honor Catherine

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:56.320
and Jon, and to honor books
and their power to connect us

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.060
and to help us see each
other, and today, I feel very,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.900
very lucky to pass this
light, Walter's light,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.650
onto the incomparable Gene Yang.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.770
Thank you for these past two years.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.510
Thank you for letting
me hold the light.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:20.720
[ Applause ]

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.930
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Yes, our
new ambassador is next.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:28.770
You are about to personally
experience Gene's passion

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.050
for reading, his passion for books,
and he's going to talk a little bit

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.090
about his theme of inclusiveness.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.430
Reading Without Walls.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.540
Gene is a Michael Prinz winner.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.410
He's won lots of awards, but his
career is really moving up fast now

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.620
with more awards and more
recognition in many different ways.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:53.840
The American Library Association
bestows the Prinz Award each year

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.500 position:56%
for the best book written for teens,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.320
written entirely on
its literary merit.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.400
Gene will cover a little of
this, but let me explain quickly,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.890
just in case he doesn't, and
then he may not have to go

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.250
into too much depth on this part.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.690
He's been drawing comics
since the fifth grade.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:15.480
He first found success in
1997 when he received a grant

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.710
for his Gordon Yamamoto
in The King of Greeks,

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:25.230
which was eventually published as a
comic book by a comic book company.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.050
During this time, Gene received
a master's degree in education

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.250
at California State at Hayward

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.490
and began teaching
school in San Francisco.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.490
I've mentioned, in passing,
the first graphic novel

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.800
of Gene's American-Born Chinese
was enormously successful,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.840
and the first graphic novel
to be named a finalist

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.660
for the National Book Award.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.090
The book is about a teenager
struggling with his identity,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.700
a theme that is common
in much of Gene's work,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.340
which emphasizes the importance of
celebrating our diverse culture.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.810
It was American-Born Chinese
that won the Prinz Award.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.190
Boxers and Saints, which comprises
two companion graphic novels,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.130
was Gene's next solo work,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.370
and it also was a National
Book Award Finalist.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.200
Gene is currently writing the
graphic novel series Secret Coders,

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.030
which teaches young people about
computer programming, believe it

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.460 position:56%
or not, and it's said if I read that
book, I could become a computer.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.040
So I'm going to give it
a try, Gene, I promise.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.710
Please welcome Gene, our
new National Ambassador

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.010
for Young People's Literature.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.810
Gene Yang.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:51.230
[ Applause ]

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:55.240
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.170
Thank you so much for being here.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.760
I seriously cannot tell you
how excited, how honored,

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.870
and how thrilled I am to be here.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.570
I'm going to start by thanking
a whole bunch of people.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.920
There are lots of people to thank.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.400
So please bear with me.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.380
First, I want to thank God for
both the blessings and trials.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.070
Second only to God I want to
thank the Library of Congress,

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.670
Every Child a Reader, and
the Children's Book Council,

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:25.160
not just for this opportunity,
but also for caring so deeply

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.840
about the young people
of this nation,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.800
for wanting to share the wonders
of books and wonders of reading

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.700
with every child in America.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.260
I want to thank all of my
predecessors at this post.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:42.290
I want to thank Kate and
Walter and Katherine and Jon.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.410
You guys have truly created a
legacy of light, and I feel honored

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.120
to be a part of that legacy.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.290
I'd like to thank all the good
people at McMillan Children's

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.370
and First-Second Books, John
Sargent, Jonathan Yagen,

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:02.560 position:56%
Simon Boutin, Angus Killick, Allison
Verost, Costa Brill, Gina Gagliano,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.170
and especially Mark Siegel.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.220
First-Second Books,
just over 10 years ago,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.570
First-Second Books was a glimmer
in Mark's eye, and now it is a home

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.810
for me and storytellers like me.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.420
That's a really amazing thing.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.700
I'd like to thank my agent,
Judy Hansen, for your wisdom

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.800
and guidance, my lovely wife,
Teresa, who is my partner

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:31.000
in everything, and also my family
for their undying support, and last

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.680
but not least, I want
to thank all of you,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.740
especially if you skipped
school to be here.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.540
You so much.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.890
[laughter] Now I'm going to start
by telling you a little bit,

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.620
something about myself
that you may not know.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.120
I am a nerd.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.940
I know a lot of you are
looking at me and going, "Wow,

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.180
that guy kind of looks
like a pro wrestler."

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.220
But I am not a pro wrestler.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.520
I'm a nerd.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.460
I like the things that
nerdy people like.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.440
I like superhero comics.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.060
I like computers, and my
nerdiness really solidified

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.360
when I was in fifth grade.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.660
That was when I really fell in love

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.900
with both superhero
comics and computers.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.610
Going to tell you exactly
how that happened.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.910 position:56%
I fell in love with superhero comics

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.290
because of this book
here right here.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.820
Oh, this is what I looked like
in fifth grade, by the way.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:27.150
Now I fell in love with superhero,
because of this book right here.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.330
This is Marvel Comics Two in One.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.370
The series that they don't
really publish anymore,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.810
but this is where Marvel Comics
would take two of their characters

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.280
that didn't normally hang out
together and them together

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.360
to have some kind of adventure.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.100
For this issue, it was The
Thing and Rom The Space Knight.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.490
I thought the two characters
looked amazing.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.390
I saw this at my local bookstore.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.690
I brought it up to my mom.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.330
I said, "Mom, I need to own this.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.600
Can you please buy it for me?"

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.010
She looked at cover, and she
said, "No, absolutely not.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.760
Those two characters
look way too scary,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.490
and they're going to
give you nightmares."

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.140
And she maybe put this
back on the spinner rack.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:04.320
To this day, I really have no
idea what this story is all about,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.200
but my mom, being a good
mom, decided buy me a comic.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.690
She decided to buy me the
latest Superman comic.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.760
I have to tell you,
when I was a kid,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.190
I was not a huge fan of Superman.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.500
I thought he was kind of boring,
but it's obvious why my mom chose

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.930
to buy me a Superman comic, right?

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.880
Because Superman is every
parent's favorite superhero.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.430
He's not scary looking at all.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.800
He's actually kind of good-looking.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.100
He always does the right thing.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.760
He never says any bad words.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.190
He doesn't punch anybody unless
he really has to, and afterwards,

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.250
feels kind of bad about it.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.470
He flies around in
this blue uniform,

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.960
like this giant flying
Boy Scout fighting crime.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.310
I brought this book home.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.880
I was disappointed,
but I still read it,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.430
and in this book the
atomic bomb drops in 1986.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.670
His 1984 as I'm reading it.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:48.970
So the atomic bomb drops.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.330
It kills off to the
people in the world.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.230
The few remnants of humanity
that are left gather themselves

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.690
in these little societies
that are pretty lawless.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.780
So a group of men have
to get together dressed

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.500
up in Medieval-style armor and
ride around the countryside

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.700
on these giant mutated
dogs to fight crime.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.050
Superman teams up with these guys.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.500
They call themselves
the Atomic Knights,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.080
and they have this
adventure together.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.090 position:56%
In the last few pages of this story,

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.860
it's revealed that the
whole thing is just a dream,

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.510
but that did not stop this book
from completely freaking me out.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.740
I stayed up nights
thinking about it.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.980
I also stayed up nights thinking
about comics, how the combination

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.160
of words and pictures did
something inside my brain

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.070
that neither words nor pictures
had been able to do alone.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.110 position:56%
Pretty soon, after buying this book,

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.770
I went from being a comic book
reader to comic book creator.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.270
Fifth grade, I have
this friend by the name

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:41.700
of Jeremy Kinyoshi
[assumed spelling],

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.730
half Jewish, half Japanese kid.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.240
He was a veteran comic
book geek in fifth grade.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.810
He'd been collecting
comics since he could read,

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.510
and together, we made stories.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.930
We made comics.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.580
We would brainstorm plots together.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.050
Then I would do all the pencils.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.350
He would do all the inks.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.300 position:56%
We give all of our original art to
his mom who would take them to work,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.410
wait until all her coworkers went
home, and sneak photocopies for us.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.770
Then we take these photocopies.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.080
We'd staple them by hand.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.030
We sold them to our
classmates for 50 cents a piece.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.430
We made $8.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.520
It was amazing.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.180 position:56%
Jeremy has since given up on comics.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.060
He is now a radiologist.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.210
He lives in a giant house in
Hawaii, but I did not, oops,

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.450
I did not give up on comics.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.660
I kept making comics all the
way until now, until now.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.060
So that's how I fell
in love with comics.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.750 position:56%
How I fell in love with computers
was through this machine right here.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.050
This is an Apple 2E.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.520
Any of you remember an Apple 2E?

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.820
You all know what that is.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.440
Those of you who don't
know what a Apple 2E,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.720
visit your local technology museum.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.360
There will be one there.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.860
Now the Apple 2E compared

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.320
to computers today is just
not very powerful, right?

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.290
It could only display
the color green.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.430
It was very slow.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.600
Didn't even have a hard drive, so
you couldn't even store anything

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.550
on it, but I loved this computer,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.840
because this is the computer
I learned how to program on.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.740
My fifth grade year, the summer
right after my grade year,

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.590
started off spectacularly.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.680
I spent every day off in
front of the television.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.960
I watched a lot of Reading Rainbow,
but I didn't read any of the books.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.680
My mom watched me do this,
and she was kind of disgusted.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.780
So she signed me up for these
summer enrichment classes.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.910
Now, 30 years later,
I don't remember any

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.320
of those summer enrichment
classes except for one of them.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.160
I took an introduction to
computer programming class.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.800
In that class, we learned
the language called LOGO.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.810
LOGO is a language which
is kind of forgotten now,

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:40.630
but if you had learned computer
programming in the 70s or 80s,

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.440
you most likely learned LOGO.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.850
There are all sorts of
reasons why LOGO is awesome,

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.150
but my favorite feature

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.290
of this language is
there's this little turtle.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.980
The turtle doesn't look like this.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.290
Normally it looks like
this, because graphics

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:56.480
in the 80s were just not
very good, but what you do

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.550
in LOGO is you could give us turtle
instructions, and it would move

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.100
around the screen and draw stuff.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.690
So you could do really
simple designs like this.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.550
You can add the simple
designs together

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.310
to make more complex designs,

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.890
or you could do these beautiful
geometric designs like this.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:22.010
What I learned that summer was that
computers are a way to make art,

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:23.490
and I've always been
interested in art.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.880
That's how I fell in
love with computers.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.230
So in fifth grade, my
nerdiness was solidified,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:33.230
and I've been a nerd
ever sense, but today,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:37.030
I'm not just a nerd, I
am also an ambassador.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.050
I first found out in October.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.970
My editor, Mark, called me up.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.070
I kind of freaked out a little
bit, but after I freaked out,

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:49.410
I also wondered what exactly
does an ambassador do?

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.540
What exactly is an ambassador?

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.120 position:56%
I had a few email exchanges with
Kate, and she was amazingly helpful,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.150
but I also consulted that source
of answers that all nerds go to.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.220
So I knew that ambassadors
had to wear fancy suits.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.300
I also knew they wore fancy metals,
but when I consulted that source

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.160
of answers, that source
of answers, by the way is,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.460
of course, superhero comics.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.630
Superhero comics don't have the
answers to all of life's questions,

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.230 position:56%
but they definitely have most of
them, and the superhero comic answer

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.660
to the question what exactly is an
ambassador is this lady right here.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.370
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Wonder Woman!

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.670
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: You all
know who this is?

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.970
This is Wonder Woman.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.500
She is one of my favorite
superheroes.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.230
Wonder woman and I have a
lot in common, actually.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.990
First, we both have black hair.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.720
We both are a lot stronger than
we look, and I have to tell you,

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.470
it's a lot harder for
her to pull this off,

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:45.980
because she actively look strong,

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.670
and we also both look
great in red boots.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.010
Now I don't really have a photo to
show you this to prove it to you,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.310
but you've just got to imagine.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.860
I look amazing in red boots.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.510
Today, we have even more common,

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:02.030
because Wonder Woman is also an
ambassador, which means she also,

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.980
from time to time, puts on a fancy
suit and wears a fancy metal,

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:09.640
and Wonder Woman is from an
island called Paradise Island.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.510
Paradise Island only has women.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.920
No men. Which might be why
it's called Paradise Island.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.420
But the women of Paradise Island
call themselves the Amazons,

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.290
and one day, this man, this
fighter pilot named Steve Trevor,

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.930
crashes on Paradise Island.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.230
The Amazons rescue him.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.320
They're not sure what
to do with him.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.080
They're not sure how to relate to
Steve Trevor's world, our world,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.680
so in the end, they decide

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.850
to send wonder woman
out as their ambassador.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.150
Wonder Woman is supposed
to promote understanding

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.820
of Amazon culture to
the outside world.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.190
As an author, I am from
the world of books,

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.850
and that's kind of like my job too.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.890
I'm supposed to promote
understanding of the world

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:56.280
of books among children
and their caretakers.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:02.540
Here's the thing though,
books are also ambassadors.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.600
Books have been ambassadors
in my life.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.530
Let me explain to you
how this happened.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.990
So as we get older,
one of the things

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.180
that we do is we figure
out who we are.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.270
We figure out the different
pieces of our identity.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.660
So I'll give you myself
as an example.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.080
I am a Chinese-American.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.580
I love computers.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.910
I love superhero comics.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.580
I also love drawing.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.240
I've been drawing since
I was two years old.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.080
That's what my mom tells me anyway.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.560
I don't really remember,
and I love books.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.710
So as we get older, we collect
all these pieces to who we are,

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:39.720
and then eventually, we put
a wall around these pieces.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.910
Walls are not necessarily
a bad thing.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:47.410
After all, walls define what a home
is, and this graphic, in a sense,

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.940
represents what my home is.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.610
This is where I am most
comfortable, but walls can be bad

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.280
if you never go outside of them.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.960
If you never go outside your walls,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.030
then your home is essentially
a prison.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.490
I am not a sports guy.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:05.210
I have never been really
good at sports.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.000
I've never been a fan of sports,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.780
and I've especially not
been a fan of basketball.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.430
For some reason, whenever
I play basketball,

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.620 position:56%
the ball always hits me in the head.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.500
It's like my head is
magnet for basketballs.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.510
So growing up, even
after I became an adult,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.190
I made sure to keep
basketball outside

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.910
of my walls and away from my head.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:34.300
As adults, we keep
our walls with us.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.410
Sometimes they even solidify
for us as we become adults,

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.920
and we even have these
walls when we're teachers.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:46.060
I was a high school teacher for 17
years at Bishop O'Dowd High School.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.360
This is what our campus looks like,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.090
Bishop O'Dowd High School,
has anyone heard of us?

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.390
Nobody? We're kind of famous.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.690
You should have heard of us.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:55.820
We are like the best school
in all of Oakland, California.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.440
In any case, even teachers
have these walls.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.740
Let me give you an example.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.020
This is a drawing of what our
faculty lunch room looked.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.570
The PE teachers and at one table.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.970
The drama teachers sat at another
table, and the nerdy teachers

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.960
that at yet another table.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.180 position:56%
There were a couple teacher that
would go from one table to the next,

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.670
but for the most part,
we teachers stayed

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.510
where we were most comfortable.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.240
We also had our walls.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.650
Every now and then,
however, something happens

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.870
to make us go outside of
our walls, and for me,

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.870
books played a key role in that.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:33.220
I told you already that one of the
pieces, one of those icons inside

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.950
of my walls is my Chinese-American
heritage.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.510
That's something I'm
really interested in,

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.410
something that really
care a lot about.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.310
One day I came across this
book called Outside the Paint

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.610
by Kathleen Yep.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.920
Kathleen Yep has these
older relatives who all grew

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.390
up in San Francisco Chinatown.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.590
This is a book about
Chinese-American culture.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.790
These older relatives
of the author's,

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.050
they came from very
poor, immigrant families.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.160
They didn't really have a lot
of money, and what they did

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.040
for fun was they played basketball.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.920
They played a lot of basketball.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.360
Both the girls and the boys
were obsessed with the game.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.020
In fact, for a couple of decades,

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.340
the San Francisco Youth Basketball
Leagues were all dominated

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.490
by these Chinese teams.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.790
I read this book.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.090
It was a ton of fun.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.390
It was very fast-paced.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:22.690
It was about a corner of
Chinese-American history

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.780
that I knew nothing about, but
it was also about this topic

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.840
that was clearly outside
of my walls.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.610
It was about basketball.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.020
I enjoyed this book so much that
I decided to find other books

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.260
about basketball and read them,
and here are just a few of them.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.560
The first one, Slam Dunk, is one

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.160
of the most popular Manga
series in the world.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.810
It's about a Japanese high
school basketball team,

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.550
and their pursuit of
their championship.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.640
Ball Don't Lie is by a
superstar young author

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.300
by the name of Matt de la Pena.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.680
Matt and I are friends.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.210
I'm just kind of name
dropping right there,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.040
but Matt isn't just a great writer.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.230
He is also a great basketball
player, and his book really draws

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:07.840 position:56%
on his experiences as both a Mexican
American and a basketball there

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.200
to tell a wonderful
story, and the final one,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.340
The Crossover by Kwame Alexander
recently won The Newberry,

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.430
one of the biggest book
prizes in all of America.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:22.260
This is an extraordinary book
because the author is able

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.480
to capture the rhythm
of a basketball game

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.060
through the rhythm of his words.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.590
I read these books, and these
books acted like ambassador to me.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.500
They were in ambassador to
the world of basketball.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.430
They allowed me to
understand a world

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.910
that I was never really part of.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:40.210
I read these books.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.900
I got kind of excited
about basketball.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.640 position:56%
I want to talk to somebody about it.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.370
So I started talking to
this guy named Lou Ritchie.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.230
Lou Ritchie was another teacher
at Bishop O'Dowd High School.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.020
He was a PE teacher.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:56.610
He's also the coach of the
varsity men's basketball team.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.470
Now this is what he looks
like in the yearbook.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.410
This is what he looks
like as a cartoon.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.330
Lou's a great guy,
but he is not the kind

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.100
of guy I would normally
be friends with.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.630
After all, he sat at
a different table.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:16.710
He's also an athlete, and I am a
nerd, but as we started talking

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:20.520
about basketball, we
slowly became friends.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.040
Lou invited me to go watch
the games of his team.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.020
So I even got to travel
with this team.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.500
There's this big tournament
in Missouri.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.320
This is a photo from that
tournament, and as I traveled

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.580
with this team, I learned
how to watch basketball.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.880
I'm definitely no expert.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.860
I don't think I have like
70% of the rules memorized.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.960
But now I get it.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.890
I understand why basketball
is important.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:51.000
I understand why people like
it, and as I followed this team,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.670
I got to know Lou a little better.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.970
What I discovered is that he and I
actually have a lot more in common

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.270
than I originally thought.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:03.630
For instance, Lou loves
books just like I do.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.930
He especially loves
reading history books.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.810
Lou also loves numbers.

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:10.160
Now I love number too, even
though I didn't include that icon

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.880
in my previous picture
with the walls and it.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.180
Lou loves numbers so much
that he memorizes basketball

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.160
and baseball statistics for fun.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.320
He had so many of these statistics
memorized that when he was a kid,

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.970
the kids in his neighborhood
used to call him The Professor.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.690
So Lou isn't just an athlete.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.280
He's also a nerd.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.040
He's like a nerdlete.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.830
I even have photographic
evidence of this.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.590
This is what Lou looked
like when he was a kid.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:41.340 position:56%
His glasses are just as big as mine.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.240
So I followed this
team for a season.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.860 position:56%
I got to talk with Lou and the
other coaches and the other players.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.520
I even got to sit in on
their locker room chats.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.950
I could hear their pep talks.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.870
I got to look at their
strategies, and during the season,

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.530
what I discovered was an
amazing, compelling story.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.010
It was their story.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.910
It was a story that was
so compelling that I felt

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.030 position:56%
like I needed to do a book about it.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:10.350
So my next book is actually
my first nonfiction book.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.770
It'll be a graphic novel
about this basketball team.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.800
I'm kind of giving away the ending
with this picture right here.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.750
So don't tell anybody.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.190
So books were really
ambassadors for me.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.170
Books allowed me to understand
basketball a little bit better,

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:29.030
which led to my friendship
with Lou, which in turn led

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.680
to me following him and his
team around for a season,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.320
which led to me now doing
a book about basketball.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.550
Books can be ambassadors
for you, too.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.300
They can be ambassadors
in your lives too.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.770
I'm going to give you just a few
examples of how it can happen.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.880 position:56%
Number one, they can be
ambassadors into the lives of people

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.180
who are different from you.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.910
People from different
cultural traditions.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.130
People from different religions.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.440
People different ways of life.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.770
Number two, books can be
ambassadors into topics

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.580
that you might find intimidating.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.300
For me, that was basketball.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.760
I talked to a lot of folks who find
STEM topics intimidating, science,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.750
technology, engineering, and
math, and there's some amazing,

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:14.040
amazing books that can act as
your ambassador into those topics.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.030
Books can even be ambassadors
into other kinds of books.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.950
So, for instance, maybe, you
pretty much only read prose books,

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.100
books with just words in them,

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.260
and you've never tried
a graphic novel before,

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.640
or maybe you're the exact opposite.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.830
Maybe you only read graphic novels

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.890
and you never read books
with just words in them.

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.820
Well, there are plenty of
books that are hybrid books

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.900
that marry these two different
ways of telling stories together.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.130
One of my favorites is
actually Ambassador Kate's book,

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:46.070
Flora and Ulysses, about
a superhero squirrel.

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:50.650
It's pretty amazing, but these
books can help you transition

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.210
from one kind of a
book to the other.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:56.480
So I'd like to end my talk
with a challenge to you,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.080
and my challenge is that
you read without walls.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.090
Go find a book that you
normally wouldn't read.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.950
This might be a book with someone
on the cover that doesn't like you

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.250
or doesn't live like you.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.500
This might be a book about a topic

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.420
that you had previously
thought intimidating,

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.330
or this might be a book in a format

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.940
that you have never
really tried before.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.750
Read without walls
and see what happens.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.650
I guarantee, it's going
to be something amazing.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:26.950
Thank you very much.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:28.640
It was wonderful to have the
chance to talk to you all.

and we've got it recorded, and
we're going to make use of it.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.770
That's great.

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:03.070
I'd like to invite David to come
up to present Gene with his medal,

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:07.850
and I'd like to ask Jon and Kate
stand by for the photo opportunity

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:12.090
that will follow right after
this presentation here, and then,

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:16.050
if we have time, if we move through
this quickly, we'll have time

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:21.860
for a question or two from the kids
for Gene, but let's move ahead.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.390
Thank you.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:27.490

could bring our photographers

[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: So the
question is how did I come

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.760
up with the idea of Secret Coders?

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.320
Secret Coders is a six-volume
graphic novel series all

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.930
about computer coding.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:53.100
I said that I taught
high school for 17 years.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.480
I talked computer science.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.310
I taught kids how to code, and I
taught in this really visual way.

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:59.290
So I do a lot of drawing
on the board.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.510
I was actually just kind of copying
my old computer science teacher

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.830
from when I was in high school, and
when I did that, I thought, "Man,

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:08.050
a lot of this could really
work as a graphic novel."

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.780
So it's been a project
that I've been thinking

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.080
about for really long time.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:15.040
I'm really happy to
finally get to work on that.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.340
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
Good morning, Mr. Yang.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.870
Have you ever done any
animation for any movies?

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.940
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Have I done
any animation for any movies?

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.620
You know, when I was
a kid, I really,

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:28.020
really wanted to be a Disney
animator, and in the end,

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:32.430 position:56%
I decided to give up on that
because what I was really interested

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:34.140
in was story, you know?

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.420
And if you look at the animation
industry, an animatedly takes

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.850 position:56%
like hundreds of people to make,
and out of those hundreds of people,

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.790
maybe only a handful have
any control over the story.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.700
So I like books because
looks really give the author

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.800
or the cartoonist control
over the story.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.480

done any sort animation.

So in How to Draw Comic the Marvel
Way, he taught me how to write

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:58.210
and draw comic books, but
the thing is, when I realized

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:03.480
after I became an adult is that not
every comic book is made the Marvel

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.560
way, and that might not even be
the best way of making comics.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.090
So if you're interested in
writing comics or making comics,

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:11.810
I would encourage you to do
some exploration and figure

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.400
out what the best way is for you.

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:17.740
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
Good morning, Mr. Yang.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:26.820
Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang, what inspired
you to make Secret Coders?

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: What inspired
me to make Secret Coders?

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.240
Have you read it yet?

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.780
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Yes.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.080
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: You did?

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.380
Thanks for reading it.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.680
Thanks for reading it.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.980
Okay, so the main character

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.640
of Secret Coders is a little
girl named Hopper who learns how

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.320 position:56%
to become a computer programmer, and
Hopper is actually inspired by one

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.630
of the most famous computer
scientists in the world.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.510
Her name is Grace Hopper.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.200
She's no longer with us, but
a lot of people don't realize

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.390
that computer programming
started off

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.980
as what was considered
a woman's profession.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:00.320
A lot of the early computer
programmers were women.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.240
The very first computer program
in the world was a woman a woman

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:07.010
by the name of Ada Loveless,
an English mathematician.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.220
So Hopper, Grace Hopper,
was really the inspiration

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.000
of my character, Hopper.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:25.760
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Mr. Yang,
what was your first book?

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.570
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Which
was my first book?

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:30.430
The very first book that I did when
I was a kid was a superhero book.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.520
That's what I did with Jeremy,
who I showed you earlier.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.100
The first book that I did as an
adult was called Gordon Yamamoto

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.400
and The King of The Geeks.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.430
It was about a young man
who gets a spaceship stuck

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:44.130
in his nose becomes friends with
the alien that's driving a ship.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:46.080
Thankfully, that is
hard to find now.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.380
That book.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.510
[ Laughter ]

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:57.340
[ Background Discussion ]

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:02.940
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Oh, Mr. Yang,
again, do you do other comic books

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:07.970
like besides Superman, Batman,
Justice League comic books.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Well, I
only work on Superman.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.010
Are you a fan of Superman?

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.530
Who do you like better,
Superman or Batman?

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Well, it's a --

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: There's
a right answer here.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.050
[ Laughter ]

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.630
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Well, there's
going to be a movie called --

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:25.800
coming out against a
Superman and Batman.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Yeah, so
who are you rooting for?

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:32.430
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
Well, and four of Superman

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:37.760
because he's got the [inaudible]
power, and heat vision.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.060
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: That's right.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.360
That's right.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.660
Good answer.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:42.960
Good answer.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.260
Well, so I only work on
Superman for DC Comics,

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.560
but I do do a bunch of
other comic, as well.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:50.260
I write Avatar, The Last Airbender
Nickelodeon and for Dark Horse.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.170
You know that comic?

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.370
Okay, it's based on a
really popular TV show,

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.800
and that I do American-Born
Chinese and Boxers and Saints,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.680
and a bunch of other books
with First-Second Books.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.980
Oh, thank you.

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:09.960
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
Do you speak Chinese?

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: I do.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:13.730
Do you? Do you speak
any other languages?

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.210
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: No.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.590
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Okay, so I
have some advice for you.

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:21.470
When I was a kid, my parents
put me in Chinese school.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.860
So every weekend on Saturday, when
other kids were watch cartoons,

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.790
I would have to go to
Chinese school, they told me,

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:28.360
"You need to pay attention.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.810
Otherwise, as an adult,
you're going to regret it."

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:34.600
I did not pay attention, and
as an adult, I regret it.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.900
So I would encourage you to go
and take a foreign language class

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:40.730
and pay attention so you
don't regret it as an adult.

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:48.490
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Two more
questions, just two.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:49.790
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Mr. Yang,

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.110
did you ever get the
book that you wanted?

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:54.410
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Which book?

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:56.870
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: The book that
you wanted when you was a kid.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:59.210
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Oh, oh,
the book that --

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.190
the one with green cover
with Thor and The Thing.

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.820
You know, I have to tell you, one
of my former students saw me do

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.500
that presentation, and he
bought it for me for Christmas,

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.820
but I haven't read it yet,
because I feel if I read it,

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.700
I'm going to ruin that joke, right?

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.510
So it's just sitting in my room.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:23.610
[ Background Discussion ]

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.390
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Mr. Yang,
have you ever wanted to do a comic,

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.040 position:56%
but you didn't have the inspiration?

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Okay, so your question
is have I ever wanted to do a comic

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.680
but I haven't had the inspiration?

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.980
Is that a problem that
you have had yourself?

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:38.280
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: No.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Do you any
sort of stories or anything?

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.160
Okay, awesome.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.880
So are you able to go from
beginning to end without stopping,

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.550
or do you sometimes run
out of steam in the middle.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:47.850
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
Sometimes, but not all the time.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:49.340
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: You sometimes
run out of steam in the middle?

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:52.760
Yeah, so for me, normally,
at the beginning of the book,

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.460
I have all sorts of inspiration.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:59.700
Then when I get to the middle,
things sometimes get kind of dicey.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:04.410
Like, it starts getting hard,
and what I found is you just have

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:07.610
to keep a regular time in your day

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.040
or in your week to
work on that book.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.810
You've got to work on it, even
when you don't feel inspirational.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:16.270
I mean, I've got to say,
it's kind of like a marriage.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:18.160
You've just got to stick to it.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.060
I mean, not my marriage.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.950
Not a marriage.

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:24.450
But a theoretical marriage.

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.660
But you've got to stick with
it until one of you is dead

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.410
or one of you is finished.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.710 position:56%
Either you or that book is finished.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:33.180
That's what you've got to do.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:38.620
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I think I
have to bail Jean out here.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:39.920
Give him a hand.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.820
&gt;&gt; Gene Yang: Thank you.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.370
&gt;&gt; John Cole: It's
really been wonderful.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:48.140
Don't leave quite yet.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.690
Remember the students are
going to be leaving first.

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.900
Gene, you may sit.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.300
You've done enough, I tell you.

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.850
It's been wonderful.

00:55:55.850 --> 00:56:00.200 position:56%
But I wish to thank the staff, not
only of the Children's Book Council,

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.440 position:56%
but of the Center for the Book, and
especially The Young Readers Center.

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.830
For putting this together,
for the planning

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.830
and for the hard work
that's gone in.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.650
I'd like to thank the
judges in the sponsors

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.620
who put this program
together for the past,

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.110
this is our fifth ambassador,
as you know.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:18.800
We didn't know how it
would go when it started.

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.650
It's really gone beautifully.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:23.720
It's been a program of
substance and of style,

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.220
and it's because of
the participation

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.750
of the people I just mentioned and
the kids, who were great today.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:34.510

and then let the kids go first.
