00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.116
(beeping)

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.185
- Oh fuck, you're awake.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.353
- Is that a MacRib?

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.420 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yep, you have to wait
a whole nother year

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.923
to get one of these bad boys.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.090
- Another year?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.593
Ah fuck, I woke up too early.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.762
Put me back in the
fucking coma, man.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.598
(beeping)

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.601
(children laughing)

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.137
Are you the Easter Bunny?

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:40.039
- Actually, used to be.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.774
Now I'm the Atheist Rabbit.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.910 align:start position:0%
Everything you thought you knew
about Easter's lies, fatso.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.212
- You're so cool.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.246
- I am.
- Yeah.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.747
- You know what's not cool?

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.482 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The MacRib only being
available for a limited time

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:52.418
when the Big Mac is
available year round?

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.986
- Yes.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.921
It's not like he was made
out of Adman's big match,

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.489
it was made out of his MacRib.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.225
I have something I
need to show you.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.226
- Show me.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.995
(screaming)

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.597
What?

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.568
Oh my, fuck you, what is that?

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:09.402
Holy shit.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.804
- Oh yeah.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:12.638
Yes, yeah.

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:15.608
(laughing)

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.644
- Oh my God, this is rabbit.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.745
I think I love you.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:19.946
- I love you.

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.114
- Will you marry me?

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:22.514
- I want you so bad.

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:24.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yes.
- But I just can't.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.253
The president passed a
bunch of wacky laws now.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.488
- What?

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.322
- And a man can't
marry a male rabbit

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.589
who shits sandwiches.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.258
- No.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.926
That's crazy.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.161
(screaming)

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.262
- Send me home.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.531
