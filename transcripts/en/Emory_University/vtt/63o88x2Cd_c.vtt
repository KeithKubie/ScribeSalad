00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.559
So one of the challenges in
research is how do you pick a topic,

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.740
how do you pick a model? I think here
that the key thing is you should ask an

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.730
important question. You should ask a
question that a lot of people are

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.179
interested in. You should ask a question
that has broad implications.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.350
I think we were lucky, or I should say,
I was lucky, that when I started my

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
lab, I asked a question that perhaps was
a good question to ask. The question

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.070
I asked was: "How do you maintain immunological memory to an infection you got

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.629
or a vaccine you got 20 years ago, or 30
years ago or 50 years ago? How is this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.520
memory maintained? So I think the question was a very good one.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070
But the next stage is how do you
study that question? And the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.820
advice I would give is pick a model
where you can really study the question,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.960
where you can really dissect it, 
you can understand it in some detail .

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.450
So again, I think made a good choice.
We picked a mouse model. Sometimes people

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.900
don't like what you learned from mice
and they - not everything you learn there

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.650
extrapolates into humans - but still I
think if you ask the right question,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.259
do it well , those discoveries will hold as
you move up towards human studies.

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
So we picked a mouse model. And why did we 
pick hat particular mouse model?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.439
Because that was a natural -- this virus
that we used which was LCMV is a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.140
natural pathogen of mice. 
You can find wild mice in nature

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.439
which are infected with this. Of course,
we were not working with those mice,

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.790
we were working with mice in the lab,
that infected with LCMV. But the reason I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.520
emphasize that it's a mouse virus
is pathogens evolve with its own host

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
so if you're studying a mouse virus in a mouse, you really looking at the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.259
interaction between a virus and its
natural host, and this is a much better

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.790
than sticking a human virus that doesn't
replicate in mice or replicates poorly.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.350
So if you want to discover fundamentals
of immune responses, do it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.910
with the natural host natural pathogen
and a virus that will replicate

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.840
efficiently and give you the all the
things that you need to study in terms

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.950
of viral infections. So I think it's
picking the model. And then you ask the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.819
right questions. In this case it was - you
know... I shouldn't say ask the right questions,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.160
should say you should then study what
you want to look at in as much detail as

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.650
you can, and again the mouse model allows you to do this. In this particular one,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.519
reagents were available for analyzing
the T-cells, reagents were available to

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.290
look at what the virus was contributing,
so it was a well-defined model for

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.170
studying immune responses to viral
infection. And then it's interesting how

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.239
science moves forward. It depends on how technology is being developed. So our lab

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.652
was never developing new technology.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:08.400
were are immunologists, more I would

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.769
say biologists, we are biologists, asking
biological questions, we were

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.180
not creating any tools and any reagents.
But others were - the science moves

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.410
forward because many people do many
great things. So we were greatly helped

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.790
in many different things. I mentioned
to you that we did this gene expression

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.540
profiling. Of course we didn't
develop them, but those tools became available.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.790
Tools became available that worked 
in other places in terms of looking at

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.370
at the appropriate single cell assays
developed to look at expression of

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.120
different cytokines. So the techniques
and reagents that developed... One of the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.250
most important reagents that was developed actually was work that John Altman, who's a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.010
faculty member at Emory Vaccine Center,
did when he was at Stanford University,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.000
as a postdoc, and that was the
development of these MHC class 1 tetramers.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.239
These are reagents that you
can use to identify specifically T-cells

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.350
reacting against different viruses.
So this development of the tetramer

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.289
reagent greatly helped in the analysis that we did.
So my advice there is that

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.579
as you ask the right question, pick the model,
and be aware of all the

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.360
wonderful technology that's developing
around you, because you have to apply

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.020
then the state-of-the-art techniques, no

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.560
matter who's developed it. You don't need
to be an expert in it, you just bring the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.530
technique into your lab or you
collaborate with those people

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.650
to move it forward.
