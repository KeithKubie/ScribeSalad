00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.660
Alright, and just to make sure this epsilon exhaustion conpcet

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.390
is clear, let's actually use it in a quiz. So,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.840
here's our example from before. We've got our target concept,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.380
which is X or, we've got our training data which is

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.990
these, with the things that are in the green boxes

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.600
here, 0 0 output 0 1 0 output 1. And

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.890
this time, I'll actually write down a distribtiuon D that gives

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.040
the. Probability of drawing each of these different input examples.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.800
All right? So now what we'd like to do is find an epsilon such

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.610
that that this training set that we've

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.300
gotten has epsilon exhausted the version space.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150
&gt;&gt; Okay. I got it. I think I got that.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.690
&gt;&gt; You think you, you think you can work that one through?

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.470
&gt;&gt; Anything else that we'd have to tell you? Remember

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.820
again that These are the hypothesis in the hypothesis set.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.170
&gt;&gt; huh. Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.730
&gt;&gt; Alright. Let's, let's,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.380
let's see what you got.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.130
&gt;&gt; Okay.
