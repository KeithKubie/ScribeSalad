disease are genetically transmitted so
 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.450
disease are genetically transmitted so
ninety-five percent are not generating

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 
it's not that in China there is more

circumstance that could lead to dementia
and because of the habits of those does

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970
and because of the habits of those does
 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.930
and because of the habits of those does
you know population it's just there are

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940
you know population it's just there are
 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.600
you know population it's just there are
small groups of people for instance in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610
small groups of people for instance in
 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.020
small groups of people for instance in
the in the Pacific they were population

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030
the in the Pacific they were population
 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.180
the in the Pacific they were population
they used to eat the brain of the dead

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190
they used to eat the brain of the dead
 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.340
they used to eat the brain of the dead
people and then they were transferring

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350
people and then they were transferring
 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.710
people and then they were transferring
disease which one of the symptoms of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720
disease which one of the symptoms of
 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.200
disease which one of the symptoms of
this disease was dementia and they were

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210
this disease was dementia and they were
 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.749
this disease was dementia and they were
all developing dementia over there there

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759
all developing dementia over there there
 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.779
all developing dementia over there there
was a high incidence of the link just

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789
was a high incidence of the link just
 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.080
was a high incidence of the link just
because this habit of heating the brain

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090
because this habit of heating the brain
 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.270
because this habit of heating the brain
of the people that were dead and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
of the people that were dead and
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.050
of the people that were dead and
therefore like an infection disease they

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060
therefore like an infection disease they
 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.520
therefore like an infection disease they
were transferring the disease for one to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530
were transferring the disease for one to
 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.740
were transferring the disease for one to
end they were higher incidence of people

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750
end they were higher incidence of people
 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.249
end they were higher incidence of people
affected disease once this was found in

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259
affected disease once this was found in
 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.800
affected disease once this was found in
this habits were blue and we stopped

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
this habits were blue and we stopped
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.279
this habits were blue and we stopped
then the incidence of disease became the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
then the incidence of disease became the
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:17.720
then the incidence of disease became the
same as with another populations

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
 
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 
in general you know if you look at our

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010
in general you know if you look at our
 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.410
in general you know if you look at our
society there there is not a population

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
society there there is not a population
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.320
society there there is not a population
of people or you know that is more

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
of people or you know that is more
 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.949
of people or you know that is more
affected by the loss of memory it is a

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959
affected by the loss of memory it is a
 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.649
affected by the loss of memory it is a
problem that heats with aging so

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659
problem that heats with aging so
 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.289
problem that heats with aging so
something related with the with aging

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299
something related with the with aging
 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.740
something related with the with aging
and so it's as we age we get more memory

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
and so it's as we age we get more memory
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.020
and so it's as we age we get more memory
more memory problem obviously not all

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
more memory problem obviously not all
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.300
more memory problem obviously not all
the people are evil there are some what

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
the people are evil there are some what
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.500
the people are evil there are some what
a better memory than others and and we

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
a better memory than others and and we
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690
a better memory than others and and we
do not know why some people have a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
do not know why some people have a
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.809
do not know why some people have a
better memory than others when we say

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819
better memory than others when we say
 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.880
better memory than others when we say
that that they if we keep ourselves in

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
that that they if we keep ourselves in
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.430
that that they if we keep ourselves in
our brain exercises just like a muscle

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440
our brain exercises just like a muscle
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.170
our brain exercises just like a muscle
then we tend to have memory problems

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180
then we tend to have memory problems
 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.720
then we tend to have memory problems
less memory problems so it kind of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
less memory problems so it kind of
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.199
less memory problems so it kind of
protective the activity of mental

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
protective the activity of mental
 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.629
protective the activity of mental
activity even some people think even

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639
activity even some people think even
 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.940
activity even some people think even
physical activity it could be protected

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
physical activity it could be protected
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.670
physical activity it could be protected
against the memory loss the problem

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
against the memory loss the problem
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.190
against the memory loss the problem
problem you know the loss of memory

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
 
 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.460
 
that's what I have to say obviously

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
that's what I have to say obviously
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.420
that's what I have to say obviously
there are diseases which are associated

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
there are diseases which are associated
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.339
there are diseases which are associated
the one of the most typical one is

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349
the one of the most typical one is
 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.920
the one of the most typical one is
Alzheimer disease which are associated

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
Alzheimer disease which are associated
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.460
Alzheimer disease which are associated
with the loss of memory and others but

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
with the loss of memory and others but
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.980
with the loss of memory and others but
are less relevant unless

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990
 
 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.600
 
and the characteristic symptoms of our

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610
and the characteristic symptoms of our
 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.400
and the characteristic symptoms of our
symptom of our semi disease which is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410
symptom of our semi disease which is
 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.860
symptom of our semi disease which is
really whole Michael disease is the loss

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870
really whole Michael disease is the loss
 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800
really whole Michael disease is the loss
of what we call short-term memory so

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810
of what we call short-term memory so
 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.530
of what we call short-term memory so
that's how the disease starts actually

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
that's how the disease starts actually
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840
that's how the disease starts actually
it's people who cannot remember what

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850
it's people who cannot remember what
 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.840
it's people who cannot remember what
they just did just as a very short-term

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850
they just did just as a very short-term
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.870
they just did just as a very short-term
memory loss and let's last for a very

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
memory loss and let's last for a very
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.220
memory loss and let's last for a very
very long time and publicity the memory

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230
very long time and publicity the memory
 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.450
very long time and publicity the memory
problem get worse and worse and only a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
problem get worse and worse and only a
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400
problem get worse and worse and only a
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.820
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease
it's when also logical memory is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
it's when also logical memory is
 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.820
it's when also logical memory is
affected but the major characteristic of

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830
affected but the major characteristic of
 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.490
affected but the major characteristic of
Alzheimer disease which is a very

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500
Alzheimer disease which is a very
 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.910
Alzheimer disease which is a very
widespread disease in the population

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920
widespread disease in the population
 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.240
widespread disease in the population
special at old age is the loss of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250
special at old age is the loss of
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.970
special at old age is the loss of
short-term memory
