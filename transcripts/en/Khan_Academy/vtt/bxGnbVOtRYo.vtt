00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.600
After going through type 1
and type 2 region definitions,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.550
you can probably guess what a
type 3 region is going to be.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.995
So a type 3 is a region
in three dimensions.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.130
Since we called the other
the type 2 region R sub 2

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.500
and the type 1
region R sub 1, I'll

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.200
call this region R sub
3-- R with a subscript 3.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.490
It's going to be the set of
all points in three dimensions.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.230
The set of all x, y and z's
such that the x, z pairs

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.730
are member of a domain, I'll
call this domain D sub 3.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.600
And y is going to vary
between two surfaces that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.420
are functions of x and z.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.860
So y is going to be greater than
or equal to the surface-- I'll

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.550
call it h1 of x, z is going
to be less than or equal to y.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.540
y is going to be bounded
from above by the surface

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.240
h2 of x, z.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.550
And once again, let's
close our set notation.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.700
So let's think about whether
some of these regions that we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.350
already saw were type 1 and
type 2, whether they're type 3.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.490
And then think about what
would not be a type 3 region.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.140
So let's go to this sphere.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.310
What could be our domain?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640
Well the domain
is a set of x, z.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.340
It's just going to
be the in x, z plane.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.180
So over here our domain
could be this region right

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
over here in the x, z plane.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.340
So I'll color it in.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.320
It could be that region right
over there in the x, z plane.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.720
And then the lower
bound on y will

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.580
be the part that is behind
the sphere in this direction

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.134
right over here.

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.550
It's the stuff-- actually,
this might be a little bit hard

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.210
to visualize since I'm
redrawing on top of it.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.050
And then the upper
bound on y is going

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.150
to be this side right over here.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.060
So all of this is now
going to be green.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.570
Let me redraw this sphere
just to make it clear.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.010
Let me just draw
another coordinate axes.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.130
So another coordinate axes.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.640
The backside of this
sphere in the y direction.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.710
So I guess let's
think of it this way.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.610
This is the
hemisphere mark, this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.240
is the halfway
point for my sphere.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.610
And once again, that's kind
of the boundary of our domain.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.070
And then the backside-- let
me do the front side first.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.330
The front side y is upper
bound, that would be h2,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.750
would be all of this
business right over here.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.910
So this would be h2
that I'm coloring in.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.310
h2 would be the side that
is facing in that direction.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.230
Let me see how well
I can color it.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.000
That didn't do a good thing.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.340
So h2 is all of this stuff out
on this side of the sphere.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.090
And then h1 was the
lower bound on y.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.499
So it's going to be that
side right over there.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.540
And I could draw it probably
a little bit neater.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.123
But hopefully you get the point,
it would be all of that side.

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:15.160
And then y can vary
between those two

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.460
and essentially
fill up the region.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.060
Make the exact same
argument with the cylinder.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.940
The cylinder can be
defined the same way.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.260
So first of all, the
sphere is a type 1, type 2,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.950
and type 3 region.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.166
It meets all of the constraints.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.540
The cylinder, at
least the way it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.710
was oriented there,
actually any cylinder,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.760
will also be a type 3 region.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.980
Exact same argument.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.340
So let me draw my axes again.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.680
And here to make the cylinder
that we've been making,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.720
our domain could be a
rectangle in the x, z plane.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.460
So our domain can be
a rectangular region

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.480
in the x, z plane,
just like that.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.960
And then the lower
bound on y could

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.950
be that side of the cylinder.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.460
The side facing in that
direction right over there,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.882
that is the lower bound.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.340
And then the upper
bound on y could

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.000
be the side facing
in that direction.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.740
So once again, this is
also a type 3 region.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.620
By the same logic, this
one right over here,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.580
this hourglass, can
be a type 3 region.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.960
The front side would be this
front side right over here,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.540
all of this, including
that stuff that I--

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.640
And then the backside when
you think of it in terms of y,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.290
the backside would be that
part right over there.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.240
And once again, this could
also be a type 3 region.

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:06.690
The boundary of the domain
would be this cross section

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.610
right over here.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.170
So the boundary of
our domain could

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.160
be that cross section
right over there.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.010
The lower bound on y
would be the back half,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.840
the back half of
this hour glass.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.790
And the upper bound on y
would be the front half.

00:05:23.544 --> 00:05:25.960
Let me do that magenta color
because I've been using that.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.170
Or actually that green color.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.390
So the upper bound on y
would be this right half

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.570
right over here.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.580
So what would not be
a type three region?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.040
Well, if we just rotated
this around like that.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.410
So let me just draw something
that is not a type 3,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.930
just to show you that
this definition does not

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.401
include everything.

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.400
So something that would
not be a type 3 region--

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.520
for the same argument as
we've seen before for a type

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.000
2 and type 1 region
is an hourglass

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.304
where it's along the
y-axis or at least

00:05:56.304 --> 00:05:57.262
it's oriented this way.

00:05:57.262 --> 00:06:00.270
It actually does not have to be
right centered on the y-axis.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.770
But an hour glass that looks
like this, now all of a sudden

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.970
the y can't be just expressed as
being between two surfaces that

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.630
are functions of x and z.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.020
You would have to break
this up in order to do that.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.040
But you could break
up this region

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.830
into two types 3 regions.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.000
But the whole thing itself
is not a type 3 region.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.770
So not type 3.
