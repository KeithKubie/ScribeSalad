00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.810
- [Instructor] What we're going to go over

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.270
in this video is one of the
core principles in calculus,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.210
and you're going to use it any
time you take the derivative,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.380
anything even reasonably complex.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.280
And it's called the chain rule.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.610
And when you're first exposed to it,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.900
it can seem a little daunting
and a little bit convoluted.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.550
But as you see more and more examples,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.520
it'll start to make sense,
and hopefully it'd even start

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.930
to seem a little bit simple
and intuitive over time.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.060
So let's say that I had a function.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.990
Let's say I have a function
h of x, and it is equal to,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.280
just for example, let's say
it's equal to sine of x,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.740
let's say it's equal to sine of x squared.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.970
Now, I could've written that,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.260
I could've written it like this,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.770
sine squared of x, but it'll
be a little bit clearer

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.010
using that type of notation.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.300
So let me make it so I have h of x.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.850
And what I'm curious about
is what is h prime of x?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.400
So I want to know h prime of x,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.070
which another way of writing it is

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.890
the derivative of h with respect to x.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.610
These are just different notations.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.310
And to do this, I'm going
to use the chain rule.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.040
I'm going to use the chain rule,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.070
and the chain rule comes
into play every time,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.950
any time your function can
be used as a composition

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.090
of more than one function.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.610
And as that might not
seem obvious right now,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.810
but it will hopefully,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.660
maybe by the end of this
video or the next one.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.493
Now, what I want to do

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:19.440
is a little bit of a thought experiment,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.470
a little bit of a thought experiment.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.640
If I were to ask you

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.770
what is the derivative with respect to x,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.900
if I were to just apply
the derivative operator

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.670
to x squared with respect
to x, what do I get?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.030
Well, this gives me two x.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.530
We've seen that many,
many, many, many times.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.570
Now, what if I were to take the
derivative with respect to a

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.210
of a squared?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.350
Well, it's the exact same thing.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.850
I just swapped an a for the x's.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.720
This is still going to be equal to two a.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.840
Now I will do something

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.810
that might be a little bit more bizarre.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.140
What if I were to take the
derivative with respect to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.800
sine of x,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.970
with respect to sine of x of,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.120
of sine of x,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.730
sine of x squared?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.860
Well, wherever I had the x's
up here, the a's over here,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.850
I just replace it with a sine of x.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.320
So this is just going to be
two times the thing that I had,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.300
so whatever I'm taking the
derivative with respect to.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.700
Here it was with respect to x.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.670
Here with respect to a.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.790
Here's with respect to sine of x.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.550
So it's going to be two times

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.880
sine of x.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.850
Now, so the chain rule tells us

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.200
that this derivative is
going to be the derivative

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.950
of our whole function with respect,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.520
or the derivative of this
outer function, x squared,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.760
the derivative of x squared,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.570
the derivative of this outer function

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.920
with respect to sine of x.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.050
So that's going to be two sine of x,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.110
two

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.180
sine of x.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.830
So we could view it as the
derivative of the outer function

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.420
with respect to the inner, two sine of x.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.820
We could just treat sine of
x like it's kind of an x.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.980
And it would've been just two x,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.060
but instead it's a sine of x.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.980
We say two sine of x times,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.580
times the derivative, do this is green,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.760
times the derivative of
sine of x with respect to x.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.450
Times the derivative of
sine of x with respect to x,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.640
well, that's more straightforward,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.140
a little bit more intuitive.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.610
The derivative of sine of x

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.520
with respect to x, we've
seen multiple times,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
is cosine of x,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.450
so times cosine of x.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.420
And so there we've applied the chain rule.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.180
It was the derivative
of the outer function

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.060
with respect to the inner.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.660
So derivative of sine of x squared

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.190
with respect to sine
of x is two sine of x,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.590
and then we multiply that times
the derivative of sine of x

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.160
with respect to x.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.200
So let me make it clear.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.520
This right over here is the derivative.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.080
We're taking the derivative of,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.080
we're taking the derivative
of sine of x squared.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.043
So let me make it clear.

00:03:49.043 --> 00:03:50.800
That's what we were
taking the derivative of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.370
with respect to sine of x,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.630
with respect to sine of x.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.960
And then we're multiplying that times

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.940
the derivative of sine of x,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.540
the derivative of sine

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.680
of x

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.250
with respect to,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.100
with respect to x.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.010
And this is where it might start making

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.160
a little bit of intuition.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.330
You can't really treat
these differentials,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.180
this d whatever, this
dx, this d sine of x,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.013
as a number.

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:19.900
And you really can't,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.610
this notation makes it
look like a fraction

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.280
because intuitively
that's what we're doing.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280
But if you were to treat
'em like fractions,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.050
then you could think about
canceling that and that.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.610
And once again, this isn't
a rigorous thing to do,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.970
but it can help with the intuition.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.470
And then what you're left
with is the derivative

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.200
of this whole sine of x
squared with respect to x.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.760
So you're left with,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.550
you're left with the derivative of

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.600
essentially our original
function, sine of x squared

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.400
with respect to x,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.420
with respect to x, which
is exactly what dh/dx is.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.950
This right over here,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.180
this right over here is
our original function h.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.410
That's our original function h.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.740
So it might seem a
little bit daunting now.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.700
What I'll do in the next video
is another several examples,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.413
and then we'll try to
abstract this a little bit.
