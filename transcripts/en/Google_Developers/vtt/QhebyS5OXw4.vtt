NOOR ALI-HASAN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.150
Thank you so much for
coming to our talk.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.650
My name is Noor Ali-Hasan.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.390
And this is Julie Aranda.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.580
And we are, both user experience
researchers on the Android Team

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.320
at Google.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.390
So as you heard already
yesterday during the keynote,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.890
we've made a bunch of changes
to notifications in Android N.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.540
And today, we're going to
tell you about some research

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.360
that we conducted last
fall that's helping

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.200
us think about notifications
in a different way

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.230
for future Android releases.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.482
So our agenda for today's
talk-- first, we're

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:39.440
going to tell you about
the specific study, how

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.640
we went about conducting it.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.410
Then we're going to tell
you about some of the things

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.360
that we learned.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.056
And then lastly,
we're going to wrap up

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.430
by talking about
what all of this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.220
means for Android as a platform,
and what it means to you guys

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.801
as application developers.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:52.300
All right.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.230
So let's talk about this study.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.690
So last fall, we wanted
to better understand

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.550
how our users deal
with notifications

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.217
and how notifications
impact their lives.

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:03.800
And when we started
thinking about it,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.650
realized that notifications
isn't just about notifications.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.200
It's about the
distractions-- interruptions.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.660
So we decided to cast a
little bit of a wider lens

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.560
and look at this topic from the
sense of attention management.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.620
So that includes everything from
interruptions from your device

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.840
to interruptions from
other people in your life

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.220
to the interruptions that
are going on in your head,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.900
so thoughts that you might
have, to everything else that's

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.100
going on in your environment.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920
Our goals for this
study was, one,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.630
to build a foundational
understanding

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.460
among our team who works on
notifications at Android,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.920
inform the development
of Android N,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.640
and then generate ideas for
future Android releases.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.200
We wanted to understand
what do people

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.506
want to know when they
get a notification,

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:50.130
when do they want to
know those things,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.129
and how should they be
presented so that they're

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.860
more actionable and effective.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.170
So to answer those questions,
we took our entire team

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.910
to New York City for a week.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.290
And we talked to
18 New Yorkers--

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.650
average, everyday
people-- about how

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770
they dealt with notifications.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550
The first phase of the
study, we conducted

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.140
some unstructured interviews
with these participants

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.267
in their homes.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.850
We've talked about
everything from how

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.808
do you deal with a
notification when you get it

00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:21.750
to how do you manage your time,
how do you organize yourself,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.490
how do you deal with reminders,
things of that nature.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.030
But notifications is a sort
of thing that's fleeting.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.890
It's in the moment.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.720
And we didn't just want people
to tell us about notifications.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.460
We wanted to
actually observe them

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.100
dealing with them in real life.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.000
So we conducted some full
day, so eight hour to seven

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.860
hour observations, and
half day observations,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.440
so about three to four hours,
where we're literally just

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.920
followed these folks
around during that time

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.790
and watched them do everything
from running errands

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.890
to child care.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.840
And just kind of
watched what they did

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.930
when they got notifications.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.510
And we observed all sorts
of things that had we only

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.385
interviewed them, I
don't think we would have

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:02.900
been able to capture as well.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.250
So I'll give you an example.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.530
One of the participants
that I observed,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.670
during the three or four hours
that we were watching her,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.760
she had received this email
but this piece, this article.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.040
That she had written had
gotten published online.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.748
And it was the first
time that she'd ever

00:03:16.748 --> 00:03:18.160
had anything like that happen.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.900
So here we watched her deal with
the initial email notification,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.800
and then watched her you know
pull out her Chrome book,a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.230
tablet, and her smartphone and
deal with all the notifications

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.530
that she got from
people on social media,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.480
like her friends and family
liking the articles to like her

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.787
husband SMSing her about it
to like her mom calling her.

00:03:36.787 --> 00:03:38.620
And that's the sort of
thing that, yeah, she

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710
should probably could have told
us about it in an interview.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.590
But it was an entirely
different experience

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.150
to watch her deal
with it in the moment.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.300
After those first
two phases, we then

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.550
asked some of these
participants to come

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.270
to our office in New York City.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.770
And we conducted some
buddy sessions with them,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.200
where we asked them to
actually bring along

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.640
a couple of their friends.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.020
And had some discussions
where the three of them

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.180
around notifications,
how they dealt with them.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.510
And then we also did
some design exercises,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.580
where we asked them to
imagine a world where

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.790
they had no limitations.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.770
What would they want
notifications to be like?

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.290
And then at the end of the week,
our entire team-- so everyone

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.860
from people like us who are
UX researchers to designers,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.682
engineers, product managers--
sat together in a room

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:24.890
and literally went through
every single piece of data

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.610
that we had collected that week
and organized it, and tried

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.590
to really see what sort
of patterns were emerging.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.040
So the first thing
that we learned

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.204
is that notifications are
necessary for survival.

00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:38.120
Now, if you think about
it, throughout history

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.540
we've actually received
all sorts of information

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.410
that's kind of similar
like a notification.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.200
So for instance
for communication,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.010
things like telegrams
or carrier pigeons.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.440
For signaling danger, like the
town crier or the story of Paul

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.980
Revere or even smoke signals.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.030
And even superheroes need a
customized notification system.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.390
Even Batman-- yes, Batman--
he needs the bat signal.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.710
That's right.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.140
He needs the bat
signal in order to know

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.250
when to help out Gotham City.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.790
But over time, each one of
these channels of communication

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.786
has become polluted
with other sources.

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:16.160
So for instance,
there was a time

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.520
when if you received
a letter in the mail,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.530
it was probably some sort
of personal correspondence.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.610
And right now, our mailboxes
are full of all sorts

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.540
of other stuff, like credit card
applications, advertisements,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.686
things that we may
not necessarily want.

00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.810
As a lot of you I'm sure
know, in the United States

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.912
right now we're going
through an election cycle.

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:36.370
And what that means
for a lot of us

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.160
is that we get
phone calls asking

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.430
us to vote for this candidate
or vote for this issue.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.969
Today, we're inundated
with so much information.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.760
And the people that we
talked to told us it

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.593
was really hard to focus
on the stuff that's

00:05:48.593 --> 00:05:50.560
important in their life.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.350
And that has led to
hyper-vigilance and addiction

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.427
to devices.

00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:56.010
People told us that
it was really hard

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.460
for them to disconnect
from their devices.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.960
There was our
participant, Denise,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.850
who's a busy lawyer
and a first time mom,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.130
and she freaks out if she
doesn't have her phone

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.260
with her for two seconds.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.450
She worries what if she
misses something important.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.570
Her husband, Andrew, thinks
that notifications are horrible,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.374
because they make us
attached to our phones.

00:06:17.374 --> 00:06:19.040
Now, the people we
talked to have set up

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.000
all sorts of different
coping strategies

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.480
to filter out the noise.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.250
And some of these
coping strategies

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.910
are built-in features to
smart phones and some of them

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.230
are hacks.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.820
The first strategy
that we heard about

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.440
is physically putting
your phone away.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.080
One of the participants that
we talk to is a playwright.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.690
And she told me about
how she would actually

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.280
put her phone in a
box and put it away.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.360
And then once she wrote a
certain number of pages,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.940
she would go back to the box.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.150
And as a reward, she could use
her phone for 10 or 15 minutes.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.670
Other participants told
us about not letting

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.290
different sources contact them.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.920
So we heard of
participants going

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.970
into Settings and
disabling notifications

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.500
for different apps.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.000
We heard of some
students telling us

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.680
about how sometimes when
in their study sessions

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.055
they'll actually exchange phones
and change their pass codes, so

00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:10.590
that this way they won't
be tempted by their phones.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.890
We also heard about participants
putting their phones

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.630
in airplane mode.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.700
And then the most drastic
thing that we heard

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.840
is that00 there are some
participants who told us

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.140
that they will
literally uninstall app

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.340
if they feel like it's
to spam-y or too noisy.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.280
The other tactic
that we heard about

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.480
is not letting your device
make noise, so putting it in

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.887
do not disturb mode, putting
it in vibrate, or silent.

00:07:33.887 --> 00:07:35.470
And some people even
told us that this

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.440
is how their phone is
set up at all times.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.850
And now this last
tragedy is doing nothing

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.220
and being constantly annoyed.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.340
So these participants--
it wasn't that

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.826
they didn't know that
they can to make changes

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:49.700
or that they could do
all these other things.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.640
It just wasn't
worth the trouble.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.860
People told us that they
wanted more shortcuts

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.526
to learn about each notification
without having to look at it.

00:07:57.526 --> 00:07:58.900
Because if you
think about it, it

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.280
does take some effort to
review a notification.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.050
And the cost of checking
that notification

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.150
should be worth your time.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.020
So one of the
participants we talked to

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.567
told me that the letter,
K, is a waste of her time.

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:12.150
And when she said that at first,
I was like a little confused,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.774
because I didn't
really understand what

00:08:13.774 --> 00:08:17.340
she had against the letter, K.
And then she actually told me

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.954
how she'll get a
notification for a message

00:08:19.954 --> 00:08:21.620
and she thinks it's
something important.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.760
And then she goes
through the trouble

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.950
of unlocking he phone
to look at the message.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.040
And literally it is just the
letter, K-- shorthand for OK.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.880
Screening information helps
people sift through the noise.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.820
And participants told
us about different ways

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.700
that they did this.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.034
So for instance, like
different notifications

00:08:37.034 --> 00:08:38.950
from different apps that
have different sounds

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.010
or the colors of notifications.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.800
And they wanted even
more ways to do this.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.970
One participant, Flora,
told us about how

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.200
her phone has an actual
light for notifications,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.557
and different notifications
have different colors.

00:08:52.557 --> 00:08:54.390
And she knows that when
the light is orange,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.100
it means that it's
her fan fiction app.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.930
And she gets really excited,
because she loves that app.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.780
Alexa told us about how
she gets a little confused

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.430
between the sounds of
two notifications--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.836
one for a game app and
then one for Gmail.

00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:09.210
And she wishes that she could
distinguish between the two

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.460
a little bit more,
because she probably

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.690
wouldn't be checking her
phone as often if she

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.330
knew it was from the game
as opposed to emails.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.689
So what do people want to know?

00:09:17.689 --> 00:09:19.230
Well, people told
us that they wanted

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.840
to know two primary things
with their notifications.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.921
And I'm going to tell
you about the first one.

00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:27.420
The first thing that people
told us that they wanted to know

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.120
is that people are the most
important notifications.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.430
And this was hands down
every single person

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.640
we talked to said
this is number one.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.740
This is their
number one priority.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.060
And who a message is from
is more important than what

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.750
or when.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.390
So when we're talking
about people notifications,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.931
we're talking about
everything that's

00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:50.320
like messaging, IM, chat,
email, all that sort of stuff.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.890
Participant Flora told us that
those are the most important

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.780
to her, and she always responds
to those notifications.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.200
But even within
people notifications,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.620
there are people
in your life who

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.560
are more important
than other people.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.700
It could be your spouse.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.020
It could be your best friend.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.120
It could be your
parents or your kids.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.890
And for those people, you
reserve those channels

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.611
of communication.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.610
Andrew told us there are
two things in life that

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.340
are going to get him in
trouble-- work emails and SMSes

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.330
from his wife.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.807
So those are the two things
that he takes care of first.

00:10:21.807 --> 00:10:23.890
And it makes sense that
these people notifications

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:24.980
are so important.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.660
They help us maintain
our social connections.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.430
They help us fulfill social
contracts and obligations

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.875
with other people.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:34.390
And if you think about
it throughout humanity,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.130
we've needed other people
in order to survive.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.530
But we also found that
there's a certain etiquette

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.860
around online communication.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.770
And there are consequences
when you don't

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.510
reply to someone soon enough.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.140
Juan told us about how there
was a time when he broke up

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.720
with someone, because
that person did not

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.030
get back to him quickly enough.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.690
And he knew that this person
had gotten his message,

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.366
because this he had
gotten the read receipt.

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:01.990
And we might laugh
about Juan and think

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.581
it's an extreme scenario.

00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:05.080
But a lot of the
people we talked to

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.580
had this anxiety
around read receipts.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.771
Now, another reason why
these people notifications

00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:11.770
are so important is because
they just feel good.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.780
It feels good to know
that there's somebody out

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.280
there who's sending
you message, who

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.256
cares about you, who needs you.

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:18.630
And we couldn't
put it any better

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.880
than our participant, Rachael.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.260
She said notifications
from other people

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.670
make her feel like her existence
in the world is important.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.390
She even told us how there are
times where her phone might

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.347
get a little quiet.

00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:31.430
And she'll actually start
kind of like instigating

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.910
communications with
other people that she

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.290
hasn't heard from in a while.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.800
She might send them a message
just so that that way,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.906
she gets this positive
feedback loop.

00:11:39.906 --> 00:11:41.530
JULIE ARANDA: So
what's the other thing

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.571
that people want to know?

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.320
So Noor just told you
people is most important.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.450
Well, the other thing was people
want help with remembering

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.820
what they need to do.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.370
So all participants told us
there's a lot on my radar.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.980
I have these long mental
and physical to do lists.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.040
And one person said, OK,
what's on my radar right now?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.960
I have to clean the
chinchilla cage.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.570
I have to remember to go to
Trader Joe's and pickup pumpkin

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.650
spice coffee later.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.730
I've got to order my Prius keys.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.910
I have to confirm a play
date for my son tomorrow.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.535
She's like, I
could go on and on.

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:13.850
And someone else said I
have to return a modem.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.307
I've got to call
Citibank to pay my bill.

00:12:16.307 --> 00:12:17.640
I've got to return the curtains.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.772
I've got a call the super
to fix my drain later.

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:22.230
We all have stuff
like this, right?

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.400
We've all got stuff that
we have to take care of.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.910
Participants told
us about these.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.400
They're trying to stay on top
of these tasks in their lives,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.000
while they're managing all
these incoming interruptions

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.890
and notifications
that we are sending.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.010
Alyssa said, "My life is
a series of close-calls."

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.647
She's a writer for a
newspaper in New York,

00:12:41.647 --> 00:12:43.980
and she just got deadline
after deadline after deadline.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.600
And she has trouble
juggling them.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.580
Sometimes she forgets something
or just drops the ball.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.860
Or sometimes she's very close
to forgetting something.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.770
But at any moment, she's feel
something could be dropped.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.970
A close-call's going to happen.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.910
The most appreciated and
relied upon notifications

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.240
are ones that remind you of
something you need to do.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.690
These bring relief.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.640
These are when people want to
be notified, because they help.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.550
"If I didn't have my calendar
reminding me, I'd be screwed,"

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.440
said Andrew.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.870
I feel the same way for work
meetings and stuff like that.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:18.440
Without a calendar,
where would we be?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.120
And then we asked
people, so show us

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.250
how do you remember the
stuff you have to do?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.020
And people showed us these
systems that they had.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.680
Every one had some
kind of a system,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.470
and there were all very complex.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.000
They all included
multiple tools.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.380
There was always
gaps and overlaps.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.090
There was no perfect solution.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.780
I don't think anyone
figured it out yet.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.440
Some people-- like
for example, this one.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.520
This person-- he put these
two notes on his door.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.410
It's a German word.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.210
I don't know if anyone
knows German here.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.230
But it's-- oh yeah?

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.080
What does that say?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.280
AUDIENCE: Keys.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.030
JULIE ARANDA: Yes.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.420
Bring the keys when
you leave the house.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.960
So for him, he has
a complex system.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.460
And this is just
one part of it--

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.010
to use physical
notes on his door.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:58.760
We do that, right?

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.510
Does anyone do that?

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.121
I put boxes by the door.

00:14:02.121 --> 00:14:04.370
And the types of tools we
heard were across the board.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.360
There were like paper lists,
paper planners, digital lists,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.680
digital apps, taking photos
to remember to do something,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.560
taking screenshots
of a text message,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.230
because there was something in
that text message you needed.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.220
People hack together
all kinds of things

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.230
to try to remember these tasks.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.980
This participant said,
"I keep the weekly

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.610
to do list to my planner.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.312
I keep unread emails for
things I need to do long-term."

00:14:28.312 --> 00:14:30.270
And we heard people
keeping these things unread

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.205
for like eight months, so
they would remember them.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:36.030
And she said, "I'm just
trying to survive."

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.940
And we used this as inspiration
for the title of our talk,

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.830
because it reminds
us we all are just

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.210
trying to survive and
stay on top of the things

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.500
we need to do in our
lives, while managing

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.190
all these interruptions
and all these distractions

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.050
that we're getting
on our devices.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.310
So when we looked at all
the different types of tools

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.850
that people use
to remember stuff,

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.300
they seem to fall into
this kind of process

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.870
for how to remember
to do things.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.950
And the first stage
is just offloading.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.430
So you remember like, oh,
I got to do this later.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.400
You have to offload that idea,
so you can focus on doing it,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.590
rather than focus
on remembering it.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.920
And next you have to view it.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.430
So you put all your stuff
together somewhere in a list

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.630
somewhere.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.220
And you need to be able
to access it later.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.600
And the third one is to
do the thing, so the thing

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.630
you need to get done.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.100
And the last one is to check
it off when you're done.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.710
And we highlighted
Do, because we

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.140
think this is where
notifications can help most.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.220
And just focusing
on the Do section,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.250
people told us the quality
they needed in a tool

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.030
to help them was like they
needed that alert-- that ping.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.090
That's kind of the
most important thing.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.300
And so people would use
things like putting things

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.920
in calendar, a digital
calendar, just for that ping,

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.884
even though it's
not an event per se.

00:15:45.884 --> 00:15:48.050
Or they would email themselves
just to get that ping

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.220
and to get that the unread
email on the top of their list.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:56.300
Taking pictures, like I said,
phone alarms, timers, telling

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.720
someone else to remind
me later, so offloading

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.230
that responsibility to
someone elss-- lots of tools

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.800
that people hacked
just to get them to do.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.080
Someone said I need something
to pester me until I do it,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.580
or I'll forget.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.280
And Angie-- so she missed
the flight last time.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.920
And this time she really didn't
want to miss that flight.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.440
So she set a calendar reminder,
an alarm on her phone,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.370
and she made her friend keep
texting her every 30 minutes

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.940
to make sure she'd get home
and get a good night's sleep

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.310
to wake up in the morning.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.160
So she was so afraid
of missing the flight

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.600
that she triple booked
these different sources,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.860
because she didn't believe that
any one would be enough to let

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.790
her remember task.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.840
So how might our
notifications remind

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.620
people of what they need to do?

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.050
And I think it was probably
different with every service

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.300
or every app that you work on.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.380
But I think for each
one, we encourage

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.390
you to think about your
service and which aspects of it

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.810
might be related to a task
that someone might need to do.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.280
And how can you remind them
with your notifications?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.860
OK, so leading into
this idea of how do

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.722
people want to know things.

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:03.180
We told you what
they want to know,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.890
which is people and
stuff they have to.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.240
But how should we notify them?

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.720
And it depends.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.900
When we looked at all the
different notifications

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.579
our participants
told us about, there

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.720
was an interesting
intersection between the task,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.369
so how enjoyable
it is and how much

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.099
you want to do the thing,
to how urgent it is.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.920
And when we combine
these dimensions,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.900
we get four types
of notifications.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.450
So here's a framework that
I'll go into a more detail.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.620
If you look at the
x-axis, this is really

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.735
like how much do you
want to do the task.

00:17:32.735 --> 00:17:35.110
There are some things that
are just more fun than others.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.300
And how urgent is it?

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.050
Is it something you
need to do right away?

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.560
Or can you put it off to later?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.920
And this framework speaks
to how people should

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.090
be notified of something.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.490
So going to this first one, the
green section-- the VIP stuff.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.240
So this is the
enjoyable and urgent.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.650
So these are the
VIPs in your life

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.790
that Noor just told you
about, because people are

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.040
so important to our survival.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.780
These are the most
important notifications.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.930
Some examples are a text from
your spouse, a baby-cam alert

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.200
telling you that
there's in the crib

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.240
or in the baby's
room, social event

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.990
reminders, because
these events are

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.060
important for our
social connections.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.340
Remembering a friend's
birthday, we heard that a lot.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.887
People really
wanted to remember.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:18.720
And don't remind me the
day of the birthday.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.510
But tell me in advance,
so I can do something

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:21.290
about the birthday.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:21.790
Right.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.750
"I wish I could something
like an Amber alert

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.680
for my parents, my ex-husband,
and my son's school,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.340
so that those would
override everything else."

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.320
So for Alice, no matter
what settings you set up

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.690
on her phone that day, whether
she's in her yoga class

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.810
or whether she's teaching
her university course,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.470
she needs to be reached at
all times by these VIP people.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.240
So for her
notifications, those need

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.720
to stand out from the noise.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.190
The next one will be called
mission-critical notifications.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.630
So these are not enjoyable
things, or things

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.980
you don't like to do,
but they're important.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.020
And often they're important
for your livelihood

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.680
or for your survival,
like work emails.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.180
Right.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.013
Those are important.

00:19:03.013 --> 00:19:04.760
You've got to get
to those in time.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.810
Renewing a passport,
which I don't think anyone

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.840
likes to do-- it's
just kind of a hassle.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.350
But there are real ramifications
if you don't do it in time.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.710
And anything with a
deadline-- that's important.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.544
So for these types
of tasks, people

00:19:17.544 --> 00:19:18.960
need to know if
there's a deadline

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.480
and exactly when it is,
so that they can plan it.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.550
And they need to do it.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.200
And Andrew, who is the lawyer
who hates his job-- he says,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.140
"My work emails...

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.714
Those are the really
soul-crushing alerts.

00:19:30.714 --> 00:19:32.130
To me, this is
kind of the essence

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.370
of the mission-critical stuff.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.990
The next one is what we
call nagging reminders.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.940
So these are unpleasant things
you don't really like to do,

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.730
but they don't have to be
done right away yet, so

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.310
like paying the bills or like
picking up your dry cleaning--

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.150
just like those errands that
add up-- system updates,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.890
app updates, basically the
stuff that you go, ugh, still

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.550
have to do that later.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.020
Shelly said, "I know I have
to pick up my dry cleaning.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.160
But telling me right now
is not going to help me.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.610
It's just like nagging.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.030
Tell me when I'm near
the dry cleaner!"

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.320
So we should think about for
these nagging types of alerts,

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.870
like how can you send them so
to increase the likelihood of it

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.690
being done the most?

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.960
And the last one are what
we call fun distractions.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.280
So this is maybe like
the only part of your day

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.550
that is kind of enjoyable.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.390
These are fun things
you do to kill

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.640
time, like social networking,
group chats, games, and news.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.380
And we heard people
telling us that they

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.990
check these apps so often
anyways that maybe they don't

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.270
even need a notification ever.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.450
For example, Alexa said,
she loves this game.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.540
"I'm so addicted.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.300
But I hate their notifications,
like 'You have 5 more

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.250
lives!', because I
already know that.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.520
I was going to play it anyway.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.872
You don't need to tell me."

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:50.330
And this I thought
was interesting,

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.700
because if you like the game,
wouldn't you like to know?

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.010
It's a positive message, right?

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.150
You've got new lives, like maybe
someone would like to know.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.310
But for her, she doesn't.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.790
So maybe for some of these
types of things, maybe more

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.660
customization for each user
to decide which exactly they

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.150
want and don't want.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.540
So this just sums up
the four quadrants

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.020
and some examples inside them.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.520
OK.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.290
So it's not that simple.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.230
If only we could say, OK, for
every type of notification,

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.060
it fits exactly
there for everybody.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.960
It's not that simple-- lots
of contextual issues here,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.650
one of them being
the urgency scale.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.150
SO because time is so related
to urgency, over time the way

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.570
you experience a
notification will shift.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.970
So we came up with what we
think violation-- principles

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.480
that notifications should stick
to in order to be effective.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.140
And when they're
violated, the notification

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.970
can move across the quadrants.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.520
And I'll give you
some examples here.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.020
OK.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.580
So here are , we think,
the four principles of what

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.670
notifications should be.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.380
The first one, I
think is most basic.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.440
It's relevance.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.300
Send me messages
that matter to me.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.800
When it is not relevant, it
becomes unnecessary noise.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.175
Denise said that she really
likes this photo apps

00:22:04.175 --> 00:22:05.050
she just start using.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.040
It reminds her every
day at 6:00 PM,

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.931
you didn't post a
picture of your child.

00:22:08.931 --> 00:22:10.180
And she's like, oh, thank you.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:10.680
Great.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.870
I'll do it now.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.190
But my mom and dad
and sister-- they

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.950
all hate it, because they're
never going to post a picture.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:18.533
They just joined the
app, because they

00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:20.040
wanted to see her pictures.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.390
So this is just an example
of one notification--

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.280
very useful and
delightful to one user,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.010
but very annoying and
irrelevant to the other people.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.091
And Shelly-- she has a group
chat with five close friends.

00:22:32.091 --> 00:22:34.590
She said they're fun, unless
you're not in it, like if she's

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.551
busy at that moment.

00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:37.550
Then their phone just
keeps buzzing and buzzing.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.651
And it's so annoying.

00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:41.150
So those are just
examples of things

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.740
that were enjoyable
distractions, right,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.570
like positive
things in your day.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.330
But when they're
not relevant to you,

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.470
they move over into
that nagging category.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.020
The next principle--
selectivity and differentiation.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.600
So Noor talked about how
there's a cost of your attention

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.800
to go check a
notification, right.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.240
It needs to be worth your
attention, so be selective.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.040
And people said if
messages are too excessive,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.410
I'm just going to show you out.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.130
I'm going to shut
that source down.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.720
If they're not
differentiated, I'll

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.590
stop noticing them over time.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.870
For example, Angie-- she
talks about this new app

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.590
the she uses.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.810
It "sends way too
many notifications,

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.530
like 'Breaking News-- The
president of the university is

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.930
thinking of stepping down'.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.670
And then 'Breaking News--
He's going to step down'.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.860
And then 'Breaking
News-- He took a step'.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.600
She says "It's so annoying!"

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.250
And Stephen talked about a very
popular social networking app,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.640
and how it sent him away
too many notifications.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.710
And he deleted it.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.710
And that's something we're
hearing more actually

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.293
across other research
that we're doing

00:23:41.293 --> 00:23:43.900
is more people just
using the browser--

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.090
the mobile web experience--
because the app was

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.850
sending too much stuff.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.650
We're hearing that a lot.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.650
So those are examples again of
positive things, right-- news

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.664
that people like to read,
social networking, which is fun.

00:23:56.664 --> 00:23:58.080
Positive things--
but because they

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.810
weren't selective or
differentiated enough

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.380
in their notifications,
it moves over

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.980
to this nagging, annoying thing
that you resent and ignore

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.110
over time.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.900
The next one is the
principle of legitimacy.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.270
So the importance
of the content needs

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.110
to be aligned with
the urgency signal.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.300
When they're unimportant alerts
that are disguised as urgent,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.380
it tricks me into
unnecessary anxiety

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.940
and I will resent that source.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.010
And I think this is probably
the most annoying to users.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.630
And I'll give you
some examples here.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.590
Like Flora says,
"Sometimes I get alerts

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.850
that I don't think
need to be alerts.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.750
Like some app reminding me
that I can buy something in it"

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.120
It's another place where
I have to eradicate

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.450
spam, which irritates me."

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.540
So sometimes-- do we all
get those notifications

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.730
where it didn't actually
benefit you in any way?

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.700
An d it all did was be
like, hey, I'm here.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.479
Remember, I exist on your phone.

00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:49.270
These are the ones.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.680
They're not legitimate, and
they really get people annoyed.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.960
We call them crying
wolf, right, because we

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.990
reserve that part
of our consciousness

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.860
for the important VIP people.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.759
But these notifications--
they cry wolf

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.300
and they get into
your consciousness.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.800
They stress you
out for a minute.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.591
And you're like, oh,
I didn't even need it.

00:25:06.591 --> 00:25:08.890
It tricked you, and it
moves over to that really

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.670
nagging category.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.000
These are the worst offenders.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.880
And the last principle,
action ability.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.410
Can it be acted upon?

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.330
Tell me when I can act.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.850
Give me options to
delay, and allow

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.350
me to find that
message again later.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.700
And help me prioritize,
like tell me

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.120
what will happen
if I don't do it,

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.080
so I can put it on that scale of
how urgent or not urgent it is.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.570
David said, "Sometimes I get
a notification for something

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.316
I want to do, just not
right at that moment.

00:25:38.316 --> 00:25:39.690
And then I forget
about it later,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.930
because I don't see it
again." and Denise-- she says,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.310
"I hate updating my OS."

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.830
I think maybe we
feel that way too.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.960
"So I just keep putting
it, off until one day

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.300
an app told me I can't use it
in anymore unless I update it.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.940
Then I spent an
hour deleting things

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.205
to make more room
for the update."

00:25:57.205 --> 00:25:59.060
It's probably happened
to some of us.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.470
And this example is
about OS updates.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.680
But if you think about
app updates as well,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.305
sometimes you get
like, oh, by the way,

00:26:05.305 --> 00:26:06.513
there's an update to the app.

00:26:06.513 --> 00:26:09.070
And you think, OK, I don't
have to do anything about it.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.945
You kind of leave it.

00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:11.090
It was a nagging thing.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.923
And then all a sudden
one day it's like, OK,

00:26:12.923 --> 00:26:13.770
you can't use it.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.310
And you have to drop
everything and update it.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.090
That happened to me the
other day at the keynote.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.600
I got a thing saying there
was activity at my front door,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.190
because I have those cameras.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.960
So I stressed out.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.230
I was like, oh my
god, what's happening.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.030
And then I opened the app.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.110
And it's like,
there's a new version.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.340
You have to update it.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.674
And I couldn't get on the Wi-Fi.

00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:33.798
And I just sit there trying
, like what's happening

00:26:33.798 --> 00:26:34.630
at my front door.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.100
And I couldn't update it.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.720
[LAUGHING]

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.260
So those are
examples that things

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.210
that were nagging that you
didn't know were important yet.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.240
But because you didn't
act on it and it

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.420
didn't make you
accountable, it moved

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.780
into eventually a
mission-critical fire

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.190
that you had to put
out in the moment.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.150
So just to sum up the principles
that we've mentioned here,

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.610
this is what we think
notification content should

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.810
abide by.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.310
OK.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.680
So what does this mean
for Android and for you?

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.180
OK.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.950
So by the end of our study,
we realized a very clearly

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.050
that the goals of developers and
users are just very different

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.770
and on kind of different planes.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:13.380
Everything we've
told you so far has

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.550
been from the user's
perspective, so all this stuff

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.810
on the left side.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.420
What users want, they just want
to stay on top of their life.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.460
They just want to
survive, right.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.160
Send me only what I need.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.080
Don't interrupt me.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.780
Don't disrupt me even more.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.290
Give me confidence I'm going
to get those VIP notifications.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.660
That's all they want.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.630
But as developer, we want to
fulfill the service obligations

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.514
that we have to give.

00:27:37.514 --> 00:27:38.930
And when there's
something new, we

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.138
want to tell people about it.

00:27:40.138 --> 00:27:42.360
Hey, there's this new
feature or something

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.760
has changed in the service.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.890
We believe it will
benefit their lives,

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.500
and we want to tell them, right.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.680
And of course, we want
to promote engagement.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.700
We spent time and money
working on these things,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.910
and we want people to use them.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.390
So if you look at
these two sides,

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.700
they're just very
different goals.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.290
They're competing.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.700
And there are different
perspectives on urgency.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.000
So what is urgent
to the developer

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.140
may not be urgent
at all to the users.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.890
And we acknowledge it's
challenging as developers

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.600
to know the user context.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.400
Because everyone
is so different,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.800
it's hard to know
what every user wants,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.136
like what this person
wants versus another.

00:28:19.136 --> 00:28:21.510
And so that's something that
we're working on internally,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.790
like what kind of
data can you use,

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.780
what signals can you
get to really determine

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.220
what users want to know.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.930
So what is Android doing?

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.910
So when in the
release, there are

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.640
some changes to notifications.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.170
And we feel that these
will help with those people

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.910
VIP notifications, but
this is just a start.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.650
We did this research at
the very end of last year,

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.230
but we've started to
ideate for future releases.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.520
And our team, we're working
toward creating a long term

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.330
vision for what we believe
the notifications should do.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.390
So what about your product?

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.980
Do you guys send notifications?

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.710
Yeah.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.270
So for each one that
you send, we really

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.030
encourage you to think
about it this way.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.160
What type is it?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.240
So use that framework
that we've created.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.370
And be honest and realistic.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.910
Like is it a painful
Is it nagging?

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.360
Is it useful or is it not?

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.680
Like how could it
be interpreted?

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.710
And given its level
of urgency, what

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.720
is the best way to send it?

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.790
Or even better, should
you even send it?

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.310
Is it offering any benefit?

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:26.170
Or is it merely just,
hey, look at our app,

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.430
like we still exist.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.200
And again, be honest
and realistic.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.670
And how can the notification
enhance the user experience

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.592
of the service?

00:29:34.592 --> 00:29:36.300
This might be the most
challenging to do.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.590
There are some really
good notifications

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:41.340
were it actually enhances
the whole service

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.620
and your experience of it.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.420
What can you do to respect
your users' attention

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.020
and help them complete
tasks that they care about?

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.450
We're all in this together
in this game, right.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.700
Like if some apps are sending
too many notifications, abusing

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.920
people's attention, it affects
how users think of other apps.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.534
And it affects their decision.

00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:02.950
The next time
there's an app, they

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.332
may not want to try it at all.

00:30:04.332 --> 00:30:06.790
We heard people say, I don't
even want to download the app.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.600
I'm just going to go
to the mobile website.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.140
Or they may download an app
and just block notifications

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.110
from the start.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.610
Right.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:17.910
What we do affects other
experiences as well.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.380
So today, we told you
about real people's lives.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.690
We told you about the
attachment and the addiction

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.200
to phones because
of notifications.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.350
We told you about
all the distractions

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.250
that people are managing, as
they're just trying to survive

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.270
and get through their day.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.430
We need to spread the word and
start a movement for everyone

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.140
to realize how disruptive
our notifications can be,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.290
and what we can
do to change this.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.260
We feel that we have
the responsibility

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.720
to respect all of
our users' attention.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.220
Thank you.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.118
