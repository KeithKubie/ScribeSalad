every human being models the world to
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.249
every human being models the world to
understand it and that's cognitively how

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259
understand it and that's cognitively how
 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.910
understand it and that's cognitively how
we're successful so I don't look at a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
we're successful so I don't look at a
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.939
we're successful so I don't look at a
chair and see a huge number of molecules

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
chair and see a huge number of molecules
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.500
chair and see a huge number of molecules
or some very complex structure I see a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
or some very complex structure I see a
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.929

chair this is something that's very hard

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
chair this is something that's very hard
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.710
chair this is something that's very hard
to teach a computer to do to understand

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720
to teach a computer to do to understand
 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.970
to teach a computer to do to understand
conceptual things forward right and we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
conceptual things forward right and we
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670
conceptual things forward right and we
conceptualize right away we theorize

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
conceptualize right away we theorize
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410
conceptualize right away we theorize
right away I have a theory of what that

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
right away I have a theory of what that
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850
right away I have a theory of what that
object is in my theory is that it's a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
object is in my theory is that it's a
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.660
object is in my theory is that it's a
chair and that's what helps human beings

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
chair and that's what helps human beings
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.049
chair and that's what helps human beings
be so adaptable in the world and so fast

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
be so adaptable in the world and so fast
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.869
be so adaptable in the world and so fast
and moving through the world and and

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879
and moving through the world and and
 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.060

it's precisely this ability to theorize

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
it's precisely this ability to theorize
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.660
it's precisely this ability to theorize
and model but we also know that by doing

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
and model but we also know that by doing
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.720
and model but we also know that by doing
so we are projecting a theory of the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
so we are projecting a theory of the
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.360
so we are projecting a theory of the
world on the world and we trick

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
world on the world and we trick
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.410
world on the world and we trick
ourselves we deceive ourselves sometimes

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420
ourselves we deceive ourselves sometimes
 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.190
ourselves we deceive ourselves sometimes
the trick is to to use the the power

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
the trick is to to use the the power

the trick is to to use the the power
that's given to us by being able to

that's given to us by being able to
 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.190
that's given to us by being able to
conceptualize and and model and have

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
conceptualize and and model and have
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310
conceptualize and and model and have
metaphor but always to remember that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
metaphor but always to remember that
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830

when you come to a point there is in
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200
when you come to a point there is in
some sense no such thing as knowing

some sense no such thing as knowing

some sense no such thing as knowing
something's true it's true in the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
something's true it's true in the
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170
something's true it's true in the
context of the model of the world that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
context of the model of the world that
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.590
context of the model of the world that
you have and and maybe there's a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
you have and and maybe there's a
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.749
you have and and maybe there's a
different model of the world where that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
different model of the world where that
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.630
different model of the world where that
truth is a little bit different I mean

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
truth is a little bit different I mean

I'm in no position to talk about

I'm in no position to talk about
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929
I'm in no position to talk about
interpersonal relationships but I think

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
interpersonal relationships but I think
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.520
interpersonal relationships but I think
that this is a problem between people

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
that this is a problem between people
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350
that this is a problem between people
that we have a theory of the world and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
that we have a theory of the world and
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539
that we have a theory of the world and
things mean certain things in that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
things mean certain things in that
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210
things mean certain things in that
context and we forget that somebody else

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
context and we forget that somebody else
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.800
context and we forget that somebody else
has a different theory of the world and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
has a different theory of the world and
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929
has a different theory of the world and
the exact same experience means

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
the exact same experience means
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090
the exact same experience means
something very different as a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
something very different as a
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.819
something very different as a
theoretical physicist I rely very much

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
theoretical physicist I rely very much
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.819
theoretical physicist I rely very much
on calculating to understand results so

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
on calculating to understand results so
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.660
on calculating to understand results so
let's say I want to know what happens

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
let's say I want to know what happens
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.220
let's say I want to know what happens
when

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
when

when
big black hole swallows a little tiny

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
big black hole swallows a little tiny
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.470
big black hole swallows a little tiny
black hole my starting point will be to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
black hole my starting point will be to
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240
black hole my starting point will be to
think what's my first mathematical

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
think what's my first mathematical
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.680
think what's my first mathematical
sentence that I know if I crack it open

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
sentence that I know if I crack it open
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600
sentence that I know if I crack it open
will answer this question

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
will answer this question
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.580
will answer this question
not even that step can be very hard and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
not even that step can be very hard and
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.780
not even that step can be very hard and
then once I do that I'll be moving very

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
then once I do that I'll be moving very
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.479
then once I do that I'll be moving very
in a very structured way through the

in a very structured way through the
steps to unlock that but it's kind of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
steps to unlock that but it's kind of
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.850
steps to unlock that but it's kind of
sometimes it's like a Rubik's Cube which

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
sometimes it's like a Rubik's Cube which
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.430
sometimes it's like a Rubik's Cube which
I'm actually not good at but you know

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
I'm actually not good at but you know
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.670
I'm actually not good at but you know
some people can just go and solve it and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
some people can just go and solve it and
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680
some people can just go and solve it and
some people just keep making a bigger

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
some people just keep making a bigger
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.190
some people just keep making a bigger
mess right and so as a physicist you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
mess right and so as a physicist you
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.619
mess right and so as a physicist you
want your skill to improve to the point

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
want your skill to improve to the point
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.349
want your skill to improve to the point
where you can just sort of unlock this

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359
where you can just sort of unlock this
 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.809
where you can just sort of unlock this
thing I find it very interesting when I

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
thing I find it very interesting when I
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.470
thing I find it very interesting when I
work with much younger students I like

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480
work with much younger students I like
 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.119
work with much younger students I like
to kind of sit back in the room when

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129
to kind of sit back in the room when
 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.670
to kind of sit back in the room when
we're calculating now and and ask them

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
we're calculating now and and ask them
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150
we're calculating now and and ask them
to try to find the solution and in the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
to try to find the solution and in the
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.369
to try to find the solution and in the
way that's you know we do know how to go

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379
way that's you know we do know how to go
 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.740
way that's you know we do know how to go
one step after another but I'll be

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
one step after another but I'll be
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.500
one step after another but I'll be
trying at the same time to try to find

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
trying at the same time to try to find
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.159
trying at the same time to try to find
that cute way of unpacking it that's

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169
that cute way of unpacking it that's
 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.379
that cute way of unpacking it that's
highly non-obvious and sometimes I'm

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389
highly non-obvious and sometimes I'm
 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.309
highly non-obvious and sometimes I'm
sitting there for two days

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319
sitting there for two days

well there you know generating 12 pages

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919
well there you know generating 12 pages
 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.949
well there you know generating 12 pages
are very tough beautifully done

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
are very tough beautifully done

sometimes I succeed and sometimes I

sometimes I succeed and sometimes I
don't you know sometimes I can't do that

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
don't you know sometimes I can't do that
 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.509
don't you know sometimes I can't do that
it's just not possible or I haven't

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
it's just not possible or I haven't
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.059
it's just not possible or I haven't
figured out how to do it and sometimes I

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
figured out how to do it and sometimes I
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.849
figured out how to do it and sometimes I
do and when you do it's not just that

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859
do and when you do it's not just that
 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.849
do and when you do it's not just that
it's shorter it's that you're working

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859
it's shorter it's that you're working
 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.940
it's shorter it's that you're working
with such bigger structures that you can

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
with such bigger structures that you can
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.550
with such bigger structures that you can
see so much more at a time I don't know

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560
see so much more at a time I don't know
 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.930
see so much more at a time I don't know
how else to explain it you know how how

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
how else to explain it you know how how
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.900
how else to explain it you know how how
chess players see a lot of the game at

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910
chess players see a lot of the game at
 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.349
chess players see a lot of the game at
one time in one sort of thought they see

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359
one time in one sort of thought they see
 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.289
one time in one sort of thought they see
many plays and many and you know it's

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299
many plays and many and you know it's
 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.089
many plays and many and you know it's
also I don't play chess because I see

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099
also I don't play chess because I see
 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.699
also I don't play chess because I see
one play at a time right and I think

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
one play at a time right and I think
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.289
one play at a time right and I think
