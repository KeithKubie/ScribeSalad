00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.620
Atlas is coming and he's going to KILL US
ALL!

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.200
Or maybe he's just gonna clear bombs and stuff.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.349
Hey meatbags - Trace here comin' to you from
DNews -- The field of robotics is both fascinating

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.349
and frightening.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.779
We're advancing so fast, and yet... not...
really...

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.970
DARPA and Boston Dynamics have struck fear
into the hearts of gods and men numerous times

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.960
with robots like Big Dog and Petman -- but
now, this one takes the frickin' cake.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.050
Atlas is a six foot two inch, 330 pound humanoid
robot; possibly the most advanced humanoid

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110
robot ever built.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.110
Are you freaked out?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.090
Because we looked at this in our news meeting
and started talking in all caps.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.090
And yet....

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260
On the cool side: Atlas has an on-board, real-time
control computer, LIDAR -- which is similar

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.850
to the tech that helps self-driving cars see
their surroundings -- stereo vision like a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.350
human, and 28 hydraulic joints.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.740
On the be-wary-because-it-could-kill-you-in-one-of-your-weak-little-meatbag-heartbeats
side: Atlas has four hands.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.740
Four.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.160
So why spend all this time and money to build
a humanoid robot?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.170
Disaster response is the obvious first-step
-- no pun intended -- with Atlas being able

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.350
to put a versatile humanoid robot into a situation
that would kill a human, like the Fukushima

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.350
meltdown.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.329
The upside of this technological terror, is
at the moment Boston Dynamics and DARPA are

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.329
still creating its brain.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.780
So, there's still the ability to keep it under
control.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.780
For now...

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.109
When it comes to robot advances, these guys
are not the only company making such extravagant

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.149
robotics assertions.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.719
If you follow the field, then you know of
Honda's ASIMO.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.240
They've been developing this little fella
since the mid-80s.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.869
Focusing on mimicking human strides.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.909
Today, it can walk around pretty smoothly,
recognize people in a room, and is beginning

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.329
to learn to respond to social input.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.869
Importantly, it also carries its own power
supply, which Boston Dynamic's Atlas has yet

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:42.869
to master.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.009
Learning is the key word there,

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.799
in a demonstration last week, ASIMO was supposed
to recognize raised hands and ask for questions,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.969
but instead it got confused... so maybe making
a brain for Atlas is further in the future

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:53.969
than we thought.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.869
Currently, the SMARTEST robot on the planet,
is debatable, but on IndieGogo -- a crowdfunding

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.189
site similar to Kickstarter -- I found a team
of roboticists that want to create a robot

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.999
with the artificial intelligence of a three
year old; figuring it would then have something

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.560
no AI has ever attained: common sense.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.090
Though since it will be three...

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.390
I'd hope it doesn't just want to sit and eat
chocolate frosted sugar bombs all day.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.230
Robotics kits are a great way to teach kids
about science and math in everyday life.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.290
DARPA is keeping that in mind, and have released
virtual version of Atlas that anyone can program

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.290
and play with.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
That's pretty fantastic.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.430
Does this robot make you excited for the future
of robotics?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.390
Or are you more... wary...

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.950
What would YOU use it for if you had one?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.670
