00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.710
Oh, hey!

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.240
I didn't see you up there.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.060
How long have you been waiting in this line?

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.930
I've been here for like 15 minutes and it's
freaking freezing out here

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.640
I mean, whose banana do you gotta peel in
order to get into this club?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.280
Well, while we're here I guess this might
not be a bad time to continue our discussion

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.970
about cells. Because cells, like nightclubs,
have to be selectively permeable.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.150
They can only work if they let in the stuff
that they need and they kick out the stuff

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.079
that they don't need

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.699
like trash and ridiculously drunk people

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.159
and Justin Bieber fans.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.029
No matter what stuff it is it has to pass
through the cell's membrane.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.800
Some things can pass really easily into cells
without a lot of help, like water or oxygen.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.900
But a lot of other things that they need,
like sugar, other nutrients, signaling molecules

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.270
or steroids

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.520
they can't get in or it will take a really
long time for them to do it.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.550
Yeah. I can relate.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.550
Today we're going to be talking about how
substances move through cell membranes, which

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.330
is happening all the time, including right
now, in me

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.400
and right now, in you.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.659
And this is vital to all life, because it's
not just how cells acquire what they need

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.990
and get rid of what they don't, it's also
how cells communicate with one another.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.450
Different materials have different ways of
crossing the cell membrane. And there are

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.990
basically two categories of ways: there's
active transport and there's passive transport.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.719
Passive transport doesn't require any energy,
which is great, because important things like

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.409
oxygen and water can use this to get into
cells really easily.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.159
And they do this through what we call diffusion.
Let's say I'm finally in this show, and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.299
I'm in the show with my brother John. Some
of you know my brother John, and I love him,

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.630
but he uh...

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.979
He's not a big fan of people.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.509
I mean he likes people.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.289
He doesn't like big crowds.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.929
Being parts of big crowds and people standing
nearby him, breathing on him, touching him

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.490
accidentally and that sort of thing

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.719
Because John's with me at the show, we're
hanging out with all of our friends near the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.850
stage. But then he starts moving further and
further from the stage so he doesn't get

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.119
a bunch of hipsters invading his space.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.829
That's basically what diffusion is. If everyone
in the club were John Green they would try

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.819
and get as much space between all of them
as possible until it was a uniform mass of

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.539
John Greens throughout the club.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.030
When oxygen gets crowded, it finds places
that are less crowded and moves into those spaces.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.939
When water gets crowded, it does the same
thing and moves to where there is less water.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.530
When water does this across a membrane, it's
a kind of diffusion called osmosis. This is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.739
how your cells regulate their water content.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.250
Not only does this apply to water itself,
which as we've discussed is the world's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.019
best solvent.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.629
You're going to learn more about water in
our water episode.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.019
It also works with water that contains dissolved
materials, or solutions, like salt water,

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.299
or sugar water, or booze, which is just a
solution of ethanol in water.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.239
If the concentration of a solution is higher
inside a cell than it is outside of the cell,

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.540
then that solution is called hypertonic

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.519
Like Powerthirst, it's got everything packed
into it!

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.060
And if the concentration inside of the cell
is lower than outside of the cell, it's called hypotonic.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.860
Which is sort of a sad version of hypertonic.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.180
Like with Charlie Sheen: we don't want the
crazy, manic Charlie Sheen and we don't like

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.250
the super sad, depressed Charlie Sheen.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.500
We want the "in the middle" Charlie Sheen
who can just make us laugh and be happy.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.189
And that is the state that water concentrations
are constantly seeking. It's called isotonic.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.349
When the concentration is the same on both
sides, outside and in.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.480
And this works in real life! We can actually
show it to you.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.829
This vase is full of fresh water. And we also
have a sausage casing, which is actually made

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.500
of cellulose, and inside of that we have salt
water.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.670
We've dyed it so that you can see it move
through the casing, which is acting as our

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.269
membrane.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.769
This time lapse shows how over a few hours,
the salt water diffuses into the pure water.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.069
It'll keep diffusing until the concentration
of salt in the water is the same inside the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.670
membrane as outside.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.340
When water does this, attempting to become
isotonic, it's called moving across it's concentration

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.599
gradient.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.150
Most of my cells right now are bathed in a
solution that has the same concentration as

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.930
inside of them, and this is important.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.150
For example, if you took one of my red blood
cells and put it in a glass of pure water,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.530
it would be so hypertonic

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.739
so much stuff would be in the cell compared
to outside the cell

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.150
that water would rush into the red blood cell
and it would literally explode. So, we don't

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.829
want that!

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.930
But if the concentration of my blood plasma
were too high, water would rush out of my

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.659
cell, and it would shrivel up and be useless.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.989
That's why your kidneys are constantly on
the job, regulating the concentration of your

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.900
blood plasma to keep it isotonic.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.150
Now, water can permeate a membrane without
any help, but it's not particularly easy.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.780
As we discussed in the last episode, some
membranes are made out of phospholipids, and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.710
the phospholipid bilayer is hydrophilic, or
water-loving, on the outside and hydrophobic,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.569
or water-hating, on the inside.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.560
So water molecules have a hard time passing
through these layers because they get stuck

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.169
at that nonpolar, hydrophobic core.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.389
That is where the channel proteins come in.
They allow passage of stuff like water and

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.350
ions without using any energy. They straddle
the width of the membrane and inside they

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.000
have channels that are hydrophilic, which
draws the water through.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080
The proteins that are specifically for channeling
water are called aquaporins, and each one

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.370
can pass 3 billion water molecules a second!

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.259
It makes me have to pee just thinking about
it.

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.479
Things like oxygen and water, that cells need
constantly, they can get into the cell without

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.910
any energy necessary

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.840
but most chemicals use what's called active
transport.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.110
This is especially useful if you want to move
something in the opposite direction of its

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.360
concentration gradient, from a low concentration
to a high concentration.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.940
So, say we're back at that show, and I'm
keeping company with John who's being all

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.080
antisocial in his polite and charming way,
but after half a beer and an argument about

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.810
who the was the best Dr. Who. I want to get
back to my friends across the crowded bar.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.190
So I transport myself against the concentration
gradient of humans, spending a lot of energy,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.630
dodging stomping feet, throwing an elbow,
to get to them. THAT is high energy transport!

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.780
In a cell, getting the energy necessary to
do pretty much anything, including moving

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.800
something the wrong direction across it's
concentration gradient, requires ATP.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.220
ATP or adenosine tri-phosphate

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.650
You just want to replay that over and over
again until it just rolls off the tongue because

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.410
it's one of the most important chemicals that
you will ever, ever ever hear about.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.440
Adenosine tri-phosphate, ATP.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.900
If our bodies were America, ATP would be credit
cards It's such an important form of information

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.900
currency that we're going to do an entire
separate episode about it, which will be here,

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.099
when we've done it.

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.220
But for now, here's what you need to know.
When a cell requires active transport, it

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.690
basically has to pay a fee, in the form of
ATP, to a transport protein. A particularly

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.580
important kind of freakin' sweet transport
protein is called the sodium-potassium pump.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.830
Most cells have them, but they're especially
vital to cells that need lots of energy, like

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.710
muscle cells and brain cells.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.710
Oh! Biolo-graphy! It's my favorite part of
the show.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.979
The sodium-potassium pump was discovered in
the 1950s by a Danish medical doctor named

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.000
Jens Christian Skou, who was studying how
anesthetics work on membranes. He noticed

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.220
that there was a protein in cell membranes
that could pump sodium out of a cell. And

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.030
the way he got to know this pump was by studying
the nerves of crabs, because crab nerves are

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.720
huge compared to humans' nerves and are
easier to dissect and observe. But crabs are

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.409
still small, so he needed a lot of them. He
struck a deal with a local fisherman and,

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:25.060
over the years, studied approximately 25,000
crabs, each of which he boiled to study their

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.479
fresh nerve fibers. He published his findings
on the sodium-potassium pump in 1957 and in

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.629
the meantime became known for the distinct
odor that filled the halls of the Department

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:39.360
of Physiology at the university where he worked.
Forty years after making his discovery, Skou

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.780
was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.940
And here's what he taught us:

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.919
Turns out these pumps work against two gradients
at the same time. One is the concentration

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:52.000
gradient, and the other is an electrochemical
gradient. That's the difference in electrical

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.169
charge on either side of a cell's membrane.
So the nerve cells that Skou was studying,

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.199
like the nerve cells in your brain, typically
have a negative charge inside relative to

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.090
the outside. They also usually have a low
concentration of sodium ions inside.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.270
The pump works against both of these conditions,
collecting three positively-charged sodium

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.169
ions and pushing them out into the positively
charged, sodium ion-rich environment.

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:18.389
To get the energy to do this, the protein
pump breaks up a molecule of ATP.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:23.629
ATP, adenosine tri-phosphate, is an adenosine
molecule with three phosphate groups attached

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:27.990
to it, but when ATP connects with the protein
pump, an enzyme breaks the covalent bond of

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.050
one of those phosphates in a burst of excitement
and energy. This split releases enough energy

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.229
to change the shape of the pump so it "opens"
outward and releases the three sodium ions.

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:40.860
This new shape also makes it a good fit for
potassium ions that are outside the cell,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.320
so the pump lets two of those in.
So what you end up with is a nerve cell that

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.649
is literally and metaphorically charged.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:50.870
It has all those sodium ions waiting outside
with this intense desire to get inside of

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.440
the cell. And when something triggers the
nerve cell, it lets all of those in.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.660
And that gives the nerve cell a bunch of electrochemical
energy which it can then use to let you feel

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.220
things, or touch, or smell, or taste, or have
a thought.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.290
There is still yet another way that stuff
gets inside of cells, and this also requires

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.990
energy. It's also a form of active transport.
It's called vesicular transport, and the heavy

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.130
lifting is done by vesicles, which are tiny
sacs made of phospholipids just like the cell membrane.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.420
This kind of active transport is also called
cytosis, from the Greek for "cell action"

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.260
When vesicles transport materials outside
of a cell it's called exocytosis, or outside

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.230
cell action. A great example of this is going
on in your brain right now. It's how your

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.959
nerve cells release neurotransmitters.

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:36.899
You've heard of neurotransmitters. They are
very important in helping you feel different ways.

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:38.730
Like dopamine and serotonin.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.320
After neurotransmitters are synthesized and
packaged into vesicles, they're transported

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.589
until the vesicle reaches the membrane. When
that happens, their two bilayers rearrange

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:51.790
so that they fuse. Then the neurotransmitter
spills out and -- now I remember where I left my keys!

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.950
Now just play that process in reverse and
you'll see how material gets inside a cell.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.940
That's endocytosis. There are three different
ways that this happens. My personal favorite

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.230
is phagocytosis, and the awesome there begins
with the fact that that name itself means

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.440
DEVOURING CELL ACTION!

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.600
Check this out. So this particle outside here
is some dangerous bacterium in your body.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.920
And this is a white blood cell. Chemical receptors
on the blood cell membrane detect this punk

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.600
invader and attach to it, actually reaching
out around it and engulfing it. Then the membrane

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.970
forms a vesicle to carry it inside, where
it lays a total, unholy beatdown on it with

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.089
enzymes and other cool weapons.

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:35.180
Pinocytosis, or drinking action, is very simIlar
to phagocytosis, except instead of surrounding

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.950
whole particles, it surrounds things that
have already been dissolved. Here the membrane

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.149
just folds in a little to form the beginning
of a channel and then pinches off to form

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:47.029
a vesicle that holds the fluid. Most of your
cells are doing this right now, because it's

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:48.290
how our cells absorb nutrients.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.010
But what if a cell needs something that only
occurs in very small concentrations? That's

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.959
when cells use clusters of specialized receptor
proteins in the membrane that form a vesicle

00:10:57.959 --> 00:11:01.829
when receptors connect with the molecule that
they're looking for. For example, your cells

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:05.750
have specialized cholesterol receptors that
allow you to absorb cholesterol; if those

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.769
receptors don't work, which can happen with
some genetic conditions, cholesterol is left

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:13.160
to float around in your blood and eventually
causes heart disease. So that's just one of

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.380
many reasons to appreciate what's called
receptor-mediated endocytosis.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.079
Ah! Hey, glad you made it in too!

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:22.959
Now comes review time. You can click on any
of these links and go back to the part of

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:25.850
the video where I talk about that thing if
you are at all confused.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:31.579
And you may be. This is totally, pretty complicated
stuff we're dealing with right now, so you

00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:33.300
just go ahead and watch all that.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.529
And if you have any questions, of course,
we'll be down below in the comments and on

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.130
Twitter and Facebook as well and we'll see
you next time.
