with having good teachers because a good

young person's life and so we have to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
young person's life and so we have to
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.250
young person's life and so we have to
then have teachers who are well-prepared

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
then have teachers who are well-prepared
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.120
then have teachers who are well-prepared
who if they were not educated in the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
who if they were not educated in the
 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.479
who if they were not educated in the
sciences and engineering are have

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
sciences and engineering are have
 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.699
sciences and engineering are have
professional development programs that

things we have to have more degree

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770
things we have to have more degree
 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.910

so really having good teachers well

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530
so really having good teachers well
 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590

although problems like numbers I find
pretty pretty interesting because they
