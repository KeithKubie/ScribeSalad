an awesome idea now let's see what the
 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.529 align:start position:0%
an awesome idea now let's see what the
payoff<00:06:17.809><c> is</c><00:06:18.050><c> for</c><00:06:18.319><c> that</c><00:06:18.409><c> awesome</c><00:06:18.800><c> idea</c><00:06:19.539><c> nothing</c>

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 align:start position:0%
payoff is for that awesome idea nothing
 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
payoff is for that awesome idea nothing
like<00:06:21.110><c> nothing</c><00:06:21.319><c> really</c><00:06:21.740><c> it</c><00:06:22.069><c> is</c><00:06:22.189><c> clever</c>
