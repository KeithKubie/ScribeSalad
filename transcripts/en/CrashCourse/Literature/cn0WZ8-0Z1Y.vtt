Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and this is The Great Gatsby.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.880
This novel barely makes it to 200 pages
even with rather large print,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.700
and yet it's so magnificently complex and rich that
we can't possibly do it justice in two videos so
today we're gonna focus on a specific question:

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.880
Is Gatsby great?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.380
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! No.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.700
Oh, it's so cute when you think you're entitled
to your opinions, Me From The Past, even when
they're entirely uninformed opinions.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.540
As penance for being such a little Hemingway
about this stuff, you will one day have to host a
show about the glorious ambiguity of literature.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:40.460
[Theme Music]

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.699
So a while back we discussed the Aristotelian
tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, in which people

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.640
of high birth are brought low by weakness
of character. Shakespeare introduced some

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.179
ambiguity into that story arc as you'll remember:
There was bad luck involved in their demise,

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.019
and their mistakes, such as they were, weren't so
grievous as to render Romeo and Juliet unsympathetic.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.679
Also, as in many tragedies, Shakespeare used
heightened, poetic language to help us care

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.040
about Romeo and Juliet and root for them instead
of just holding them up as examples of what

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.170
terrible things befall you when you're naughty.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.220
Now obviously, Gatsby isn't a work of poetry,
but Fitzgerald found himself with similar

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.310
problems. As many a high schooler has pointed
out, the characters in The Great Gatsby aren't

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.290
terribly likeable, and the story just isn't
moving or compelling if you're reading about

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.810
a bunch of people you hate, some of whom get
what's coming to them and some of whom don't.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.640
Fitzgerald handles this problem by heightening
the language and giving it pace. I mean, you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.660
can basically tap your foot to The Great Gatsby
from the very first sentence: "In my younger

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.300
and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some
advice I've been turning over in my mind ever since."

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.580
It's got a beat and I can dance to it.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.140
And the descriptions are jarringly, magnificently
beautiful, too: Daisy's voice sounds full

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.860
of money; the fading glow on Jordan Baker's
face is "like children leaving a pleasant

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.780
street at dusk." At the end of the novel,
Nick imagines the first European explorers

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.910
of New York, writing, "For a transitory, enchanted
moment, man must have held his breath in the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.670
presence of this continent, compelled into
an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.620
nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with
something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.360
Putting aside the fact that Fitzgerald failed to foresee
that humans would one day walk on the moon,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.120
not to mention create fake fake flowers the descriptions here are lush and beautiful. So the language of the novel

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.600
elevates Gatsby's triumphs and
tragedies to the stuff of real epics,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.620
which gives Gatsby a kind of unironic greatness.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.010
Stan! Can we just decide if these are physical
digital flowers or digital digital flowers?

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.420
Remember, you don't have to be good to be
great. And as the critic Matthew J. Bruccoli

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.500
notes, Gatsby "is truly great by virtue of
his capacity to commit himself to his aspirations."

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.320
I mean we celebrate achievement born of hard
work and clarity of purpose because there's

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.789
a greatness in that success that you don't get by, like, lounging around and using your pool all the time.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.599
Remember, there's exactly one person at Gatsby's
parties who doesn't get drunk: Gatsby. I mean,

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.909
he's a bootlegger who doesn't drink, a swimming
pool owner who doesn't swim, a man of leisure

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.999
who never engages in a single leisure activity.
But as Bruccoli further points out, there's

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.430
plenty of irony in the titular description
of Gatsby as Great.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.010
"The adjective indicates the tawdry and exaggerated
aspects of his life: Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.769
Step right up and see the Great Gatsby!" I
mean, he's part magician, and- in a world

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.700
of wealth -- he's part carnival curiosity. Bruccoli
notes that Tom Buchanan describes Gatsby's

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.019
famous yellow car as "a circus wagon."

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.689
Okay let's go to the Thought Bubble. One thing
Gatsby has in common with Romeo and Juliet

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.079
is that they're all obsessed with controlling
time, which of course continues passing anyway.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.359
Like, Juliet tries to force night to come
quickly and dawn to stay away, because only

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.919
under cover of darkness can her marriage thrive.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.420
Similarly, Gatsby doesn't just want to marry
Daisy: He needs her to say that she never

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.889
loved Tom Buchanan at all, as if he can erase
the past 5 years. What they'll do about Daisy's

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.379
baby is a fascinating question that Gatsby
seems wholly uninterested in, but anyway,

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.239
Gatsby's dream is that he and Daisy will --
to quote Nick -- "go back to Louisville and

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.499
be married from her house -- just as if it were
five years ago."

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.769
Nick's perfectly sensible response to this
idea is, "You can't repeat the past." And

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.929
then Gatsby utters his most famous line: "Can't
repeat the past? Why of course you can."

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:09.180
And then he says, "I'm going to fix everything
just the way it was before." Romeo and Juliet

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.299
want to extend the present into forever because
they know their future is bleak; Gatsby believes

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.279
the key to the beautiful future is a perfect restoration
of the beautiful past. Thanks, Thought Bubble

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.440
Okay, a brief aside before we return to Gatsby's
questionably greatness: The idea of restoring

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.289
the past to create a beautiful future is or
course, not unique to Gatsby, which is why

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.520
no candidate for President can ever get through a
speech without mentioning some previous President,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.080
whose glorious leadership the current campaign intends to channel so as to make it morning in America again.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.539
It's also why Americans fight so much about
what the Founding Fathers would think of us,

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.190
when in fact, what they would think is probably
"You guys are dressed funny. Also, how come

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.280
this room is so bright without any windows?
Furthermore, why is this screen talking to me?"

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.800
Now of course this nostalgia isn't unique to the
United States, but you also have to remember

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.740
that Gatsby is the ultimate self-made man, having
both literally and figuratively made a name for himself.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.539
And this combination of aspirational impulses
and the urge to restore life to some immaculate

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.250
past does strike me as very American. That's
what makes the tragedy of Gatsby so much more

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.460
interesting and complicated than the Aristotelian
model of tragedy.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.389
Instead of being a person of high birth, Gatsby
is a person of low birth, albeit one born

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.789
into a world that claims not to care
about or even believe in such things.

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.849
And instead of experiencing a reversal of fortune
due to a weakness of character, Jay Gatsby -- well

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.580
that's were it gets complicated actually.
I mean Daisy Buchanan was driving the car,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.220
but Gatsby chose to take the fall for her.
But he is also doomed because he lives in

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.560
a social order that's happy to drink illegal
alcohol, but condemns a sober bootlegger.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.560
Oh, it's time for the Open Letter?

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.640
An Open Letter to Prohibition. But first let's
see what is the secret compartment today.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.979
Be booze, be booze, be booze. Yes! Touchdown.
It's mystery liquor.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.810
Alright the game is simple, I drink the mystery
liquor and try to guess what it is. [coughs]

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.750
Southern Comfort?... No? What is it? Jack
-- that's too easy, Meredith. Jack Daniels.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.420
Anybody could get Jack Daniels.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.840
Dear Prohibition,
You were crazy. I mean, for the rest of American

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.800
history, our Constitution is gonna be this
weird document that is perfectly normal until

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.879
the 18th Amendment, which suddenly bans alcohol,
and then the 21st Amendment which is suddenly

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.039
like, "No, no, no. Terrible idea!" It's almost like
legislating morality doesn't actually increase morality.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.820
But Prohibition, in you, Fitzgerald found
the perfect metaphor for American hypocrisy

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.500
and debauchery. We are not very good at tolerating
naughtiness in America, but we love being

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.520
naughty. In short Prohibition, you were a terrible
idea, but a fantastic metaphor, so thanks for that.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.960
Best Wishes, [coughs]
John Green.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.400
So is Gatsby doomed by his romanticization
of Daisy, by his refusal to accept that he

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.300
just wasn't born to be one of the gold-hatted
men of leisure, by his belief that any means

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.180
justifies -- if you'll pardon the pun -- Daisy's
end?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.419
Yes, yes, and yes. But more than that, the
great Gatsby lives in a cold world that cares

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.339
nothing for justice, a world that makes claims
to fairness but really only further rewards

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.100
those who have already been rewarded.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.039
I mean, who even survives this novel? Only
the idle rich: Jordan Baker, Daisy and Tom

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.590
Buchanan, Nick Carraway. They survive, and
they are allowed to go on being careless.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.610
As Nick writes, "They were careless people,
Tom and Daisy -- they smashed up things and

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.530
creatures and then retreated back into their
money or their vast carelessness."

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.699
They aren't cruel or malicious, they're just
careless -- they don't care too much about

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.400
Myrtle or Gatsby or their daughter or even
each other. To live without a care in the

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.629
world is supposed to be the dream, right?
Everyone wants a care-free life. But Fitzgerald

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:34.979
shows us the horror of this care-free life,
how Tom and Daisy's inability to care is in

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.939
some ways more monstrous than outright cruelty
would be.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.220
It's not like Romeo and Juliet, where the
lovers are sacrificed and then Verona is healed.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.860
Nothing is made whole by the tragedy of The
Great Gatsby.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.349
I think that's why some readers find the
novel depressing and hopeless, even amid all

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:50.289
the lush language and witty turns of phrase.

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:54.249
But I don't think it is hopeless. Remember
that line from the first chapter: "Gatsby

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:58.469
turned out all right in the end, it was what
preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in

00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:02.650
the wake of his dreams..." As individuals,
and as a collective, the tragedy isn't in

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.939
dreaming; it's in chasing an unworthy dream.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.020
So in the end, is Gatsby great? I'm interested
to read your comments, but here's my takeaway:

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.040
Jay Gatsby was a great man. But great people
especially must be careful about what they worship.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.120
Thanks for watching. I'll see you
next week.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.680
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Too far! Our script supervisor is

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.569
Meredith Danko. The associate producer is
Danica Johnson. The show is written by me.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.629
And our graphics team is Thought Bubble. Every
week, instead of cursing, I say the name of

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:29.729
a writer I like if you'd like to suggest writers.
you can do so in comments where you can also

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:32.990
ask questions about today;s video that will
be answered by our team of English Literature

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.909
experts. Thanks for watching Crash Course
and as we say in my hometown,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.449
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
