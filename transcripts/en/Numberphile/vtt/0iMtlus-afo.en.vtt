00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.589
So today we're going to talk about

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.360
Pascal's triangle. It's one of my

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.970
favorite things in math - particularly

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.080
because whenever I talk to other

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.000
mathematicians they always have some

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
interesting patterns they like talking

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.480
about. It's almost never the same one.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.940
So Pascal's triangle is sort of like an

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.830
addition triangle. So we start with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.080
the number one and every time I draw one

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.550
assume that everything around it is a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.769
bunch of zeros so what we do is we have

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.960
one and then we add whatever is to the left

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.060
of it - so it's neighbor here is 0 and we just

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.470
drop that down in between - then I do

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.609
the same thing on the right.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.590
Alright cool now I have two ones in this row

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.790
and I'll do the same thing so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.860
there's a 0 we can imagine here so we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.760
drop that down.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.230
There's one in this neighbor now so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.420
we can have a two and then there's one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.399
and the zero to its right we make another one.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.410
And we just keep doing this for a while

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.989
and you can see that the triangle just

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.820
keeps getting bigger this is nothing

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.260
that's gonna stop. So we can just keep

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.879
doing this for as long as we want and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.320
for me as long as I want is when the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.760
first double-digit number shows up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.289
because that's when adding gets hard.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.199
So Pascal was also a combinatorist so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.120
in particular like problems where "If I have

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.890
N things and I want to choose K of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.359
them, how many different ways can I do

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.610
that?" And it turns out that Pascal's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.040
triangle is really like "childlike adding

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.369
game" as seems to be actually encodes N

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.390
choose K. So if I have N things -

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.369
in particular let's say i have four things

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.350
and I want to choose let's say one of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.570
them then I go to the fourth row I move

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.280
over one and that's how many ways I can

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.259
do it four ways. I if I have four things

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.930
let's say I have like four circles and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.820
I want to only choose one of them - there are

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.200
four ways i can do that right. I can

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.189
choose this one, I can choose that one

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.530
I can choose that one, I can choose that one

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.299
And it turns out Pascal's triangle says if I go down to the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.400
fourth row and - where it like this is the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.130
0th row - and I choose one thing so I move

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.750
one over then that's exactly how many

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.710
ways I can do it.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.689
(Brady Haran) So if i told you to choose two circles-

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.329
Then there are six ways to do it.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.579
You notice that the sides are always ones

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.530
Like, this isn't going to change because

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.170
we just keep doing 1+0 and then oh, look

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.479
1 + 0,  1 plus 0. And this is just gonna keep

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.270
happening so we can define this entire

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
diagonal as "+0" because every time I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.250
go down 1 i'm not changing anything

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.770
But then we get to this row right and we have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.100
one plus one plus one plus one because

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.550
I have 0 1 2 3 4 5 so i can define this row

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
I felt like it as "+1" then this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.690
pattern looks less fun right. I have One, a Three

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.610
But the difference between three and one

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.260
is 2. The difference between six and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.670
three is three the difference between

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.760
10 and 6 is 4 so it turns out this pattern is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.440
+ 1 + 2 + 3 keeps going. So around here

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.940
One may be tempted to look for more

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.040
patterns like right here is like plus

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.709
what three plus six but that's when you

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.760
start to notice what we've been doing

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.200
all along which was just adding the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.850
number to the top-left like Pascal

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.320
wanted us to anyway. Let's just look at

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.700
something else one that might be tempted to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.170
do when they see a bunch of numbers and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.100
that's add them in a different way.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.720
So this is 1. One plus 1 is 2. One plus 2 plus 1 is 4.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.620
One plus 3 is 4 plus 3 is 7 plus 1 is 8.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.940
You'll notice that some point I just stopped adding

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.140
because we can actually rewrite everything over here as

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.660
the powers of 2. So the sum of the rows of

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.120
Pascal's triangle is two -  like if I'm on

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.660
the Nth row and I call the first one row zero then

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.450
the sum of that row is 2 to the N.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.880
Let's just read these as numbers let's not add

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.620
them let's not treat them as anything else

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.830
So the first row is 1 the next row is 11

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.780
The next row is a hundred and twenty one. The next row is thirteen thrity-one. Then  we get

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.740
Then we get fourteen six-four-one

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.360
And then we get to this

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.280
*laughs*

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.380
So ,right now these are actually the powers of 11 too

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.520
So this next row looks pretty frightening

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.220
because if I wrote it out just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.240
as it is, I get a pretty big number right

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.500
like once I put in these commas,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.740
this is around 15 million

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.100
(brady) That's not 11 to the 5

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.200
It's not. But it turns out Pascal

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.280
you know his triangle doesn't quit that early

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.900
so what's happening here is that

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.000
when I was writing these as digits

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.310
before, I was actually considering that

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.110
place value right - like the ones place

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.329
the tens place the hundreds place

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.020
So I'm just going to do the same thing where I rewrite these numbers

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.380
as ones and tens and hundreds place

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.340
So the first one will be one times 10 to the 0

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.160
because this is the 0th row

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.870
Then we have 1 times 10 to the 1 plus 1

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.280
times 10 to the 0 (1x10^1+1x10^0)

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.240
so this one's 1 this one's 11.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.220
Uh, let's do 1 times 10 squared plus 1 times

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.160
te- oh 2 times 10 to the one my bad - plus 1

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.360
times 10 to 0. That"s a hundred twenty-one

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.320
So let's let's skip on down to our friend here

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.620
We do 1 times 10 to the 5 Plus 5 10

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:59.920
to the 4 plus 10 10 to the 3 plus 10(10) squared? - yeah

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.460
5 to the 10 to the 1 and 1 times 10 to the 0

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.163
and this is 11 to the 5

00:05:08.163 --> 00:05:09.690
(Brady) So it is 11^5

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.909
It is 11^5, it's just hiding

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.490
So now I have this really cool thing

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.349
that I found extremely recently called

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.090
um, the hockey sticks method i think

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.889
some people call it. It's just a really

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.560
cool trick that you can do on Pascal's

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.570
triangle another result of the fact that

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.200
it's the coefficients of like a binomial

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.840
expansion which is all of  - it will make

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.760
more sense once I draw hockey stick

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.920
What you do is you pick a one somewhere on the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.810
edge and you just go down diagonally so

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.360
i'm going to pick this one and then i'm

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.830
going to go down diagonally and then I'm just

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.330
gonna keep going and then at some point

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.520
I'm just gonna veer off in this case I have to

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.139
veer off because I didn't draw any more

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.830
rows. So the number that I veer off to

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.530
is the sum of all the numbers I traced down

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.780
1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 equals 10

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.240
So this row - or this diagonal rather - equals 10

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.040
So I'm gonna start with this one

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.000
and it's gonna be awful real quickly

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.380
actually I'm just gonna all right to

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.380
work on small ones. Uh, let's use this one

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.360
Because... why not. We can do the other direction, right

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.800
and we get 1 plus two plus three equals 6

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.860
I'm gonna do Pascal's triangle mod 2

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.759
So, brief aside - mod 2 in this case is just

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.020
going to mean that every time a number

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.060
is odd I write it as a one and every

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.160
time a number is even I write it as a zero

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.720
(Brady) Cool

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.280
cool right

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.580
(Brady) That's still a Pascal Triangle, is that?

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.340
Yeah, just mod two. It doesn't like

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.259
preserve the actual value of the numbers

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:44.860
as much, but it totally tells you whether

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.050
or not something is even or odd and that's

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.219
all we care about right now.

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.860
So then I'm going to outline all of the

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.469
diagonals that are all ones and all the

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:53.700
rows are all ones

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.240
So i'm going to do this - which isn't the world's prettiest

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.780
thing but it's pretty nice

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.900
and this shape should maybe start to

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.520
look a little familiar if you played  - I dunno -

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.420
legend of zelda before. It's th-also the Triforce

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.703
but more importantly it's sierpinski's triangle

00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:24.210
so for those who don't recognize sierpinski's triangle

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.389
I start with an equilateral triangle

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.780
I inscribe another one upside down and

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.400
then i can just keep doing this on all

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.970
of the upward facing triangles as many

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.289
times as I want

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.420
so yeah that's can just go on for a long time

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.740
(Brady) Cool, yeah?

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.080
And it turns out that the

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.210
way that the evens and odds show up

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.250
in Pascal's triangle when I convert them

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.440
to mod 2, I can make Pascal triangle as

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.940
big as I want and I'm just going to keep

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.800
getting iterations of sierpinski's triangle

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.760
so that's really cool

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.260
(Brady) That's awesome!

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.120
That's really cool by itself but it gets cooler using the mod 2  construction

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.280
There's something else we can do in mod two though

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.699
Um, in particular we can write down the same

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:10.540
things but let's write them now as - we've got ones and zeroes, right?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.160
And for most people ones and zeros kinda remind them of binary

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.440
So, let's just see what happens when we transcribe these from binary

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.580
You know one binary - 1 and then 11 in binary is 3

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.039
101 is 5

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:32.849
111 is 15 and then the next one, 10001 is 17

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:37.140
Now these may not immediately appear pretty cool

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.140
but if I kept going the next one is 51

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.060
The next one is 85

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.700
After that is 255 and here I'm gonna stop and I'm

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.500
going to look at what these numbers are

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.080
three is prime

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.422
Five is prime

00:08:52.422 --> 00:08:53.970
15 is 5 times 3

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.320
17 is prime

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.880
51 is 17 times 3

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.880
85 is 17 x 5

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.400
And 255 is 17 x 15

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.160
So you'll notice that every time I get a prime i go back and

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.390
just multiply by all the things that came before it

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.135
and I can generate the next you know n minus 1 entries

00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:20.730
So the primes that we have here actually at least the ones

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:26.040
that I'm - that we're certain of - are actually Fermat (pronounced fer-mat) primes

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.776
Or Fermat (pronounced fer-mot) primes rather

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.600
Which means that they can be written of the form 2 to the 2 to the n plus 1

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.720
Somehow every time I talk to a mathematician-

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.670
even 10 minutes ago when i asked a different mathematician for an idea

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.820
he told me something I've never heard before

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.600
So even if maybe somewhere out in the world all of the things you could

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.460
do with this triangle are done

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.140
I don't know if there's any one person

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.630
who knows them all and maybe there's

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.100
only one person who knows one of them

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.410
and we just have to keep exploring the

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.850
triangle and seeing if we can

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.740
collaboratively explain everything

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.360
inside of it but it's an infinite

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.980
triangle right so maybe there are things

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.320
on the hundredth line down that we

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.480
haven't explored yet

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.490
I feel like it wouldn't be a numberphile video if somehow

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.140
the Fibonacci sequence didn't show up

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.260
So i'm going to show you where the Fibonacci sequence is in the Pascal's triangle because...

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.900
this is a numberphile video

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.050
yeah so what we're going to do is we're

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.220
gonna add up the shallow diagonals

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.800
So what that means here is the triangle kind of

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.430
inscribed diagonals already right like I

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.600
could look at this one and just kind of

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.450
follow this but a shallow diagonal means that

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.950
i'm going to kind of go off at a

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.350
slightly higher angle that I would have

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.180
if I was just following the way I drew

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.400
the triangle so for example the first

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.100
Fibonacci number is one so that's my shallow diagonal

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.980
And then this one doesn't have any other shallow neighbors

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.860
so it's just by itself also

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.480
So now we have one,one.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.400
So this shallow diagonal is a one and then this one

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.160
So we do this and you get 2

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.920
Then we do this one with this two - we get three

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.940
We do this one with this 3 with this one we get five

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.520
And you know how this game goes

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.360
So we have 1,4 and three here so we're going to get eight

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.640
We get- I'm  goina do one more in case you don't believe me

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.780
We're going to do five plus six plus one and this one down here that I didn't add yet

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.740
And we get 13

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.940
(Brady) Cool

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:43.280
So there you have it - the two biggest recurrence relations in math that involve addition probably

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.892
um tied together in the Triangle

00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:49.670
They're not unique things you know you can have one

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.020
and it encodes the other and it's all

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.220
just related in really beautiful ways

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.260
it's so beautiful you know, this triangle has all

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.940
of these really cool properties about it

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.890
and again like you said earlier it feels

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.450
like it's really childlike thing right

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.310
like I just you know add the things next

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.740
to me and I just plop them down under but

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.240
I've been playing with this triangle

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.380
since... I want to say 8th or 9th grade and

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.270
I learned half of these things in the

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.340
past month and there are still other

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.780
things that I could ramble on about

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.640
about this triangle and this isn't even

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.770
my field like I'm still an undergraduate

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.180
I didn't even study this triangle

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.970
professionally so just imagine what

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.440
people know about the triangle that I

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.090
don't even know that they don't even

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.610
know amongst themselves like it's

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.120
amazing
