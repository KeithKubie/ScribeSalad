00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.720
Google is so all encompassing,
right?
You have g-mail,

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.790
you have android.
I mean that that is,

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.870
they are the number one operating system for mobile phones in the world on top

4
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:16.630
of being a search engine.
There's so much involved in that company.

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.350
And again,
like almost all tech companies,

6
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.540
they heavily lean left and they be,

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.060
because they had that don't be evil as a part of their code of conduct.

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.390
It seemed like something that was a good idea to have and it sort of defined

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.930
what I was talking about that tech companies are uniquely progressive.

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.740
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
I,
I don't know.
I don't know what makes that,
um,</v>

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.880
I think,
um,
no matter what,
like we,

12
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
the Internet allows for a very healthy skepticism of nearly everything.

13
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.770
Yeah.
Um,
I'm from,
I'm from Missouri.
It's the show me state.
Are you ready?

14
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
Yeah.
I'm from Saint Louis,
Missouri.
We're all skeptics.
My mom was a democrat.

15
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.420
My Dad was a republican.

16
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.900
My Dad listened to rush Limbaugh and Hannity all the time.

17
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:14.660
I found myself somewhere in the middle.
But one of the things I appreciated,

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.670
we had a ton of fights and arguments and yelling matches around the kitchen

19
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:25.010
table.
But like I appreciate the fact that we could have them,
and I did.

20
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.500
I felt safe to do so.
And I didn't feel like,

21
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.330
I mean obviously they're my parents,

22
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.570
but they weren't judging me because of what I said.

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.480
And they didn't force you to be a republican or a democrat.

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.270
He didn't force me to,
to,
to think a particular way.
And I'm like,
I,

25
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.430
I think they were good,

26
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:45.960
at least showing different perspectives even in this,

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.560
in this union that they have.
And I dunno,

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.960
it developed,
it developed a skepticism in me that I,

29
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.210
that I think is,
is healthy.

30
00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:02.211
And I have a lot of skepticism of companies like ours and leaders like me.

31
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:08.790
I think that's right.
I think that's right.
And people should,
and we,
I mean,

32
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.980
I was,
I was,

33
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.220
I was formed through a lot of the ideals that they did and I just fell in love

34
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:22.440
with what it made possible.
And I,
I,
I never,

35
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:27.180
ever want to run a foul of,
of those ideals and,

36
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:29.070
and,
you know,
the,
the,

37
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:34.071
the removal of barriers and boundaries and the connection that we have because

38
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:38.110
of it.
And I,
you know,

39
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.550
I think often and reflect often about my role in the centralization of my role

40
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.180
in our company.
And I,
I wanna,

41
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.210
I wanna figure out and help figure out like how we can continue to add massive

42
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:57.760
value and,
and be an amazing business,
which is,

43
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.040
is us and always be us,

44
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:04.630
but at the same time be a participant,

45
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.990
participatory force in this greater good that the Internet has really started.

46
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.370
And it,
it's not,
it's not led by any one individual or anyone company.

47
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:17.350
And that's the beauty of it.
And I want to,

48
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:22.240
I want to make sure that we find our place in that and we can also contribute

49
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:25.480
massively to an,
I think we can,
it's just going to take a lot of work,

50
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.270
a lot of introspection and a lot of experimentation,

51
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.960
a lot of making mistakes and failures too.
Well,

52
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.880
<v 0>and it's very encouraging that you have that attitude because uh,
you know,</v>

53
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.881
a lot of people I think in a similar situation would try to control the

54
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.724
narrative.

55
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.830
They would try to reinforce their own particular perspective on things and try

56
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.460
to get other people to adopt it or try to push it.
And I think it is,

57
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.590
it's very important to just have this open discussion and,

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.530
and I think it's very important to review your own thoughts and ideas and all of

59
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:01.480
the best ways to do so.
Put it out,
put it out there,

60
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.400
<v 1>put it out there and have other people review.
Peer Review is a great process.</v>

61
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.930
And Dad's floors,

62
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.740
<v 0>the way this podcast has evolved more than probably anything.</v>

63
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.820
<v 1>Yeah.
Oh,
that's the thing.
I mean you,
you,</v>

64
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:16.480
you did this because you want to learn from people and,
and the,

65
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.320
the platform that you've created,
millions get to learn from it as well.

66
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.360
And that's just so amazing.
Like I,
I learned from your podcast all the time.
And,

67
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.170
and
that's what technology makes possible.

68
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.370
But with that power also comes ramifications.

69
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:37.000
And if we're not talking about the ramifications and like at least being open

70
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.460
about what we know and what we don't know.
And I,
I think we're,

71
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.880
I think we state and post a lot more of what we know rather than what we don't

72
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:49.030
know.
And that is so interesting.
Why don't you guys steal?
Don't be evil.

73
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.300
Put that in your own shit.
Fuck you.

74
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.830
I don't know if that's going to help anything,

75
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.650
then what does that tell our employees that do?
It's real simple.
Don't be a dick.

76
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.060
Yeah.
I mean like how do,
how do we,
how do we get deeper and just like,
you know,

77
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.830
seeing more conversation around what is quote unquote evil.
