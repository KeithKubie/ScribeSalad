that's kind of a common human attribute

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480
that's kind of a common human attribute
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.640
that's kind of a common human attribute
which is that if you don't know about

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
which is that if you don't know about
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.990
which is that if you don't know about
something you don't take it seriously

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000
something you don't take it seriously
 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.940
something you don't take it seriously
right and it's because if you don't know

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950
right and it's because if you don't know
 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.610
right and it's because if you don't know
about it well it's just gray and fuzzy

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
about it well it's just gray and fuzzy
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.040
about it well it's just gray and fuzzy
right to you you have no differentiated

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050
right to you you have no differentiated
 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.690
right to you you have no differentiated
knowledge so it's easy to oversimplify

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
knowledge so it's easy to oversimplify
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.730
knowledge so it's easy to oversimplify
it
