00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.496
A very simply little
demonstration.

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.901
And I would like you to take a
look at the two materials that

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.250
are in the two vials I have
here.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.215
One of these that I am taping
is a beige-colored solid,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.372
and it is iron dichloride,
ferrous chloride.

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:35.043
And then over here,
I have an organic molecule that

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.805
is colorless,
just white.

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:40.916
And what I am going to do is
first make a solution of the

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.000
ferrous chloride in water.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.472
I am just using a very small
amount.

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:55.782
And what you will see is that
the FeCl two dissolves

00:00:55.782 --> 00:00:59.597
up pretty nicely in water,
and it gives a solution that

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:04.619
has very little color to it.
You might be able to see that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.593
it looks maybe pale yellow.
Can you see that?

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:11.483
Okay.
To that solution of ferrous

00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:15.458
chloride in water,
I am now going to add this

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.522
organic molecule.
I will draw the molecule for

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:24.490
you before we finish today.
And I am just going to add a

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.000
small amount of this colorless
organic molecule --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.300
-- to get a very nice intense
red color in the aqueous

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.300
solution.
And the person I am going to be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.300
talking about today is the one
who really figured out what is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.500
going on in a reaction like
that.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.900
And this was a great mystery
for a long period of time,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.000
until Alfred Werner came along.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.105
I would encourage you while you
are at home, perhaps,

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:24.578
or visiting friends over this
coming weekend,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:29.078
to go onto the Internet and go
to the Nobel Prize website,

00:02:29.078 --> 00:02:33.657
where you can read a very nice
short bibliography of Alfred

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:38.000
Werner, because he won the Nobel
Prize in 1913.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.526
And he won this prize based on
a theory that he developed

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:55.052
stemming from observations he
made regarding reactions of

00:02:55.052 --> 00:02:59.000
metal salts with various
substances.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.800
And I am going to point out
initially, here,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.832
that he studied the reaction of
cobalt three chloride.

00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:16.860
I just used iron dichloride.
This is cobalt trichloride

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.000
reacting with six equivalents of
ammonia.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.021
And he observed that if to
aqueous solution of cobalt

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:37.718
trichloride was added six
equivalence of NH three,

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:45.416
ammonia, followed by silver
nitrate, that that resulted in

00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:52.167
no AgCl precipitate.
And that is rather astounding.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:55.678
Sorry.
We will get to "no,"

00:03:55.678 --> 00:04:01.993
but this one is "all."
How does he do this experiment?

00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:05.722
He just puts these things in
solution, adds silver nitrate,

00:04:05.722 --> 00:04:09.645
and either there is or is not a
precipitative silver chloride,

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:12.924
which is very insoluble.
And that precipitate can be

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:16.011
collected by filtration,
dried, and then weighed.

00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:19.161
And then, in comparison with
the mass of the added

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:22.955
substances, you would know how
much of the chloride that was

00:04:22.955 --> 00:04:26.685
put into the reaction actually
came out as insoluble silver

00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:31.820
chloride precipitate.
And he did a series of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.564
experiments.
And so, if he uses cobalt

00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:43.615
trichloride and less ammonia,
namely five equivalents of

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:51.564
ammonia, then he finds that that
leads instead to two-thirds of

00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:59.000
the possible AgCl precipitate.
And continuing down.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.038
If he uses now only four
equivalence of ammonia,

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:17.232
then the addition of silver
nitrate provides one-third of

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:23.270
the possible of the total
precipitated chloride.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.437
And then, finally,
if he drops down the number of

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:35.732
equivalents of ammonia to three,
then we get none,

00:05:35.732 --> 00:05:43.313
zero of the AgCl precipitating.
And a further observation,

00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:46.250
to add to these four
observations,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.610
was that in no case,
here, did the solution give a

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.860
reaction with hydrogen chloride.
What is the significance of

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.906
that?
Hydrogen chloride,

00:05:57.906 --> 00:06:02.000
of course, is a strong Bronsted
acid.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.097
And, if you have a base in
solution, it should react with

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:09.536
that Bronsted acid.
And what are we adding here?

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.756
We are adding ammonia.
And ammonia is a base,

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:15.609
isn't it?
But when you do the experiment

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:19.634
like this and then test for any
reactivity with hydrogen

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:23.658
chloride, there is no reactivity
with hydrogen chloride.

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:27.335
So what is going on?
And, secondly,

00:06:27.335 --> 00:06:32.389
normally, this reaction with
silver nitrate is used to

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.061
quantitatively precipitate
chloride from solution.

00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:42.211
So it is a quantitative
analytical test for chloride in

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:45.739
solution.
And the less ammonia we add,

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:51.079
the less silver chloride we are
getting as a precipitate.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:56.610
How are these facts related?
Well, Alfred Werner put it all

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.000
together, and he correctly
formulated these complexes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Let me write this as follows.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.311
In that first instance,
when we have added six

00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:37.964
ammonias, Werner decided that
the reason that ammonia is not

00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:43.712
in solution in a form that is
reactive with hydrogen chloride

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:48.502
is because the ammonia is
coordinated to the metal.

00:07:48.502 --> 00:07:51.952
And so he wrote the formula
this way.

00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:57.413
Cobalt NH three six times.
And this species

00:07:57.413 --> 00:08:01.995
is a trication.
And to balance those three

00:08:01.995 --> 00:08:05.294
positive charges,
we find that there must be

00:08:05.294 --> 00:08:09.821
three chloride ions outside of
what we are going to call the

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:13.428
inner coordination sphere of the
cobalt complex.

00:08:13.428 --> 00:08:17.571
Now, there were lots of
different preparations that had

00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:22.252
been reported in the literature
back at this time of materials

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:26.319
that seem to be composed of
metal ions and mixtures of

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:31.000
chloride or ammonia or other
types of molecules.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.081
And this kind of a formulation
of them was completely unique.

00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:40.401
And I really think that in the
history of chemistry,

00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:45.398
you can compare Alfred Werner's
leap, his development of the

00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:49.887
coordination theory as very much
analogous to Kekule's

00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:54.715
description of planar benzene
with all equivalent C-C bond

00:08:54.715 --> 00:08:57.849
distances.
This is really a tremendous

00:08:57.849 --> 00:09:02.000
leap in our thinking about
molecules.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.531
And then, in the case where he
is adding five equivalents of

00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:12.593
ammonia, those five equivalents
all go onto the cobalt,

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:17.656
and so does one chloride ion.
So he writes it that way.

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:22.343
And that chloride ion is
balancing one of the three

00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:26.562
positive charges on the cobalt
plus three ion.

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:30.593
So this overall,
now, has a two plus charge,

00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:35.937
and there are two chlorides
external to balance the charge

00:09:35.937 --> 00:09:40.480
on that.
And then in case three,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.735
we have added four NH three
per cobalt to solution.

00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:52.774
Four of them go on the metal
and two chlorides remain and

00:09:52.774 --> 00:10:00.000
interact with the metal in a way
that we will discuss shortly.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.710
And that system now has two of
the plus three charges on cobalt

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.328
three balanced by chlorides that
are in the inner coordination

00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:14.460
sphere.
And only a single chloride,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.526
now, is needed externally to
balance that charge to give

00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:23.486
overall a neutral system.
And then, finally,

00:10:23.486 --> 00:10:29.013
when only three equivalents of
ammonia are added to solution,

00:10:29.013 --> 00:10:35.000
those three equivalents per
cobalt bind to the metal.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.732
And all three of the original
chlorides can be included in the

00:10:39.732 --> 00:10:44.077
primary coordination sphere,
balancing the three positive

00:10:44.077 --> 00:10:48.655
charges on the cobalt three ion
and giving overall a neutral

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:53.000
coordination complex.
This is coordination theory.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.257
And the dominance of organic
chemistry at that point in time

00:11:06.257 --> 00:11:09.288
was very great.
Most of the people who were

00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:13.402
thinking about these unusual
substances were thinking that

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:17.515
they might have structures
analogous to those that organic

00:11:17.515 --> 00:11:20.257
molecules have.
And typical hydrocarbon

00:11:20.257 --> 00:11:24.443
molecules like n-pentane or
n-hexane have sequential joined

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:28.268
CH two groups,
repeating CH two groups

00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:32.038
in a line.
And so the type of formula that

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:36.246
you were seeing people write for
these molecules at that point in

00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:38.284
time was, for example,
a cobalt.

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:40.717
And then NH three,
NH three, NH three,

00:11:40.717 --> 00:11:43.610
NH three, somehow all stuck

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.687
together in a way that does not
seem very intuitive to us today

00:11:47.687 --> 00:11:50.975
because we know so much more
now, partly due to the

00:11:50.975 --> 00:11:54.000
accomplishments of Alfred
Werner.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.602
This systematic set of
observations,

00:11:56.602 --> 00:12:00.617
the use of silver chloride's
insolubility as a means of

00:12:00.617 --> 00:12:04.855
precipitating it out so that you
could distinguish between

00:12:04.855 --> 00:12:08.869
external chloride from chloride
that is actually in the

00:12:08.869 --> 00:12:12.661
coordination complex.
And let me define coordination

00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:14.000
complex.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The coordination complex is a
metal ion.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Plus its ligands.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.824
So there is another word that
you need to learn in this

00:12:51.824 --> 00:12:55.041
context.
Here, I would like to define

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:58.704
the term ligand as an atom,
or a molecule,

00:12:58.704 --> 00:13:03.618
or an ion, that can bind
directly to a metal like cobalt

00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:06.656
in its primary coordination
sphere.

00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:13.000
And that means that they are
directly connected to the metal.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.055
And the amazing thing here and
what was so different from

00:13:18.055 --> 00:13:23.652
organic chemistry at this time
was the idea that a single metal

00:13:23.652 --> 00:13:27.715
ion can have a fairly large
number of ligands.

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:32.680
In this particular case,
Werner analyzed his experiments

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.465
with the assumption of
coordination number being equal

00:13:37.465 --> 00:13:39.000
to six.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.481
So here, it is six.
But coordination number is a

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:55.851
variable that depends on the
metal itself and depends on the

00:13:55.851 --> 00:14:00.148
specific choice of the ligands.
Some molecules are known in

00:14:00.148 --> 00:14:04.000
which there are very low
coordination numbers.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.665
A coordination number can be as
small as two or one in some very

00:14:09.665 --> 00:14:13.352
special instances for insoluble
molecules.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:18.388
And for very large metal ions,
sometimes the coordination

00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:21.446
number can be as great as about
12.

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:26.212
So 12 atoms or ions or
molecules directly connected to

00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:31.795
a central metal atom.
And ligands don't have to be as

00:14:31.795 --> 00:14:37.024
simple as chloride or ammonia.
Ligands can have some pretty

00:14:37.024 --> 00:14:41.983
interesting architectures.
And you can even dream up new

00:14:41.983 --> 00:14:47.303
ligands with which to decorate a
metal ion and with which to

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:52.713
imbue it with special properties
for purposes like catalysis.

00:14:52.713 --> 00:14:56.590
We will be talking soon about
metaloenzymes.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:02.000
These are proteins as ligands
to metal complexes.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.873
And very many important enzymes
are metaloenzymes that have

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:13.949
these elements from the 3D part
of the periodic table bonded.

00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:18.000
Here is what we call the
d-block, --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
-- or transition elements.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.327
And, in the case of the 3D
series, you will know that we

00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:41.686
have metals like titanium,
vanadium, chromium,

00:15:41.686 --> 00:15:44.689
manganese, iron,
cobalt, nickel.

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:50.210
These are called transition
elements because oftentimes in

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:55.635
ions stemming from these
elements, as you go from left to

00:15:55.635 --> 00:16:01.544
right across the periodic table,
you are adding more electrons

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:06.000
to an incompletely filled
d-shell.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.614
And at the end today,
we are going to talk a little

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:13.590
bit about the bonding properties
of transition elements.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.855
And that will hearken back to
what I said with my discussion

00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:20.819
of carbon monoxide and why it is
a poison.

00:16:20.819 --> 00:16:24.289
And it is the interaction,
actually, with certain

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:28.409
d-orbitals on the iron in
hemoglobin that makes CO a toxic

00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:32.938
substance.
And so how does this work?

00:16:32.938 --> 00:16:37.006
How do ligands coordinate two
metals?

00:16:37.006 --> 00:16:43.900
Well, one simple way is if you
have a ligand like ammonia that

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:50.342
is a base, it can also be a
nucleophile, and the metal can

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:54.071
be the corresponding
electrophile.

00:16:54.071 --> 00:17:00.739
I can draw that to represent a
lone pair of electrons on the

00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:04.500
nitrogen.
Now that we have studied

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.875
molecular orbital theory,
you will know that I can also

00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:11.437
call this the highest occupied
molecular orbital of the NH

00:17:11.437 --> 00:17:14.687
three molecule.
And it is the one responsible

00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:18.625
for the basicity of the ammonia
molecule and the one responsible

00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:21.812
for its ability to serve as a
ligand in coordination

00:17:21.812 --> 00:17:25.125
complexes, like these.
And you might also suspect that

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:28.625
we might have some contributions
to this highest occupied

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:33.000
molecular orbital from hydrogen
1s linear combinations.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.702
I will just draw that in to
make it a little bit more

00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:41.138
accurate.
And so, you can think of this

00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:46.382
as a big fat lone pair that will
coordinate to Lewis acids.

00:17:46.382 --> 00:17:50.000
And the metal ion is a Lewis
acid.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.169
But it is a very interesting
Lewis acid because,

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:11.403
unlike the BH three
molecule that has a single empty

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:16.903
orbital, this metal seems to be
able to act as a Lewis acid six

00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:21.427
times and coordinate six bases
to it in forming this

00:18:21.427 --> 00:18:26.361
coordination complex.
And if we go ahead and

00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:32.696
crystallize molecules of this
sort and use X-ray diffraction

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:38.815
studies to determine the bond
angles and bond distances in

00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:43.539
systems like this,
what we would find is that

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:49.230
these nitrogens are located at
the vertices of a nice,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.276
regular octahedron.
So, in the case of our first

00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:59.000
one, we can draw it out this
way.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.344
This first one is what would
result if, to that aqueous

00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:08.252
solution of cobalt trichloride,
we were to add six equivalents

00:19:08.252 --> 00:19:11.551
of ammonia.
This is Werner's first system.

00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:14.367
It is a molecule oriented like
this.

00:19:14.367 --> 00:19:19.195
That lone pair that comes from
the highest occupied molecular

00:19:19.195 --> 00:19:24.103
orbital of ammonia is directed
right at the metal from each of

00:19:24.103 --> 00:19:29.506
the six ammonia ligands.
And this system does have a

00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:34.705
three plus charge that is
balanced by three chloride ions

00:19:34.705 --> 00:19:38.604
in solution.
This locating of six nitrogens

00:19:38.604 --> 00:19:42.968
in an array in space that
approximates a regular

00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:48.538
octahedron is what makes the
octahedron such a central aspect

00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:52.716
of the theory of transition
element chemistry.

00:19:52.716 --> 00:19:58.472
And, if you are going to design
molecules that do include these

00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:02.000
transition metal ions,
--

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.324
-- whether you are going to do
it for their color,

00:20:05.324 --> 00:20:09.530
like the red color there of the
iron complex that we made a few

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.805
moments ago, or whether you are
going to do it to take advantage

00:20:13.805 --> 00:20:17.604
of the properties associated
with unpaired electrons like

00:20:17.604 --> 00:20:20.793
magnetism, for example,
you would begin any such

00:20:20.793 --> 00:20:25.000
approach with the octahedron as
your starting point.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.655
Let's go ahead and consider
some of the other examples

00:20:41.655 --> 00:20:44.000
provided to us by Alfred Werner.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.074
If instead of six,
we are adding only five NH

00:20:53.074 --> 00:20:56.777
three molecules for
every cobalt,

00:20:56.777 --> 00:20:59.000
then what happens --

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.822
-- is indeed we do get an
octahedron, but one of the

00:21:07.822 --> 00:21:11.718
chlorides is not ionized.
It is bound directly to the

00:21:11.718 --> 00:21:14.416
metal, and it is serving as a
ligand.

00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:17.564
And this species,
therefore, has a two plus

00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:19.812
charge.
The cobalt ion is still

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:23.934
considered here to be in the
plus three oxidation state.

00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:28.131
And this system is balanced by
two chloride ions that are

00:21:28.131 --> 00:21:32.702
floating around externally in
solution and that are not in the

00:21:32.702 --> 00:21:39.202
primary coordination sphere.
These atoms here that are part

00:21:39.202 --> 00:21:45.713
of ammonia molecules that are
bonded directly to the metal are

00:21:45.713 --> 00:21:49.129
in the inner coordination
sphere.

00:21:49.129 --> 00:21:55.000
That is, the inner or primary
coordination sphere.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.554
What do you think happens if
you take a metal salt and

00:22:12.554 --> 00:22:16.765
dissolve it in water?
I did that a moment ago with

00:22:16.765 --> 00:22:20.289
ferrous chloride.
I dissolved it in water.

00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:25.273
Water is a very polar solvent.
It promotes the formation of

00:22:25.273 --> 00:22:30.000
ions in solution because of its
great polarity.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.040
It is good at solvating ions,
water is, as a medium.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.784
If I take FeCl two
and add it to water,

00:22:39.784 --> 00:22:43.441
as I did a moment ago,
and it ionizes,

00:22:43.441 --> 00:22:47.000
what is happening to the iron?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.349
The iron is going to take up
water molecules into its inner

00:22:58.349 --> 00:23:02.166
coordination sphere.
When you dissolve FeCl two

00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:06.333
in solution,
which might often be written

00:23:06.333 --> 00:23:10.250
quite simply as FeCl 
two aqueous,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.750
what you really have in
solution is the system in which

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.000
six water molecules are bonded
to that iron.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.192
And, because I used FeCl two,
this system had a two

00:23:30.192 --> 00:23:33.895
plus charged balanced by two of
the chloride ions that

00:23:33.895 --> 00:23:38.017
dissociate from the iron and
ionize and go out into solution

00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:42.000
to be solvated separately from
the cation by water.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.437
That initial weakly-colored
solution contained iron in this

00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:49.726
form, hexaaquairon two.

00:23:49.726 --> 00:23:54.087
And I will tell you a little
bit about what made the color

00:23:54.087 --> 00:23:56.000
change in a moment.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.385
But first I would like to
discuss an issue that arises in

00:24:10.385 --> 00:24:15.403
the Werner system.
And this is the problem of

00:24:15.403 --> 00:24:17.000
isomerism.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.782
Werner found that you could
make different cobalt complexes

00:24:27.782 --> 00:24:30.456
that would have the same
chemical formula,

00:24:30.456 --> 00:24:33.521
but, for example,
one would be red and one would

00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:36.456
be green, or one would be
yellow, for example,

00:24:36.456 --> 00:24:39.521
even though they have the same
chemical formula.

00:24:39.521 --> 00:24:42.521
And that was because,
as he correctly reasoned,

00:24:42.521 --> 00:24:45.000
they were forming isomers.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.195
And this comes into play,
for example,

00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:58.525
when you add only four
equivalents of ammonia to

00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:01.387
solution.
And here is why.

00:25:01.387 --> 00:25:06.416
If I put the first chloride up
on top, as I have done here,

00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:11.618
there are two choices of where
to put the second one that are

00:25:11.618 --> 00:25:15.086
not the same.
I can either put a chloride

00:25:15.086 --> 00:25:20.375
here, such that we have a bond
angle of 90 degrees between the

00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:23.497
two chlorides.
And I will draw in our

00:25:23.497 --> 00:25:30.000
remaining ammonia molecules that
are coordinating to the cobalt.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.351
This is an isomer that we would
call "cis." Cis denotes a

00:25:35.351 --> 00:25:41.276
proximal arrangement of the two
chlorides with a 90 degree bond

00:25:41.276 --> 00:25:45.863
angle between them.
And then the alternative here

00:25:45.863 --> 00:25:51.119
would be to put the other
chloride 180 degrees away from

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:55.324
the first one.
And that gives us what we call

00:25:55.324 --> 00:25:58.000
the trans iosomer.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.733
And note that both of these
would have a single plus charge.

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:13.592
Trans means across.
So the two chloride ligands are

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:17.868
located in a mutually trans
disposition here.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:23.407
Isomerism is very important.
I will discuss a couple other

00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:29.432
types of isomerism that you can
get and that Werner contributed

00:26:29.432 --> 00:26:34.000
to our understanding of very
greatly.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.246
And let me do that by
completing consideration of

00:26:43.246 --> 00:26:46.253
this.
You might ask yourself in the

00:26:46.253 --> 00:26:51.296
case where we added only three
ammonias to the solution is

00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:55.542
there a possibility for the
formation of isomers?

00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:59.876
And the answer again would be
yes, we can have two

00:26:59.876 --> 00:27:04.157
possibilities.
And this is for a neutral

00:27:04.157 --> 00:27:08.732
system that contains three
ammonias and three chloride

00:27:08.732 --> 00:27:11.925
ligands.
And let's say I put the first

00:27:11.925 --> 00:27:16.154
one here, the second one here,
the third one here.

00:27:16.154 --> 00:27:20.470
That is one of our possible
isomers of this neutral

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.958
coordination complex.
And then the other possibility,

00:27:24.958 --> 00:27:28.755
the only other possibility is
with one there,

00:27:28.755 --> 00:27:33.099
one there, --
-- and then the third one here.

00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:36.283
And so you can try to draw
different structures.

00:27:36.283 --> 00:27:40.551
And you will see that these are
the only two possible structures

00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:44.006
that you can draw for a
combination of three ammonia

00:27:44.006 --> 00:27:47.529
ligands and three chloride
ligands surround a central

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:50.848
cobalt three plus ion
in an octahedral

00:27:50.848 --> 00:27:52.000
array.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.672
And these have names,
too.

00:28:01.672 --> 00:28:05.520
This one is the so-called fac
isomer.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.865
And that fac is an abbreviation
of the word facial,

00:28:10.865 --> 00:28:17.172
because if you remember that
the octahedron is composed of a

00:28:17.172 --> 00:28:22.944
set of eight equilateral
triangles, then the polyhedron

00:28:22.944 --> 00:28:30.000
that we call the octahedron has
both vertices and faces.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.687
And these chlorides,
in this particular case,

00:28:33.687 --> 00:28:37.878
can be seen to define one of
the eight faces of the

00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:40.895
octahedron.
And so that is the facial

00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:43.745
isomer.
And then, the other type of

00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:47.684
isomer for this type of
structure is called mer.

00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:51.875
And that is an abbreviation of
the word meridional,

00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:56.401
which would be like the
meridians of longitude that you

00:28:56.401 --> 00:29:01.405
see on the globe.
They start at the top and run

00:29:01.405 --> 00:29:06.631
down through the equator and all
the way down to the South Pole.

00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:10.364
That is your meridional isomer.
These isomers,

00:29:10.364 --> 00:29:13.184
here, are called geometric
isomers.

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:17.000
There are different types of
isomerism.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.840
Because the complexes that
differ only with regard to the

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:40.926
spatial arrangement of the
ligands, but not with respect to

00:29:40.926 --> 00:29:47.889
the formula of the system,
these would be types of isomers

00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:53.997
known as geometric.
We have the possibility of CIS,

00:29:53.997 --> 00:30:00.838
TRANS, FAC, MER geometric
isomers for molecules that have

00:30:00.838 --> 00:30:06.335
the same formula.
And then, there is a further

00:30:06.335 --> 00:30:10.238
type of isomerism.
And here, again,

00:30:10.238 --> 00:30:10.985
the contributions of Alfred
Werner were exceedingly

00:30:10.985 --> 00:30:11.805
important, because it was
thought that this next type of

00:30:11.805 --> 00:30:12.477
isomerism was restricted to
organic molecules.

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.000
And this is stereoisomerism.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.206
Stereoisomerism is a little
more subtle than geometric

00:30:34.206 --> 00:30:37.380
isomerism.
And it is a little more subtle

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.222
because two molecules that are
stereoisomers of each other are

00:30:42.222 --> 00:30:46.746
related in the same way that
your left hand and your right

00:30:46.746 --> 00:30:50.238
hand are related.
They are non-superimposable

00:30:50.238 --> 00:30:53.253
mirror images.
If you can find a way to

00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:57.539
separate molecules that are
chiral, then you can have a

00:30:57.539 --> 00:31:02.460
sample that can do interesting
things, like rotate the plane of

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:07.328
polarized light.
This happens when you have

00:31:07.328 --> 00:31:11.358
chiral molecules.
And if a molecule is chiral,

00:31:11.358 --> 00:31:16.014
that is to say it is
non-superimposable on its mirror

00:31:16.014 --> 00:31:17.000
image.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.894
And in order to see whether a
molecule is or is not

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:40.193
superimposable on its mirror
image, you really need to get

00:31:40.193 --> 00:31:43.724
good at visualizing things in
three-dimensions and at rotating

00:31:43.724 --> 00:31:46.908
molecules around in your mind.
You can also do it on the

00:31:46.908 --> 00:31:49.049
computer.
And doing it on the computer

00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:51.712
will help you prepare for doing
it on the exam,

00:31:51.712 --> 00:31:53.796
where you have to do it in your
mind.

00:31:53.796 --> 00:31:57.269
But if you like architecture,
and you like visualizing things

00:31:57.269 --> 00:32:00.163
in three-dimensions,
you should know that that is a

00:32:00.163 --> 00:32:04.994
lot of what we do in chemistry.
You should think about these

00:32:04.994 --> 00:32:09.339
molecules, these 3D structures,
in ways that allow you to test

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:11.832
for a property like
stereoisomerism.

00:32:11.832 --> 00:32:16.035
And I mentioned that it was
thought that stereoisomerism was

00:32:16.035 --> 00:32:19.169
a property associated with
organic molecules.

00:32:19.169 --> 00:32:23.087
And organic molecules were
compounds of carbon that were

00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:27.076
thought to be associated very
fundamentally with life and

00:32:27.076 --> 00:32:31.402
living things.
And so the fact that Werner in

00:32:31.402 --> 00:32:35.647
one of his most amazing
accomplishments was ultimately

00:32:35.647 --> 00:32:39.251
able to synthesize a
coordination complex that

00:32:39.251 --> 00:32:44.056
contained no carbon at all but
exhibited stereoisomerism just

00:32:44.056 --> 00:32:49.021
shattered that theory and really
helped to bring science onto a

00:32:49.021 --> 00:32:53.106
much more firm footing.
And that parallelism between

00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:58.071
organic and inorganic chemistry,
I think, has stemmed from this

00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:02.316
aspect of its history.
And so let's look at an example

00:33:02.316 --> 00:33:06.000
of a molecule that is chiral --

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.115
-- that could be made from
cobalt.

00:33:12.115 --> 00:33:16.089
And if you imagine carrying out
a reaction like we were talking

00:33:16.089 --> 00:33:19.551
about up above but not even
giving it enough ammonia to

00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:23.012
displace all the water molecules
then you could have an

00:33:23.012 --> 00:33:25.000
intermediate like this.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.153
And in this type of species
what I've got are two water

00:33:44.153 --> 00:33:47.769
molecules, two ammonia
molecules, two chlorides.

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:52.538
And so if this is cobalt three,
we would have a single positive

00:33:52.538 --> 00:33:56.230
charge on that ion.
And what I can represent here

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:00.000
by a dashed line would be a
mirror plane.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.256
That is our mirror.
And we are going to reflect

00:34:08.256 --> 00:34:12.079
this molecule through that
mirror plane to see what its

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:16.256
mirror image would look like.
And then, if you can rotate it

00:34:16.256 --> 00:34:19.796
around in your mind,
we can determine whether it is

00:34:19.796 --> 00:34:22.982
or is not superimposable on that
mirror image.

00:34:22.982 --> 00:34:26.946
I am generating the mirror
image by reflecting this water

00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:31.569
to this position.
This ammonia back here reflects

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:35.133
over to here.
The top ammonia reflects still

00:34:35.133 --> 00:34:39.195
into the top position.
This water behind the board

00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:42.510
reflects behind the board.
And over here,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:47.401
this chloride coming out in
front of the board reflects over

00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:50.550
to here.
And we have one more chloride,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:54.695
down on the bottom.
That molecule is now our mirror

00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:57.596
image.
And let's go ahead and rotate

00:34:57.596 --> 00:35:02.142
it, like this.
Because it is a little hard,

00:35:02.142 --> 00:35:06.274
I am going to highlight the
position of the two ammonia

00:35:06.274 --> 00:35:09.258
ligands.
And to see if this mirror image

00:35:09.258 --> 00:35:13.084
is superimposable on the
structure we started with,

00:35:13.084 --> 00:35:17.216
I am going to rotate this
around so that we can put the

00:35:17.216 --> 00:35:21.271
two ammonia ligands coincident
with the two shown here

00:35:21.271 --> 00:35:26.015
underlined in green on the left.
We are going to do a rotation.

00:35:26.015 --> 00:35:31.342
And I need to rotate this.
I am going to rotate here,

00:35:31.342 --> 00:35:34.765
around the cobalt-chlorine bond
access.

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:39.900
And I am actually going to go
in the negative direction to

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.783
generate the following
structure.

00:35:42.783 --> 00:35:48.099
This puts this ammonia up top,
and it will put this one down

00:35:48.099 --> 00:35:51.252
below.
We have NH three and NH three

00:35:51.252 --> 00:35:54.405
here.
Let me underline them.

00:35:54.405 --> 00:35:59.000
So those are in positions,
coincident.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.156
And this rotation also will
carry that chloride from the

00:36:04.156 --> 00:36:07.718
bottom up here,
into what I may call an

00:36:07.718 --> 00:36:12.218
equatorial position.
And it puts a water molecule

00:36:12.218 --> 00:36:15.312
down.
And that rotation about this

00:36:15.312 --> 00:36:21.031
cobalt chlorine bond left the
cobalt and chlorine on that bond

00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:24.406
axis unrotated.
And then in the back,

00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:29.000
we have this OH two molecule.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.601
And what you can see is,
if you now bring this over,

00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:35.567
what we have,
in fact, is a situation where

00:36:35.567 --> 00:36:39.239
we are not currently
superimposable with that choice.

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:43.476
I generated the mirror image.
I have rotated it by 90 degrees

00:36:43.476 --> 00:36:47.924
around the cobalt-chlorine bond
axis to bring these two ammonias

00:36:47.924 --> 00:36:51.173
coincident with these two.
So you can see that,

00:36:51.173 --> 00:36:54.774
whereas we have a water
molecule on the bottom here,

00:36:54.774 --> 00:37:00.000
we have a chloride over here.
So that is not superimposable.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.555
But we can do one more rotation
to check the other possibility,

00:37:06.555 --> 00:37:12.583
and that rotation will be a
rotation by 180 degrees around

00:37:12.583 --> 00:37:15.755
an axis, here,
that bisects the

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:20.936
nitrogen-cobalt-nitrogen bond
angle of 90 degrees.

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:25.483
We will rotate 180 degrees
around that axis,

00:37:25.483 --> 00:37:29.607
and that will bring our
ammonias, again,

00:37:29.607 --> 00:37:35.000
into a position so as to be
coincident.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.938
And rotating around that axis
brings a water around front here

00:37:43.938 --> 00:37:48.805
and puts a chloride in back,
rotating around there,

00:37:48.805 --> 00:37:53.769
and it swaps this chloride with
that water molecule.

00:37:53.769 --> 00:38:00.000
So we now have chloride down
and OH two over here.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.622
And so if we take this,
we identify our ammonia

00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:07.560
positions by green underlining,
they're coincident,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.766
here.
And now where we have a

00:38:09.766 --> 00:38:13.467
chloride coming out,
we have a water coming out,

00:38:13.467 --> 00:38:17.957
so our mirror image is not
superimposable on the structure

00:38:17.957 --> 00:38:21.658
that we generated it from
through the process of

00:38:21.658 --> 00:38:24.494
reflection through that mirror
plane.

00:38:24.494 --> 00:38:28.983
And so, what we can say is that
this molecule and this one

00:38:28.983 --> 00:38:33.000
constitute a pair of
stereoisomers.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.905
And because this condition was
satisfied that the mirror image

00:38:36.905 --> 00:38:40.746
was not superimposable on the
structure we generated it from,

00:38:40.746 --> 00:38:44.012
the molecule is chiral.
And you will see that I have

00:38:44.012 --> 00:38:47.981
chosen a molecule that contains
no carbon, and yet it is chiral

00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:51.567
and it has stereoisomers.
And that was thought impossible

00:38:51.567 --> 00:38:54.000
prior to the time of Werner.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.698
Let me show you another example
of a molecule that is chiral.

00:39:04.698 --> 00:39:07.831
And I am going to use this
example, also,

00:39:07.831 --> 00:39:13.000
to illustrate another important
feature that ligands can have.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.276
And that is that they can have
more than one atom that can bond

00:39:23.276 --> 00:39:26.000
to the metal at the same time.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.987
I am drawing a cobalt ion three
plus complex that

00:39:33.987 --> 00:39:37.894
has six nitrogens directly
bonded to the cobalt.

00:39:37.894 --> 00:39:40.804
But now, look what I am going
to do.

00:39:40.804 --> 00:39:45.875
I am going to put some organic
material in here and link these

00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:49.616
nitrogens by a CH two CH two
unit,

00:39:49.616 --> 00:39:52.775
a CH2-CH2 chain here.
So it is CH2-CH2.

00:39:52.775 --> 00:39:57.097
These carbons that I am
representing as vertices here

00:39:57.097 --> 00:40:03.000
each have two additional
hydrogens that I am not showing.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.385
And that is typical organic
shorthand.

00:40:06.385 --> 00:40:12.058
And I am going to suggest that
this molecule would be generated

00:40:12.058 --> 00:40:16.816
by adding three of these ligands
to the metal center.

00:40:16.816 --> 00:40:21.300
And for each nitrogen,
if you consider it as being

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.692
derived from ammonia,
one of the hydrogens of the

00:40:25.692 --> 00:40:31.000
ammonia is replaced with a
nitrogen-carbon bond.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.486
And we have used this organic
moiety here to tether two

00:40:37.486 --> 00:40:42.891
nitrogens together.
This is a very popular and

00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:47.695
ancient ligand in coordination
chemistry.

00:40:47.695 --> 00:40:54.782
And, by drawing in simplistic
form the two lone pairs on the

00:40:54.782 --> 00:40:59.826
two nitrogens,
you can see that this set of

00:40:59.826 --> 00:41:07.033
four atoms is able to organize
itself so as to simultaneously

00:41:07.033 --> 00:41:14.000
point two lone pairs at the same
metal center.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.084
That is permitted by this
bridge.

00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:22.000
This particular ligand is
called ethylenediamine.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.054
And it is called en for short,
ethylenediamine.

00:41:32.054 --> 00:41:37.000
And it is an example of a
bidentate ligand.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.185
And that means that it has two
teeth with which to bite down on

00:41:53.185 --> 00:42:00.000
the metal center.
It is a double Lewis base.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.384
And when it binds to the metal
center, we call that the process

00:42:05.384 --> 00:42:08.338
of chelation.
When a bidentate or a

00:42:08.338 --> 00:42:11.377
multidentate,
which would be maybe a

00:42:11.377 --> 00:42:16.589
tridentate or a tetradentate
ligand, binds to a metal through

00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:20.584
multiple points,
we call that a ligand chelate.

00:42:20.584 --> 00:42:25.882
And we call the process one of
chelation that forms these ring

00:42:25.882 --> 00:42:30.485
structures with the metal as
part of the ring produced

00:42:30.485 --> 00:42:37.000
through multipoint binding of
the ligand to the metal center.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.458
And you are going to see that
it is possible to have all kinds

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:45.478
of different architectures for
ligands in proteins or in

00:42:45.478 --> 00:42:48.913
synthetic systems.
And the reason that I carried

00:42:48.913 --> 00:42:53.445
out over here earlier is one in
which I added three equivalents

00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:57.392
of a bidentate ligand to this
solution of iron two plus.

00:42:57.392 --> 00:43:01.526
And, when that occurred,

00:43:01.526 --> 00:43:07.736
this bidentate ligand displaced
the water molecules from the

00:43:07.736 --> 00:43:11.736
inner coordination sphere of the
metal.

00:43:11.736 --> 00:43:16.894
And the bidentate ligand that I
used was this one.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:22.789
This is a very common chelating
ligand, a planar aromatic

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:25.736
ligand.
And you can see that,

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:31.000
like ethylenediamine,
its architecture promotes the

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000
pointing of a pair of electrons
toward the same point in space.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.756
So that this ligand can bind
itself to a metal center through

00:43:43.756 --> 00:43:46.768
two nitrogen lone pairs
simultaneously.

00:43:46.768 --> 00:43:51.128
And it is the interaction of
the d-electrons on the iron

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:55.804
center with the unsaturated pi
system of this organic ligand

00:43:55.804 --> 00:44:00.164
that produces the red color in
ways that we are going to

00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:05.000
explore in more detail in one of
our next lectures.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.215
But, before we do that,
we are going to need to

00:44:08.215 --> 00:44:10.802
understand something about
d-orbitals.

00:44:10.802 --> 00:44:14.647
And, as you have learned,
when you are forming molecular

00:44:14.647 --> 00:44:18.702
orbitals in systems that consist
of either s or p orbitals,

00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:22.686
you needed to know something
about the nodal properties of

00:44:22.686 --> 00:44:26.531
those atomic orbitals in order
to build proper molecular

00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:30.628
orbitals.
And that will certainly be the

00:44:30.628 --> 00:44:35.974
case for these more interesting
elements that have d orbitals.

00:44:35.974 --> 00:44:40.443
Not just s and p valance
orbitals, but also a set of

00:44:40.443 --> 00:44:43.422
d-orbitals.
And I call those the 3d

00:44:43.422 --> 00:44:48.329
elements because their principle
quantum number for those

00:44:48.329 --> 00:44:52.623
elements is three.
And what we need to now know is

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:57.443
what do these orbitals have,
as far as nodal properties,

00:44:57.443 --> 00:45:02.000
depending on the other quantum
numbers?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.050
And I will draw a set of
coordinate axes,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:10.000
here, on which to map these
orbitals.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.409
It should be pretty
straightforward for you to keep

00:45:26.409 --> 00:45:30.772
straight the nodal properties of
the d orbitals of which there is

00:45:30.772 --> 00:45:34.616
a set of five.
We had one s orbital for a

00:45:34.616 --> 00:45:39.347
given valance shell,
and we had a set of three p

00:45:39.347 --> 00:45:45.587
orbitals, and there is a set of
five d orbitals for the d-block

00:45:45.587 --> 00:45:49.211
elements.
And they can have different

00:45:49.211 --> 00:45:53.639
values for the quantum number m.
One is zero.

00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:56.860
One is plus one.
One is plus two.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:03.000
And m can be minus one,
and m can equal minus two.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.815
And this quantum number
determines the angular nodal

00:46:08.815 --> 00:46:13.263
properties of the d orbital in
question.

00:46:13.263 --> 00:46:17.368
Here, let's draw a fairly
simple one.

00:46:17.368 --> 00:46:21.245
Let's say that we have x,
y, and z.

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:29.000
Then what we might have is a d
orbital that looks like this.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.834
d orbitals often have four
lobes.

00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:45.142
In fact, you will see that we
represent four of the d orbitals

00:46:45.142 --> 00:46:51.612
this way and not the fifth.
And let me use this pink to

00:46:51.612 --> 00:46:58.322
represent the negative phase.
And so this orbital here is

00:46:58.322 --> 00:47:02.408
(d)xz.
And that means that it has

00:47:02.408 --> 00:47:05.558
nodes.
You have two planes that are

00:47:05.558 --> 00:47:10.098
nodes for a (d)xz orbital.
And one of these is the

00:47:10.098 --> 00:47:13.711
x,y-plane.
And then the other one is the

00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:17.231
y,z-plane.
Those are planes when you go

00:47:17.231 --> 00:47:22.697
from one side through one of
those planes to the other side.

00:47:22.697 --> 00:47:28.256
The wave function changes sign.
And, just like each p orbital

00:47:28.256 --> 00:47:34.000
has a single nodal plane,
each d orbital has two.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.049
And this is (d)xz.
And we can also have one that

00:47:38.049 --> 00:47:42.529
we call d x squared minus y
squared.

00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:47.612
And that one lies right along
the coordinate axes like this,

00:47:47.612 --> 00:47:52.350
with the four lobes being
skewered by the x-axis and the

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.193
y-axis.
And we have negative phase

00:47:55.193 --> 00:48:00.190
located along y for the d x
squared minus y squared.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.839
And you can see that the nodal

00:48:04.839 --> 00:48:10.233
surfaces here both contain z.
The nodes contain the z-axis

00:48:10.233 --> 00:48:13.829
and bisect the x and y
coordinate axes.

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:19.791
There is one plane up here that
contains the z-axis and one over

00:48:19.791 --> 00:48:23.955
there located at 90 degrees to
the first one.

00:48:23.955 --> 00:48:29.350
Those are the nodal planes for
d x squared minus y squared.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:34.442
In addition to that (d)xz

00:48:34.442 --> 00:48:40.599
orbital, I have a (d)yz orbital,
which is located with its lobes

00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:44.605
lying between the y and z
coordinate axes.

00:48:44.605 --> 00:48:49.491
And it will have phasing as
indicated here in pink.

00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:53.302
That is (d)yz.
And it looks exactly like

00:48:53.302 --> 00:48:56.625
(d)xz.
And it is just rotated by 90

00:48:56.625 --> 00:49:02.000
degrees around the z-axis
relative to (d)xz.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.315
And then, finally,
we have one that looks just

00:49:06.315 --> 00:49:11.013
like d x squared minus 
y squared.

00:49:11.013 --> 00:49:15.904
And this one is (d)xy.
And, like d x squared minus y

00:49:15.904 --> 00:49:20.506
squared, the (d)xy orbital lies
in the x,y-plane.

00:49:20.506 --> 00:49:26.260
And its lobes point between the
axes, as shown here with that

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.000
phasing.
And then, finally --

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.858
And we will return to this
point next week.

00:49:33.858 --> 00:49:38.910
Our m equals zero orbital is
our d z squared **d(z^2)**.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:44.055
And d z squared lies along and
is skewered by the z-axis.

00:49:44.055 --> 00:49:49.199
It looks like a p orbital,
except the sign is the same on

00:49:49.199 --> 00:49:53.608
top and on bottom.
And then it has this beautiful

00:49:53.608 --> 00:49:57.742
torus here that is in the
x,y-plane like that,

00:49:57.742 --> 00:50:03.070
so that its nodal surfaces are
actually conical rather than

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.288
planes.
That is our set of five d

00:50:07.288 --> 00:50:12.965
orbitals with which we are going
to do a lot more to understand

00:50:12.965 --> 00:50:16.627
the chemistry and coordination
complexes.

00:50:16.627 --> 00:50:21.205
Have a great break,
and please don't forget to read

00:50:21.205 --> 00:50:22.538
