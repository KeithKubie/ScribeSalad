1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,430

Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

Just checking in on you.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,420
I'm just checking out how the holiday
season is fucking go and for you.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,710
Did you get some toys for
fucking girls and boys?

8
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:26,210
That sounded really creepy.
Um, hey, what's going on?

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,080
I uh, been running around all
day. Podcast is a little bit late.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,860
I was actually doing Joe Rogan's
monster podcasts. Um, and uh,

11
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:36,680
we had a great time.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,260
Talked a little bit about flying in the
helicopter earlier this week and uh,

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,940
and that he got me all sold on
buying a fucking sauna. Yeah. Joe,

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,910
Joe, Joe. Fuck. It tells you something.
Be like, all right, this guy, you know,

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,940
he's probably read up on
it, whatever. He was like,

16
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,910
people who do this four times
a fucking week, you know,

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,640
live a long time or some shit.
And I'm just thinking like,
well, I'm an old dad. Oh,

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,840
guys should get off. I
don't care. I'm an old dad.

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,030
Joe,
make me Camaya too far away.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,320
Just give me me in five
years. Oh yeah, you can you,

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,433
oh.

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,840
[inaudible].
Um,

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,790
so I have to make sure I
take care of myself. So, uh,

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,330
Bill, he's got some growing
up to do. All right.

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,080
Abuse and alcohol for a while
now I take the bottle out,

26
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,990
I slept it around and let
them know who's boss. Um,

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,230
and I got to fucking grow up.
You need,

28
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:45,820
you need to take a little
Paris back to Philly.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,440
Hey, fuck it. Say that all the
time. You know what you need.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,570
You need a little bit of responsibility.
Uh,

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,090
I've never in my life

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,320
understood that expression.
You need a little bit of responsibility.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,810
They'll pick like the most immature
fucking person ever and tell them you need

34
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,960
some responsibility and you're
like this fucking guy. No,

35
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,920
this guy does not need to be in charge
of anything. He's a fucking moron.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,130
Because they have that
whole idea of, oh, well,

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,920
once you have a kid and then you have,
you know, you're, you're gonna have to,

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,000
you know, change your ways. Yeah.
Unless you're a fucking idiot.

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,410
And everything this person is doing is
demonstrating that there a fucking moron

40
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,710
and you're telling them to go out there,
procreate with somebody.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,920
You know what you need
is no responsibility.

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,270
You need a fucking playpen
is what you need there.

43
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:42,590
Bucko my new year's resolution
is I'm going to, um,

44
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,090
I'm going to fix, I'm going to fix
this little phone, a headphone Jack.

45
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,790
I literally sit here with my thumb
on the button like a terrorist.

46
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,880
You know what I mean? Like I lift
it off. It's, you know, my mom,

47
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,960
my weight up fucking Evan
70 broads in my life.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
I know it's a hacky joke, but the more
you're married, you're just like, oh God.

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,843
Um,

50
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,863
anyways,

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,160
um, all Bebo Oh, bill Burroughs
is fucking slowing down, man.

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,350
In a good way. You know, I'm off
the sauce. Who knows for how long,

53
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:20,340
but I'm off the fucking sauce
and I'm actually reading a book.

54
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,830
Swear to God. I mean, granted,
it's a sportsbook. Does
that even count? It's about,

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,280
uh, Bob Cousy and Bill Russell's
relationship. When I did the herb,

56
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:33,660
somebody over there gave it to me. I
believe that's where I got it. And um,

57
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,470
you know, one of the things that
always bothered me, you know,

58
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:40,800
something I always got meant to get
around to was to know all the Celtics

59
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,920
retired numbers. And now that
I've read the book, I finally,

60
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,570
I think I have them down. I swear to God
I'm not looking at anything. All right.

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,100
Number one is Walter Brown.
He was the original owner of the Celtics.

62
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:57,770
Number two is red are back. The great
coach, they consider a number two,

63
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,740
he got number two because he's the second
most important person in the Celtics

64
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,630
history I guess. Cause number one is the
original owner. Then it's Dennis Johnson.

65
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:10,290
Number three, Bill Russell, number six.
Why do I, why do I need to know this?

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Jo Jo white on the great basketball names
number 10 and then it's Bob Cousy at

67
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:20,610
14.
Tommy Heinsohn is 15 some guys.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,410
Tom Sanders is 60
70.

69
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,623
Yeah.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,310
Eighteens Dave Cowens 19
is fucking Don Nelson.

71
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,580
21 is Bill Sharman.
22 is

72
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,980
Ed Mccauley 20 Three's Frank Ramsey,
24 Sam Jones,

73
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,790
25 Casey Jones.
All right now let's not eat now it's easy.

74
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,100
31 Cedric go and Brad
Maxwell, 30 twos. Mikael,

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,240
33 is bird 35. Reggie Lewis, double
zero is fucking Robert Parish.

76
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,830
Then there's another guy just as his name,

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,740
cause he also wore the number at
18 and didn't want to retire it.

78
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,620
And then Dave Collins got it. So I don't
know his fucking name. So that's not bad.

79
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,480
That's not bad. Um, so now I know
that. And what does that get me?

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,600
Next time I get into an argument with
my wife now, but watch Walter Brown now,

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,540
but two's red are back.
Can you do this?

82
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
No Dad,

83
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,850
I'm an old dad. I said, get off
of that now I need a nap. Um,

84
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,260
anyways, so after I did
Joe's podcast, he's like,

85
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,350
he's got like did that flotation salt
tank thing in there. And I'm like,

86
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:38,700
dude, I don't, I don't know.
Like if I went in that fucking
thing for like an hour,

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,273
like

88
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,770
I always wondered what those things were.
Like those isolation tanks.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,540
I mean that looks fucking wild.

90
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,900
They just close that door and you're in
there floating in pitch black like you

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,910
floating through space like
Sandra Bullock in that movie,

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,940
right where the other guy was never going
to get married and then he did George

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,933
Clooney.
Right.

94
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,580
May just sort of floated off into space
that I could never get my shit together.

95
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:12,170
You go back to the bucket spacecraft,
I'm just going to float away that movie.

96
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,680
I feel like you'd feel like that,
you know,

97
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,810
if I ever get a role where I get
to play in astronauts, that that's,

98
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,660
that's going to be how I'm
going to prepare for the role.

99
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,220
But what did you do to prepare for
a role to play an astronaut? Well,

100
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:30,221
I kept my Boston accent and I just went
to an isolation tank and just laid there

101
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,340
in a bathing suit.
Do you think it helped you now?

102
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,300
But it gave me something to say
in this interview. Um, anyway,

103
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:43,190
so he had a sauna there, which I'm
totally sold on now. We went there,

104
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,850
we tried to be in there for like a fucking
half hour. He could do it. I couldn't,

105
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,830
I, I made like there was eight
minutes left, 10 minutes left.

106
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,770
I made 20 minutes and I was like
200 fucking degrees in there.

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,470
That's what he was saying. Like, how
the fuck is it? 200 degrees in here?

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,420
It doesn't water boil that
like 212 degrees or some shit,

109
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,770
hundred degrees Celsius.
Um,

110
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,460
I guess those Saunas can get harder
cause it's not like it because it's a dry

111
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:14,840
heat. I have no idea on all. I know. I
was just like, all right, 10 minutes left.

112
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,610
He goes, come on, tough it
out. I'm like, all right.

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,880
And then 10 minutes later I'm like,
how much time's left? And he's like,

114
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,350
eight minutes. I'm like, fuck.

115
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,220
And it at like five minutes I laid down

116
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,220
and he's like,
all right dude.

117
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,010
He knew I was too stubborn so he fucking
opened the door and then I was fine.

118
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,430
He goes, you almost made it. It's
like, I think I did all right.

119
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,390
I don't think I need to go any further
than that, but uh, I felt fucking great.

120
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,700
I felt peaceful.
I felt calm.

121
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,620
I didn't feel like yelling at anybody
or walking around being a fucking

122
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:49,760
emotional lunatic that's
just wears people out. Um,

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,760
so whatever. I'll see. They makes
little two person once I want,

124
00:07:55,761 --> 00:08:00,530
if I get fitted my fucking
little ass garage, you know,

125
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,770
that would be great.
You know,

126
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,200
anytime you have a disagreement
with your spouse, right?

127
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,210
You just go into the sauna.

128
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:11,600
The rule is you go in there for half
hour and then when you come up then you

129
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:14,600
talk about it.
Hey Man,

130
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:19,070
like you left your shoes in the
hall, man. Oh, I'm sorry man.

131
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,530
It's okay. It's not, it doesn't really,

132
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,420
but I didn't know why it bothered me
31 minutes ago, but it did. But that's,

133
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,470
you know what, you can put your shoes
wherever you want. Ah, thank you.

134
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,304
I appreciate that.

135
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,550
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. So anyways, um,

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,490
I get not only do I have all my
Christmas shopping done, I got them,

137
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,230
I got it all wrapped except for when I
bought my, my daughter, this book, uh,

138
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,490
the, how the Grinch stole Christmas,
I bought that on the road. And I just,

139
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,840
I forgot I had it,

140
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,510
I tucked it away in drawer because I know
if she saw it she'd be like, book, book,

141
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,590
read, read. Um, so I'm going to,

142
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,760
I just have to wrap that and then I
think I'm done. I'm think I'm done.

143
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:10,470
And I think for once my super smart wife
hasn't figured out what anything that

144
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,690
I'm going to get her,
you know,

145
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,950
I was really covert about this
shit's not going around. I just,

146
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,190
I brought everything into the
garage this year. Right. Sorry.

147
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,270
What the fuck was that?

148
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,790
You know that shit when you open your
mouth and you just make a fucking noise.

149
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,990
Did you just hear that? Sounded like
there was a ferret that was like some,

150
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,630
something in the back of my
throat while I continued to talk.

151
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,560
Sound like a little cat.
Did you hear that? You know,

152
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:40,310
do you realize like back if I did that
back in like the fucking 1700 state,

153
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,530
they'd be like drowning
me thinking I was a witch.

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,700
I was like possessed or I had a
fucking tape worm or something.

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,910
Jesus Christ.
Some of these fucking brides on,

156
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,570
on social media thinking they're not
being heard. How do you think it, the,

157
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:55,480
the fucking people felt back then?
Yeah.

158
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,740
Well, if you have to compare
ourselves to the Salem witch trial,

159
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,450
aren't you really proving our point?

160
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,963
[inaudible]

161
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,920
that was the hedge clippers
trim in the bush there. Um,

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,100
they broke.
Anyways,

163
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,330
I'm plowing ahead here. Uh,
by the way, I've keep, um,

164
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,850
promoted this on, on Joe Rogan to I
the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit.

165
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,180
Still promoting that is February,
Tuesday,

166
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,300
February 19th, 2019 get your ass to the
fucking city. Alright, come on. Damn.

167
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,030
Great benefit. Big J. Oh, Chris.

168
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,650
Michelle Wealth Rich Vos.

169
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,050
Fucking SciFest sounds myself as going,
it's going to be a cavalcade,

170
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:53,440
a comedy for the best data of
comedian I ever saw in my life.

171
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,550
All proceeds go to benefit all the people
he was taking care of his family and

172
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,380
all that.
And it's been a very successful thing.

173
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,700
We keep his name alive and what not.
Um,

174
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,160
all right with that,
you know what?

175
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:09,570
I actually got to watch a Bruins game
the other night, uh, by getting watch.

176
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,500
Most of it. I watch most of it. And then,
uh, being a dad comes in, you know, I saw,

177
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,080
uh,
the first two periods of the Bruins,

178
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,370
Ford and nothing win over the Canadians.
You know,

179
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,620
we were up two to nothing and I missed
the fourth period. Third period. Sorry.

180
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,470
And uh,
you know,

181
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:30,850
one of my friends from Montreal
Comedy Festival texting me,

182
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,750
cause you watching this game, and I knew
it was the third period and I was like,

183
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,140
well, I go, I'm assuming you guys
tied it up if you fucking called me.

184
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,540
And to his credit, he didn't, he texted
me, he, to his credit, he didn't.

185
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,340
The man did not. He was letting me
know that we played fucking great.

186
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,880
And then I saw the highlights at last.
Fuck it,

187
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,620
Marshawn golden number for
that Little Bing Bang, boom.

188
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,390
All around the Oh and everybody,
it,

189
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,100
all those little Fred cheese with
the fucking crying into their little

190
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,530
handkerchiefs with this
silly socks. Oh, I love it.

191
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,490
Going into their building.

192
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,423
Okay.

193
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,890
Four to nothing. So they're probably
playing tonight. I have no idea.

194
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:15,660
But I gotta go, I gotta go on site for
fucking supper. I still call it supper.

195
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,430
Back in the day. That's what
we call sit down for September.

196
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,170
Your mother would bring the fucking dinner
bell and everybody would come running

197
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:25,950
in like cattle. Right? I'll fucking
filthy for being outside there.

198
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:30,210
It was chipped beef on
toast. Uh, chicken Alex King.

199
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,700
Yeah.

200
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,680
You know, I don't think a king
eats like this. Um, anyways,

201
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,730
let's plow ahead here.
Uh, Liverpool, my fucking,

202
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,990
my fucking adopted Goddamn team.
I almost fucking miss this game.

203
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:48,520
They're playing all my God. They're
playing the wolves. Jesus fucking Christ,

204
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,360
not the wolves. How the fuck is
that a professional franchise?

205
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,010
You've got some stupid Jersey with
like a w on it. We get it. You know,

206
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,970
you couldn't write the whole thing.

207
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,670
They can afford to have the
o l v e s on there, right?

208
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,600
Is that he spell wolfs
was it w o l f s wolf?

209
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,320
I don't know. They'd say
everything different over
there. Reagan, L or a gang? No.

210
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,900
You know, what else do
they say? Tomato or a Gyno?

211
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,990
Uh, all the spices they say
differently. What's mother Rose Marie?

212
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,830
No, that's not the one with the
flex time. They see the same way.

213
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,603
There's another one,

214
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,640
there's another one that is just the
ones Basel or Rogano Basel tomatoes.

215
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,620
And you just want to be like,
stop doing that.

216
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:36,930
Yeah,

217
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,720
you want to say that they're wrong. But
they did it first. So they were right.

218
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:41,830
Why the fuck did we switch?

219
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:46,831
We switched all the accents on everything
and I believe that was a fuck you

220
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,470
right to England after we kicked their
fucking red coated asses all the way back

221
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,200
to their island,
all the way back.

222
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,663
Right.

223
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,580
And I just think that our little rebellion
was not only are we kicking you out

224
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,270
in the country that you first
fucking occupied and took over.

225
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,340
Not only will we continue the
genocide that you started, right.

226
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,500
We're gonna, we're gonna change
the accent on the English language.

227
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,633
Right.

228
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,900
Do you say a automobile?
We're going to say automobile.

229
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,910
I don't know if we do that.
I have no idea. Um, anyways,

230
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,550
uh, the fuck was that. I am. Oh,

231
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,100
goddamn. Noise is now. I don't
know if I'm going crazy or what.

232
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,780
I will tell you what's driving me
fucking crazy is this year I, you know,

233
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,390
I thought it was being a smart guy.
Oh, who's this too was a tough guy.

234
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,630
He was a smart guy, right? I went
out and I bought a Christmas tree,

235
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,360
like when it was still November,
you know,

236
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,030
so now I'm water in this thing and I
got a missed it every goddamn morning to

237
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,860
make sure it's not all brown and dead.
By the time fucking Christmas comes along,

238
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,180
our wreath is on the, on the front
door is already dying, you know?

239
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,080
And my wife went all out. You know
what I mean? Like great mothers do.

240
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,950
She went all out, but I got more goddamn
shit. I'm running around, you know,

241
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,970
I'm the water boy. I got a water rate.
I missed it. I'm talking to it. No,

242
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,140
you look good. You look good. No,

243
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,390
you're going to be one of the
trees that lives after Christmas.

244
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,450
You don't just lie into them
like a fucking dirt bag. Right.

245
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,160
So I didn't have a lot of time the other
day and I'm running around the fucking

246
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:36,161
kitchen table and we got the stupid
fucking potted plant that literally has a

247
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,970
concrete plant plant or whatever the
fucking house that the roots are in,

248
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:41,870
whatever you call it.
Right.

249
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,200
And that was on the floor because of
the Christmas decorations on the table.

250
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,260
And I ran around the table
and just punted that thing,

251
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,100
concrete fucking block with my,

252
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,300
my pinky toe on my left foot
and Jesus fucking Christ.

253
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,420
It was like Barney the dinosaur
purple within two hours.

254
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,130
And it was like half of my foot by foot
looked like I got run over by a car.

255
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,130
Now, you know, obviously
I did some damage,

256
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:14,570
but most of it has to be my,
most of it is my complexion,

257
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,480
you know, being uh, a a fucking, you know,

258
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,100
redhead,
I'm borderline like transparent.

259
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,390
Like I'm always getting marks on
my body and like late at night,

260
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:33,230
like I go to bed and my wife be like, what
is that? What does that entail? What is,

261
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,040
you know,
fucking kilohm mark at my side.

262
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,830
Did you get to a fight with an
alley cat? Yeah, no, I took, I, uh,

263
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,540
think I leaned up against
the refrigerator. I don't
know what the fuck happened.

264
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,111
And then when,

265
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:47,540
you know what's weird is if you hurt
yourself and you don't remember what

266
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,910
happened, you press down on
it and then you're like, oh,

267
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:54,470
and he takes you right back
to that moment. Oh, that's
right. That's fucking right.

268
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,940
Yeah, it was, I was at the
fucking poster. Oh, by the way,

269
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,270
Jesus Christ,
I went to the post office.

270
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,480
I was trying to get all my
fucking gifts out and uh,

271
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,610
you can not fucking go there.

272
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,110
The only way you can fucking go
there is if you have everything done.

273
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,340
I went there,
I needed a box and I needed to,

274
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,130
and then I need the fucking, the
peanuts or whatever to put it in there.

275
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:19,670
So what I was,

276
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,970
whatever I was going to put in there was
going to slide around and break and I

277
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,940
need to tape the, close the box.
It should just like, it's just,

278
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,100
it's that last chopper out of Vietnam I
n and I was happy that I went down there.

279
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,660
I found somebody to help me
out. You know, I got the box,

280
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,280
I got the tape and then they said they
had nothing to put in there to make sure

281
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,890
my gifts to my nephews and nieces
wouldn't fucking slide around. And I,

282
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:47,630
I just, I just, I said, fuck it.
I said, all right, thank you.

283
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,220
I sent the tape down and put
the box where it belonged.

284
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,130
I walked out like a
gentlemen while I fucking,

285
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,790
I went a little Tourette's underneath.
Goddamn fucking, well fucking fuck.

286
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Do you have fucking boxes and tape, but
you don't have the, the last ingredient,

287
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,910
most important ingredient

288
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,710
for the last piece of the puzzle,
I should say.

289
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,740
The box is probably the most important
ingredient. Well then you have to tape.

290
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,360
I mean, they work together like a
great comedy team, dare I say, right?

291
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,740
Like Bob hope and bing Crosby through the
guys who evidently created the fucking

292
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,890
the buddy movie,
you know,

293
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,000
which has now been hijacked by all these
females in all these movies acting like

294
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,460
they're breaking ground. It's like you're
just doing this shit. We already did.

295
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,880
There's nothing new here ladies.
You know,

296
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,770
why don't you reinvent the buddy fucking
movie before I get to listen to your

297
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,080
call on each other. A bunch of fucking
heroes. What do you think about that? Hey,

298
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,440
uh,

299
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,440
this is the thing that fascinated me
because I was reading the Celtics Book and

300
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
some of the fucking teams that
they were playing, like, you know,

301
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,980
playing Syracuse and Rochester
stuff I had heard about before.

302
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,650
But um, when they were
talking, what the fuck is this?

303
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,030
They were talking about playing like the,
uh,

304
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,510
what are now the Atlanta Hawks and I
knew that they were in Saint Louis,

305
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:13,230
but I didn't realize that they
were in Milwaukee before that.

306
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,110
All right, let's see here. Atlanta hawks,
yet they were at this, this is their,

307
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,944
their history.

308
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They were the buffalo bisons then for
one season and then they moved or maybe a

309
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:30,840
half a season.
Then they moved to the tri cities in Iowa,

310
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,210
which are now the quad cities,
I believe.

311
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,480
And they became the tri city Blackhawks.

312
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Then they may move to Milwaukee in
1951 and became the Milwaukee Hawks.

313
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,080
Then in 1955 they moved to St Louis
and became the Saint Louis Hawks.

314
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,940
And then in 1968 they moved to uh,

315
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,690
Atlanta and became the Atlanta Hawks.
And they'd been there for 50 years,

316
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:01,830
but they've moved five times.
And I always thought the Sacramento Kings,

317
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,510
which I can't remember if they were the
Cincinnati royals and then the Kansas

318
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:10,890
City kings and then the Sacramento Kings,
I couldn't remember. Hang on a second.

319
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,880
Let me get to this,
cause I got,

320
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,510
I got this fucking website here that
has all the franchises that moved.

321
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,640
If I can get it to work
here, please, please.

322
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,500
As people listening national hockey
league, what the fuck is the NBA?

323
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,710
Ah, Jesus Christ, come
on National Basketball
Association, the Tri City Hawks,

324
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,730
Blackhawks play their
home games in Moline.

325
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,890
And Rock Island, Illinois and
Davenport, Iowa moved to Milwaukee,

326
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:45,270
became the hawks. Then in 55
they moved to St Louis. Okay.

327
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:50,271
And then the Detroit Pistons where
Fort Wayne Pistons until 1957 Rochester

328
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,750
royals moved to Cincinnati. And then
where the fuck did they go from there?

329
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,290
Yeah,

330
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,470
cause this goes year by year, so I'll,
they became the Sacramento Kings. Yeah,

331
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,070
they were the rot Rochester's
Seagram's. What the fuck is that?

332
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,040
Yeah.

333
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,310
Anyways, Rob Chester pros and they
became the Rochester's royals.

334
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,660
Then they moved to Cincinnati royals,
Kansas City slash all Mohawk kings,

335
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,810
Kansas City Kings,
Sacramento Kings.

336
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,890
And then I think the Syracuse team moved
to San Diego and became the San Diego

337
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,210
Clippers.
Where the fuck is it?

338
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,800
The Syracuse nationals moved to
Philadelphia and became the 76 is, okay,

339
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,700
so who became the La Clippers?
The San Diego Clippers?

340
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,290
Yeah.

341
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,770
Oh, the buffalo Braves moved to
San Diego and became the clippers.

342
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,780
That's what it is. Oh No, it's
the Rochester was, I don't
know. I'm a fucking nerd.

343
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:49,740
I love that shit.

344
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,330
Then I go online and see if I can find
a tri cities black hawks tee shirt.

345
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,640
Like they ever fucking sold one of those.

346
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,750
I bet it's a minor league hockey team now.
Tri City.

347
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,260
Come on, come on bill. You can write it.

348
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,690
Black Hawks

349
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,110
tee shirt. Here we go. Somebody
makes it, you know somebody makes it.

350
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,210
Mitchell and ness. Chicago
Blackhawks, Tri city,

351
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,740
black hawks.
There it is.

352
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,170
Everyone would like myself would think,
oh,

353
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:27,530
is that where the Chicago Blackhawks first
played? And they'd be like, oh no, no,

354
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,370
no. That's not, that's
not the case. All dead.

355
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,970
Leave me alone.

356
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,810
MMM. Yeah. They've got
the, they've got the dude.

357
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,030
He's just see them all the fucking kid.
If they got it wearing,

358
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:41,980
it was like 21 fucking years old.

359
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,610
Similar designs. Look at this. They
got all the old ones here anyways.

360
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,690
Trust the process. Yeah. Boy,

361
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,940
I didn't want to know who the fuck said
that. Um Oh, there's a cool Lebron one.

362
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,250
Will they make his beard
like the State of California?

363
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,870
Do you realize if the Lakers don't win it
this year, this'll be the first decade.

364
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,290
They haven't won a fucking
championships since the fucking 1960s

365
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,480
seventies eighties nineties two
thousands they went for decades in a row.

366
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:17,940
Celtics won 50 60 seventies eighties no,

367
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,650
it went for decades, right? It
was seventies eighties nineties

368
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,070
2004 Oh yeah. No one's ever done five.
No one's ever done five. Can you see,

369
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,740
can you tell him? I'll fucking
talked out from Rogan's podcast.

370
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,330
We did like fucking two and a half hours.

371
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,250
I'm sitting here wondering
what the hell to talk about it.

372
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,020
Cause I can read some advertising. I
could read some advertising. By the way,

373
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm not farting continually.
I'm just sitting in a leather
chair. I just realized

374
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,340
that. Yeah, that leather chair,

375
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,990
plush leather chair. One Chair, one chair,

376
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,250
my little fucking podcast area here
finally, cause now we have the kid.

377
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,530
I can't do it the way I used to
in the fucking bedroom and shit.

378
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,750
Screaming and yell and we can't
have that bill. We keep pill.

379
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,700
We can't have you be who you
are in your own home anymore.

380
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,290
Butcher box.
Everybody butcher box delivers.

381
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,810
That's a great name for like a
fucking female wrestler. Butcher box,

382
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,750
you know,
or finishing moves.

383
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,450
He jumps up in the air and fucking
puts her claim in your face.

384
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,180
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

385
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:30,181

God, do I love that stuff?

388
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,950
The incredible quality of butcher
box means start with the co,

389
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,170
the commitment starting,
sorry.

390
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:47,530
With the commitment to raising animals
humanely and free of antibiotics and

391
00:24:47,531 --> 00:24:50,920

beautiful before they murdered,

392
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,810
cooked with piece of mind knowing you're
eating healthy, high quality meat.

393
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,800
Each box comes with at least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

394
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,400
which is enough for 24
individual sized meals.

395
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,230
Even for you size queens out there, you
can choose from five different box types.

396
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,030
All beef, beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed. Yeah,

397
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,660
box,
custom box.

398
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,560
I feel like the mixed box is
to progressive liberal box.

399
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,760
We're custom box is more like, you

410
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,750
like get together of like, you know,
four or five different couples.

411
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,800
And they came over and my
wife just did it up, you know,

412
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,990
hired these people to cater it. They
made all this great food, you know,

413
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:22,530
the booze was flowing, everyone was
having a good time. And I sat there,

414
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,900
she's like, come on man, it's a holiday
party. I have to have one drink,

415
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,430

start with the Ginger Ale. Right.

416
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,280
And I just kept putting it off and
putting it off and putting it off. Right.

417
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,710
And then all of a sudden it
was the end of the night,

418
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,690
we'd all sit in there smoking cigars
and a then all of a sudden the night was

419
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:43,560
over and I didn't drink.
Everybody had a time.

420
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,100
And I've almost done it.
I only have a,

421
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,390

422
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,240
I got a couple more holiday
parties. Oh, I got a tough one.

423
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,210
I've got a tough one coming up with
a good friend of mine, comedian.

424
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:56,610
I'm not going to say who the fuck it is,
but he has a party coming up.

425
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,860
Oh this is going to be tough and no,

426
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,050
it's not that gutter dweller Joe to Rosa.
Oh Joe de Rosa loves it.

427
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,120
Gutter loves it.
Gutter.

428
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,540
I know he sees a Kirby
just east nuzzles up to it.

429
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:15,010
Like he's laying with his own
mother, his own mother. Um,

430
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,940
but anyways, I always get a little bit
sad this time of the holidays, you know,

431
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,570
cause I know that it's almost over.
I like this time of year, you know,

432
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,280
everybody just kind of sits
back cause like, you know what,

433
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:29,080
I fucking love you man. Fucking
PCH been in my life, man. You know,

434
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,500
you know they got the fucking lights.
It's just,

435
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,630
he just look around like why can't
it be like this all the time?

436
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,260
Why can't work be like,
all right, relax. You know?

437
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:41,230
And everybody just chills out and just
says how much they like each other.

438
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,060
Why can't we do,
you'd get bored of it,

439
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,940
I guess after a while they
can't have like, you know,

440
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,460
yeah.

441
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,820
It's sort of a summer, Christmas time
holiday, Hanukkah, Kwanza fucking thing.

442
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,540
Yeah.

443
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,380
You got to wait once a once a fucking
year that it starts all over again.

444
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,850
January 2nd or January 3rd or
this has got to be this company.

445
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,800
Yeah.
This quarter ever.

446
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,710
Where did you all a buckle down and
not go? You will not see your children

447
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,960
when you leave for work. Y'All
be sleeping. When you come home,

448
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,920
there will be a slave.
You'll be a stranger.

449
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,470
So this year we could sell the most where?
Jets we've ever Solera.

450
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,150
I'll tell you right now, if you've
got a problem, there's door.

451
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,320
The Internet has made this industry
more competitive than it's ever been.

452
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,723
Okay?

453
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,240
I did counter.
That's rob.

454
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,860
You're going to cry Maggie,
Huh?

455
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,140
Yeah.

456
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,240
Who else? What about you? Greg
hurt. You're all fucking sensitive.

457
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,713
Okay.

458
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,600

for the first fucking court?

459
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,900
What did you do less last quarter?
You didn't check.

460
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,810
You know,
can imagine if you had that fucking life,

461
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,880
just imagine that fucking life.
Get yelled at.

462
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:17,790
You know you liked that famous
scene in Glengarry Glen Ross.

463
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,980
Alec Baldwin comes in and starts yelling
at people. I can't fucking hear myself.

464
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,410
God Damn it. I've got
to get this fixed. Um,

465
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,860
this will be such a great stocking
stuffer. What did I tell fucking Santa?

466
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:33,030
I wanted this. Oh, here comes Santa Claus.

467
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,540
Here comes Santa Claus.
He's back from radio shack.

468
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,200
He got you the fucking
headphone Jack that you needed.

469
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,480
What does this even called? I'm gonna
you don't want me to do people in,

470
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:48,430
in fucking honor of the new year.
I mean, what I plan on doing,

471
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,300
which you wouldn't know from that last
little comedy skit that I did there.

472
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,520
And by the way, that was all written
out. I memorized all those lines. Um,

473
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,190
uh, you know, I'm going to try to fucking
chill out in the next fucking year,

474
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,000
you know what I mean? So anyways, in
honor of that and solving problems,

475
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,950
rather than complaining about them,
I'm a,

476
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,930
I'm going to let you
guys listen to me order.

477
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,420
This is the highlight of
your fucking week. I know it
is this self self involved.

478
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,211

You're gonna listen to me.

479
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:18,630
Order this fucking cock sucking
God damn thing that I need here.

480
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,750
What would you call this thing?
Uh, the rotisserie. Yeah.

481
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,240
This is basically like the
chick and you know, a porno.

482
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,810
She's getting bang from
behind it. A, you know,

483
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,770
she's put forward in the old fucking
a and how you been up front. Right?

484
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,380
And you know someone's going
to have a bigger Dick, right?

485
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:41,490
So one of them is bigger. The other one's
smaller. What do you call this thing?

486
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,790
The rotisserie.
A core Jack.

487
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,260
I don't fucking know a head phone.

488
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,300
I'm going to go with a head phone
adapter.

489
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,790
It's gonna take me to fucking Wikipedia.
Why the fuck would it do that?

490
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,410
It's in my default settings.

491
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:06,400
I get to figure out how to fucking do
headphone adapter. Oh No. Oh No, no, no,

Three and a half millimeter.

call this fucking thing?

498
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,080

were the most afraid of.

519
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:10,690
A lot of times they seem like
mountains and they're really,

520
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:15,520

527
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:41,831
You know,

528
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:46,831
I just feel like that just to be
a performer isn't enough for me.

529
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:49,870
I feel like I should be this vessel.

530
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,240
Who is it? Come on in. Oh,

531

It doesn't work right now. Can
I get a hug please? Hi. Hey.

535
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,960
Hi. Hey. Hey football.

536
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,950

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,550
Can you say baseball? Uh,

538
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:28,450
All those cards over.

539
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,950
How you guys doing the two most
beautiful ladies in my life? How are you?

540
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,870
I've been bitching about this
3.5 millimeter male to female,

541
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,560
a headphone Jack and I finally got
it fixed. What did you guys do today?

542
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,250
Ingredients for Christmas dinner.
What are you going to make?

543
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,030
Um, am I plugged in? Yes. You were
plugged in. Ah, we're going to make lamb.

544
00:34:58,031 --> 00:35:00,280
So I got a rack of lamb. Oh, nice.

545
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,580
And I had them cut it up and we're just
going to freeze it until it's ready

546
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,640
because it's going to be a mad
house when we go on Christmas Eve.

547
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:09,070
Or can you say strawberry?

548
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,530
Can you say football?
Trooper. Okay. And you say hi.

549
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,780
Can I say Merry Christmas?
[inaudible] I don't know.

550
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,810
She can say that. Wow. I'm here.

551
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:27,910
I know how to keep you occupied
while we're in here. All right,

552
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:30,250
well we're just doing something. I
didn't really, I had all these debts,

553
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,440
that script I'm writing, so I get a,
what's this? Oh, those are, those are Dad,

554
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,800
dad's keys. He said Daddy's
keys. Can you say dad does car

555
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,600
as car
is getting fixed.

556
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,040
I had an orange cone and my car and
all of a sudden the engine light. Yeah,

557
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:50,890
don't touch.

558
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,090
It was on the highway and this is random
orange cone and I couldn't swerve away

559
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,830
from it or I caused an accident.

560
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:59,190
So I just drove over and went underneath
the car and I was getting off the

561
00:35:59,191 --> 00:35:59,851
highway and it was,

562
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:04,530
I just heard it under the
car was set Minnie mouse?

563
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,810
Yes. You want to go watch many moms? Huh?

564
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,280
What do you say here? She does a
football. Football. What do you say?

565
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,780
You say please? Now what he say,
Hey Danks please. And thanks.

566
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:23,640
That's why you gotta be a good
kid. Oh. Oh, I get a kiss.
Your Mama and Mama. Yeah,

00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,690
See that's the fucking song I was trying
to remember from last week and I want

603
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:33,010
to thank all the podcasts
listeners letting me know

607
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,510
said it. And then they had those
fucking women in the background.

608
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,880
[inaudible] Papa,
boom.

609
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,000
You're telling me you couldn't
write a fucking song back dead.

610
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,680
I mean Jesus Christ.
Maybe because it's so simple.

611
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,720
It sounds so simple that you think he
could do what? I don't know. So anyways,

612
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,780
it is. Oh fuck. Why did I play that?

613
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:13,270
And I want to be singing at the
whole God damn podcast again.

614
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:17,500
I don't like to repeat myself, at
least not on purpose. What's going on?

615
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:21,990
It's bill Burke. It is the Monday
morning podcast for Monday, uh,

616
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,880
December 20th.
Oh my God.

617
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,140
Only five more days till Christmas.
I only have half. Shut up.

618
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:33,500
You fucking all right.
I'm not even this angry week.

619
00:41:33,501 --> 00:41:36,470
I'm just trying to figure out how I'm
going to situate myself on the bed.

620
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,600
I don't want to put my laptop in my lap.
You know what I mean? Why would you,

621
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,480
why won't you put it in your lap?
It's cool. The little dude. Um,

622
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,720
this is why, because it gives off
radiation and I like my balls.

623
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,710
I think the Illuminati came
up with the laptop, you know,

624
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,640
and they know we're too stupid to stick
at exactly where they want us to put it

625
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,030
so they can fin out the fucking
heard. So they go, you know,

626
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,990
with their evil voices. Why don't
we just, it the laptop, we call it,

627
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:10,190
they let up days, put it in their lap
and they fucking die. The infidels,

628
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,570
that was half Arab, half Italian. So
make sure I get notes from both of you.

629
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,350
Um,
yes it is December 20th.

630
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,000
I just came off of a
fabulous week out in Bray,

631
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,130
California and I want to
tell you guys something.

632
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:30,131
If you're ever in a situation where you
have a lot of vacation time and you're

633
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:34,520
just like, fuck, where the
hell can I go? You know,

634
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,320
you only go around once in this world,

635
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,920
where can I go to vacation to summer
does not what rich people say.

636
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,580
We live in the city and we
summer out in the Hamptons.

637
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,770
I'd love to summer somewhere when
that'd be awesome. Jesus Christ.

638
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,530
How much fucking money do you
have to have? They have two homes.

639
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,300
This is where I live during the year.
And then I summer,

640
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,250
we spooned no linters done and boom.

641
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,780
Bhutto's know doing what?

642
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:09,650
Visiting the fucking money that you're
not paying taxes, taxes on. You know,

643
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,490
I don't give a fuck.
I didn't know what I'm talking about here.

644
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,060
I was onto something there and then I
completely lost it because I thought I

645
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,520
wasn't recording here. Um, oh, I know.

646
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,460
I was out in Bray California this
weekend and I got to tell you,

647
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,570
I had a miserable experience the last
couple of times I went there and the only

648
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:30,980
reason why I was miserable is because
nobody showed up. And Lo and behold,

649
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,910
this time I came out there and the
fucking place was packed all weekend and I

650
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,630
had one of the best
weekends of, uh, of 2010.

651
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:43,520
So I want to thank everybody
who came out to my shows, uh,

652
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,680
out at the Improv in Bray California.

653
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,690
Actually had some people from La
came out and a, I had like 12,

654
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,460
uh,
Mexicans,

655
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,770
different Mexican fans coming up saying
you have some Latino fence. Okay,

656
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,310
hang in there.
We will spread the word out to Ontario.

657
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:06,400
So I want to thank you guys. Grassy
us. It's the only word I know. Mucho.

658
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:10,830
Grassiness Rosetta stone.
I'm a Rio.

659
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,450
Ah, thank you very much. And yellow.
That's my only Spanish words.

660
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:21,800
I caramba. Yeah, Shit like that, that I've
seen in like cartoons when I was a kid.

661
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:27,830
Um, so anyways, I don't know what the
fuck did talk about this week because a,

662
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,110
I am technically,
I'm on vacation.

663
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,590
Like Axel Foley had Beverly Hills Cop.
I'm not investigating anything.

664
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm out here in La with my
Mumford fucking sweatshirt.

665
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,690
You know what I realized? I just
realized this podcast is going to suck.

666
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,310
You know why I have too much
other shit on my mind because a,

667
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,290
as much as I'm mocking people who
haven't started this shopping,

668
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:53,390
I'm one of those people. I
haven't started it yet. And uh,

669
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,360
it really fucked up because I
did like six weekends in a row.

670
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:02,310
So I just focused on the road work and
I did not deal with the fact that I

671
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:04,650
haven't done any sort of
Christmas shopping yet.

672
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,970
So now I have to go out there today.
It's fucking raining.

673
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,560
I bet in this weather since I went to
Seattle right after Thanksgiving and I'm

674
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:18,240
ready to blow my fucking brains out and
went to Seattle and I also went to San

675
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,540
Francisco and all those fucking
assholes. We're just like, oh, you bring,

676
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,060
you bring the bed where the with you?
You know, I don't, I don't know. It was,

677
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:25,950
it was great last week.
So you know what,

678
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:31,020
considering I bought the droid phone,
does anybody know how to shut that off?

679
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,450
Dry Aid every time you turn it on.

680
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,010
My phone says that I brought the droid
incredible and every time I turned it on,

681
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,640
first of all it takes 10 minutes for it
to turn on. And then about, you know,

682
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,860
eight minutes in it goes dried and I
don't think there's a way to shut it off.

683
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,930
That's one of those
fucking advertising things,

684
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,440
make it look nice and loud and obnoxious.

685
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,000
So everyone around we'll hear it and be
like, Ooh, I want my phone to do that.

686
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,700
All right.
I'm still waiting for that.

687
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:03,930
Like I hope that phone does not take
over as much as I love it cause uh,

688
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,520
I fly too much,
you know,

689
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,880
and at the end of the flights when it's
okay to turn your cell phones back on,

690
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,590
I don't want to hear like draw, draw,
draw, draw void on the fucking plane, put,

691
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:17,880
you know, I'm going to, um,
but anyways, yeah, I haven't,

692
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:21,140
I haven't started in my
Christmas shopping and uh,

693
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,140
I don't want to be that Douche just
goes out and gets the gift certificates.

694
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,090
You know that, you know that person, you
go out, you buy him something thoughtful.

695
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,910
What are they into?
A,

696
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:35,850
what did I hear a mentioned that
they wanted or something like that.

697
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:38,550
And you put a lot of thought and you
drive around now that isn't right.

698
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,150
Drive over here that isn't right. Bam.
And then you find it and they're like,

699
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,520
aw man, thanks a lot. Right.

700
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,600
And they give you like a fucking, yeah,
he waiting to see what they got you right.

701
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:56,220
Do you put some thought in?
Do you feel this way about me too?

702
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,881
And what do they do?

703
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:00,870
They hand you a gift certificate to
the fucking olive garden. You know,

704
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,470
it's like you fucking asshole.
You know,

705
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,980
I drove all over fucking
town and you just, you just,

706
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,200
and not even a good restaurant. That's
an, that's another thing too. Um,

707
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,800
if somebody gives you a gift certificate
to a restaurant, don't fucking go.

708
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,170
Don't even fucking go.
All right.

709
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,920
What sort of respectable restaurant
gives out gift certificates?

710
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,620
You know what I mean? That's, that's
just like one step above fast food.

711
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,750
You know what Douche bag of the week is?

712
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,670
Anybody who goes out and
does Christmas shopping,

713
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,120
it just gets a bunch of fucking
gift certificates. Hey, you go,

714
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:39,100
you fucking figure out what
you want is some money.

715
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,460
Why don't you just come in and take a
fucking handful of cash and throw it on

716
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:42,881
the floor,

717
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,480
like have some goddamn whore and watched
me crawl around on my hands and knees

718
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:50,680
picking it up. You know, like I
just gave you a bad lap dance,

719
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,130
but you got enough money to not bitch
to management a, you'll have the really,

720
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:56,050
that's what I get is you
have fucking hundred.

721
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,870
Don't spend it all in one place.
All right?

722
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,050
You fucking cheap bastards.

723
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:10,051
I'm talking to you and you and you just
gotta be at least three people on this

724
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:14,410
podcast that do that shit.
He fucking tight Fox.

725
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,390
Right?
And then what do you do?

726
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:20,410
You gather up all your nice gifts that
people put thought into and you just,

727
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,430
you know, walk out of the house. You
know, you don't give a fuck, right?

728
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,590
Fuck it. Right. It's
just the drinking water.

729
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,130
We can pour the shit in there.
Well that kept me the corner office.

730
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:35,771
I swear to God,

731
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:40,120
if somebody gets me a fucking
gift certificate this weekend,

732
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:43,780
I'm going to do some of the not, this is
Christmas this weekend. Five days away.

733
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:47,170
Yeah. Be Saturday. I'm going to take
that fucking thing. Oh, thanks a lot.

734
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,680
And I'm going to slice their
juggler like James Bond level,

735
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:55,570
fucking paper cut and just watch that
blood right off the side of their fucking

736
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,660
neck. All right, so you
learned something about me.

737
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,520
You already knew I was an angry son of
a bitch, but I hate give certificates.

738
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,600
I can't stand them.

739
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,650
I would rather get an ugly sweater
from an older relative than dent than a

740
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,110
fucking gift certificate.
That's just so you know he did.

741
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:19,000
That's just the fucking tap out.
You know shorty,

742
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:23,020
man, it'd be really busy. Oh really? Oh,
I've been laying in a hammock all year.

743
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,390
You Lazy. Fuck. Now you don't give a shit.

744
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,650
Why am I such a fucking Dick?

745
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,570
Somebody I knew every year would get me
a fucking gift certificate and you know,

746
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,050
I should have just gave it
right back to him. I never did.

747
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,840
I always gave him a nice gift thing. Can
I, you're gonna you're going to notice,

748
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:45,100
right? Nothing. Nothing.

749
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,470
Oh, we shit. All right. There you go.
This your first rent for the week.

750
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,080
Did that make you feel better? I'd
like to hit. Why? Why don't I have a,

751
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:55,030
why don't I have a podcast
where I give thanks.

752
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,860
I give thanks to everyone who came
out to my shows this year. You know,

753
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,861
I give thanks to the universe for allowing
me to fuck up enough in my personal

754
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:08,560
life to bless me with an
a new hour of material.

755
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,470
I've got to tell you, man, my fucking act
is right where I needed to be. And uh,

756
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,480
my next Gig is an until, uh, the
weekend, I believe of January 13th.

757
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,510
Um, I'm going to be in Atlantic
city with a, this is the show.

758
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,330
Jim Norton put this thing
together. It's Norton, myself,

759
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,440
Jim Breuer and David tell all on
one show. All right. The Miami Heat,

760
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,930
the Mount Rushmore, if you will,
of a stand of a standup comedy.

761
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,800
I can't see Mount Rushmore. That'd be all
time greats. Let's go with Miami Heat.

762
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,290
All right, let's go with
that. How about we say that?

763
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,490
So anyways,
that's my next show.

764
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,710
So they have this weird thing
where I'm off for like a month,

765
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,030
but I also have to stay sharp.

766
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:57,230
So my girls all excited that I have a
month off and I'm actually doing a show

767
00:50:57,231 --> 00:50:58,064
tonight

768
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:04,730
and I was trying to tell her that
I, I have to stay sharp, you know,

769
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,080
I've got to stay on my toes.

770
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,580
I can't just sit around
fucking roasted chestnuts.

771
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,790
Does anybody do that anymore
than anybody ever had a chestnut?

772
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,910
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

773
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,200
Jack Frost nipping at your news.

774
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,490
There's no internet or
fucking cell phones,

775
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:30,480
so we have to talk to one
another. Um, all right.

776
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,270
What, you know, something,
something I mentioned,

777
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,140
they're actually tied into something that
somebody was talking about. Oh, they,

778
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:39,230
you're talking about die hard fans.
I'm talking about sports here.

779
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:41,480
Somebody said a bill,
just like the Yankees,

780
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:46,030
the Celtics purchased the last
championship with Kevin Garnett. I love,

781
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,990
and people do half ass research.
You know,

782
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,100
didn't you forget a couple of
other guys that we also bought? Um,

783
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,620
it's not, it's not even the purchasing
of Garnette that bothers me.

784
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:02,030
It's the delusion Boston's fans
have when they cheer for Garnette,

785
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,240
that mother fucker kissed the
Shamrock in the center of the court.

786
00:52:05,241 --> 00:52:08,150
Like it was his homecoming,
like he was from Boston.

787
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,180
Like he yearned for playing for that
team at Boston's fans ate that shit up.

788
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,910
Totally bought into that shit.
Uh,

789
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:21,110
when in actuality it was just
another purchase for a championship.

790
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,210
How do you feel knowing your
fellow Bostonians got duped? Uh,

791
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:30,080
the bullshit fan base I see in Boston
makes me want to puke in my soup.

792
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,450
And it happens in a bunch of
other cities to, uh, sorry,

793
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:38,300
I, I can't read out loud and I'm
also reading this at a fucking angle.

794
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:42,800
Let's get some fucking stomach cancer
here. Put the laptop here. Uh, where was,

795
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,440
where was I? Uh, you have die
hard fans for all your teams,

796
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:50,150
but they're few and far in between few
and far between servers. How you say that?

797
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:50,961
Uh,

798
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:53,810
then you have just a bunch of stragglers
who suddenly come out of the woodwork

799
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:56,330
when their teams on top.
I live in New York and now in La,

800
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:59,330
in the past eight years I've
noticed an influx influx of pats,

801
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:01,070
fans and both of those cities.

802
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:05,000
All of a sudden everyone is
proud to be a patriots fan. Uh,

803
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:08,900
where were these fucks in the 90s?
Same goes for Laker fans.

804
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:13,220
Where will those assholes with
the flag on the car asked, uh,

805
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,100
with the flag and the car assholes
in the 90s. Explained this to me,

806
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:18,860
Bill and go ahead and shit on as
many front running New Yorkers,

807
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,610
Los Angelenos in Miami, schmucks
all you're like, yeah. Yeah. Dude.

808
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:27,210
You're basically explaining, uh, yeah,

809
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,220
that's how it works. Yeah. Where
were all the Yankee fans in the 80s?

810
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:35,670
Exactly. You can't say where were
all the patriots fans in the 90s.

811
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,490
Because once we got bill Parcells,
everybody jumped on board.

812
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,880
And then when Pete Carroll came in after
parcels fucked us that fat fuck that

813
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:50,091
fat fuck Egomaniac who never won a
championship without bill Belicheck is his

814
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:55,290
defensive coordinator who you will
need to cook to do, do groceries.

815
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,860
He says that right before our Superbowl
puts his fucking house up for sale.

816
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:03,861
What a cunt fucking were overrated
bill Parcells if you want your uniforms

817
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:08,670
changed and you want to make it
to the playoffs, he's your guy.

818
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,100
But if you want to win
the super bowl you got,

819
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:15,420
you better have bill Belicheck on
your staff. All right. Yeah, I, yeah,

820
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,230
Your Bandwagon Fence Bandwagon fans are,
are uh,

821
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,910
the majority of the fan base.

822
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:23,220
There's no reason to build
stadiums as big as they are.

823
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:25,210
If they're actually talking
about die hard fans,

824
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,560
you'd only need like a one level,
you know,

825
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:32,100
you could have those old school
like high school stadiums, you know,

826
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:36,450
with a wind whip through the
end zones. Uh, yeah, absolutely.

827
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,980
That everybody is guilty of
that. And, um, basketball,

828
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:45,180
I hate to say it has followed what the,
uh,

829
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,060
what baseball has been doing,
where you just sort of try to buy the,

830
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,380
buy the championship every year
and it's really a free agency.

831
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,510
I guess it's kind of the player's fault.
You know what it was,

832
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,860
it was an overcorrection.
It was before free agency,

833
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,220
you know, the owners were
like the owner in, um,

834
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,350
what does that call the perfect stallion?
What the fuck's that?

835
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:11,160
I can never mean Robert Redford movie,
the natural perfect stallion.

836
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:15,570
How the fuck did I get?
I can't remember. Shit.

837
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:18,600
I can never remember the names of
actors, a movie. So I just, whatever I,

838
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:22,800
first thing I think of, I just fucking
throw it out there. Uh, the natural, yeah,

839
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:26,300
the owners were like that. They
totally fucking owned you. And um,

840
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,360
that's why the fucking white sox
through the world series in 1919,

841
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,690
that's what opened the door to that is
they were getting so underpaid and they

842
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,380
were scumbag pieces of shit.
Those two fucking things. Um,

843
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,460
so then [inaudible] free agency came
around and now there's been like a total

844
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:47,010
overcorrection.
Um,

845
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,580
and the players are toe
seem to be completely in
control and they can just all

846
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:56,370
pile on one fucking team. I don't know.
I don't like it. I don't like it. Yeah.

847
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,060
The Celtics bought the championship
apps a Fuckin lutely uh, but you know,

848
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,560
it's one of those deals.
What are they supposed to do?

849
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,950
That's what the Lakers were
buying them too. You know,

850
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:06,991
what are we supposed to do?

851
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:09,960
Sit back and watch them by all these
fucking championships and we're not

852
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:13,950
supposed to go out and
purchase one. You know, Coby,

853
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:18,090
Brian's sitting out there can't win shit.
So they buy him Shaq and Phil Jackson.

854
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,010
Fucking Gary Payton,
Robert Henri fucking Karl Malone.

855
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,170
Who else? I don't watch hoop. Every time
I turn it on, there's another fucking guy,

856
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,650
the guy who beat up the
crowd, Ron Artest, that guy.

857
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,270
What a, what the fuck are the
Celtics supposed to do? You know,

858
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,100
it'd be nice if they all sat down and
just said, look, this is fucking stupid.

859
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,160
Let's go back to the way it was. But I
just think that that's the way it is.

860
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,470
So anyways, yeah, they just pile on.

861
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,370
I think Garnette kiss the floor because
he was sick of playing in Minnesota and

862
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:54,760
he knew he finally had a chance to,
uh,

863
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,120
to win a championship after being the
fucking guy for all those years out there

864
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:05,410
in Minnesota and, and always
coming up short. So I dunno,

865
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,580
I don't fucking, I don't know. I don't
know shit about basketball, but yeah,

866
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:13,220
you're basically, yeah. Diehard fans,
diehard fans hanging in there. But uh,

867
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,250
I even think die hard
fans are full of shit.

868
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,880
There's a couple that will
actually sit there. Come on man.

869
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,330
You gotta be honest with you. I'm a die
hard fan. Your team is going to, and 14,

870
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:26,320
you're actually sitting down
watching that shit. You know,

871
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,550
sometimes you're such a die hard
fan. You can't go, you can't watch,

872
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,020
you know, I didn't watch the Celtics. I
went to a Celtics game the year before.

873
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:39,040
We bought all those guys
to win a championship. We
played the Toronto Raptors.

874
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:43,210
I had like court side fucking seats and
I almost fell asleep and it was just sad

875
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:47,410
looking at the parquet floor and looking
at the shamrock and just seeing it was,

876
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:50,560
it was, you know, it was hard to watch.

877
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,530
That doesn't mean I don't love
the Celtics, but you know,

878
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,710
sometimes you got to look away and
you know what, you fucking cunt,

879
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:03,670
you do the same thing. Stop acting
like you're all high and mighty.

880
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:06,760
You just hate the Patriots and
you're sick of seeing them.

881
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:09,610
Be honest with yourself.
All you sports fans,

882
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,670
who the fuck ever saw anybody in a sports
bar with the New Orleans Saints Jersey

883
00:58:14,861 --> 00:58:18,700
on ever 30 years of watching football?

884
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,050
I never fucking saw it.

885
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:24,610
And then last year there's like a whole
gang of them going, who dat? Who Dat?

886
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:29,170
Who Dat take? They gonna
beat them saints. It's like,

887
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,970
where the fuck did you guys come from?
The states were borderline.

888
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,110
They will like an expansion
franchise for like 40 years.

889
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,980
They couldn't even afford a
kicker with two whole feet.

890
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,730
They had a kicker with one and a
half fucking feet. That's, that's,

891
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,990
that's how fucking broke those guys were,
you know,

892
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,980
then they brought that football out there
with the helium in there so they could

893
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:57,940
have a feel good story. Oh by the way, um,

894
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:02,560
did you see how the jets,
when they got busted for cheating,

895
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:06,700
that fucking fag on the jets go?

896
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:11,701
Who to patriots are doing it to that
right there is known as a pulling a Cobie.

897
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:19,630
When you do that shit that's called
the shack fucks around on his wife too.

898
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,900
You know when you're down at the
police dude, you don't ever do that.

899
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,320
All right.
When you get busted for some shit,

900
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,560
you go into mister blonde mode,

901
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:33,470
you shut your fucking mouth
and you do your God damn time.

902
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:36,350
You don't start dragging other people.
And it was so passive aggressive.

903
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,480
I'm not trying to get anybody
in trouble. I'm just, you know,

904
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:41,180
if you just look at the tape,
I mean it's all there,

905
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,490
which was such a stupid, there's no
rule against lining up people there.

906
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:48,170
You can stand on the sideline,

907
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,780
you can all stand there
doing handstands if you want.

908
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,690
That's not what he got
busted for your green cunt.

909
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,690
He got busted for sticking
your fucking knee out

910
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,900
evidently on purpose.
How wrong was,

911
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,370
I tried to be nice last week and I
defended that Douche and it turns out, uh,

912
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,213
I dunno.

913
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,780
I like how they tried to act like that
was his decision and his decision alone.

914
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,320
That guy actually, he shut that guy.
The strength and conditioning coach.

915
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:19,280
That is a solid guy cause he just, he
took, he took the blame for that one.

916
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:23,180
The strength and conditioning coach.
He the only guy,

917
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:25,970
he's these the guy like
as far as moneymakers,

918
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:30,320
he's just above a fucking cheerleader and
he's saying like, he's on the sideline.

919
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:35,300
Hey listen guys, everybody fucking
line up the private over there.

920
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:38,600
They're blaming the private, you
know, give me a fucking break.

921
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,860
But I think sticking his knee
out was definitely his decision.

922
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:47,120
But as far as lining up on, on, on the
side, I don't give a fuck. So I love it.

923
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,390
So the jets cheated and this week the
panthers had somebody get up and drill,

924
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,990
drill, someone coming down the sidelines.
See this is what it's all coming out.

925
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:57,620
I love it. After all these years of
people saying the patriots are cheaters,

926
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:58,790
like no one else is doing it.

927
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:04,340
Like the Yankees weren't all taken
fucking roids [inaudible] along with the

928
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,710
fucking reds. Everybody
cheats. Do you guys watch that?

929
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:11,711
30 for 30 on Smu and how the entire
southwest conference football was played.

930
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,370
I hate to say it during the week of
Christmas, but there's no Santa Claus.

931
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:24,320
Everybody fucking cheats.
Everybody Cheats Booboo, booboo.

932
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:26,540
What song is that?
Remember that from fucking sesame street.

933
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,660
Everybody sleeps and they'd show like
turtles sleeping and you sit there almost

934
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:35,840
tearing up, not even knowing what the
fuck you were crying about. You know,

935
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,681
cause you're already knew it.

936
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:41,270
You could sense it even as a six year old
that the world was going to be full of

937
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:45,530
a bunch of selfish cons. Hey,
you know something? I have
a video for you this week.

938
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,480
How many fucking agonizing minutes am I
into this podcast? 22 fucking minutes.

939
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,041
Jesus Christ.

940
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,760
I gotta be honest with you
people sometimes this podcast
is easy and other times

941
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:59,000
I feel like I'm shoveling
what? Snow. And uh,

942
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:02,960
this is one of these times I feel
like I'm shoveling wet fucking snow.

943
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:09,230
Uh, I'm sick of talking about football. I
can't talk about it any fucking more. Uh,

944
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,600
thank you to Green Bay,

945
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:14,930
Wisconsin though I do want to say thank
you for that Christmas gift for allowing

946
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:18,350
us to win that game that we
shouldn't have one yesterday and a,

947
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,110
do you guys realize,

948
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:24,030
actually bet the Patriots after telling
you guys all if given 14 and a half

949
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,480
fucking points
I bought into the hype.

950
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,020
You know what a moron all year. I've been
saying, I hate our fucking difference.

951
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:35,020
Our defense lifts up 24 to
30 points every fucking game.

952
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:38,530
We have two good weeks in a row.
I even said last week on the podcast,

953
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:41,080
you think I'm buying into this shit.
Like we're going to win a super bowl.

954
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:45,100
You don't just play two good games in
a row and fucking wipe out 11 bad ones.

955
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:49,340
And after saying all of that,
what do I do?

956
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,670
I fucking bet the Patriots because
they're fucking quarterback was out.

957
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:58,800
And I'm a fan of Lsu. I don't ever
remember that guy fucking doing anything.

958
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,150
You know what it was that guy played
at Lsu right before it started watching

959
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:06,620
college football. But my experience of
watching Lsu is they have fucking, ah,

960
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,790
they always have two quarterbacks,
a white dude and a black dude.

961
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,890
And they cheered. They just Sorta, I
don't know what they'd do. They just a a,

962
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:19,110
they just switch them off and it's not
the same guys every, every fucking year.

963
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:22,990
They got a new white dude, new
black dude, and they just, uh,

964
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,860
put the white guy in there, Dan.
He's too fucking white. Look it up.

965
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,670
Take a net sec sick. The black
guy in there, Jesus Christ.

966
01:03:30,671 --> 01:03:33,460
He won't stand in a pocket.
Get the white guy back in there.

967
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:38,670
I'll tell you if they could somehow
Amalga just stick those two guys together.

968
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:40,910
Add it probably wouldn't work.

969
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,340
I know it worked for Paul Mccartney
and Michael Jackson when they sang that

970
01:03:45,341 --> 01:03:48,690
fucking song.
Was that one of the worst songs ever?

971
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,410
Wait a minute. Was that him?
Who Sang Ebony and ivory.

972
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,790
That was them.
Right.

973
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:59,060
I was thinking of Eddie Murphy and he
made it Stevie wonder and Frank Sinatra.

974
01:03:59,061 --> 01:04:02,270
That was the sketch. Yeah. Was that
one of the worst fucking songs ever?

975
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,810
Ebony and a Boobie.

976
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:12,340
Somebody looked at the piano and
just came up with that corn bullshit.

977
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,280
You know what I mean? It's like, yeah,
we all want everybody to get along,

978
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,370
but do you have to try to make
us throw up in the process?

979
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:28,080
Okay.
Why is happy shit so nauseated?

980
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:32,860
Can anybody explain that to me during
the week of fucking Christmas, you know?

981
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:34,103
Yeah.

982
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,900
What is it about watching like a kid
trip and fall and start crying and then

983
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:42,740
looking for his mother? What is it about
that that's so fucking funny. Yeah.

984
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:47,850
You know when they get up and they're
crying so bad that they're not even making

985
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,684
any noise.

986
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,103
Okay.

987
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,540
Yeah. It just fucking
makes me laugh. You know,

988
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,850
watching my dog gets so excited
that it wants to go outside and it,

989
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,160
and it goes to make it quick,
you know,

990
01:05:03,161 --> 01:05:07,390
fucking Barry Sanders cut and its legs
front legs go up from underneath them and

991
01:05:07,391 --> 01:05:12,320
I hear him hit his jaw
off the floor. Yes. Okay.

992
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,670
Gets up and fucking does that
Little Harlem shake to try to,

993
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,850
it's just fucking funny.
I don't know what it is.

994
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,780
Maybe because I grew up watching the three
stooges. I Dunno why, but watching, uh,

995
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:27,880
watching people fuck up makes me smile.
What is wrong with me?

996
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:32,950
I really am destined to be alone.
Um, all right, speaking of Christmas,

997
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,800
um,
last week I made the mistake of,

998
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:40,801
I told you I bought a different kind of
Christmas tree for the holiday season.

999
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:45,790
Whoop de Doo be Doo. Um, I don't know,

1000
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,680
the past couple of years just
to, just to, you know, for,

1001
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:52,120
for new listeners this week, you know,
I don't know what happened. I just,

1002
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:53,050
I had last couple of years,

1003
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,750
I went there and I looked at these
Christmas trees and they would like,

1004
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:00,460
they will like symmetrical and
there would be like, you know,

1005
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,850
six inches of tree trunk and then
they'd have like these perfectly level

1006
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:04,660
branches.

1007
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,430
I just thought they look bad ass like
that Japanese garden sort of Zen look and

1008
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:13,870
shit. And I loved it and I thought
that, you know, I thought, you know,

1009
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,460
I knew I was going to get shit,

1010
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:19,510
but I thought at least a couple of
people would come out of the woodwork and

1011
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:23,590
dare to break free fucking tradition.
Let's read some of these uh,

1012
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,240
these uplifting comments here.
A bill,

1013
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:31,360
this guy tried to write day
Yom and he spelled damn yum.

1014
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,310
D a m Y U M Damn Yum bill.

1015
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:37,990
That is Charlie Brown's tree.

1016
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,790
Looks more like an anorexic
low hand than Thurone.

1017
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:46,690
All Right, Nice Tree Dick. You
see, this is what it's like.

1018
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:49,390
You guys want to get into entertainment.
This is what you get all week.

1019
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:53,350
This is pretty much the tone every once in
a while. Hey, great special. I loved it.

1020
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:57,190
But other than that, that tree makes
the peanuts crew look like ballers.

1021
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,030
I would rather decorate my coat
rack then that Skank Shrub,

1022
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,860
Jesus Christ. Somebody wrote this
as the soundtrack to that tree.

1023
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,410
I don't get Internet in this
fucking room for some reason,

1024
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:15,100
so I can't click on that. Uh, it
looks like a used up toilet brush.

1025
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,050
Uh, it looks like the tree, the tree,

1026
01:07:20,051 --> 01:07:23,770
the three stooges would have
thrown another picture up
when you throw the lights

1027
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:27,880
on it. Oh, look at that. And I
liked that one. That's a twofer.

1028
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:33,250
Made Fun of the fucking tree and
made fun of my bare walls. Um,

1029
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,770
yeah. People, you've got a
glimpse of how I live my life.

1030
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,490
This is why I'm debt free. I enjoy
in your credit card debt. You can't,

1031
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,620
I know how to live.

1032
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:48,910
I buy a Christmas tree. I can
actually afford. All right. Uh, yeah,

1033
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:52,660
you probably should have got the other
tree. What are you a fag? I like it.

1034
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,100
I wanted a Charlie Brown tree.

1035
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,670
I was going to buy a real tree
and cut off half the branches.

1036
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:59,230
So it was like Charlie Brown tree.

1037
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:04,231
And my girl went out and bought one of
herself so she could say it's hers and I

1038
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:07,630
can't cut it up. Okay. It's like I
was kind of like kind of on my side.

1039
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,940
So what does that 20 against one for me?

1040
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,450
Looks like a cell phone tower in disguise.

1041
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,830
Jesus. I'm getting killed here. All
right. Uh, let me see something.

1042
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,400
Everybody's just going, Charlie Brown
on me here. What do we to do? What?

1043
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,180
I was genuinely excited to see your tree.
Where did you pick it out?

1044
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,390
What'd you pick it out?
Champ. Fucking Afghanistan.

1045
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,160
And actually looks like something that
would grow out of the soil in Hiroshima

1046
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,800
now. Seriously, I'm Grad.

1047
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:42,500
Glad you're going out of the ordinary with
the tree this year. Good. Good for you.

1048
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:45,590
But I had no idea trees
could get hepatitis.

1049
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,350
Merry Christmas. Oh look who's here. Nia.

1050
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,700
Everybody is agreeing with you.
You want to come on the podcast?

1051
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:01,070
Wait a second, let me, uh, let me
get your mic up here. Here you go.

1052
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,220
Hi. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Let me
make sure you read. Go ahead, talk it.

1053
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,570
Merry Christmas, everybody. There you
go. Talk a little more. All right.

1054
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,310
Happy holidays. All right. Um, would
you like to hear some of these comments?

1055
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:18,380
They all agree with you about the tree,
about the tree of the holiday season.

1056
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:22,760
Boy, uh, maybe I should have known what
to expect when you scribed the tree,

1057
01:09:22,761 --> 01:09:27,190
but I didn't expect that. No offense,
but that just looks awful, man.

1058
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,620
I have to admit that that one
hurts more than people who,

1059
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,690
somebody said it looked
like a cell phone tower.

1060
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,570
Like those ones are actually
funny. This guy that, that was,

1061
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,960
that one came from the heart.
That will really was, uh, well

1062
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,600
I'm a fucking termite and even I wouldn't
take a shit on that fucked up tree.

1063
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:49,820
Jesus. Wow. Sweet tree.

1064
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:53,210
Not Oh, lame. Yeah. No,
you know what that is?

1065
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:57,380
That's like from a fucking anthrax fan
who's like fucking 48 now and has three

1066
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,390
kids.
That's from like a Wayne's world.

1067
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,190
Then they always used to say that not
the first time I saw not was anthrax.

1068
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:08,480
That guy had it shaved into his
chest. The word, not an OT. Yeah.

1069
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:10,430
The guy who then
eventually shaved his head.

1070
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,790
You know those guys who go bald or always
like Harry, like apes, the guy, uh,

1071
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,990
the guy who was on that VH one show
where they had the super group.

1072
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:24,080
Oh, uh, yeah. And he had
the long beard. Yeah,

1073
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:26,780
the long beard. Shaved head. But
just along the long beard. Yeah,

1074
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:28,430
I know who you're talking about.
I forget what his name is.

1075
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:31,220
I remember when I shaved my head because
I'm losing my hair and you love me.

1076
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,640
Maybe you should fucking a
up that you love the shape.

1077
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,060
Love it when you had the shaved
head. I say bring it back. Well,

1078
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:41,920
I think nature is going to bring
it back for [inaudible], but well,

1079
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,020
it's good to know that you still look
good. Well, you know, I can't do that.

1080
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:47,920
Fuck it. Rogaine, Propecia shit.
I just can't, I, I just know it.

1081
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:50,780
I know how it works in life.
You don't get your cake and eat it.

1082
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,570
Nature's going to get you. Oh, you
want to keep your fucking hair. Okay.

1083
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,420
Why don't we just fucking take
a shot to your goddamn liver.

1084
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,040
Those people are going to
lose their livers. You know,
they're full heads of hair.

1085
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,370
What did I walk into?
And I were talking about the tree.

1086
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,530
The anorexic tree. Yes. So have
you done any Christmas shopping?

1087
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,710
Let's do quick little interview. Uh,
get the people all caught up with you.

1088
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:17,850
Have you, uh, look at that tree. I think
that tree looks fucking cool as hell.

1089
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:21,050
It's not the Charlie Brown tree. You
have fucking asshole. Wait a minute.

1090
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:25,270
You had to symmetrical Charlie Brown
tree was all brown. Call you guys. Well,

1091
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,400
you have to take a picture of the tree.
Now that it's decorated though. What?

1092
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,310
I think there's a debate.

1093
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:34,370
It looks like a fucking fucking Broadway
singer with aids because it's all

1094
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:37,980
glitter and skinny.
What a lot of them died of that.

1095
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:43,530
They do. They do dress flashy. You need
to stop with, well, I'm not saying that.

1096
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:45,720
I agree with that. I'm saying
that that's what they would write.

1097
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:49,650
That's your out for everything offensive.
They, I'm not saying I agree with it.

1098
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:53,730
It's just how it is.
Fucking dirt bag.

1099
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,410
Oh, I saw that movie in the
band played on, right. I,

1100
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,040
I don't want [inaudible] guys,
friends.

1101
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:06,030
I don't mind any guys drive driving
garbage trucks holding their other garbage

1102
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:10,840
truck boyfriend rocking them slowly.
It's not only gay people who can,

1103
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,360
I know it's that. It's that and truck
drivers. That's not what it was.

1104
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,730
Let's move on. It's Christmas.
Huh? I know it is now.

1105
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:21,390
Let's talk about aids and let's
talk. Let's not play now. Come on.

1106
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:25,660
This is fucking hilarious. I never saw
me. It was a long time ago. I don't know.

1107
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,850
How did the song go? I don't
know. There was a song. Yeah,

1108
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:34,080
I got in the bed.
Eat often happen.

1109
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,410
Where are you asking me about Christmas
shopping? Wasn't it about San Francisco?

1110
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:41,700
Isn't that where they basically don't
know Harvey milk came in and then that

1111
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:46,320
other guy shot him in the head or is
that a different milk? It was milk. Oh,

1112
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:49,050
you want to Sean Penn. Can I
show you the most? I can't even,

1113
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,240
I won't even show this to you
because I love you too much.

1114
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:55,990
Somebody sent me a youtube video. You
guys have to fuck never stopped you. Huh?

1115
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,030
Showing me horrific. This is why you
don't get affection. I try to be,

1116
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:04,390
I try to give it to you and you
slap it down. Look at that. What?

1117
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,110
Let me, what do I got to replay?
What just happened there?

1118
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:11,370
I said I'd love to show this to you
and, but it hurts you to, uh, you know,

1119
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,410
I'd love you to whatever the fuck.
Nice thing I just said.

1120
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:18,720
He don't even remember any of it's
two seconds ago, but I meant it.

1121
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,970
All right.
There's a movie called Feast.

1122
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,290
This is going to be on the Mlm podcast
where you guys feel free to go on there

1123
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,590
and trashed my fucking Christmas
tree. I like it. I'm sticking by,

1124
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,500
you know what this is like,

1125
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,130
this is like the new kid who comes to
school and you guys all pick on him and I

1126
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:35,880
prefer friend him cause I'm stronger. I
can step outside the group. Look at me.

1127
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,980
I'm the hero.
It's just a tree and I'll fuck you.

1128
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,090
All right. There's a movie, there's
a movie called a feast. Yeah.

1129
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:49,350
Have you ever heard of that movie?
Okay. I don't know what's going on.

1130
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,540
I can't, I don't want to, oh, that's my
phone. What is your cell phone sound like?

1131
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:59,190
The tornado drill from the 50.
[inaudible]

1132
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,010
cause you notice there's no, there's no
good ring tones. You know what I've got?

1133
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,210
Go, go get the a, you know what? I'll
let my podcast listeners decide them.

1134
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:09,060
Ringtone. Go grab my phone if you
don't mind. All right. All right.

1135
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:12,310
Now I'm going to describe this fucking
thing where you're, okay, there's this,

1136
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,810
this, this movie out there.
Feast that I, I have to rent.

1137
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,330
I don't know what's going on,

1138
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:24,331
but there is a woman tied down and this
beast that looks like a little person

1139
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:30,460
that was a skinned alive
basically comes out of nowhere.

1140
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:33,650
And
Fox,

1141
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,130
this woman in the mouth and
finishes there. I set it,

1142
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,740
I set it and it happened so fast.

1143
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:43,690
I didn't even think that it was real.
And uh,

1144
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,660
I don't know. That's when
I have to ask. It's like,

1145
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:47,890
you're not really trying to scare me.

1146
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,620
You're just trying to either gross
me out or make me fucking laugh,

1147
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,280
but if you really want to get grossed out,
um,

1148
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:57,850
here's another youtube video of the week.
Somebody sent one in.

1149
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,700
I only got like two minutes into
this thing and I had to shut it off.

1150
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:05,830
Human cryogenics. All right,
so if you guys, you know,

1151
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:07,690
isn't that funny?
I told her to go pick up my phone.

1152
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:11,440
She goes and answers it and now he's
talking to the person, you know,

1153
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,220
what would you broads be doing if you
weren't running your fucking yaps?

1154
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:20,410
You know, I, it's like I don't
understand it. They just,

1155
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,790
it just have to be talking.

1156
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,480
All right, whatever. So human
cryogenics, red sox fans,

1157
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:30,850
we're all familiar with that.
You know what I mean?

1158
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,550
Ted Williams head,

1159
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:37,480
I believe is upside down sitting on a
tuna can and they accidentally broke his

1160
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:42,190
nose.
I'm talking about Ted Williams.

1161
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,040
They froze. Do you believe in a
pick up the microphone. Oh God.

1162
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,610
You're going to be eating on the podcast.
You know,

1163
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,070
I think this is good that you're on
the podcast. It's, it's, you know,

1164
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:53,850
it's the holidays. It should. It should
be family April. I don't like it.

1165
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,640
Then some people, some people
don't like my Christmas tree. Look,

1166
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:00,220
first of all the Internet is like a,

1167
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,110
you know like when you hang up those
lights to track bugs, Zap them.

1168
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:08,580
That's what the Internet is for. Cuts,
you know what I mean? They, yeah,

1169
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,180
they just gravitate towards it.

1170
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:14,170
All these miserable fucks who have all
the power in the world to change their

1171
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:18,610
life and live the wonderful life that
we're living on this fucking bed without a

1172
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:22,390
headboard.
I've been trying,

1173
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,220
you know somebody's trash
just because we don't have,

1174
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,960
we don't have any pictures on the wall.

1175
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,880
I'm trying to teach people how to live a
minimalist debt free life. First of all,

1176
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:32,440
we don't need pictures on the wall.

1177
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,960
We have our picture on
the wall that bill hates.

1178
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,100
We have the live of pictures just getting
way too fucking intimate, but women.

1179
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:43,510
But we have a picture above the
fucking bed of it. Looks like.

1180
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,270
I thought you've talked about this
poetry. Have I talked about it? All right,

1181
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:49,930
well I already brought it up. Yeah.
It's like every time I look up,

1182
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:54,320
there's another deer, can't see it, and
it's staring right into the fucking Lens.

1183
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,930
It's not black and white.
It's not in color. It's Sorta
in that Blair witch look.

1184
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,200
It's kind of a Sepia tone. I fucking
hate it. And you know something.

1185
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,300
I know you hate him yet. And I, whoa.
I almost fell in between the Tutsis.

1186
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:07,540
We need a headboard. Homeless
just fell off the back of the bed.

1187
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,150
But personally I'd like to point out the
fact that you went out and just bought

1188
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:14,390
that fucking photo. Yep, I did.
And hung it. Right. Look at that.

1189
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,750
And you just hung it right over the bed.
How can we didn't ask me about it?

1190
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,270
I don't know. I just thought it would
be nice. Really. What if I get a poster?

1191
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,590
A fucking Larry Bird.

1192
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:29,420
He played for the Celtics and he used
to do this thing where he would always

1193
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:31,970
wipe the sweat off the side of his feet.
So I'm going to get that.

1194
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:36,300
So it looks like one of his fucking
blonde balls is going to fall out shorts.

1195
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,150
And I'm going to hang that over the bed.

1196
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:42,040
I don't want to see how
fucking long that lasts. Um,

1197
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,290
I just want to say that we have a
mantle and there's pictures all over the

1198
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,180
mantle of all of our annual something
that, those are the pictures we have.

1199
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:52,370
You know what this is. This is hilarious
how innocent you are with the Internet.

1200
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,630
What do you mean
you don't defend your position?

1201
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,840
All you do doing now is
prolonging the arguments.

1202
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,790
So now they'll do like really do,

1203
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,610
why don't you put a picture
up of him if you have them?

1204
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,310
Cause they just want more
material to trash you.

1205
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:11,300
But they haven't even seen her apartment.
Who are they to say anything? Exactly.

1206
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:13,460
I'm, I'm not, I'm just
saying what you're doing is,

1207
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,600
it's like with someone trashes
you [inaudible] fucking
white. You're legs are,

1208
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,660
I know. It's great. I just take them
out in a job interview when I get it.

1209
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,130
So he know. You just agree. Absolutely.
Whatever. Yeah, I'm horrible.

1210
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,160
I look like a puppet. Absolutely.
You're 100% and it kills it.

1211
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,800
That's what Madonna's done.
You're a fucking whore.

1212
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,530
I know you want to see my
[inaudible] check out my new book.

1213
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,480
I got it all over there. I got a close
up. Didn't she take an in that book?

1214
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:42,710
She took a close up of her fucking hoo
ha. I don't think so. Yeah, she did.

1215
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:46,730
I think she was fully knew but then there
wasn't a closeout I that wasn't that

1216
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:49,970
book. No. The sex book book
book was that, I don't know.

1217
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:51,560
I don't think there is
with the little red wagon.

1218
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:58,220
What was the last book that I read?
Actually that that book was, uh, my,

1219
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,550
I think was my favorite work by Madonna
and I thought it was their most honest

1220
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:06,110
work. You know who's standing out there
on the street looking like a fucking

1221
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:09,680
prostitute. Exactly.
Exactly. She looked good.

1222
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,640
She looked phenomenal. She looked really
good. I still bang that fucking cougar.

1223
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,770
Huh?
You know what I hate?

1224
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,380
You know what I love is that she's
gotten all their varicose veins.

1225
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:21,950
Fucking that's what I was just going
to talk about that, cause she's,

1226
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:24,740
everyone always talks about her
arms are so veiny. It's so gross.

1227
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:25,574
But you know what?

1228
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,150
Madonna works out everyday and that's
blood pumping through those veins.

1229
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:33,920
You can see life. That's what those
veins are. Oh, it's very inspirational.

1230
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:38,810
Yeah. Doesn't look aesthetic
though. She knows. She's
like, she's like somebody who,

1231
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,690
you know, she's no, you
know what she's like,

1232
01:19:41,691 --> 01:19:45,470
she's like Clint Eastwood in that
movie. Gran Torino. Torino. Yeah.

1233
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,850
I'd never been named that car.

1234
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:50,270
The grant and that grant from Eda duty
year to your impression of that. Oh,

1235
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:54,800
I forget to get off my lawn. Is that,
was it wanted? I can't remember.

1236
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:57,500
I didn't like that. Yeah. But
then I would say all racist ship,

1237
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,490
which people won't get that.

1238
01:19:58,491 --> 01:20:00,800
I'm making fun of the movie and I'll
think I believe it. Well that's what,

1239
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,500
that's what he did in the movie. He was
racist in any way around. But anyway.

1240
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:09,540
Oh yeah. Cause it's a Hollywood
wow. Because it's a holiday movie.

1241
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:13,690
Listen. Yes. Grand Torino that, that's,

1242
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:15,870
that's how she's treated like
the way he treated that car.

1243
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,900
That's way she's treating her body. Her
body is like in fucking mint condition.

1244
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,330
It is, you know, and all the
rest of us. What did we do?

1245
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,320
We fucking back into a car at a
worry about it. Slammed into a tree.

1246
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,530
That's how we treat our bodies. Damon
doesn't settle for second. Yeah,

1247
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,990
she's out there waxing it.

1248
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,830
She's the walking oil balls to the wall.

1249
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,420
Not the whole fucking old
school shit this week.

1250
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:48,840
So, uh, yes. I did go Christmas
shopping to answer your
dude. Go Christmas shopping.

1251
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,790
I have a little bit.
What did you get me?

1252
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:54,960
I'm not telling you what the surprise
you'll find out on me. A shirt.

1253
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:00,090
You know what sucks about being a guy is
the last time you get a good gift is I

1254
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:03,750
think when you're 11, the second you
turn 12, you start becoming an adult.

1255
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,980
Maybe get some like electronic shit.
You know,

1256
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,720
you just go into that, that
phase. We get shirts and uh,

1257
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:18,150
uh, organizers. This is a place
to put your wallet and your keys.

1258
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,270
I actually fucking love that.

1259
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:26,280
That's really unnecessary.

1260
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:37,170
Perfect casting, getting trashed. Here's
the perfect pushups. Merry Christmas.

1261
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:43,230
I'm fucking with you. Got me great gifts.
You have first year I was with you.

1262
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:47,010
You got me the drum sticks with my,
my initials and graved in him.

1263
01:21:47,011 --> 01:21:51,450
That was fucking adorable. Those were
great. That was cute. That was adorable.

1264
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:54,930
This was when, obviously bill and I
were first day. What are we doing here?

1265
01:21:54,931 --> 01:21:57,270
Too much of our life.
Let's get back to the podcast here.

1266
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:02,130
That was when we were talking about our
social security numbers that are seven,

1267
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:05,470
nine, eight, four. I was just gonna
say that was what I thought. I,

1268
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:12,480
you brought it up. I'm trying to get you
to stop talking about it. Fine. All right.

1269
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:15,150
Let me see if I've got a question
here that you can actually answer

1270
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:19,590
a where you can add to. I don't
think I have anything. You know what,

1271
01:22:19,591 --> 01:22:22,320
this fucking podcast, oh shit.
That I shut it off. I didn't,

1272
01:22:22,321 --> 01:22:26,460
did I please tell me I didn't. All
right, we're up to 42 minutes. Um,

1273
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,140
so listen, yes, I, uh,

1274
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:35,760
I got an offer for a corporate
gig on the day after Christmas

1275
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,640
and,
uh,

1276
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:43,170
Eagle Rock and I was wondering
if I can go do it. No,

1277
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:49,110
please. First of all, I have to
fucking lie. All right, second of all.

1278
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,690
No,
I'm just fucking with you.

1279
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,240
You always get mad at me when I do
fucking work kid. You know what? This,

1280
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:56,000
this whole fucking podcast and just,

1281
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:59,130
I just forgot I was even doing the
podcast and I'm just sitting here watching

1282
01:22:59,131 --> 01:23:02,170
you eat oatmeal. Do you have
any closing comments? I got,

1283
01:23:02,171 --> 01:23:04,500
I got to bring this home with something
funny here. Do you got anything?

1284
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,350
Anything you want to say? Oh, let's
talk about how I hurt my foot.

1285
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:12,120
Making fun of you fucking ex. I mean, Oh
yeah, I made fun of her exercise tapes.

1286
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,260
She,
she's in there like grunting and groaning

1287
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,510
doing this fucking exercise tape.

1288
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:22,630
And I walk in there and it's that dude
Bob from the biggest loser with is

1289
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:26,770
shredded head.
He like has like,

1290
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,710
he's, he works out too
much. Like he actually,

1291
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,110
you know the cuts people
want when they get abs,

1292
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:33,970
he has them on either
side of his forehead.

1293
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,280
His head is shredded.
He's in great shape.

1294
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,220
I'm pleased CVDS are no fucking jets.

1295
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:46,330
So she sits there and she starts telling
me how his DVDs are hard and all that.

1296
01:23:46,331 --> 01:23:50,740
I was like, fuck that guy. I can do that
God damn DVD. I'll be fine. Typical man.

1297
01:23:50,741 --> 01:23:52,240
Right.
And then what happens?

1298
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:56,530
I go to stretch before I do it because
I'm 42 years old and you're like, oh,

1299
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,960
you don't need to stretch you
as this whole stretching thing.

1300
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:02,410
And he fucking didn't and I ended
up screwing up my foot again.

1301
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,520
They're stretching in the
beginning. Yeah, that's bullshit.

1302
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,300
He didn't say he didn't do any
stretches for your back. Nothing.

1303
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:12,250
Nothing to stretch out your feet.

1304
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:14,050
And then the guy has the
fucking fucking jumping.

1305
01:24:14,051 --> 01:24:17,770
I got Bill Walton feed at this point. I
can't do that. God Damn Video Bill Walton.

1306
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:21,760
Bill Walton was a big fucking redhead
who smoked weed and college and hung

1307
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:25,780
around John Wooden and then all he
does is try to, like John Wooden was,

1308
01:24:25,781 --> 01:24:30,640
was this amazing coach who gave you all
this life advice and he's trying to be

1309
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:32,980
John Wooden junior
always giving out advice,

1310
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:36,280
always telling those stories and
he has his awful fucking voice.

1311
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:41,290
That's like it comes from the center of
his head and goes out as fucking broken

1312
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:45,280
nose.
[inaudible] we didn't do

1313
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:54,070
good. Ugh, fucking red
headed Frankenstein. Well,

1314
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:57,250
in the midst of that workout when there
was all that stuff going on with the

1315
01:24:57,251 --> 01:24:58,061
back,
I was like,

1316
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:00,970
why don't you stop and just kind of
do an alternate version of it and you

1317
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:04,210
wouldn't do it because you're a typical
man and you have to see like I can do

1318
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:07,190
anything. You know what? I just love
the, you say a typical man. Yeah,

1319
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,930
I lump us all in and then give me
shit when I talk about all the broads.

1320
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,180
You've always done that.

1321
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,240
I always have done that and I don't have
a problem with you saying that guys are

1322
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:19,780
hardheaded and goes, we are. We're
fucking morons and you guys aside goes,

1323
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:22,940
you guys are psychos. All
right. Where emotional.

1324
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,630
That doesn't mean I don't like tea bars.
Fucking Bandana.

1325
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:29,620
What do you think about that?
Oh t buys right from that fucking,

1326
01:25:29,621 --> 01:25:32,290
what's the name of that group that was
going to say like as long as they're

1327
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:35,890
going to take you to get the name of
that bill. Never remembers the name.

1328
01:25:35,891 --> 01:25:40,870
Crazy sexy. Cool. Was the name
of their album. Don't go chase.

1329
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,020
I thought they were saying
don't go Jason waterfalls.

1330
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:49,330
And I didn't know what that meant. I was
like, is that some sort of hip hop slang?

1331
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:50,703
Who's Jason?

1332
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,170
Is that like a in why does
he like waterfall waterfall?

1333
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:59,410
Can you fucking get the oatmeal? You
just spit out of your mouth. Oops. Um,

1334
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,340
oh what was the name of
them? TLC. Yeah, you go

1335
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:10,190
and uh oh left. Die Cause
I is right. Oh Shit.

1336
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,380
What is this? Oh that's why she,
that's why she called herself left dot.

1337
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,540
Cause what? Cause I is right. At
least that's how she explained it.

1338
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:24,920
I know why they said why do you
have that thing under your, uh,

1339
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:28,280
your left eye or it's she had something
on her fucking face and she said,

1340
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,260
cause I use right. And I
was like, oh, what a cunt.

1341
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,160
You know right there or cause she's dead.
I'm not supposed to say that.

1342
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:37,010
When she was alive, she probably wasn't
difficult to be in a relationship with.

1343
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,000
Wasn't she the one that burned down
that guy's fucking house? Yes she did.

1344
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:44,150
I didn't go to jail because she has a
vagina. She went to jail. Are you done?

1345
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:47,520
Went to jail for that? Yes.
How long? I don't know exactly.

1346
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,510
Internet and look it up instead of just
one of those things where you end up

1347
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:53,270
being wrong. Well you end up being
wrong and you're proven wrong.

1348
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:56,960
So you just fucking gorilla your way
through it like you just said. Yeah,

1349
01:26:56,961 --> 01:27:00,650
that's what I'm saying. She did
go to jail bell. Look it up.

1350
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,400
I'm not going to look at forest or
asked to go to Rehab because she was an

1351
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:08,390
alcoholic on top of it. Anyway, with the,

1352
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,150
why you saying it like she's some
sort of a victim. She burned out some.

1353
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,070
He please keep the Mike
in front of your mouth.

1354
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:17,120
He didn't say that she was a victim.
I did not say that. Yeah. The,

1355
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:20,450
gave her the out cause she was an
alcoholic. No I didn't. Yeah, you guys,

1356
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:22,790
you guys always see everything,
the whole, your whole fucking life.

1357
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,040
You just given excuses.
That's why you guys,

1358
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:26,930
that's why he can't do
as many pushups as a guy.

1359
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,270
Has nothing to do with
your mothering hips.

1360
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:33,590
It has to do with the fact
that you fucking get to tee
off 20 yards in front of

1361
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:35,660
me and still get the gift.
The same fucking score.

1362
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:40,160
What does the c stand
for and Tlc? Uh, let's,

1363
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:43,490
I don't know what the,
the Tl stands for. Yes,

1364
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:47,030
you do tender loving care.
So to stands for,

1365
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:51,530
they're the names of the girls in the
group. All right. There was Chili.

1366
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:56,960
I've got Chili, there's left die and
then this t boss. Hey Cow. Yeah. Got It.

1367
01:27:56,961 --> 01:27:58,250
There you go. Go ahead.
Quiz me on some more.

1368

1369
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,340

Absolutely gone. Bobbi Brown, uh,

1372
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:18,260
Jerome Robinson, the trail.
Spreewell. It's rough.

1373
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:24,680
And uh, Nipsey Russell. I was, oh,
he was a manager. He was the manager.

1374
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,460
I was done over the group.
No, but I know here it is.

1375
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:34,250
Horrible. That's my, a little
ring. I'll give me a fucking break.

1376
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:36,350
What the world would you want to hear my,
you want to hear my options?

1377
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,930
Give me another group once you pick a
white group so I can actually get it.

1378
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:44,240
New Kids on the block. New Kids on the,
although they had all those games. Joey,

1379
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:47,450
Bobby, Stevie, Mikey in pooky.

1380
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,300
Huh? Can you feel the
baby? I can feel it too.

1381
01:28:56,030 --> 01:29:00,770
It was Marky mark stealing the licking
the lips thing from ll cool j Marky mark

1382
01:29:00,771 --> 01:29:05,220
and who else? And the funky
button. I remember those guys.

1383
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:07,140
See It, feel it. Feel it.

1384
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,200
Okay. It's just that, that, that ratio.

1385
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:15,880
Oh, it was horrible music. What was the
spinoff group from new edition? A bell.

1386
01:29:15,881 --> 01:29:18,660
Biv. Devoe. Wow. What did they say?

1387
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,173
Okay,

I remember all that shit.
Go ahead.

1389
01:29:26,050 --> 01:29:30,520
Name a song by Bobby Brown when
he was solo. My prerogative.

1390
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:35,760
These are a joke. Okay. Let's see. I'm
trying to get your money right, Joey.

1391
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,600
We didn't look at my fucking shiny shoes.

1392

People. I know, it kind of sucked.

1456
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:46,720
I know some of it was Kinda
nice spot on that said, oh,

1457
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:50,440
you know something of what I keep meaning
to fucking talk about on this God damn

1458
01:33:50,441 --> 01:33:53,980
podcast is I started,
somebody sent me something,

1459
01:33:55,530 --> 01:34:00,220
uh, about the fucking, what the
hell did I do to my damn computer?

1460
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,550
Let it go.
Let go of my fucking cord.

1461
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,350
Are you fucking kidding me?
Get up.

1462
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:13,030
Hang on a second.
People fucking court is stuck in there.

1463
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:16,630
Whatever.
People keep sending me this shit about.

1464
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:21,860
A one person did send me
about the Liverpool soccer
club in the premier league

1465
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:27,370
and evidently these American dudes bought
it and said that they were going to

1466
01:34:27,371 --> 01:34:30,520
buy a buy,
a brand new stadium.

1467
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:33,070
They were going to do all this
type of shit and they didn't do it.

1468
01:34:33,071 --> 01:34:37,420
And somebody sent me this great video
of all these English people from their

1469
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,650
heart's telling these American guys to
fucking sell the Goddamn team and to fuck

1470
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:43,330
off.
And it was awesome.

1471
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:47,410
And this is the same team that the owners
of the red sox then went in and bought.

1472
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:51,730
And I started looking at the premiere
league and like three or four the teams

1473
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:55,870
are owned by, uh, by Americans,

1474
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,440
specifically people from the
United States. All right.

1475
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:03,550
Because we're all from North
America up here. Uh, and I,

1476
01:35:03,551 --> 01:35:05,480
I can't believe how fucking
annoying that would be.

1477
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:09,650
You don't have a bunch of English guys
came over and bought my team and said

1478
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:11,900
that they were going to do a bunch
of stuff when they fucked it up.

1479
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:16,760
I would be beyond pissed.
Um, so I, I don't know.

1480
01:35:16,761 --> 01:35:19,190
Sorry about that. England. I don't
know why the fuck we did that.

1481
01:35:19,191 --> 01:35:22,460
It's nice to know we're buying
something considered gyp.

1482
01:35:22,461 --> 01:35:23,710
Japan's come over here and they,

1483
01:35:23,711 --> 01:35:27,200
they fucking bought up everything
over the last 20 years. Didn't they?

1484
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:31,250
Don't they own our roads? You know,
what are you gonna do with them?

1485
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:36,020
Close them off. Do you have enough people
to do that? I don't think you do. Um,

1486
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:37,580
so yes.
Send me some more information on it.

1487
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,490
Cause I'd like to talk about the
premier league and also I'm wondering in

1488
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:44,210
Ireland, is that a seven nation rugby
league or whatever the fuck it is?

1489
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:45,230
Is that starting up again?

1490
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:49,300
Cause I watched that last year in
March when I went over there and uh,

1491
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:53,660
rugby is the shit and a
unlike professional football,

1492
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:56,450
which they're just turning into
the biggest pussy sport ever.

1493
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,280
Isn't it enough that we were,

1494
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:02,450
that they have to wear pink for the
entire fucking month of October.

1495
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:06,530
You know,
now you can't tackle people.

1496
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,460
The amount of quarterbacks out there
that I get in like Joe Montana fucking

1497
01:36:10,461 --> 01:36:15,461
stats because they're drive was kept
alive because a defensive person had the

1498
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:20,600
audacity to tackle someone as, as
just as fucking beyond me. And uh,

1499
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:22,580
I got nothing left people.
I'm not going to lie to you.

1500
01:36:22,581 --> 01:36:24,860
This podcast was fucking
over before it started.

1501
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,230
I have too much shit I have to do.
All right.

1502
01:36:27,231 --> 01:36:30,710
I remember the first year I did this
podcast, I actually took two weeks off.

1503
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,900
I took two weeks off, so,
you know, whatever it was
dressed down fucking Monday.

1504
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,700
I came in, I did what I
could. All right. That's it.

1505
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:43,250
That's it for the, uh, for
the podcast for this year.

1506
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:47,480
Everybody right now we've got one
more for this year and next weeks.

1507
01:36:47,481 --> 01:36:48,410
I promise you,

1508
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:51,650
I promise you it will be just as bad
as this one if not fucking worse.

1509
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,950
Cause I'm on vacation.
I'm not required to make you laugh,

1510
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:59,900
but I want to thank everybody.
Seriously. Everybody who came out to see,

1511
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:03,680
um, my shows this year, um,

1512
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,590
I had a great time and I actually,
oh wait. Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

1513
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:10,580
I'm missing an underrated overrated. How
the fuck could I do that? Underrated.

1514
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:14,300
Overrated this week real
quick. Uh, overrated.

1515
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:18,380
Both the jets and the Patriots being a
Dolphin Fan. Born and raised in Miami.

1516
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,220
I'm six at sick and tired
of these two faggots.

1517
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,800
Teams dominating the AFC
east for the past decade.

1518
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:26,780
While it's really been the patriots,

1519
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:28,670
it was very nice of you to
throw the jets in there.

1520
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:33,470
I think the jets have one like one, one
division in the last fucking 10 years. Um,

1521
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:37,070
so I get it. Were overrated
because your team sucks. Um,

1522
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:40,970
80 you like how while the former Dolphin
won the game for the jets yesterday.

1523
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,210
Have Bet you enjoyed that, huh? I
hope you get a sunburn on your ass.

1524
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:48,350
You fucking cunt. All right. Underrated
the bills. Being a dolphin fan.

1525
01:37:48,351 --> 01:37:50,750
Born and raised in Miami,
like you already said,

1526
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:54,620
I love the bills for always keeping the
dolphins in the hunt for the playoffs

1527
01:37:54,621 --> 01:37:57,240
every year for the past decade and a half.
All right.

1528
01:37:57,241 --> 01:38:00,480
That guy was just being a dick, so I have
to respect that. Alright. Underrated.

1529
01:38:00,481 --> 01:38:04,920
Michael Vick. He does sports announcer
voice, uh, Michael Vick, Michael Vick.

1530
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:05,460
What are you,

1531
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,310
one of the things you have to understand
about Michael Vick is Michael Vick,

1532
01:38:08,311 --> 01:38:12,390
the MVC P of this season.
Bob, because he's my MVP.

1533
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,290
He's making fun of me talking about
how that's all they say. Michael via.

1534
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:20,820
What can you say about Michael
Vick? Well, well, Jim, Michael
Vick, um, you know what?

1535
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,390
I have to admit I was fucking
wrong about that guy. I was wrong,

1536
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:27,990
but I was also right. Okay.
Because the same reason

1537
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:32,790
I fucking fell for it by the Patriots
playing good defense for two weeks in a

1538
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:36,510
row and then actually gave up 14 and a
half points ignoring the fact that they

1539
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:38,550
only played well for two
fucking weeks in a row.

1540
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:41,220
You can't say that a guy's the best dude,
the fucking lead.

1541
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,700
Cause he lights up the Redskins and
fucking three weeks later John Chitana

1542
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,780
lights up the fucking Redskins.
All right. But yesterday,

1543
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,810
what happened in that game?
I mean that was unreal.

1544
01:38:51,811 --> 01:38:53,790
I think he went back to old school,
Michael Vick.

1545
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:57,390
He just started fucking running down the
field like a God damn water bug. But uh,

1546
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:02,230
I was wrong about that guy.
Um, it's where it's been a,

1547
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:05,390
he can't say he's in,

1548
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,520
he's in like a League of his own as
far as like what the fuck he's doing.

1549
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:11,190
Cause I've never seen anybody
do that shit at his position.

1550
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,280
And I'd say that he's going
to change the position,

1551
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:19,050
but I don't know that they'll any be
ever be another person is talented.

1552
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:24,030
Is that fucking guy at that
position? Um, I dunno. So anyways,

1553
01:39:24,031 --> 01:39:25,200
he says, uh, Bill, sorry,

1554
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:27,900
you have to go through another week of
that shit of everybody saying Michael

1555
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,780
Vick. But every time I hear them talk
about fiqh after a big wing, no matter,

1556
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:34,320
no matter what I remember about
your rant against the announcers,

1557
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:37,560
the announcers saying his
name over and over again. Um,

1558
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:41,010
I say he's still underrated because he
broke two NFL records in the last two

1559
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:44,500
weeks, but still can't
get any solid respect. Uh,

1560
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:48,360
I think he's getting his solid respect.
The fact that there's,

1561
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:53,100
they're saying that he might be the MVP
of the league and he's coming off an 18

1562
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:56,820
month stint in Leavenworth
for torturing dogs to death.

1563
01:39:57,570 --> 01:39:58,403
You know what I mean?

1564
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:03,720
I definitely fought when someone
plays the fucking race card.

1565
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:05,250
I always listened to it because I,
you know,

1566
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,790
I traveled the road and I know what
people are like having talked to them,

1567
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:13,410
it's just people are fucking,
they're awful. The fucking awful.

1568
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:15,570
But this is the one time where
it's like, dude, you know,

1569
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:21,090
you're tortured dogs to death.
You drowned them, your shot him.

1570
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:24,510
I mean straight up, straight
across the fucking board. You know,

1571
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:29,490
you can't expect people to 100% Embracia
after you do some shit like that even

1572
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:31,500
though you more than
paid the fucking price.

1573
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:37,140
But I'd rather be you than one of
those fucking dogs. So anyways,

1574
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:41,340
he said, I say underrated because he broke
two NFL records in the last two weeks,

1575
01:40:41,341 --> 01:40:43,950
but still can't get any solid respect.
Honestly.

1576
01:40:43,951 --> 01:40:48,840
As much as I hate Tom Brady,
he is the real MVP so far.

1577
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:51,750
But people are still hesitant.
I don't know who the real MVP is,

1578
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:55,240
but Tom Brady's having
his best fucking year. Um,

1579
01:40:56,970 --> 01:41:01,510
all right. This is a good one here.
Yukon women's team, 88 win streak,

1580
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:02,530
overrated.

1581
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:07,180
The audacity of these media prints to
compare the Yukon's woman's team to the

1582
01:41:07,181 --> 01:41:11,080
UCLA team, by the way, which
was cheating by the way,

1583
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:13,300
with how they got all their prospects.

1584
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:17,050
For all you people who trashed the
Patriots and act like all you're fucking

1585
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:20,880
winning is because you're just such
smart fucking human beings. It,

1586
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:23,810
I would,

1587
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:25,930
I'm not going to get involved and I'm
not going to open that fucking can of

1588
01:41:25,931 --> 01:41:27,520
worms, but John Wooden, uh,

1589
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:31,870
as my buddy said yesterday was the
king of looking the other way when the

1590
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:34,660
boosters got involved. Okay, let's
leave it at that. All right. Of course,

1591
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:37,900
it's a major accomplishment,
but as is typical with everything,

1592
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:39,400
male versus female related,

1593
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:43,210
people cannot put things into
perspective when it comes to females.

1594
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:47,440
The woman's Yukon teams,
88 wins is in no way,

1595
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:51,040
shape or form as impressive
as the UCLA teams.

1596
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:54,400
88 whims wins.
I'll put it to you like this.

1597
01:41:54,580 --> 01:41:59,580
I used to play little league football
and got MVP three times in a row

1598
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:02,830
and co MVP once,

1599
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:07,890
however Tom Brady has won the NFL MVP I
think once or twice I have a longer MVP

1600
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:15,190
streaked and Tom Brady, but who's MVPs
are more respectable and impressive.

1601
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,960
That's right. Mine. Just
kidding. Of course his are, um,

1602
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:25,360
all right, I get that. But

1603
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:30,190
uh,
do,

1604
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:33,880
but you're a guy and you could play in
the NFL but you weren't good enough.

1605
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,790
So that's the difference I guess.
Um,

1606
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:41,860
as far as that,
I would say that they're the Ucla,

1607
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:45,700
the Ucla of women's basketball.
How about that?

1608
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:49,900
You got to say that because they are going
up against the best females out there

1609
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:52,690
and they have one 88 in a row.
So I would say it like that.

1610
01:42:52,691 --> 01:42:57,070
But to compare to put it up there
with Uclas. Yeah, the men's,

1611
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:00,460
I definitely think that's bullshit.
That's just the classic, uh,

1612
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:05,650
you know, it's like them wearing
pink in the NFL. It's just,

1613
01:43:05,651 --> 01:43:09,640
did you just appeasing them? That's
all the fuck you doing. You know?

1614
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,790
And I really just compare breast
cancers to like appeasing somebody.

1615
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:17,230
I really should just stop talking, but I'm
just going to keep going here. Um, yeah.

1616
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,210
As far as sports accomplishments go,

1617
01:43:19,211 --> 01:43:22,960
I don't think females mean as much as
men's just because we're better at it than

1618
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:24,580
you are.
You know,

1619
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,620
we just have better hand eye coordination.
Just generally speaking,

1620
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:32,860
we're just better at, you know, the
amount of guys that if you go, hey,

1621
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,830
think quick catch and you just throw
them a stapler, they going to catch it.

1622
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:38,830
And the amount of women who would just
take it off the face and have it landed

1623
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:43,060
in their cleavage, it's, you
can't even compare it, you know,

1624
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:44,560
let's debate that next week.

1625
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:48,310
I don't think females are as good
athletes as guys are. I just don't,

1626
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:52,540
I don't think they are. I don't think
that they have that killer instinct. Yup.

1627
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,820
Unless they're there,

1628
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:58,380
they're chemically wired like a guy
and they have as much testosterone.

1629
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:59,790
I don't think it's going to be a problem.

1630
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:03,770
I'm just saying this to Piss people off
so I don't have to work hard next week.

1631
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,430
Uh, I think that's it. I do. I've
got some, uh, youtube videos,

1632
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:12,070
you know, if ever I was going
to edit a fucking podcast,

1633
01:44:12,071 --> 01:44:14,980
it should be fucking this one.
This one is just Jesus, whatever.

1634
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,870
Last week's was great. This is
what I am happy, you know, I mean,

1635
01:44:17,871 --> 01:44:21,240
this is a let down week for me. All
right, youtube, check this one out.

1636
01:44:21,241 --> 01:44:25,950
This is one of the creepiest ones I've
seen. And uh, it's called the liar card.

1637
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:31,390
This is a card you can put in your phone
and for people, you know, so when you're,

1638
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:34,120
you're,
if people are ducking your calls,

1639
01:44:34,121 --> 01:44:36,220
that will show up as
somebody else's phone call.

1640
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,810
You can disguise your voice to sound
like a woman or a man. And uh, yeah,

1641
01:44:40,811 --> 01:44:44,320
I guess you could find out where they
are in case you know. I Dunno what,

1642
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:47,900
there's another good one.
Our Danny Woodhead, you know,

1643
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:50,660
the fucking all pro for the
fucking New England patriots.

1644
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:55,090
Danny Woodhead as Modell's employee
selling his own Reebok Jersey.

1645
01:44:55,091 --> 01:44:59,110
He stands in a modal selling
his own Jersey in New
England and nobody recognizes

1646
01:44:59,111 --> 01:45:02,690
him. Uh, now the youtube,

1647
01:45:02,770 --> 01:45:05,600
would these all be up on the m
podcasts are the cliff lease signing?

1648
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:07,250
Did Not make the boss happy.

1649
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:12,610
This is actually a total ripoff video of
a video that a yes Canadiens fan made.

1650
01:45:14,770 --> 01:45:17,310
Um, or someone who hated the
Canadians a year ago. Uh,

1651
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:20,610
they just took this footage of somebody
playing Hitler and a movie flipping out.

1652
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:25,500
Um, just know that it is a rip
off, but it's funny, I guess. Uh,

1653
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:30,350
what else do I have here? I think that's
it. Is that it? That is it. All right.

1654
01:45:30,351 --> 01:45:33,580
All those videos will be up there.
I apologize for the choppy podcast.

1655
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,380
They can all be great hour and
five minutes. And by the way,

1656
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:37,550
there's some maniac out.

1657
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:42,730
They're transcribing my podcasts and
Mark Marin's and I think Adam Carolla's.

1658
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,100
And uh,

1659
01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:50,000
how about a round of applause for that
fucking trooper actually sat down and was

1660
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:52,640
reading,
I read like three minutes of my podcast.

1661
01:45:52,641 --> 01:45:57,620
The guy gets like every fucking word,
so, uh, God bless Ya. Okay. And uh,

1662
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:01,300
that is, if that's the podcast for this
week, you guys all have a merry Christmas.

1663
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,160
Happy Kwanzaa. Happy Hanukkah,
happy fuck the holidays.

1664
01:46:06,161 --> 01:46:07,150
If that's how you are up

1665
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:10,600
is all, have a good week, don't take
any shit that's it and go fuck yourself.

1666
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:49,890
[inaudible].
