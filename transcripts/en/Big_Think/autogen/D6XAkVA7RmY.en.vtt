so we're nothing but a soap bubble

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570
so we're nothing but a soap bubble
 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.860
so we're nothing but a soap bubble
floating in a bubble bath of soap

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870
floating in a bubble bath of soap
 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.890
floating in a bubble bath of soap
bubbles and so in some sense the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
bubbles and so in some sense the
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.560
bubbles and so in some sense the
multiverse can be likened to a bubble

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
multiverse can be likened to a bubble
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.170

two bubbles collide that could merge
 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.750
two bubbles collide that could merge
into a bigger bubble which could be the

into a bigger bubble which could be the
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.270
into a bigger bubble which could be the

the Big Bang is or perhaps a bubble

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980
the Big Bang is or perhaps a bubble

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.280
fissioned in half and split off into two
bubbles that could be the Big Bang or

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290
bubbles that could be the Big Bang or
 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.410
bubbles that could be the Big Bang or
perhaps the universe popped into

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420
perhaps the universe popped into
 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.050
perhaps the universe popped into
existence out of nothing that is also a

existence out of nothing that is also a
 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.140
existence out of nothing that is also a
possibility and so the universe could

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.970
be right because that violates the
conservation of matter and energy how

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980
conservation of matter and energy how
 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.940
conservation of matter and energy how
can you create a universe from nothing

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
can you create a universe from nothing
 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.890
can you create a universe from nothing
well if you can't calculate the total

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
well if you can't calculate the total
 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.920
well if you can't calculate the total
matter of the universe it is positive if

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
matter of the universe it is positive if
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.629
matter of the universe it is positive if
you calculate the total energy of the

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639
you calculate the total energy of the
 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.000
you calculate the total energy of the
universe it is negative because of

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010
universe it is negative because of
 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.010
universe it is negative because of
gravity gravity has negative energy

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
gravity gravity has negative energy
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.870
gravity gravity has negative energy
when you had the two together what do

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880
when you had the two together what do
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.390
when you had the two together what do
you get zero so it takes no energy to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400
you get zero so it takes no energy to
 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.480
you get zero so it takes no energy to
create a universe universes are for free

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490
create a universe universes are for free
 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.559
create a universe universes are for free
a universe is a free lunch and then you

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569
a universe is a free lunch and then you
 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.969
a universe is a free lunch and then you
may say to yourself well that can't be

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979
may say to yourself well that can't be
 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.100
may say to yourself well that can't be
right because positive and negative

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110
right because positive and negative
 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.439
right because positive and negative
charges don't cancel out therefore how

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449
charges don't cancel out therefore how
 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.870
charges don't cancel out therefore how
can the universe be made out of nothing

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880
can the universe be made out of nothing
 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.939
can the universe be made out of nothing
well if you calculate the total amount

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949
well if you calculate the total amount
 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.420
well if you calculate the total amount
of positive charge in the universe and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
of positive charge in the universe and
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.469
of positive charge in the universe and
calculate the total amount of negative

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479
calculate the total amount of negative
 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.020
calculate the total amount of negative
charge in the universe and you add it up

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030
charge in the universe and you add it up
 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.830
charge in the universe and you add it up
what do you get zero the universe has

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840
what do you get zero the universe has
 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.909
what do you get zero the universe has
zero charge

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919
zero charge
 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.089
zero charge
well what about spin galaxies spin right

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:03.099
well what about spin galaxies spin right
 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.730
well what about spin galaxies spin right
but they spin in all directions if you

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740
but they spin in all directions if you
 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.499
but they spin in all directions if you
add up all the spins of the galaxies

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509
add up all the spins of the galaxies
 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.010
add up all the spins of the galaxies
what do you get zero so in other words

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020
what do you get zero so in other words
 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.499
what do you get zero so in other words
the universe has zero spin zero charge

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509
the universe has zero spin zero charge
 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.559
the universe has zero spin zero charge
and zero matter energy content in other

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569
and zero matter energy content in other
 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.180
and zero matter energy content in other
words the universe is for free
