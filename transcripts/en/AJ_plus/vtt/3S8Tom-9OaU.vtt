00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.229
(Prayer call)

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.380
(Prayer call)

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.480
It's time for afternoon prayers and the
Muslim inmates in this California state

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.200
prison are doing what was once forbidden -- having an Islamic worship service. People

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.820
couldn't gather in groups to teach and
do practices of religion. Of the 3,832

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
inmates at Solano prison,
the chaplain estimates about five

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.379
percent are practicing Muslims. The
prison doesn't track religious identity

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.180
partly because it's so fluid. And
religious expression is a barometer for

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
how Islam has evolved within the U.S.
penitentiary system. Hey guys, I'm Shreen.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
And today we've travelled to Solano
Prison in Vacaville, California to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.960
explore how the world's fastest-growing
religion has had to fight to find a home

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.320
in prison.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.360
When I became Muslim, I was given a set
of principles: Do this. Don't do that. When

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.679
in doubt, don't. That's Jessie Burleson,
who people here know as Hasani. He's been

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.329
in prison for 31 years.
Hasani is one of the practicing Muslims

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.770
at Solano prison, and they're part of the
millions of people behind bars in the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.899
U.S. In fact, the United States has the
largest prison population in the world.

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.020
The more than 2.3 million people it had
incarcerated by the end of 2017 were

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.520
more than any other developed nation.
That number includes inmates at federal,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.349
state, and county prisons. And it's
growing. In a place where your housing,

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.670
meals, and recreation time is highly
constrained by rules, finding a way to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.970
practice your faith can be difficult.
These inmates have figured out a way to

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.560
infuse their faith into their sentences.
One of the things that started me

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.720
seeking something different was, I was
looking at the people that were around

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.870
me -- who were older than I was -- who had been

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.060
in prison longer than me, and who had
been on that same negative

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.920
self-destructive path. And me not being
satisfied with what I was seeing in them.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.870
And at that time I started going to
religious services. It didn't matter if

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.269
it was Muslim, Christian, Jewish. I
went seeking a better way and I believed

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.859
in God. So I knew that the only way I was
gonna change was through God. He's just

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.389
one of the Muslims that Solano chaplain
Muhammad Ali interacts with on a daily

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.950
basis. Ali is an Imam who spent four
years at this prison, helping people like

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.549
Hassani explore their faith. He
believes it can be an important part of

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.849
their rehabilitation. Religion is
important to inmates because it connects

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.630
them to something bigger than
their circumstance. You have people who

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.590
you know where you're here in prison and
there's a lot of things you can't

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.370
control, whether it's your

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.209
your eating, it's your living
condition.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.620
It really helps human beings feel
essence of connectedness to something

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.790
beyond what's right in front of
them. But Islam's journey in

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.420
penitentiaries has been complicated by
prison culture and legal challenges.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.819
Though nationally Muslims make up 1% of the U.S. population, that number is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.890
expected to double by 2050. Some of that
growth specifically comes from inmates

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.450
converting to Islam behind bars. Islam is
known for having a particularly strong

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.799
presence in prisons. In fact, more people
convert to Islam per capita than any

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.590
other religion. Nationwide, Muslims make
up 10 to 15% of prisoners. Ali even said

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.459
he has one to two inmates convert to
Islam monthly, though that's not his goal.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.900
What makes those statistics resonate
more is knowing how difficult it was to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.730
get Islam accepted as a recognized
religion within some prisons. The prison

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.989
administration, through their custody
officers, wouldn't allow groups of

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.859
Muslims that congregate over three, and
when they did they would break, they

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.269
would break them up. That's Abdul Raoof
Nasir, and he spent 30 years using his

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.169
Islamic faith to help inmates and
correctional institutions. He considered

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:22.139
it social justice work and an active
part of his faith. Back when he started

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.370
in the 1970s, he says the prison system
was full of subtle discrimination

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.039
against Muslims. Some Muslim inmates at this prison sued in 1996 for greater

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.639
access to religious services. Their
demands included hiring a full-time

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.870
Muslim chaplain and the ability to
attend Friday prayers without penalties,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.740
like demerits for leaving work.
Eventually, they did receive a full-time

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.880
Imam and their other demands. Prison
officials dispute this account. They say

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.360
Muslim inmates were never denied access to their religion, and instead the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.810
constraints were reflective of staffing
and organizational issues that were

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.060
resolved. Nationwide, the legal pushes
continue today. A 2013 report says that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.510
Muslims submitted the most religious
discrimination complaints out of any

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.800
other religious group in prison. Islam
and Muslim

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.139
organizations in prisons, for the most
part seem to be powerful because they've

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.740
been there a long time. They have
challenged the status quo of the prison

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.070
system itself legally and physically.
That quality of questioning power is

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.259
easily identifiable with one of the
religions most notable converts. Malcolm

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.139
X, his narrative is prominent and so that
attracts people toward Islam. And then

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.330
the reformative value that they find in
that the hope that it gives, that I can

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.660
survive in prison,
Malcolm survived in prison. Malcolm X's

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.639
legacy still resonates today more than
50 years after his death. While serving a

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.000
prison sentence, then-named Malcolm
Little converted to the Nation of Islam

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.850
in 1952. He found mainstream Islam years later and felt it was much more racially

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.500
inclusive then the Nation. But as Muslim we
will be Muslims. I will try and teach the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.250
religion of Islam among the so-called
Negroes and make them Muslims.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.060
Aside from spiritual guidance and the
ability to change your life around,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.840
another reason Nasir says some
incarcerated people are drawn to the

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.880
faith is for another reason entirely: how
prisons are organized. A central

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.210
organizing principle in prison is
containing the threat of violence.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.139
Inmates are housed and classified
according to the risk of violence they

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.070
pose. Here at Solano, it means they're housed dormitory-style.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.690
Those that pose a higher risk, are housed
themselves like this with armed guards.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.490
In their downtime, the crew that inmates
spend time with matters because they're

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.330
the ones that also offer protection. So
what does any of this have to do with

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.139
practicing Islam in prison?
Well Nasir explains that your brothers

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.580
in the faith can actually help protect
you behind bars and that source of

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.710
support transcends race. Islam does
challenge the strict rules of race in

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.310
prison, because if a person of another
ethnic group

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.570
besides African American becomes a Muslim
then he's embraced in Islamic community.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.370
And he's not only embraced, he's
protected from outside pressures that

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.479
other groups may place against them. Being in prison isn't necessarily

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.000
that type of situation to where
you know you need to join a group to be

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.110
safe. That's not -- hasn't been my experience, but

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.380
I would say being a part of a community
in prison is definitely beneficial in

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.260
that regard.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.430
What he is really describing
is support. And the support that

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.600
incarcerated Muslims require is
different than their free brethren. In

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.870
fact, there are several things about
prison that changed how Islam is

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.280
practiced. There's no quran app, no call
to prayer from your cell phone, and being

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.360
Muslim here is about survival in a
completely different way than it is

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.890
outside. It does afford some opportunity for

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:57.320
inmates to think about their
rehabilitation, think about meaning in

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.120
life, think about who they want to be as
a person while here or when leaving here.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.350
Just because religion might help some
people survive prison doesn't mean

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.100
they'll continue the practice after
release. Nasir has seen people let go of the

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.210
faith when they get out. But Hasani, who's
just days from release, has his sights

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.800
set on making Islam's most important
journey for Muslims, the pilgrimage

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.610
called Hajj. So I think for me that
making the Hajj as, as one of my goals

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.860
primary goals, if I keep that as a
primary goal, that I will be successful

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.490
and not only standing on the path but
doing everything that I need to do in

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.860
order to get off parole,
save some money, and make the Hajj. I

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.830
