00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.250
Okay Mike, are you ready for a quiz?

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.070
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Okay, so, here, let me, let me set up the, the situation for

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.760
you. So a man goes to see his doctor, okay, because his back hurts or something.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; Aww.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.380
&gt;&gt; And she gives him a, I know, it's really sad. It's his, the left side

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.800
of his lower back, he's been playing too

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.490
much racquetball. Anyway, so a man goes to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.870
see a doctor, and she gives him a lab test. Now this test is pretty good,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.830
okay? It returns a correct positive. That is,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370
if you have the thing that this lab test

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.500
is testing for, it will say you have it 98 percent of the time, okay? So it only

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.130
gives you a false positive two percent of the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.160
time. And at the same time, it will return

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.750
a correct negative, that is if you don't have

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.590
what the lab test is testing for, it will

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.320
say you don't have it. 97% of the time,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.263
so it has a false negative rate of only 3%.

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:45.280
&gt;&gt; Wait, hang on. So, just, what's his problem?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.750
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's the question. So, the test

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.100
looks for a disease. So, give me a disease.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.800
&gt;&gt; Spleen?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that. So the test looks for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.050
spleentitis. Now spleentitis is such a rare disease that nobody's ever

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.410
heard of it, And it turns out that it's so rare that

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.310
only about this fraction of the population has it. Okay?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.823
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:13.710
&gt;&gt; That make sense? So we're looking for spleentitis. It's a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.040
very rare disease, but this test is really good at determining

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.000
whether you have it or determining whether you don't have it

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.120
&gt;&gt; Can I tell you that, its,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.350
spleentitis appeared zero times in google. [LAUGH] So

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.350
it really is quite rare.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.978
&gt;&gt; It really is quite rare. But what does

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:29.941
google know? OK, so you got it all Michael?

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So its a really rare disease

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.050
and we have a very accurate test for it.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.710
&gt;&gt; Good. Man goes to see the doctor. She gives him a lab test. Its a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.400
pretty good lab test. Its checking for spleentitis,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.480
relatively rare disease and the test comes back positive.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.340
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.650
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, test is positive. So, here is the quiz question.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.480
&gt;&gt; Should we be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.200
net, notifying his next of kin?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.720
&gt;&gt; Yes. Does he have spleentitis?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.000
&gt;&gt; You said, just said he had spleentitis.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.030
&gt;&gt; No, I said the test says he had spleentitis. Or the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.390
test looks for spleentitis, and the test came back positive. So, does

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.810
he have spleentitis? Yes or no? Alright, before I try to answer

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.310
that can I just, ask for clarification, can I get a clarification?

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.740
&gt;&gt; Please.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.990
&gt;&gt; So the 98 is a percentage and the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.640
97 is a percentage, is .008 also a percentage?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.790
&gt;&gt; No it's not.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.825
So if I wanted to convert it to a percentage it would be .8%.

00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:23.390
&gt;&gt; Got it. Alright, now I think I have, what I need.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright, so, you think about it. Go.
