00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.520
 in this capsule to have them 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.720
 two star theoretical properties including 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.340
 we are going to do we make the list of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.929
 different properties most 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.769
 important of the star without making it the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.450
 demonstration 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.179
 and you will see that most are 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 still quite intuitive 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.060
 so first property two stars 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 is that if the graffiti is finished to star 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.220
 is always finished and that's due 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.080
 among other things, that weights 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 associated with transitions are strictly 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 positive and thanks among other thanks 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 also the clause list of it's 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.290
 possible also to check if we are in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 to explore some of the graffiti that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.480
 has already been explored before if there was 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.329
 cycles in serious 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.559
 then sacy a path to the goal 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 exist to star is going to find one 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.920
 so actually since we explore 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 basically all the paths in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.649
 adding a draw when growing up final 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.449
 finally graffiti as you go 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.729
 by calling transition is good 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.229
 eventually we will have covered all 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.390
 the possible paths so if it exists 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.780
 a goal a path to bio we go in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.549
 find there is a property that is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.840
 particularly important fundamental 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 with 1 star 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.570
 sinnott heuristic h edel that the estimated 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.790
 that it gives real future cost and a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.920
 always less than or equal to the actual cost 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.759
 to come up 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 we will say that the rustic in question 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.790
 is eligible and if we have this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 property the man we can say that it is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.140
 an important result that hay canvas 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.659
 always returns an optimal path 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 in fact when we look in the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.500
 star discussion of different 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 authors sometimes some assume that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180
 or if we talk about the stars 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.770
 logistics is needed manny sid so 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.130
 for some the definition of stars 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.409
 it's not just that fdn and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.970
 garages and additionally hd n but that in addition 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.489
 hd n is eligible and so that's a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.110
 property particularly important if 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.390
 we want to make sure we get 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.250
 at the end of the roof, an optimal path 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
 must make sure that our tourist is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.460
 admissible that is to say that it will 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 around an estimate that is lower or 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.630
 equal to the real cost future of hand 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.220
 until the end we can make links 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.640
 enters into stars and looking for 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 money 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.640
 so in fact using costs of 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.620
 evenly equal arcs so h of forgiveness 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.440
 so of 1 m prime which is equal for 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.810
 all links between seniors a premium 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.180
 for all the seniors in bonus is 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.060
 strictly positive so for example 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.100
 for blows there is there everywhere and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.810
 that energy that always returns 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.280
 zero for all our hatreds then to star 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.760
 actually corresponds to a search in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.850
 width so actually since in 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.070
 this case fdn low corresponds to j2m is not 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.630
 than j2m to match the length 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.840
 of the way if we had costs equal to 1 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.380
 and seeing that in open you bring out the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.120
 elements who acted out of hatred finally 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.489
 the smallest one goes essentially 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.340
 take out the knots that have a distance 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.080
 with the shortest initial name and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.390
 so we did come to a search 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.350
 in width and in this case we have 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.420
 also that open will become one that 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:40.080
 last in lace out or in french last 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.459
 between he last released we can do 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.150
 also reign with the al heal of size 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.730
 3 sino tourist is such that she 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.489
 always returns anonymously than me 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.350
 also 0 so so logistic is such 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.060
 that they always return zero but 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.610
 that we still have variable costs to 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.840
 star becomes equivalent to such a 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.120
 small subtle on the other hand a small 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
 difference to you will stop him 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.730
 when we found our optimal path 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.860
 green towards the goal because you have too much 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.140
 it only needs to stop 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.760
 we will continue in fact until we 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.090
 found the optimal path green or 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.269
 line height would stop him 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.680
 really done in the three courses 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.970
 they do not even find 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.490
 finally this way lovers the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.770
 of and also notes that h of hate 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.410
 legal 06 a logistics that is 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.330
 admissible since actually the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.180
 way between reindeer and the goal will be 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.220
 necessarily bigger magal did 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:44.050
 strictly larger at zero unless a 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.760
 enemy the iron menu brought some 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.350
 definitions for the next 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.860
 property to be defined so we will note f 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.050
 hate stars the optimal path so 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.410
 not an egg not an esteemed but really 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.860
 the way up pardon the optimal path of the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.710
 initial name to the bus that go through 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.000
 m unlike our f2 is our 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.070
 evaluation function that normally 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.020
 it is to estimate the cost of this path 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.580
 optimal dance that if she does you 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.490
 names will really refer to the 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.490
 neck of the optimal path that goes from one 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.960
 initial passing through reindeer is over 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.490
 drank the same way I star from 1.9 to 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.730
 match the optimal path of a 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.280
 initial to node n is to chetouane 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.160
 of hatred we will define it as the 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.669
 exact cost of the optimal path that speaks 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.780
 of a hate and that will be a goal honor 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.729
 so with these definitions there we can 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.729
 establish that f stars of hate it is 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.729
 equal g canvas of n 10 h m stars so 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.640
 actually the optimal nude during the 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.800
 optimal path that starts from an initial 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.950
 which goes through the n and ends in water 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.470
 bath necessarily sarraute is the 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.390
 cost of the new little marquis starts from a 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.870
 united if way of the match by dunod 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.380
 initial to the node ncg hand 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.080
 plus the cost of the optimal path by so much 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.070
 of hatred and going to the draw to ch 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.110
 air stars and so makes it one of 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.600
 Pippin 'star properties 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.830
 logistics is admissible it is that 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.540
 every node n explored by to stars on 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.150
 can demonstrate that for each sign 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.150
 we still have only the function 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.310
 of calculated estimates f2 n is no longer 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.820
 small or equal to effect canvas 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.280
 so in fact we have not overestimated 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.160
 never 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.729
 the actual cost of the optimal path passing 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.729
 by m 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:47.530
 another interesting definition a 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.000
 interesting property for 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.680
 rustic is that of coherence 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.830
 so if we have any 1 in 1 and a 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.780
 successor n 2 and that for his dunes of 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.710
 we are still only logistics 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:08.020
 ah1n1 and smaller or equal to the cost of 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.880
 go from n2 plus the rest to haendel on 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.660
 will say at that moment that h and 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.039
 consistent 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.930
 so that's a definition we give ourselves 

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:16.960
 thoroughly we will go as far 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.520
 some will say that will do and do 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.099
 refer to investing it as being 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.800
 monotonous and in reality cf that becomes 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.599
 monotonous but good so 6h satisfied 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.759
 this definition the hedge and consistent 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:31.630
 really we can demonstrate that buys 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:34.150
 also nbc so never overestimate the 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.810
 remaining cost of the optimal hate path 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.310
 towards the goal and besides and that's a 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.820
 property that is even more 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.240
 interesting 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.940
 whenever the star choose our 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.180
 beginnings of open so processes an output of 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:53.409
 open then to the stars to find the 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:57.430
 optimal path that will be at this draw is in 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:59.760
 does the name so will never be visited in 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.409
 the future in re canvas performance 

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.909
 so this is a property that is 

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:05.919
 particularly interesting because 

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:09.490
 in a way it's a guarantee 

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:12.909
 we will not do a job twice 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:16.539
 visit in more than one time the same name 

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:18.159
 so having a consistent stick on 

00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:21.570
 make sure that if we visit a place where we 

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:21.570
 will visit only once 

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:30.580
 another property if we have two 

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:34.300
 lawyers etc eligible h1 and h2 and that 

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:37.690
 they are such that h12 is still 

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.950
 smaller than 12 h of hate so at 

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.170
 shenzhen is always a 

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.960
 underestimation by contribution hd n 

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.660
 but that both are eligible then 

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.300
 we will see that h2 will drive more 

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.470
 quickly to the goal to explore or 

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:55.600
 exploit never more honor than h that 

00:08:53.470 --> 00:09:00.940
 the risk so to stars that would use 

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.630
 the restic shopping also 6 pm is not 

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.340
 admissible but we have 

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.890
 of alleurs b who is going to be a good 

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.590
 surprise over overestimation 

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.320
 so in other words if we did not 

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.150
 that hdn we can guarantee that these more 

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.900
 little ugal that the ha hate stars 

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:22.560
 so the real cost of the optimal path for 

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:26.700
 from a n went to the goal more 

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.990
 uncertain some additional good 

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.880
 in this case also to star will return 

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.800
 a solution whose cost is at most 

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.620
 low 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.710
 more than the optimal cost so to you 

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:43.090
 is not going to be wrong by more than 10 by 

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.380
 compared to optimality so that it can 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.660
 to be interesting if we are not in 

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.900
 able to find eligible ristic but 

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:52.870
 we have for one reason or another the 

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.460
 ability to ensure that we do not overestimate 

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:58.510
 no more a certain barabé one can 

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.280
 translate that to guarantees on 

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.580
 optima it and the path that is going to be 

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:10.390
 returned by not being 

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:13.990
 returned by a roof and finally two 

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:16.420
 last property if we only have our 

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:19.080
 tourist is exactly station at 

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.160
 buy hate canvas for everything and am 

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.320
 the optimality of the star and guarantees 

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.150
 so actually if you do 

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.600
 often think a little 

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:31.270
 you will see when done every time 

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:34.960
 to star is going to take a place that 

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.010
 belongs to the optimal path since h 

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.140
 hate stars we 

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:42.130
 directly indicates what are the nerves 

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:44.470
 who have a cost the cost that is the most 

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.900
 down so following these knots there it's 

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.230
 what light is right one of rhdp ira 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:53.290
 at you den we will go directly 

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:55.600
 towards their goal and then finally it's 

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.240
 maybe faster than properties 

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.890
 different but if we roll to stars 

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.960
 with a function is rustic that is 

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:06.700
 not eligible so we have that star 

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.740
 will find a solution if it exists 

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.530
 but we are not sure that she is 

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:14.350
 optimal hence hence the interest of watching 

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.960
 its properties of the canvas is between 

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:19.530
 others to know that if they managed to 

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.570
 define a style that is eligible or 

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:25.780
 even better that is consistent but 

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.950
 when if we only have the solution of 

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.490
 the star is well and truly 

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.490
 optima
