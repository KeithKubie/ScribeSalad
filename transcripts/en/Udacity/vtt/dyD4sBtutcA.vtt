00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.440
So how is it that one-third
divided by one-half is two-thirds?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.740
Well, dividing fractions

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.350
can also be thought of as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.218
A reciprocal, this means that you
switch the numerator and denominator,

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:19.730
so the reciprocal of one-half
becomes two over one.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.635
Since dividing is the same thing
as multiplying by the reciprocal,

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:30.058
one-third divided by one-half becomes
one-third times two over one and

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:34.850
we remember from before,
that we just multiply the numerators.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.232
So one times two gives us two and

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:42.190
we multiply the denominators,
three times one gives us three.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.079
Find the reciprocal of these numbers,

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.650
two-thirds, fourteen-fifths,
three, one-seventh.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.286
Here's a hint, any whole number is
the same thing as that number over one,

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:57.354
so three is three over one.
