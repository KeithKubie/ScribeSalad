00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
What?

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
Where am I?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.810
I was just walking on a beach with Benedict
Cumberbatch,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.410
Oh where were we?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.329
Right.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.259
DNews.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.550
Hi there, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.210
Ever been lost in a daydream?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.800
Ever had trouble separating imagination from
reality?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400
Yeah me too.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550
But there is a difference, and scientists
have discovered what it is.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.020
Turns out when you are revelling on a beach
with Benedict Cumberbatch your brain is running

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.550
in the opposite direction of reality.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.820
Literally.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.899
Researchers from the University of Wisconsin
identified the neural pathways in which daydreams

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.940
and reality travel and they appear to be heading
in opposite directions.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.859
The researchers tracked the electrical activity
of subjects, using EEG, or electroencephalography.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.139
EEGS are noninvasive sensors placed on the
scalp, it looks like a sci-fi hair net.

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:56.749
Some subjects imagined riding a bike while
focusing on details, like shapes and colors,

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.730
and then watched silent nature videos.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.149
The other subjects watched short videos and
then replayed them in their head.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.550
What the scientists found was surprising.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.270
Neural activity seemed to flow in specific
directions.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
For those imagining scenes, the information
flowed from parietal lobe to the occipital

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.350
lobe.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.910
From a higher–order region that synthesizes
information from the senses to a lower order

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.300
region, where the visual information is registered.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.591
When taking in information from reality, the
information followed the reverse path, from

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:26.070
the occipital lobe “up” to the parietal
lobe.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.420
How about people who seem to confuse reality
and daydreams?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.950
They might be lacking a specific fold in the
brain, called the paracingulate sulcus, or

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.950
PCS.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.520
Those with the fold have an easier time remembering
if something actually happened or if they

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520
just imagined it.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.550
They also perform better on memory tests.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.890
The size of the PCS fold varies naturally
within people, some people just have larger

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.160
ones than others.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.200
Unfortunately, the fold forms just before
birth so there’s not much you can do if

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.140
you don’t have one or if yours is small.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.060
So where does imagination happen in the brain?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
Imagination has been a tricky thing to pin
down.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.700
Imagination and creativity used to be considered
the domain of the “so-called” right brain.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.630
Which is now pretty much considered junk science.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.700
Some scientists consider the hippocampus to
be a prime location for imagination.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.200
It’s active in both imagining and remembering
images and events.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.370
This close location
could be one of the reasons memory is so unreliable.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.510
Yet researchers from Dartmouth University
have found out that the imagination isn’t

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.670
isolated to just one part of the brain.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.160
12 regions across the brain seem to play a
part in imagining.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.170
The so called mental playground is a large
cortical and subcortical network across the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.170
brain.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.060
It’s a place where you can visualize and
play around with images.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.140
We can combine shapes or see scenarios which
may not even happen in real life.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.000
Which makes sense, since imagining something
requires a lot of different processes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.250
It blends emotions, memory, thoughts, and
more to make-up something completely different.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.630
These types of studies can help us understand
what makes us separate from other species.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.040
What gives humans our imaginative edge?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.390
And they could potentially lead to new tools
to find out what happens when we sleep and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.390
dream.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.520
Or could lead to a new cognitive neuroscientific
theory on consciousness.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.670
What do you think?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.440
Do you ever get lost in a daydream?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640
How contrary to reality is your imagination?
