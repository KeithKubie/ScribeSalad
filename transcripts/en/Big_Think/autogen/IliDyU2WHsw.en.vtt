that what's the essence of science is

that what's the essence of science is
that it's never final although it's

the case of climate science what seems
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560
the case of climate science what seems
to me to be the case is that people

to me to be the case is that people
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.560

something that might incline them to
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.589
something that might incline them to
change their views and change the ways

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
change their views and change the ways

me completely unfounded climate science

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
me completely unfounded climate science

me completely unfounded climate science
is built on views about the atmosphere

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
is built on views about the atmosphere
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.080
is built on views about the atmosphere
that have been developed very

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
that have been developed very
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.290
that have been developed very
successfully and in a very rigorous way

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300
successfully and in a very rigorous way
 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.120

from the 19th century to the present
there are any doubt about the mechanisms

there are any doubt about the mechanisms
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.610
there are any doubt about the mechanisms
of the greenhouse effect there isn't

of the greenhouse effect there isn't
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.490
of the greenhouse effect there isn't
really any doubt about the evidence

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500
really any doubt about the evidence
 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.040
really any doubt about the evidence
behind the consensus that says that we

have contributed enormously to the

warming effects that are now becoming

apparent not only in the present but

apparent not only in the present but

apparent not only in the present but
also from the record of the Earth's

also from the record of the Earth's
 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.759
also from the record of the Earth's
average temperature so all of that is as

average temperature so all of that is as
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.670

take for granted that science tells them
like that water is h2o like the law of

earth is round and so on and so forth

earth is round and so on and so forth
there's no more reason to be skeptical

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750
there's no more reason to be skeptical
 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.250
there's no more reason to be skeptical
about the basic consensus of climate

about the basic consensus of climate

come in the next decades that's
extraordinarily difficult and on that

all we can do is to try to simulate the

all we can do is to try to simulate the
 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.600
all we can do is to try to simulate the
Earth's climate and how it's changing

Earth's climate and how it's changing

figure out the dynamics of the Earth's
 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.719
figure out the dynamics of the Earth's
climate then we can be reasonably sure

climate then we can be reasonably sure

climate then we can be reasonably sure
that that's something that is likely to

that that's something that is likely to
 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.130
that that's something that is likely to
happen so some of the forecasts about

we can't say for example how much the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690
we can't say for example how much the

temperature of the earth is going to
rise by 2100 but one thing that's really

rise by 2100 but one thing that's really
 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.320
rise by 2100 but one thing that's really
important to understand here is that

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330
important to understand here is that
 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.960
important to understand here is that
2100 isn't some magical moment I mean

2100 isn't some magical moment I mean
 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.400
2100 isn't some magical moment I mean
it's not really going to matter that

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410
it's not really going to matter that
 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.190
it's not really going to matter that
much if the temperature rises say four

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200
much if the temperature rises say four
 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.700
much if the temperature rises say four
or five degrees Celsius if that comes in

and the evidence for that seems to me

extremely strong so I think the the

extremely strong so I think the the

whether there's a good reason for it
 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.180
whether there's a good reason for it
that's perfectly understandable but if

that's perfectly understandable but if
