Estonian Designer Pavel Sidorenko repurposes
old vinyl records into wall clocks.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.089
The series is called Re-Vinyl and he wants
to reduce the waste of useful materials as

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.909
well decrease the consumption of new materials.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:32.189
Some of his designs include cityscapes, animals,
human interaction, and inanimate objects.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.810
Alvaro Cassinelli created these robotic Japanese
garden lamps for an exhibition in Tokyo.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.740
They're able to sense other objects so they
don't step on plants or run into anything

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.310
in the garden and they can be controlled with
a smart device.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.290
His hope is to one day have a garden that
takes care of itself in the absence of humans.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.330

Including a hand mixer using water color,
a wind up clock using pencil lead, and a Walkman

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.890
using charcoal.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.799
Dustin Yellin makes 3D collages by encasing
objects into layers of glass.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.170
He uses pieces he finds on the street, clippings,
computer generated images, acrylic, and glass

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.869
to create the sculptures.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:26.030
Like this massive piece that weighs 12 tons
and is 46.5 inches tall, 69 inches long, and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.560
27 inches deep and his latest series is called
psychogeographies.

High Voltage is a project by Phillip David
Stearns that merges electronics with photography.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.049
He produces images by applying 15,000 volts
of electricity to instant color film, that's

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.130
about 1,000 times the strength of a car battery.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.689
It creates an organic pattern and shows off
the ability of instant film beyond its typical

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.250
use of capturing the world around us.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.600

latex paint and a black sharpie.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.899
It took artist Sean Sullivan seven months
to get to the point where he finally considered

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.149
it done, partly because he exceeded his original
timeline by four months.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:18.819

featuring glow in the dark prints.
