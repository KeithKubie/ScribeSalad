00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.180
Let's say that you're in
desperate need of money and I

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.070
have money to lend
to other people.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.820
So this is me and this
is my gold chain.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.760
So you come to me and say,
Sal, I need $10,000 for a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.240
kidney transplant.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.270
Can you lend me the money?

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.520
I'm in desperate need.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.530
And I have $10,000.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.650
Sure, I'm willing to lend it
to you, but it's a tough

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.770
economy and you never know where
that money's going to go

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.130
and I don't know if you're going
to be able to keep your

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.970
job after going through this
kidney surgery and all that.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.080
So I'm very careful with my
money so I want to make sure

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.900
that you're good for it.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.700
So we think about it a little
bit and I say, hey, that watch

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.040
you have on your wrist, that
looks pretty nice.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.550
You say, this watch?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.800
Let me draw the watch.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.680
And I say, yeah, that watch.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.150
You're like, this watch
I got from my

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.440
great-great-grandfather and it's
actually worth-- I don't

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.310
know-- maybe it's a diamond
studded Rolex of some sort and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.330
it's actually worth
$30,000, right?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.660
And I know that, clearly because
I've already become

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.260
well acquainted with gold and
diamonds and things like that.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.300
So I say, I trust you and
you trust yourself.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.200
I'll lend you the $10,000, but
just so that we all know that

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.370
everything's going to be fine,
why don't you just leave your

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.360
great-grandfather's
watch with me?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.600
And when you pay back the
$10,000 with a low interest--

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.320
let's say it's 10% a week-- when
you pay back the money,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.490
the principal, with the
interest, however long you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.650
borrow it, I'll give you
back your watch.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.600
You're like, I don't
know about that.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.440
First of all, 10% a week
sounds like a lot.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.210
I was like, well, don't you just
need it for the kidney

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.330
transplant tomorrow and then you
can work a couple of weeks

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.030
and then pay it back.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.550
10% a week's not bad-- and we
all know that that is because

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.520
you compound that over the year
and it becomes some type

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120
of horrendous interest rate.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.160
But you're desperate.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.250
You need your kidney and I'm
like, look, you plan on paying

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.150
me back, right?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.650
So you're going to get your
$30,000 watch back, so what's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.090
there to worry, right?

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.460
So why don't you just leave this
with me as collateral?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.220
And you say, fine and you leave
your watch and you get

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.340
your kidney transplant and then
you try to work really

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.230
hard to pay it back,
but you never can

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.280
and I keep your watch.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.950
And this is how the pawn process
essentially works.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.760
You've pawned your watch off to
me, but in a less kind of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.080
derisive way of talking about
it, you've given it as

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.630
collateral for a loan.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.600
And I was willing to give you
the loan because I knew that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.470
if you couldn't pay it back, I
could keep this nice asset.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.430
And this happens all the
time in less shady

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.790
parts of our economy.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030
A bank will give you a loan and
they'll collateralize it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.600
by the house.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.820
If you can't pay the loan,
they keep the house.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.630
They want you to put a down
payment on the house so that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.400
even if the house devalues, they
still capture back most

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.750
of their money.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.500
And so this is a pretty
straightforward

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.430
collateralized loan.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.090
This is the collateral
you give me.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.820
I give you the loan.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.390
You pay it back.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.190
I give you back the
collateral.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.050
Now what if there was a reality
where I don't-- me as

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.890
the lender, I don't even like
this notion of collateral and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.660
all of that.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.970
I actually want to make it
very clear that I have

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.640
ownership of the collateral
when it happens, right?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.480
I don't want some Feds coming
in and saying, wow, whose

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.620
watch is this that
you're holding?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.710
Where's the receipt for this?

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.300
Where did you get it?

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.060
Was it stolen from somebody?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.450
And it looks all shady and I
probably do have some side

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.020
shady operations anyway so I
want to know that I own this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.050
watch in the event that
you don't come

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.840
back to pay the loan.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.310
So instead, we could have done
this exact same transaction--

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.290
so this is you again.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.330
This is me again.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.490
I'll draw that top hat
and the moustache.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.410
Those are my differentiating
characteristics, maybe the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.230
gold chain.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.850
And now what I can do is--
because I want ownership of

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.130
that watch, what I'll do is I
will buy that watch from you.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.730
So you'll give the watch-- so
the watch will literally

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.930
change hands.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:21.279
So I will buy the watch
from you for $10,000.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.940
But we'll also have
a side agreement.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.850
So far it's almost
identical, right?

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.370
The only difference between this
and what we did before

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.050
is, I'm actually selling
the money.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.590
I'm actually buying the
watch from you.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.370
This is a cash transaction.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.600
This wasn't a loan, strictly
speaking, but the same thing

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.450
is happening, right?

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.070
Up here you handed
me the watch and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.380
I handed you $10,000.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.940
Here, you handed me the watch
and I handed you $10,000.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.450
But what we'll add on to this
is an agreement that at some

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.510
future date-- so this is now.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.620
We also going to have an
agreement-- and both of us are

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.820
parties to this-- that in the
future, I will agree to sell

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.040
and you will agree to buy this
watch for me for something

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.390
more than $10,000.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.570
So in the future, you're going
to give me back my money.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.550
So it'll be $10,000 plus
something-- and that's

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.130
something is essentially
interest, right?

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.170
So I'll get my money back
and then I'll give

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.890
you back the watch.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.060
So if you think about it, this
is completely identical

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.210
economically to what we
did up here, right?

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.930
I gave you $10,000.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.880
You gave me the watch
as collateral.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.190
When you pay back the $10,000
plus interest, I give you back

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.130
the watch, right?

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.220
But at no time did I really
have real, legitimate

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.590
ownership of that watch.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.370
Well, in this situation,
the same thing happens.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.330
You come to me.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.450
I give you money.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.570
You give me the watch, but I
bought it from you so I have a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.760
receipt too.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.650
I am the official owner of the
watch while you have my money,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.990
but we have an agreement that at
some future date, you will

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.300
repurchase the watch from me.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.200
for $10,000 plus some amount,
which is essentially the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.310
interest. So this was a loan
collateralized by a watch, but

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.460
the only difference here is that
instead of it just being

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.620
collateral, you actually sold
it to me and then we had a

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.620
repurchase agreement-- and it
took me six minutes to say

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:45.480
that, but I think it was worth
it-- where you agree to

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.910
repurchase the watch
at some point.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.270
It's actually I'm the holder of
the repurchase agreement.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.590
So the money lender-- so
I get the watch and

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.070
a repurchase agreement.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.470
We'll call that a repo.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.530
So these are two assets that I
now have-- the watch plus the

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.650
repurchase agreement.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.665
You get the money.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:08.460
And it's actually called
a reverse repo, from

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.710
your point of view.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.290
But the whole idea here is this
agreement forces you to

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.030
buy the watch back at the
original amount that you

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.080
essentially borrowed from me
plus some interest. And this

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.890
essentially forces me
to sell it to you.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.320
So we have a-- it's

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.060
essentially a forward contract.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.750
A forward contract is just an
agreement to transact in the

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.900
future at some given price.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.300
And the whole reason why I did
this is because this is how

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.900
the Fed transacts.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.600
This is how the Fed lends,
especially with

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.520
the discount window.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.600
Sometimes it's called a
repo transaction or

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.060
a repurchase agreement.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.340
And so what the Fed does when
someone comes to it at the

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.180
discount window-- let me
actually draw proper balance

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.660
sheets now.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.320
Let's say that this over
here is a bank in need.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.300
I won't worry about the
right-hand side of the balance

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.830
sheet too much.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.640
It has some liabilities,
some equities.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.780
Let's say it has a
ton of assets.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.580
Let's say that these right
here are treasuries.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.330
But it's all out
of cash, right?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.810
This is the bank.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.390
It's all out of cash and on the
other hand, we have the

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.470
Federal reserve.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.425
Let me see if I can draw their
balance sheet properly.

00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:36.409
And the Federal reserve-- well,
for the most part, these

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:39.669
are going to be treasuries
right now.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.659
It has some liabilities.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.740
I won't go into that just yet.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.660
It has some equity.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.270
And let's say you're one
of these pariah banks.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.440
No-one's willing
to lend to you.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.580
Your depositors are taking
out their money.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.730
So you need to convert some of
these treasuries into cash.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.390
You don't want to just dump
them on the market.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.270
Maybe there are other assets
that are less liquid and if

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.360
you just dump them, you won't
get the value you want.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.910
So essentially you enter into
a repurchase agreement with

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.860
the Federal reserve.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.400
So this is the Fed reserve.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.420
You go to the Federal reserve
discount window.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.400
The discount rate might be-- I
don't know-- 5% on an annual

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.770
basis, but we won't get into
the technicalities of that.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.090
You say, hey, Fed, lend
me some money.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.080
And the Fed says, OK, let me
print some money for you.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.980
So these are the liabilities
notes outstanding and then he

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.680
prints some Federal reserve
notes, but instead of just

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.940
lending the money to you and
then keeping these treasuries

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.450
as collateral, the Federal
reserve will actually buy

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.610
these-- it'll enter into a
repurchase agreement with you.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.820
So the mechanics of that is that
the Federal reserve will

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.030
buy these treasuries from you.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:10:02.200
So now all of a sudden, the
treasuries-- the Federal

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:09.060
reserve notes will go from from
the Federal reserve to

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.310
you and then your cash will go
to-- then your treasury notes

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.770
will go to the Federal
reserve, right?

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.130
This is cash-- Federal reserve
printed cash, gave it to you,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.100
and then essentially bought
treasury notes from you.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.160
So now these are
treasury notes.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.560
These are the treasury notes
that were here before.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.300
But it has a repurchase
agreement where you agree at

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.500
some future date to unwind this
transaction, where you're

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.630
going to buy back your
treasuries and you're going to

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.960
pay the amount that the treasury
paid you initially

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.490
plus some interest, right?

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.920
So the basic way to view it
is, this was just a loan.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.630
You just borrowed this much
from the Federal reserve.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.780
The Federal reserve kept your
treasuries as collateral, but

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.560
it actually had formal
ownership over it.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.970
And that's what differentiates
a repo agreement from just a

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.810
traditional collateralized loan,
but in the future you're

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.490
going to buy back those
treasuries for the amount the

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.870
Federal reserve had originally
bought them from you for plus

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.330
a little bit of interest. You're
going to pay a little

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.800
interest and that interest is
going to be dictated by the

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.090
discount rate.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.650
Anyway, all out of time.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.590
In the next video, we'll
actually look at the Federal

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.780
reserve's balance sheet.
