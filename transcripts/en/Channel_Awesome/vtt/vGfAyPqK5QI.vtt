00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.720
Jesus, what is this, now? The fourth "Lilo and Stitch" movie? This is getting crazy!

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.040
Well, thankfully, "Leroy &amp; Stitch" is the last of these films,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.000
and I say "thankfully" because it actually kinda goes out on a good note.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.600
Ehh, that is to say for what it is.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.020
I'm finding out more and more some of these direct-to-DVD sequels have to be taken for what they are.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.760
For example, I'm gonna judge something like "Lion King 2", which is a direct sequel,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.560
differently than I am "Tarzan and Jane", which is  obviously just supposed to be a pilot for a TV show.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.300
And, at the beginning of this one, you can very quickly see what it's supposed to be:

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.000
not a pilot for the TV show, but the ending of the TV show.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now keep in mind I didn't watch the cartoon show, but I got the general gist:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.140
Lilo and Stitch are going around, trying to collect all the other experiments, turn them good,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.500
and stop the bad aliens from collecting them and taking over the universe.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.860
Well, that's exactly where this movie starts off.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.160
Lilo and her friends are being rewarded by the Intergalactic Council.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.720
They're all given chances to do what they've always wanted to do, whether it be go back to their evil lab,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.960
or be captain of their own spaceship, but Lilo admits that she's really gonna miss them and doesn't want them to leave.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.000
They decide to stay behind, but she realizes she may have forced them to make the wrong choice,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.920
and, thus, she finally says goodbye.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.540
They all go their separate ways, but Hämsterviel, the villain of the last...

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.440
umm... kinda sequel... and the villain of the show escapes and makes a clone of Stitch.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.080
An evil clone, of course, which makes a clone of that clone, and a clone of that clone,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.980
and soon, there's an army of Leroys that want to collect all the experiments that were set free,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.140
destroy them all, and, of course, get back to their evil plans of conquering the universe.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.880
Much like the movie pilot, "Stitch", this film focuses again on the aliens, which are, once again, very funny.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.380
Lilo is, once again, given a smaller role, but I feel they actually do have the emotional connection there.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.320
For example, I really like that she becomes friends with Experiment 625,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040
or, as she now names him, Reuben. I like seeing these two work off each other.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.720
I also really like seeing Hämsterviel and the captain of the guard still work off each other. They're still really funny.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.720
And, unlike a lot of the Disney sequels, it actually builds up to a good climax.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.800
You think it's gonna be another one of those abrupt happy endings where it's not really that big of a climax;

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.440
it's just kind of a tiny one because, hey, they don't have much of a budget, but no!

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.700
They whip out all of the clones of Leroy and have them battle all of the experiments I'm pretty sure that were in the show.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.840
And all of them look different, and sound different, and have these unique powers, and...

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.540
Yeah! It's really creative! It's funny. It's energized. It's a lot of fun.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.560
Now, granted, what ends up saving the day might be a little too silly... I don't know.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
It's Lilo and Stitch. I get it, cutesy stuff, but the battle before was so much fun,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.560
I kinda wish it would just keep going that direction, but that's nitpicking.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.560
For what is basically a series finale to a show, it seems like it wraps up everything pretty damn good.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.740
The original voice actress of Lilo is back.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.840
Again, I'm not really sure why they switched 'em out, but it's great hearing her voice again.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280
The humorous scenes are genuinely humorous, and even the emotional scenes are kind of well done.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.240
There's a really nice scene where everyone is saying goodbye, kinda going their separate ways,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.040
and then, when Lilo has to say goodbye to Stitch, all you see is him looking at the "Ugly Duckling" book,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.000
putting it away, and they just kinda sit there in silence.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.660
That's... actually kind of profound. It's simple, but it works.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.340
And maybe that's the best way to describe this: simple, but it works.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.820
You can tell from the animation that this isn't gonna be the same cinematic quality of the first film

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.580
or "Lilo &amp; Stitch 2", where they put a lot more money into it.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.740
But, honestly, for the budget they had, I think they did a really good job.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.600
Does it have the emotion of the first film? No. Is it gonna be remembered as much as the first film? No.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.480
But, again, I don't think that's what it was meant to be.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.020
It's supposed to be a wrap-up of "Lilo &amp; Stitch", yes, but more the TV show than the films.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.820
And, truth be told, this is a really fun sendoff.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.300
I can't act like it's phenomenal, but, for what they had to do, I'd say it's pretty nicely accomplished.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.980
Again, its one of the nice things of being forced to watch some of these movies:

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.480
I'm a "Lilo &amp; Stitch" fan, but I never would've checked out the sequels

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.900
or these TV pilots if I didn't have to do this for a job, but, because I have to, I'm glad I checked 'em out.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.680
While none of them quite capture the freshness or the emotion of the first one,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.160
they come pretty close sometimes, and they were definitely entertaining throughout the majority of 'em.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.520
Whether you enjoyed the cinematic side or the television side,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.760
it's nice to know that, either way, Lilo and Stitch go out on top.
