00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.950
 
my feeling is that China is being well

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
my feeling is that China is being well
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740
my feeling is that China is being well
managed and the government have provided

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
managed and the government have provided
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.820
managed and the government have provided
necessary stimulus to to promote growth

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
necessary stimulus to to promote growth
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.359
necessary stimulus to to promote growth
within China and so I think China will

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
within China and so I think China will
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.830
within China and so I think China will
pull out all right and with regard to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
pull out all right and with regard to
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.140
pull out all right and with regard to
the world generally it seems to me that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
the world generally it seems to me that
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.210
the world generally it seems to me that
so the Chinese one way or the other

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
so the Chinese one way or the other
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120
so the Chinese one way or the other
owed a great deal of assets which are

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
owed a great deal of assets which are
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.350
owed a great deal of assets which are
denominated in u.s. dollars and they

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
denominated in u.s. dollars and they
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180
denominated in u.s. dollars and they
will want to protect the value of those

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
will want to protect the value of those
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850
will want to protect the value of those
assets and so they will probably not

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
assets and so they will probably not
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.760
assets and so they will probably not
sell them and so therefore the Chinese

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
sell them and so therefore the Chinese
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.610
sell them and so therefore the Chinese
government as China generally speaking

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
government as China generally speaking
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.319
government as China generally speaking
will not make the recession worse but I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
will not make the recession worse but I
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.260
will not make the recession worse but I
don't think that the growth in China

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
don't think that the growth in China
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420
don't think that the growth in China
will have a great deal of direct impact

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
will have a great deal of direct impact
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360
will have a great deal of direct impact
on pulling back the West essentially the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
on pulling back the West essentially the
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090
on pulling back the West essentially the
West out of the recession I think the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
West out of the recession I think the
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.560
West out of the recession I think the
West will pull itself out of recession

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
West will pull itself out of recession
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.280
West will pull itself out of recession
I've got great confidence in that but so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
I've got great confidence in that but so
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.000
I've got great confidence in that but so
that's my view

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
that's my view
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.370
that's my view
my overall view on this question I'm a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
my overall view on this question I'm a
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.820
my overall view on this question I'm a
frequent visitor to China and I know

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
frequent visitor to China and I know
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.530
frequent visitor to China and I know
that China will survive very well and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
that China will survive very well and
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749
that China will survive very well and
will continue to prosper but I'm not

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
will continue to prosper but I'm not
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.850
will continue to prosper but I'm not
quite sure that there will have a very

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
quite sure that there will have a very
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.420
quite sure that there will have a very
direct impact on the general recession

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
direct impact on the general recession
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.259
direct impact on the general recession
in the West so
