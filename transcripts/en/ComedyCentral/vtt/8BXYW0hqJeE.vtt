00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.336
This morning,
the nominees were announced

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:04.004
for the 89th Academy Awards.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.639
And in contrast
with last year's slate

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.674
that provoked the
Oscars So White hashtag,

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.010
this year features a diverse set
of nominees,

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.445
including a record
six black actors.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.681
Then again... then again,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.417
a record-tying 14 nominations
also went to <i>La La Land,</i>

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.487
which is pretty much the whitest
(bleep) movie imaginable.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.189
-(laughter)
-I haven't seen it.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.590
I don't know.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:26.326
It just doesn't seem like
a movie I'm gonna see, but...

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.929
From what I hear--
I'm just piecing this together--

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.330
but I think
it's about Ryan Gosling

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.833
explaining jazz to Emma Stone,
and I assume

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.067
includes such songs as,

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.003
"I Brought My Own Cloth Bag
to Whole Foods,"

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.406
and "Extra Mild Salsa, Please."

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.408
The only thing whiter
than <i>La La Land</i>

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.977
would be a biopic about
the invention of mayonnaise,

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.079
-which...
-(laughter)

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.348
...incidentally
is in the works, you guys.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.285
Daniel Day-Lewis is gonna be
amazing in this movie.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387
-Amazing.
-(laughter)

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.789
He pretended to be mayonnaise
for, like, six months

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.658
to get ready for this. Like...

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:02.029
So, comedians, what's an even
whiter musical than <i>La La Land?</i>

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.931
-Kate.
<i>-The Grand Wizard of Oz.</i>

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.299
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.267
-That'd be very white.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.304
-Very white. John.
<i>-Annie Get your UGGs.</i>

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:11.839
-HARDWICK: Yes, points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.907
-Claudia.
<i>-How to Succeed</i>

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.776
<i>in Everything
Without Really Trying.</i>

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.876
-(laughter, applause)
-HARDWICK: Points. Points.
