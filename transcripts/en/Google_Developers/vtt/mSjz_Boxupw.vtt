JULIE PEARL: Setting
this up, I believe

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.080
this was introduced as a
totally awesome fireside chat.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.490
So I really hope that it
lives up to that expectation.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.620
All right.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.620
And so I am really excited
to have the opportunity

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.660
to do this fireside
chat today with Alaina.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.730
Alaina, as you know, is
the CEO of Women Who Code.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.420
And she started her
career working for Puma,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.256
and after Puma, went
and got her MBA,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.880
eventually worked
for a company and was

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.830
helping to design the first
volleyball and basketball shoes

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.260
designed exclusively for women.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.580
And she eventually
moved into technology,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.680
and that led her to a
path where now she's

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.560
the CEO of Women Who Code.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.300
And I think the fun fact
here is that she's visited,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.510
I think, 60 countries, and
she also loves chocolate.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.160
So please help me in
introducing and welcoming Alaina

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.440
to the stage.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.835
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:04.272
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Thank you.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.950
JULIE PEARL: OK, so
tell us a little bit

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760
about Women Who Code.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.810
ALAINA PERCIVAL: First
off, how many of you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.185
heard of Women Who
Code before today?

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:23.110
I'm glad I saw a couple
hands go up in the room.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.550
Women Who Code is a
501(3)(c) nonprofit dedicated

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.990
to inspiring women to excel
in technology careers.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780
We're in 15 countries.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.370
And this week, we're proud to
announce that we've exceeded

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.140
25,000 members globally.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.898
JULIE PEARL: Yay.

00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:42.235
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.860
ALAINA PERCIVAL:
Women Who Code focuses

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.220
on providing an
avenue into technology

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.760
and providing mentorship
and learning opportunities

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.390
so that women both stay in their
careers and make it to the top.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.250
We've tripled year over year
since we've been created.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.949
And we've launched last
week in Mexico City.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.100
And the week before, we launched
in our first city in Africa.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.760
So we're now in Algeria.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.790
So that's another very
exciting thing to announce.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.610
So I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.640
We're producing over 500 free
technical events for women

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.780
every year.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
And we've got this
great movement growing.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.180
And we're able to produce
all of these events

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.770
through our global
network of leaders.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.560
And so that's something
that I'm really

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.107
interested in discussing today--
how we're able to do that.

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:48.190
JULIE PEARL: That's great.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.660
Well, maybe you could share with
us some of the success stories,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.118
and tell us about
some of the women

00:02:52.118 --> 00:02:55.090
in the community that are
part of your organization.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.580
ALAINA PERCIVAL: So
Women Who Code, our 500

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.790
plus technical events are
produced by our directors

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.600
and leaders around the world.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.400
And so these are
primarily technical events

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.460
where you're learning Android,
or JavaScript, Python, Ruby.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.920
We're giving women
opportunities to speak.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.130
Maybe you give your first tech
talk at a Women Who Code event.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.540
And then perhaps you'll
go back to your office,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.960
and you'll give that talk there.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.650
And then maybe
you'll expand on it,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.230
and give that talk
at a conference.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.550
So these leaders,
what we've seen

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.930
is, after you've
been a Women Who

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.870
Code leader for about a
year, that you actually

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.280
begin to become a leader in
the tech industry in general.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.040
So you start to get asked to
come in and speak to companies,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.870
and talk about best practices.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.650
So you're a thought leader.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.590
You get voted in the press
as 30 under 30 Women in Tech.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.770
And we also see that they
start getting invited

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.990
to speak at conferences.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.600
So you're really shifting from
being a leader of Women Who

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.467
Code to a leader in
the tech industry

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:04.050
in general, which is something
that we're really trying to do.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.730
And today, we actually
have our leader

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.540
from Atlanta in the audience.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.410
And that's just an
absolute coincidence.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.760
And when she first stepped up
to be the leader in Atlanta,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.459
she was not sure about it.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.839
She was not sure that she'd
be able to do it well.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.330
She hated to stand up at the
front of it a very small room

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.170
and say, hey, my name's
Erica, and today we're

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.770
going to be learning Android.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.380
And if anybody has
questions, you can ask me.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.500
OK, I'm going to sit down.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.930
But she stood at the front
of the room for over a year.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.630
And she talked to
people in the community.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.680
And this autumn, she
was invited to speak

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.695
at three different conferences.

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:53.920
She actually gave a talk to
a standing room only crowd.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.220
And she's an awesome engineer.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.010
If she'd applied to
speak at a conference,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.140
she probably would
have gotten in.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.610
But she probably never
would've applied.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.140
And she probably
wouldn't have been

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.140
asked to apply had
she not stepped up

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.552
as a leader in Women Who Code.

00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:12.510
JULIE PEARL: You know,
it's kind of interesting

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.440
talking about her,
because I think many of us

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.700
sometimes feel like
maybe we're not

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.410
good enough in certain things.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.460
So I'm kind of curious.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.770
If any of you kind of felt
like you weren't good enough

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.520
to be doing the job that you're
currently doing-- a couple

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.160
hands.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.100
Sometimes it's called
the impostor syndrome.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.972
I like to call it fraud complex.

00:05:36.972 --> 00:05:40.830
It's the way I always like,
I don't know how I got here.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.590
And so some of the advice
that we're given is,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.840
you should fake it
until you make it.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.620
Not sure what that
means, but I'm kind of

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.620
trying to follow that advice.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.090
I'm kind of curious,
what have you seen,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.890
and any advice that you have
for women in this situation.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.952
And maybe based on
your own experiences--

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:04.410
because I read an
article recently,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.220
but you kind of made a
comment that you felt this way

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.460
at one point in your career.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.360
ALAINA PERCIVAL: I definitely
felt this way myself.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.950
I'd been working with Women
Who Code for over two years.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.040
I was a leader in
the organization.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.820
And I had come into
this role without ever

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.040
having the goal of becoming
a software engineer.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.700
I wanted to learn how to code,
and I did learn how to code.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.760
It's really fun.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.520
But I didn't have the goal of
becoming a software engineer.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.060
And so I thought, well, I can't
run an organization getting

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.270
women to become and excel in
careers in software engineering

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.490
if that's not who I am.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.330
And so finally, I just had to
say to myself, you know what?

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.190
If a software engineer
takes this role,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.017
then we're actually going
against our mission,

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:54.850
because she wouldn't
be a software engineer.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.310
So I guess I can do this.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.450
And so I had to
actually convince myself

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.640
that it was OK for
me to step up and be

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.600
a leader in the organization.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.570
Actually, you have a pretty
amazing story as well.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.990
Would you be
willing to share it?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.890
[LAUGHING]

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.223
JULIE PEARL: Who's interviewing
who in this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:14.416
ALAINA PERCIVAL: [LAUGHING]

00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:16.040
JULIE PEARL: [LAUGHING]
So Alaina and I

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.520
were chatting earlier.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.750
Suzanne mentioned when
I had this opportunity

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.780
to go to Motorola, I was working
at Google on acquisitions.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.910
And I was involved
in a lot of the work

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.780
up until the point where Google
actually acquired Motorola.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.600
And at that point,
I was asked if I

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.440
would go and be the CIO,
at which point, my eyebrows

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.220
went up, similar to somebody
here in the front row.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.060
Me?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.730
I'm like, there must be
somebody sitting behind me.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.650
And I really, I couldn't
believe that somebody

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.790
would actually have
considered me for that role.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.510
And it really took me awhile.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.130
I mean, it was a
huge opportunity.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.430
It was a huge organization.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.926
I was taking on a team of 600
employees, 600 contractors.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.340
I'd managed a team of
about 150 at max before.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.600
So it was one of those
opportunities where

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.890
I kept saying, I can't
possibly be qualified for it.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.960
But everyone kept
saying, no, we actually

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.520
want you to take the role.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.610
And I did.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:29.130
And what I'll say is I
learned a lot about myself

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.640
through the process.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.919
And I think-- I
read a lot about,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.230
sometimes we have to take
the opportunities that

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.520
are presented sometimes, even
if they seem like they're well

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.010
beyond something
we can actually do,

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.330
because everyone knew
that I hadn't been a CIO.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.680
I had a lot of resources, a
lot of people, a lot of advice,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.420
a lot of mentors.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.100
And it was really incredible.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.560
And the good thing is that now
I've learned a lot about myself

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.654
through that, which
is really important.

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:00.320
ALAINA PERCIVAL: So
with Women Who Code,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.280
we really work to make sure that
you have a network of people,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.220
so that when you start to run
these things through your mind,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.520
like can I be the
CIO of Motorola?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.290
Yes.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.230
Yes, you can.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.020
That's fantastic.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.106
JULIE PEARL: Should have
called you at the time.

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:18.610
ALAINA PERCIVAL: [LAUGHING]
Or I've been in my role

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.000
for two years.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.770
When is it time to
ask for a promotion?

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.790
Or am I ready to
start interviewing

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.630
to become a software engineer?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.860
Yes, go ahead and do it.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.151
They're not going to give
you a job until you're ready.

00:09:34.151 --> 00:09:37.010
So just go ahead and do it.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.080
And so having that network, and
building those relationships,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.800
and being really authentic
from the beginning,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.310
it doesn't matter if your goal
is coming out two years later,

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.400
or five years later.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.190
You're taking those
steps, and it becomes fun.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.860
And what happens is that those
opportunities open up for you.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.170
JULIE PEARL: That's great.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.140
So Google's developed
this program

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.450
we call Unconscious Bias.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.060
And--

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.990
ALAINA PERCIVAL:
Thank you for that.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.640
JULIE PEARL: Yeah, it's
really fascinating.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.139
And employees are going through
this training by which we're

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:15.960
really learning about what--
in many ways, how decisions are

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.390
being made, and what the
information is that we're

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.370
using to make those decisions.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.730
And I'm kind of curious,
your take on examples

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.430
of unconscious bias that
you've seen that maybe you

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.499
could share with us.

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:32.040
ALAINA PERCIVAL: So I think this
one is incredibly important.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.890
And as I'm saying big numbers
like, hey, Woman Who Code,

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.610
our goal is to reach
a million women.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.010
We're currently
reaching over 25,000.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.990
Actually, I'm realizing
that we have a lot of power

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.220
with the over 100 companies that
are supporting Women Who Code.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.300
And so what we're
hearing is, hey, it's

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.790
not some big dramatic thing that
causes you to run out the door.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.260
It's little tiny things
that are happening day

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.350
after day that make
you wonder if this

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.750
is the right career
for you, make

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.770
you wonder if you're good enough
for the role that you're doing.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:19.710
And so I hear everything from
I create colorful spreadsheets,

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.510
and my team makes fun of me.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.330
Or a woman told me
recently-- and she's

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.610
in a very senior position.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.750
And she was working
with a French colleague,

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.760
and he said, oh, I've never
had to explain infrastructure

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.790
to a woman before.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.270
And she's like, just
imagine me to be Tom.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.960
I've got this.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.910
Don't worry.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.200
And those are really clear.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.320
But then there's the more
subtle things that-- project

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.190
distribution, something
that you were really

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.300
wanting to get on that
other people somehow

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.510
managed to get on it.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.160
And you know, was
I not good enough?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.310
Was there hidden bias there?

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.110
And so it's sometimes
easier to process

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.880
the things that
are clearly like,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.260
oh, they just didn't get it.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.640
But sometimes, there's the
more subtle things that

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.240
make you wonder, was it me?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.410
And they're little,
little tiny things

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.480
that happen day after day.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.890
But I think that with hidden
bias training and building

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.510
awareness that
this exists, we're

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.280
able to process it better, and
hopefully improve the workplace

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.570
environment, so that it's
happening less frequently.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.760
JULIE PEARL: I work with
some female engineers who

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.880
have been complaining recently
because we've had some events

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.300
with the outside community.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.920
And they often believe that the
Google engineers at the event

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.580
are coordinating, or
part of marketing,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.820
and they're not being recognized
immediately as engineers.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:13:00.380
And how do we make sure that
even other people at the event

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.720
can call people
on that behavior,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.680
and not making assumptions
about what people's roles are?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.110
ALAINA PERCIVAL: I
had a couple of women

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.540
who had come to Google I/O, and
this was not at a Google event,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.190
but it was at an after party.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.630
And this young engineer was
like, well, why are you here?

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.450
And they said, oh,
we're Android engineers.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.110
We're here for the conference.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.230
And he was mortified, of course.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.512
JULIE PEARL: We have a
lot of improvement to do.

00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:33.470
ALAINA PERCIVAL: That
was completely unrelated.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.820
JULIE PEARL: Oh, yeah.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.530
So we've seen a lot of
companies recently releasing

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.350
their diversity data.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.790
And I think it's a great thing
in terms of being transparent.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.110
But obviously, we have
a long way to go there.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.210
What do you think
companies can do

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.340
to increase the diversity of
their employee population?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.060
ALAINA PERCIVAL: So these
numbers when they come out,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.600
they are disappointing.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.370
But the fact that companies
are putting this information

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.810
out there is a commitment
to seeing change.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.050
So this is incredibly exciting.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:15.880
And so the next steps are, like
you said, how do we do this?

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.330
And one is increasing
the pipeline.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.170
Two is making sure that you're
reaching a broad community

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.250
in your recruiting.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.570
And then the other side is
that numbers are coming out,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.800
like 56% of women are leaving
their technical careers

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.020
at the mid-career level,
after about 10 years.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.430
And this is a major
leaky bucket issue.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.390
And if we can't correct that,
we're not going to reach 50%.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.530
Women aren't a minority.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.180
Women are actually
51% of the population.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.760
And so really
working-- and I think

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.850
that Google's in an
amazing position,

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.970
because you love doing research,
and you have the ability

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:09.540
to find out really
what's happening here,

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.140
and how can we change it.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.340
And so really
creating opportunities

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.480
where women understand
that, hey, there

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.600
are next steps in your
career-- creating mentorship

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.600
and advocacy programs in the
company, checking to make sure

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.710
that there's not a wage gap.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.970
And it's tough to tell a company
to make a decision that's

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.790
not fiscally responsible.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:45.960
But the reality is is if you
know that you're earning less

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.720
than your male counterpart,
and you have an opportunity

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.530
to change careers, or
you have an opportunity

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.750
to drop out of
your career, you're

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.690
a little bit more
likely to do that.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:02.090
And so you're missing out on
that 20 years of a woman's

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.360
career where she is in the most
senior position, where she's

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.650
providing the most
value to the company,

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.810
and when she's
also in a position

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.850
to be mentoring and
leading everyone,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.120
but definitely women
coming into the industry.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.470
JULIE PEARL: Yeah, I found this
report to be really alarming.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.900
You know, seeing a lot of
women leave their career

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900
at the 10-year mark.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.360
It's like, where are they going?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.950
But have you seen
the specific things

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.060
that companies are doing that's
really helping keep women pass

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.620
that 10-year mark on average?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.260
Or examples?

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.420
I think some companies are
starting to look at job shares.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.210
Are there other things besides
the mentoring and the job share

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.240
that you mentioned that
could be relevant here?

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.823
ALAINA PERCIVAL:
Yeah, well, certainly

00:16:44.823 --> 00:16:48.700
having a lot of
advocacy programs,

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.330
so making sure that
women have mentors,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.670
creating a culture
of celebrating women,

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.590
and making sure
that-- right now,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.840
it's not completely
comfortable for women

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.930
to talk about the
successes in their careers.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.460
And it's not completely
comfortable for society

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.010
to hear that.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.990
So if you can have
people advocating

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:15.810
for you in the company, that's
certainly going to help.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.579
Doing the research.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.950
Talking about hidden biases.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.599
I was giving a talk, or I
was on a panel recently,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.200
and an engineering
manager from the audience

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.620
actually read a
review that he'd done.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.520
And then he went through
and-- he'd already

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.110
done this-- analyzed every
single thing that he'd said.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.390
And so there was
like, oh, you know,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:44.160
I'm not sure that she's as
enthusiastic about the company

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.120
because she's leaving at 6:00.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.240
But there's another guy on
the team who also has a child,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.900
and he's leaving
at this time too,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.860
and why haven't I've
written this in his review?

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.290
And so it was really interesting
and incredibly revealing

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.130
to these little tiny things
that were the hidden biases.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.570
Certainly, that's another thing
that companies can be doing.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:14.220
But creating clear pathways
for leveling up in your career.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:20.660
Having plans around distributing
great projects among team

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.790
members, and really
making sure that there's

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.940
opportunities to stay and
level up in the company.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.810
JULIE PEARL: That's great.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.400
So people used to ask me, what
is one thing that you observe

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.080
that women do quite a bit?

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.730
And something I've noticed
is I go to a lot of meetings.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.050
That tends to be my job now.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.510
And there's the main table,
and then sometimes there's

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.120
seating on the outside of
the room, the overflow.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.990
And my observation is is
that I see a lot of women

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.470
sitting at the outside.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.060
They don't sit at the table.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.360
And so I observe
this quite a bit.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.100
And now I encourage, if I'm
the one running a meeting,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.940
I will actually call various
women from the outside to say,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.710
you need to sit at
the table, especially

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.320
in engineering teams, where
it's more male-dominated

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.390
and the numbers
are fairly obvious.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.509
What observations have you seen,
just like a behavioral thing

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:20.050
that you see women doing that
men aren't, that you could sort

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.130
of advise this group
as some takeaway

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.850
that they could do
starting tomorrow?

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.800
ALAINA PERCIVAL:
Bragging on yourself.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.570
And that sounds terrible.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.680
But the truth is, if you
don't champion your successes,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.880
it's not going to get heard,
and so definitely making sure

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.310
that people know that
you lead this project,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.280
that you received a promotion,
that you're giving this talk,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.930
and getting the word out there.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:54.550
And that's how you're going to
make the difference between,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.290
hey, here's two
great people who've

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.090
been contributing
in this company.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.750
This is who we're
going to promote.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.750
Oh, I heard about
this person, and we're

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.230
going to try and get her to come
over and join our company now

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.612
in a higher position.

00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:10.320
JULIE PEARL: So this
is kind of relevant.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.028
There's this new
initiative, Applaud Her,

00:20:12.028 --> 00:20:14.075
that you're doing
with Women Who Code.

00:20:14.075 --> 00:20:16.455
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:20:16.455 --> 00:20:19.880
ALAINA PERCIVAL: So this
goes back to the whole idea

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.070
that it's a little bit
difficult for women

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.510
to celebrate the everyday
successes in their careers.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.100
And every time I talk
about it, I'm like,

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.290
does this really exist?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.020
Am I crazy when I'm saying it?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.390
Is everybody going to
start shaking their head?

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.704
And recently, I was
speaking with a woman who

00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:36.870
was director of engineering.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.840
And she said, you know what?

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.050
I'm now senior director
of engineering,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.090
and I've been too embarrassed to
put it on my LinkedIn profile.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.005
And this is crazy.

00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:48.895
She was too embarrassed to put
it on her LinkedIn profile.

00:20:48.895 --> 00:20:50.720
So it absolutely exists.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.080
And so Applaud Her
is a theme that Women

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.060
Who Code is weaving into
every single thing that we do,

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.910
because one of our
long-term impacts

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.090
is that we want it
to be comfortable

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.710
for you to talk about the
successes in your career.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.900
So Women Who Code's
"Diverse Code,"

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.570
it's a newsletter that we
send out on a weekly basis,

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.520
one of the things that
we include in there

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.510
are your successes.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:15.270
So please, of course, sign
up for the "Diverse Code"

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.320
at womenwhocode.com.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.670
But please send
us your successes.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.220
We want to be celebrating you.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.930
And you're all having these.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:30.163
Actually, who's been promoted
in the past six months?

00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:34.910
Who launched a really
awesome product?

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.690
Who did something else
great that I haven't asked?

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.740
Come on, everybody's hand
should go up at that.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.132
Yeah, so we want
to hear from you,

00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:47.590
and we want to make
sure that we're

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.040
talking about these things.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.840
And so, it's a combination
of definitely celebrating

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.310
you, making sure that the world
knows that there are actually

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:03.180
a ton of smart, ambitious, and
qualified women in the tech

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.560
industry, and making sure
that you know it's OK for you

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.940
to be talking
about these things.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.224
JULIE PEARL: So in the spirit
of speaking up and promoting

00:22:13.224 --> 00:22:15.140
yourselves, we're going
to actually open it up

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.090
for a few questions.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.595
So there's some mics
floating around, which

00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:21.720
I don't see the mic people.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.400
So why don't we take a
question in the back,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.384
and I can at least repeat it.

00:22:27.384 --> 00:22:29.183
AUDIENCE: So one of
the things that I

00:22:29.183 --> 00:22:35.240
hear is [INAUDIBLE] women in
technology is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.695
But one thing I hear
constantly mirroring

00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:42.500
that is an unwillingness
for the tech industry

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.000
to be really honest
about how they

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.767
compensate their employees.

00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:47.600
Companies don't want
to tell other companies

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.040
how much they pay their people.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.890
Where I work, we're
actually encouraged

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.590
not to talk about what
our grade level is,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.950
or whether we got promoted.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.080
You're basically trying to
encourage your employees

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.190
to hide this information
from each other,

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.260
so that you can wage
suppress the people you

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.270
don't want to promote.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.404
And I feel like
women in technology

00:23:06.404 --> 00:23:07.820
should be standing
up to companies

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.070
and saying that that's not
an acceptable practice, not

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.010
just for women, but for any
diverse group of people,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.580
because I don't
understand any benefit,

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.190
other than to
discriminate, that there

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.520
is in hiding people's
accomplishments

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.320
from each other.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.200
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Yeah.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.820
I agree.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.030
The research definitely
needs to be done.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.400
Even if you're taking
everyone's name out of it,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.220
and analyzing it based on,
hey, similar job titles, this

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.050
is what's making.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.730
Do we have a problem?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.270
Hopefully, there are some
companies out there like,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.740
no, we have no problems at all.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.970
That's my goal.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.210
But if there is, it goes
back to what I said earlier.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.100
You're asking someone
to increase wages,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.090
but that's actually a
long-term investment.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.935
And so if companies
can be thinking,

00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:55.740
hey, we're going
to keep this person

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.970
in the industry for
another 20 years,

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.670
they might stay at this
company for 10 of those years,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:06.260
then it's actually fiscally
responsible for leadership

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.260
to make those decisions.

00:24:12.467 --> 00:24:13.050
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.670
I'm a software engineer.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.600
I work at Adobe, great company,
but the upper management

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.870
tends to be shy men
who in a social setting

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.140
don't even make eye
contact with me.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.690
And I feel that affects me.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.280
And when it comes,
like you said,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.760
oh, these two people are
great, who do we promote,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.420
well, my [INAUDIBLE] level
manager doesn't know me,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.040
so the other person
gets promoted.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.080
I have asked a few people
here how they deal with this,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.220
but I don't know about chili
cook-offs, and barbecues,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.940
and Teslas, so I don't
know how to start

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:56.660
a conversation with these
heavyweights who are male,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.400
but they're shy,
or whatever it is.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.130
So I'm looking for some
guidance on what are good ways

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.880
to start a conversation with
such people who actually

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.124
have a say in my promotion?

00:25:12.124 --> 00:25:13.040
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Yeah.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.670
So I'd think generally
finding some small ask,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.030
because they're shy.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.060
They're very busy
probably as well.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.700
And then breaking the ice,
because they're probably acting

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.410
that way because they're shy.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:35.410
So finding something that
they can do in 5 or 10 minutes

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.030
to get that ball rolling.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.260
And then once the relationship
slowly starts to develop,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.000
you can ask for something
that maybe will take slightly

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.230
more time the next time.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.190
But really making it as
easy as possible for them,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.280
and making it something
that they can execute on

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.780
very quickly, because they
probably want to be involved,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.860
and they want to help you, but
they haven't figured out how.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.520
And as you said, they're
probably very shy.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.990
So I'm a user
experience designer.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.000
And the company
that I work for is--

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.840
so all the people at the top
are men, like most of the time.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.260
The biggest thing for me
has been that I recently

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.840
had a child, and
I wanted to make

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.540
some sort of minor adjustment
to my working situation.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.850
I wanted four days a
week instead of five.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.940
There's tons of data that says
that people that work minorly

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.480
reduced hours are actually
just as productive, if not more

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.030
productive, because
you have good reasons

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.912
to get your stuff
done even better,

00:26:38.912 --> 00:26:41.120
so that you can have that
extra time with, let's say,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.350
your child, or for whatever
reason you want reduced hours.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.200
The tech companies are
super against that.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.680
And I am fighting a
terrible uphill battle

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.020
that I may, in a
few months, decide

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.220
to just quit, because
they're really against it.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.730
And I don't understand,
from my point of view,

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.220
why they wouldn't even
consider trying it.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:03.950
They're just dead
set against it.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.970
They don't even want to
try it, when wouldn't it

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.710
be in their best
interest to have

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.774
me be happy for a few years
where my child is young,

00:27:11.774 --> 00:27:14.440
and then I will continue to stay
with them, because why wouldn't

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.500
I be 10 times more loyal to
a company that is actually

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.910
working with me, and
what I feel I need

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.460
for my schedule and my sanity,
and my child to grow up

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.710
to see me a little bit more?

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.940
But it's a terrible
uphill battle

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.510
that I have absolutely no
idea how to proceed on.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.540
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Yeah.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.030
I mean, this is the kind of
thing that goes back to the,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.070
hey, it is fiscally responsible.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.680
It will keep you in your career.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.350
It's a small thing,
and it's something

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.740
that we are asking
companies to do.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.660
And it goes back to
what I said earlier.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.620
Hey, we're realizing that
our power is actually

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.280
going to be in influencing
the companies that support us.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:59.170
And the companies want
to know what to do.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:09.980
And so creating a list,
or a story of the things

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.750
that need to be
done, companies are

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.850
going to do at least the
easy things, and some

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.980
of the hard things.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.800
I think that this is
devastating to hear.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.430
The wonderful thing about
software engineering

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.120
is, actually, it's
incredibly flexible,

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.350
or at least it has the potential
to be incredibly flexible.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.840
And so when I hear numbers that
women are leaving at a higher

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.554
rate than they are
other industries,

00:28:35.554 --> 00:28:36.720
that should be flip-flopped.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.760
We should see that women are
staying in tech, in engineering

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.290
positions at a higher rate
than all other industries,

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.370
because you can't be a
pharmacist and work from home.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:29:01.660
Or you can't be a teacher
and come in at 9 o'clock

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.240
and leave at 3:00, and then
work a few hours in the evening.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.526
But you can do that with tech.

00:29:07.526 --> 00:29:09.400
JULIE PEARL: So we'll
take one more question,

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.670
and then we're going
to be out of time.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:13.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.620
My name's [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.760
I'm from Netflix.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.310
And this whole
10-year dropout, we've

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.210
focused a lot about keeping
people in the companies.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.120
But what about those, like
myself, who actually left?

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.850
And I stayed at home for three
years to look after my kids.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.490
Then when I came back in, it's
this really daunting prospect.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.810
It's like everything's
moved on without you.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:35.177
I have no idea where to go.

00:29:35.177 --> 00:29:37.260
So one of the things which
I'm trying to look into

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.740
is setting up, things
for women like me,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.730
such as an access portal
for all the internships

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.200
that are out there, for all
the open source that they

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.360
can get into.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.850
But what else can we be
doing, both as a company

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.420
and individually?

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.795
ALAINA PERCIVAL:
Well, certainly,

00:29:51.795 --> 00:29:53.380
coming to Women Who Code.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.200
Actually, it's a
great opportunity

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.980
for women who have
technical backgrounds.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.120
The nice thing about
software engineering

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.550
is, hey, what you've
known in the past is still

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.310
going to build on
what you need to know.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.020
And had you stayed
in the industry,

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.310
you probably would have
learned three new things

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.040
in between the time
that you left and now.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.370
And I mean, there's always
new languages coming out,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:29.600
always new technologies-- web,
now mobile, and Swift, and Go.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.440
And so you're always
learning something new.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:38.210
And so you're in a great
position to reenter the market.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:44.350
And you just have to get back
into a programming language

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.030
that interests you.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.490
And it's completely possible.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.610
There's tremendous
number of resources,

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.610
like Women Who Code, that
are going to help you

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:54.800
do that process.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.710
And then again-- shameless
plug-- Woman Who Code,

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.320
we have over five
free events for women

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.460
here in the Bay Area
every single week.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.540
And they're always at
different tech companies.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.160
And they're always hiring.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.540
And so you at least get
exposure into seeing

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.330
what the startup
cultures are like, what

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.080
the job opportunities are.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.040
Last year, we were at
a Woman Who Code event.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.700
And there was a director
of engineering there.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.730
And a week and a half later,
he was like, oh, Alaina, I'm

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.250
hiring Rebecca.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.310
And she'd essentially
had her first interview

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.040
by just chatting
with him, asking

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.630
about their technical
stack, asking

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.490
a couple of smart questions.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.890
And within a week and a
half, that hiring decision

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.130
had already been made.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.120
And so, I mean, we're incredibly
lucky here in the Bay Area

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.860
to have so many resources,
and so many tech companies.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.687
So I mean, it's completely
possible for you to do.

00:31:53.687 --> 00:31:54.520
We welcome you back.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.900
We're really excited that
you're interested to come back.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.489
AUDIENCE: So I've actually come
back for a year and a half.

00:32:00.489 --> 00:32:01.280
I was really lucky.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.238
But that was the thing.

00:32:02.238 --> 00:32:04.910
I felt that I was lucky
to have this scenario.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.565
And I've chatted
to other women that

00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:09.670
have been struggling
really hard, both mentally,

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.020
because it's such
a daunting task,

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.679
and knowing where to start.

00:32:14.679 --> 00:32:15.470
Who do you talk to?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.807
Where's that first step to take?

00:32:17.807 --> 00:32:19.640
And so Women Who Code
is fantastic for that.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.604
And I do applaud you.

00:32:20.604 --> 00:32:21.520
I'm part of it myself.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.120
And it's a fantastic resource,
which I did use to come back.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.502
So, thank you very
much for that.

00:32:26.502 --> 00:32:28.922
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.440
JULIE PEARL: I
want to thank you.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.070
ALAINA PERCIVAL: Thank you.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.380
JULIE PEARL: Spending your time.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.650
This was really fantastic.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.850
ALAINA PERCIVAL: It's been
such an honor to be here today.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.060
It's great to see so many
amazing technical women

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.880
in a room, so many
smart women in the room.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.092
So thank you very much.

00:32:43.092 --> 00:32:44.050
JULIE PEARL: Thank you.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:44.950
Thanks.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.207
[APPLAUSE]
