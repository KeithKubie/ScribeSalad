00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.670
Hello and welcome to the second part of our software engineering course. In the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.030
previous mini-course, we discussed some basic principles

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.430
behind software engineering. We provided an overview of

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.790
several software process models and we introduced

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.530
some important tools that can help developers

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.363
increase their productivity. In this mini-course, we

00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:25.740
will focus on requirement and prototyping. More precisely,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.840
we will discuss in depth requirements

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.400
engineering activities. We will also discuss

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.950
techniques to perform a system analysis

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.720
and design in an object-oriented fashion. So,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.250
let's start the first lesson of this mini-course, which is about the use

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.230
of engineering techniques to understand and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.450
specify the purpose of a software system.
