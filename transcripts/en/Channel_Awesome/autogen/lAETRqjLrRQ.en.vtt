a certain way and his daughter thinks
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.110
a certain way and his daughter thinks
it's a ghost that's interesting cuz I

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
it's a ghost that's interesting cuz I
 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.610
it's a ghost that's interesting cuz I
really didn't think we're gonna do this

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620
really didn't think we're gonna do this
 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.670
really didn't think we're gonna do this
angle okay and I kinda was not gonna be

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680
angle okay and I kinda was not gonna be
 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.589
angle okay and I kinda was not gonna be
a ghost but whatever the the dust is

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599
a ghost but whatever the the dust is
 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.059
a ghost but whatever the the dust is
falling in a certain way and she thinks

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069
falling in a certain way and she thinks
 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.080
falling in a certain way and she thinks
it's Morse code

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090
it's Morse code
 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.770

goes and then Sully like I think you're

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759
goes and then Sully like I think you're
 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.820
goes and then Sully like I think you're
right and like he is coordinates let's

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830
right and like he is coordinates let's
 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.140
right and like he is coordinates let's
follow these coordinates like just

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150
follow these coordinates like just
 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.390
follow these coordinates like just
really kind of out of the blue does it

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400
really kind of out of the blue does it
 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.439
really kind of out of the blue does it
but again out its Nolan ok whatever so

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449
but again out its Nolan ok whatever so
 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.390
but again out its Nolan ok whatever so
so if Ali's coordinates finds and as a

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400
so if Ali's coordinates finds and as a
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.330
so if Ali's coordinates finds and as a
secret location um and pretty much goes

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340
secret location um and pretty much goes
 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.209
secret location um and pretty much goes
there and finds that they're creating a

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219
there and finds that they're creating a
 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.279

worlds like three different planets and
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.579
worlds like three different planets and
they want to repopulate that okay Plan B

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589
they want to repopulate that okay Plan B

they want to repopulate that okay Plan B
if I'm right cuz by count there's so

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710
if I'm right cuz by count there's so
 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.110
if I'm right cuz by count there's so
much science mumbo-jumbo it's hard to

follow I think they like either have

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029
follow I think they like either have
 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.740

embryos or something frozen uh that's
 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.499
embryos or something frozen uh that's
gonna like repopulate mankind so I don't

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509
gonna like repopulate mankind so I don't
 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.570
gonna like repopulate mankind so I don't
know it's let the people under die start

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580
know it's let the people under die start
 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.360
know it's let the people under die start
anew I don't know if they're just gonna

I'm sure was explained you know just

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789
I'm sure was explained you know just

probably a dumb thing for me but you

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569
probably a dumb thing for me but you
 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.360
probably a dumb thing for me but you
know it's either let everybody die or

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
know it's either let everybody die or
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.409
