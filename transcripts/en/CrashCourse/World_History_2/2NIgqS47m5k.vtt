00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.120
and today we're going to respond to your many requests and talk about a controversial subject: War.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.160
So here at Crash Course we're really not that into the history of war,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.860
partly because we feel it's been discussed well elsewhere

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.340
and partly because we haven't really figured out a way to tackle it.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.180
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! Nonononono, that's all history is:

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.480
It's a series of wars.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.360
Well, me-from-the-past, I can certainly see why you would think that,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.580
because that's how many history classes are organized.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.140
But, in fact, I don't think that history is primarily about war.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.480
But, I mean, humans find all kinds of ways to die,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.340
like, you could teach a whole Crash Course World History on smallpox.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.880
In fact, we kind of did that last week.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
Ultimately, I find cooperation and trade more interesting

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.720
than the violent and destructive aspects of world history

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.380
because I think they probably, ultimately, matter more.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.980
But I do have to admit that war is a pretty big deal in world history.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.660
So we better spend some time talking about it, at least in the abstract.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.640
[Intro]

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.440
So today we're gonna focus on the question of why people fight.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
And, more specifically, why human beings go to war.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.060
Like, to put it in another way, we're going to look at

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.500
whether making war is part of "human nature".

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.820
This gets into some nit-picky "How many angels can you fit on the head of a pin?" questions about nature,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.500
but we're just gonna put those aside for now.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.780
So are human being hard-wired to fight and kill each other?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.300
Well that's a question that philosophers have been asking for a long time.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.240
Like, Nietzsche summed it up this way:

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.780
"I am by nature war-like. To attack is among my instincts."

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.560
But he was Nietzsche.  He had a number of instincts that I'm pretty sure were not universal.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.680
Anyway, that attitude might explain why Nietzsche is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.380
so popular among the group most likely to go to war: Young men.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.640
Now among slightly less scary philosophers,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.720
the question of humans' war-like nature is often described as

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.620
a debate between Hobbes, who saw humans as war-like and violent,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.400
and Rousseau, who thought that humanity was naturally peaceful until civilization came along.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.920
And we've heard echoes of this debate throughout our study of world history.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.920
Like, were we better off as foragers, when we had way more time for scoodlypooping?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.420
Stupid civilization, always ruining everything. Let's go to the thought bubble.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.640
So was Hobbes right that life in the so-called "state of nature" was nasty, brutish and short,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.240
or was Rousseau right that it was amazing?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.520
Well, without a time machine which would settle a lot of vexing historical questions

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.700
and would also allow me to go back and fix my terrible, terrible mistakes at the eighth grade cotillion,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.040
our best guide to what people were like in the "state of nature" comes from anthropology.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.860
Making guesses about the very distant past based on observations of modern hunter-gatherers

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.080
is extremely problematic, but it's the best we have to go on.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440
Well, that and archaeology.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.780
So, what do anthropologists tell us?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780
Well, it doesn't look so good for Rousseau.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.140
Many anthropologists suggest that in pre-civilization social orders, things were pretty violent.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.540
In Australia, for example, killing and fighting was among the main causes of mortality,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.160
and archaeology has revealed evidence of warfare going back thousands of years.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.620
Now, some of these anthropological conclusions are controversial,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.520
but when combined with cave paintings and fossils of humans

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.060
who pretty obviously were killed by other humans,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.380
it seems clear that we've been killing each other for what historians like to call "a long-ass-time".

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.620
So Hobbes seems to be right that life in the "state of nature" was probably violent and brief.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.040
But was it war?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.620
Again, anthropologists can give us some guidance here.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.920
Some studies have reported relatively large-scale group confrontations similar to battles,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.960
but these tend to be largely symbolic, and they often don't result in much killing.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.060
Most of the actual violence that hunter-gatherers commit against each other takes place during raids,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.960
in which one group sneaks up upon another and attacks.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.860
So in the end there may be like a very violent middle path

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.080
between the individual killings and like, Cain v. Abel,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.080
and the modern wars that we see today.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520
But why are we seemingly so hard-wired toward violence?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.180
Well, it might be evolution.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.820
Thanks, thought bubble.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.960
So, I wanna be really clear about something.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.620
We may have aggression "in our genes", but you can't kill people!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.620
And also, you don't have to.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.020
Many of us - most of us, in fact - make it all the way through life without killing a single person.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.080
So I think it's going too far to say that our genes have, like, made us into stone-cold killers,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.180
but it is possible that aggression is an innate trait in humans.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.460
And under the right conditions, maybe it finds its expression in violence and war.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.720
Now, we should all be very skeptical about

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.340
applying evolutionary biology to cultural characteristics like warlike behavior,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.940
because Darwin's ideas have been misused to explain all sorts of unpleasant things.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.960
Especially in nineteenth-century concepts about race.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.320
You know, if you're in a structurally privileged position in the social order, it's easy enough to be like,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.180
"Huh, I wonder how I got here.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.640
Probably natural selection."

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.020
When in fact, you know, slavery was not a function of biology;

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.540
it was a function of oppression.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.800
And another reason we should be aware

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.280
is that we often refer to cultures "evolving" very quickly

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.100
like often in a generation,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.260
but biological evolution takes a lot longer.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.500
That said, there are a few ways that evolutionary imperatives could contribute to a warlike human nature.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.100
We'll start with the idea that it is a biological imperative to pass on genetic traits to successive generations.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.400
Because our close relatives and kin contain the most genetic material in common,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.920
we naturally want to protect them and ensure the continued survival of our genes.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.340
So we might be expected to fight in order to protect members of our kin group.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.820
But then again, trying to protect your family from harm is somewhat different from killing other people's families.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.940
Well, here's where it's helpful to remember that for the vast majority of human history,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.940
war consisted of raiding.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.320
It was about taking stuff from other people's kin group so that your kin group could have that stuff.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.140
For 99% of human history, that's how we fought.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.920
Not as organized states warring with each other.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.780
So let's stop even thinking about, like, groups of humans or even individual humans

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.940
and think for a second about genes.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.320
Insofar as genes want anything, they want to go on.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.040
Life wishes to continue.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.180
And for those human genes to go on, they needed humans to go on,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.540
and for that, we need two resources:

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.980
Food and sex.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.800
Both of which could be quite scarce

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.540
in the many millennia before we settled down into agricultural-based societies.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.900
It occurs to me they are also quite scarce in most American high schools

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.640
unless you consider cheetos food.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.800
So you can easily see how the competition for these two resources could become violent.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.220
It might provide an evolutionary explanation for war.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.580
Like, skill in fighting meant more access to food in the form of better hunting grounds.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.360
It also meant more food, because you were better at fighting the food, too.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.780
And there's a more horrifying aspect to this as well,

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.360
which is that in many of these raids, women were the principal goal.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.180
They were to be acquired.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.940
Also, as we know from the Odyssey, fighting has a tendency to breed more fighting.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.160
Like, you kill my friend, it makes it more likely that I'm going to kill you.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.380
I'm not going to kill you, but seriously, don't kill any of my friends.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.300
We see a bit of this phenomenon in a description of

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.220
intertribal warfare among North American Plains Indians.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.000
"In an atmosphere charged with intertribal distrust,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.640
even an imaged slight by an outsider could lead to retaliation against other members of his tribe...

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.140
It was much easier to start a war than to end one."

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.600
And as you may have noticed, that's still true today.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.280
But okay, if war was a response to scarce resources, why do we have wars now?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.760
Resources are relatively easy to acquire.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.160
Well, that's a complicated question,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.320
and we're going to talk next week about how war may actually have contributed to civilization

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.160
and proven socially useful by helping us create kingdoms and states.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.280
But another way to examine the question of why we fight

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.400
is to examine what soldiers have said about why they fight.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.180
So here's one such voice, although I wanna be clear that there are millions of them.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.160
Karl Marlantes was a Marine lieutenant in Vietnam who wrote about his experience

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.620
in the novel "Matterhorn" and a memoir called "What It Is Like to Go to War".

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.120
That book includes a number of uncomfortable revelations

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.860
about the way soldiers often think and feel about war.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.420
For one thing, Marlantes tells us that soldiers achieve a sense of transcendence through fighting,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.860
by becoming part of something bigger than themselves.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.080
Also, he says:

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.020
"There is a deep savage joy in destruction,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.040
a joy that goes beyond ego enhancement."

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.540
Now, today's soldiers rarely fight for food or mates, but they do fight for each other.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.220
And not wanting to let your comrades down, feeling loyal to the group,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.640
those are powerful motivators.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.540
More viscerally, fighting is exciting to humans.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.900
It gets the adrenaline pumping.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.500
According to Marlantes, "Combat is the crack cocaine of all excitement highs."

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.660
Neither of those things sound at all fun to me, but I guess we're all wired differently.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.060
So what do we do with the fact that for many of us, there is joy and power in killing?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.480
How do we respond when a former pilot tells us, as he whispered to Marlantes,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.620
that he enjoyed napalming the enemy, saying: "I loved it. I lit up the entire valley."

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.320
How do we respond to Marlantes's revelation that during Vietnam, he

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.380
"ran toward the fighting with the same excitement, trembling and thrill as a lover rushing to the beloved"?

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.660
Well, I think Marlantes reminds us that despite our biology,

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.880
soldiers, just like the rest of us, have free will.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.300
They make choices.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:50.400
Marlantes also notes: "Choosing sides is the fundamental first choice that a warrior makes...

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.420
The second fundamental choice of the warrior is to be willing to use violence to protect someone

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.600
against intended or implied violence."

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.220
Now, for many humans over millennia, that choice hasn't been much of a choice.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.660
You fight for your kin group.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.540
But in at least many parts of the world today, that choice is a choice.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.760
Now, it may be that these uncomfortable revelations help to explain

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.700
why we might want to search for a biological or evolutionary explanation for why humans go to war.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.100
Maybe that's preferable to the idea that humans just take pleasure in the activity of fighting

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.260
and pursue it merely for its own sake.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.220
But just as there's a danger in celebrating warfare and its transcendence,

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.940
we need to be careful of explaining war merely as an outgrowth of evolutionary necessities

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.600
because such explanations can lead to a fatalistic conclusion that war is inevitable.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.020
But it's not. The cycle of violence that you see in the Odyssey

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.480
gets broken all the time in human history.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.760
And yes, it is much harder to end a war than it is to start one,

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.520
but it is not impossible.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.880
When we get carried away by biological explanations,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.120
we forget that while humans may not have evolved all that much in the past one thousand years,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.600
our institutions have.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.080
And that's happened because of human choices

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.580
that go far beyond the desire for food or the need to reproduce.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.660
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.580
Crash Course is produced here in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.560
and is made possible with the help of all of these nice people,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.000
and with your help through Subbable.com

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.720
Subbable is a voluntary subscription service that allows you to support Crash Course directly,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.240
so we can keep making these educational videos free, for everyone, forever.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.940
Thanks to all of our Subbable subscribers, thanks to you for watching,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.880
and as we say in my hometown: Don't forget to be awesome.
