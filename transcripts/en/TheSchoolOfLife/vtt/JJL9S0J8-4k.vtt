00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.050
most of the time

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
successful modern life involves lots of
technology, constantly being connected

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
with other people, working very hard for as much money as possible and doing what we're told.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.010
So it may come as a surprise that some of the best advice about modern life

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
comes from an unemployed writer who lived alone in the woods and refused to pay his taxes.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
Henry David Thoreau reminds us about the importance of simplicity, authenticity

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.680
and downright disobedience.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.360
He was born in 1817 in concord, an
unassuming town west of Boston.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.719
His father was a pencil maker and his
mother took in boarders.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.760
He attended Harvard College in 1833, yet he rejected the ordinary career parts

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
like law or medicine or the church. Then Thoreau struck up a remarkable friendship

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.780
with the American transcendentalist
philosopher

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.000
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Transcendentalism is a philosophy that emphasizes the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.699
importance of the spiritual over the
material when it comes to leading a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.960
fulfilling life.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.229
Emerson and his transcendentalism had a huge influence on Thoreau.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
Moreover, Emerson help Thoreau find a place where he could focus on his writing.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.600
The older man owned a plot of land in the woods surrounding the nearby Walden Pond.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.000
And in 1845 he allowed Thoreau to build a small cabin there, three by four and a half meters.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
In his two years in the cabin

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.640
Thoreau penned the first draft of his most notable work: "Walden or life in the woods"

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.000
which was eventually published in 1854.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.600
It would become an inspirational text about self-discovery.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.180
Thoreau argued that his escape to Walden Pond was not simply

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.500
a relaxing retreat to the forest. He
settled there to live deep and suck out

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.400
the marrow of life as he put it.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.700
"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately...

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.400
...to front only the essential
facts of life...

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.600
...and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,...

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600
... discover that I had not lived.".

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.119
After some time in the cabin,

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.659
Thoreau discovered a different more
conscious lifestyle. To begin with, he

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.579
concluded that we actually need

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.910
very few things. He suggested that we
think about our belongings

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.080
in terms of how little we can get by
with, rather than how much we can get.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.069
He managed to sustain himself on only one day of work a week,

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.519
he pointed out that walking the distance of a 30-mile train journey took a day,

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.870
but working to earn the money to pay for the same journey will take more than a day.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
Like his friend Emerson, Thoreau
deeply valued what he called:

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.510
SELF-RELIANCE

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.000
He distrusted society and a progress it
claimed to have made.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800
"The civilized man, has built a coach..." he said,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.500
"...but has lost
the use of his feet.".

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.400
He felt that economic independence from other people

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.290
and from the government was crucial

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.220
and while he understood that we need
companionship from time to time, he felt

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.090
that too often we use others company to 
fill gaps in our inner life that we're

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.500
afraid to confront.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.300
The task of learning
to live alone was for Thoreau

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.489
not so much about carrying out daily
chores as it was about becoming a good

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.769
companion for oneself. Relying first and
foremost on oneself friendship, intimacy

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.900
and moral guidance.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.269
"INSIST ON YOURSELF...

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.209
...NEVER IMITATE!", he wrote. Most of all
one should change one's self before seeking to

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.980
change the world.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.120
Thoreau also viewed technology as an
often unnecessary distraction.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.379
He saw the practical benefits of new
inventions, but he also warned that these

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.549
innovations couldn't address the real
challenges of personal happiness.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.900
"Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys...

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.040
...which distract our attention
from serious things. We are...

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.419
...in great haste to construct a magnetic
telegraph from Maine to Texas, but Maine

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.900
and Texas it may be, have nothing
important to communicate.".

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.800
Thoreau believed we should instead look to
nature which is full of spiritual significance.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.470
He thought of animals, forest and
waterfalls as inherently valuable but

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.000
for their beauty and their role in the
ecosystem.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We can best understand ourselves

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.900
as a part of nature, we should
see ourselves as nature looking into

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
nature, rather than an external force 
or the master of nature.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.819
Most of all nature provides the meaning
that money and technology and other

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.800
people's opinions cannot, by teaching us
to be humble and more aware

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.100
by fostering introspection and self-discovery.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.650
This mental state and not money or 
technology provides real progress.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.750
Thoreau optimistically declared:

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.310
"Only that day dawns to which we are
awake. There is more day to dawn

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.600
the Sun is but a morning star.".

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.600
Perhaps the best testament of the value
of Thoreau's,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.490
individual contemplation and
personal authenticity, is that his ideas

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.500
lead him to powerful political
conclusions.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.450
Thoreau argued that people

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.350
are morally obliged to challenge a
government that uphold hypocritical or

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.360
flagrantly unfair laws.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.800
So Thoreau turned to what he called:
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.000
Peacefully resisting immoral laws in protest.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.600
In July 1846, he withheld payment of his poll tax duty

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.800
to avoid paying for the mexican-american war and slavery.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
"I ask for, not at once no government,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.630
...but at once a better government.",

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.500
he wrote after spending the night in
jail.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.290
It was not until he was picked up

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.520
by subsequent reformers that his essay
"Civil disobedience" became one of the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.880
most influential pieces of American
political philosophy in history,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.390
influencing Gandhi, Martin Luther King
and the anti-nazi resistance.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.340
Despite his time as a hermit, Thoreau
teaches us how to approach a frighteningly

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.720
vast, highly interconnected and
morally troubling modern society.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.470
He challenges us to be authentic, not
just by avoiding material life and its distractions,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.430
but by engaging with the world and
withdrawing our support for the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.100
government when we believe is acting unjustly.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.470
His works endure and remind us of just how

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.370
important it is to remove the
distractions of money, technology and

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.600
other people's views, in order to live
according to our best and truest nature.
