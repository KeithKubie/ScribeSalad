00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.740
Critic: I told you we just reviewed a fantastic four movie, I'm not doing another one!

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.220
Tamara: But it was SO bad!

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.720
Critic: I DON'T CARE!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.920
Malcolm: They Couldn't even spell it right, 'fant4stick'.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.640
Critic: I DON'T CARE!

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.440
Tamara: It got a half percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.800
Critic: How the hell do you do that?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Malcom: It found a way.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.420
Critic: *SIGH*

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.880
Black Nerd: COWABUNGA!

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.380
Critic: AH!

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.440
Tamara: Black Nerd?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.160
Malcom: Yes?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.940
Tamara: No, that one.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.440
Malcom: Oh.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.000
Critic: What're you doing in the storage closet?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.980
Black Nerd: I'm here to do the ninja turtle movie review with you and angry video game nerd, remember?

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.640
*FLASHBACK*

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.180
Critic: I don't care if the nerd is a bigger star, my face should be bigger than his on the title card!

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.000
*Ding dong*

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600
Critic: Come on, who's a bigger ninja turtles fan than me?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.380
Black Nerd: Hey Critic, heard you're Gonna do a ninja turtles crossover with the nerd?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.820
Critic: Yea, sure come on in.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.800
Critic: I don't care if i don't know anything about that one show.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.960
Critic: Or that one.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.100
Critic: Or That one.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.320
Critic: Really?, they made another one?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.120
Critic: I totally didn't know that.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.240
Critic: But nevertheless, I'm the biggest fan and i deserve to be bigger on the title card!

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.800
Critic: Everything about me is bigger than him!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.420
Critic: Including that!

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.740
Critic: DON'T ASK HOW I KNOW THAT!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.020
*Flashforward

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.760
Tamara: Wait, you've been in the storage closet that entire time?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.940
Black Nerd: Mmmmehh, it's not so bad.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.360
Black Nerd: I still made videos.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.300
Black Nerd: Hi I'm Andre and I'm a Black Nerd.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.420
Black Nerd: Today i'm gonna be reviewing boxes again.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.220
Black Nerd: YAY! BOXES!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.420
Black Nerd: Which do you think is better?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.820
Black Nerd: Cardboard or plastic?

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.560
Black Nerd: They both keep you alive if you ever need to eat them.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.140
Black Nerd: Like i do.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.820
*Munching sounds*

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
Black Nerd: I'm so cold.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.060
Peter: Ya think that's bad? how about the time when-

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.640
Critic: Ok Enough with the cutaways.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.800
Black Nerd: Soo, are you finally ready to do the review?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.320
Malcom: Ummmm, we reviewed that a few months ago, didn't we?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.240
Critic: Mmmm yeees, but seeing how i could be facing some serious criminal charges for this let's go ahead and do the crossover anyway!

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.560
Critic: It could be any movie you want!

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.440
Black Nerd: SMURFS!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.360
Critic: Any movie you want!

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.080
Black Nerd: SMURFS!

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.100
Critic: Any movie you want!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.040
Black Nerd: SMURFS!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.300
Critic: I'm sensing an Earth Girls Are Easy vibe from ya.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.960
Black Nerd: SMURFS!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.760
Tamara: Fantastic Four!

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.660
*Punch*

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.600
Black Nerd: SMURFS!

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.760
Critic: Troll 2 it is! a low clichÃ© but i still think we can get some good material out of it.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.480
Black Nerd: Hellooo, police, Nostalgia Critic kidnapped another black guy again.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.060
Malcolm: IT'S TRUE!

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.780
*Punch*

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.260
Critic: Let's do the f**king smurfs.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.820
Black Nerd: yaaaaay!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.360
Tamara: *Exhale*

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.520
Malcolm: ahhhh.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.680
Malcolm: Man, Urkel did not age well.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.940
Black Nerd: I heard that, Theo!

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.920
Black Nerd: The belgian comic turned into an american 80's cartoon and has finally hit the the big screen!

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.760
Critic: Well, technically the second time. Fucking liars.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.000
Critic: Like most 80's cartoons it banked more on selling merchandise rather than focusing on interesting stories.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.380
Black Nerd: You take that back!

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.220
Critic: NEVAAAAR!

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.340
Black Nerd: Police?~

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.500
Critic: It was mostly harmless.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.960
Critic: So much so, that I'm not entirely sure how you could get THAT much of movie out of it.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
Critic: At least without being super creative.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.000
Black Nerd: Well that's exactly what they did, at first.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.920
Black Nerd: Rumor has it Paramount originally owned the rights to the movie, and were looking to make it sort of a comedic epic fantasy!

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280
Black Nerd: Think Lord of The Rings meets (The) Princess Bride!

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.940
Critic: Well, that doesn't sound too ba-

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.260
Black Nerd: Until Sony got the rights to the movie, thought Alvin And The Chipmunks was a big hit,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.040
Black Nerd: And said: "HEY! we could do that, just make them blue!"

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.840
Critic: So wait, they're just ripping off that terrible chipmunks movie?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.800
Black Nerd: Nooooooooooo!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.060
Critic: Oh,thank god.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.260
Black Nerd: They're ripping off 'The Chipmunks Movie',

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.620
Black Nerd: But they're also ripping off Enchaaaaaanted,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.960
Black Nerd: And Fat Albert!

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.300
Black Nerd: And [In a British accent] Masters of The Universe.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.680
Black Nerd: All that's messing is the crowning turd!

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.440
Critic: *gasps* No Black Nerd! Not Raja Gosnell!

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.680
Critic: He's the cinematic equivalent of child syphilis!

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.040
*Critic screams*

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.740
*Explosion SFX*

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.640
Black Nerd: *Evil laughter*

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.520
Critic: You fool! what have you done?!

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.040
Black Nerd: YES!, my satanic fellow! Let the world see you for the abomination that you are!

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.340
*Exhaling fire SFX*

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.880
Dragon: Would you like to buy some Smurf merchandise?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.480
Critic: Evil takes many forms.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.920
Black Nerd:This is the Smurfs movie.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.920
Black Nerd: (whispering) I'll take two.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.680
Critic: It opens with
Narrator Smurf.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.340
Critic: No, really there's a Smurf called Narrator Smurf

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.180
Black Nerd: At least they're not hiding their laziness.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.420
Critic: As he talks about a place that knows no sadness.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.180
Critic: Well, clearly it can't be in this movie.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.110
Narrator Smurf: A place inhabited by little blue beings...

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.500
Critic: Oh, so it IS an animated movie!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.220
Black Nerd: No, that CG is supposed to look as convincing as
the human characters

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.840
NC: Really? they look like Rocky's coach if
he had Methemoglobinemia

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.620
Critc: It's a thing, read a book!

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.780
Black Nerd: At first, everything seems to be par for the course

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.100
The smurfs you recognize are all there,
they all have names that match their one

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.599
personality trait, and even the evil
Gargamel played by Hank Azaria plots to

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.470
catch them.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.490
Critic: Ah, that evil entity who wants to destroy
the smurf's essence in order to become

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.940
disgustingly rich.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.180
Black Nerd: Heey, I was talking about Gargamel, not SONY

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.180
(Crowd Oohing)

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.440
Black Nerd: Actually, in this

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.460
version he wants to Smurf's essence to
increase his magic, not to make gold or

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.970
eat them. And as you can see, he's not
very good at it as he spends most of his

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.599
time playing with puppets rather than
getting any real work done. Critic: Hey! At least they look

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.020
more real than the actual Smurfs! (shots fired) a lock ka boom! (??)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.700
Oh god, Azrael. You're a boy?!

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.310
Critic: Well, any kids film opens with cat balls on a beloved characters head is

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.319
certainly setting the bar pretty high!

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.979
Black Nerd: Papa Smurf, voiced by Jonathan Winters, has a vision of all the smurfs being

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.940
destroyed because of a mistake Clumsy
made, never realizing that maybe he made

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.370
that mistake because you named him
Clumsy!

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.300
Papa Smurf: Clumsy!? Critic: Yeah it's like naming your daughter
"Prostitute" are you really encouraging

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.990
any great things labeling them that?
Black Nerd: Actually one of the stranger things is the

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.000
people they got to play most of the
Smurfs.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.669
Critic: Oh come on, celebrity voices are
everywhere are you really surprised that

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.419
people like Katy Perry and George Lopez
are in this? Black Nerd: For the main characters, no.

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.110
But what if I told you that Pee Wee
Herman himself Paul Reubens was in this!

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.440
Critic: What where? Black Nerd: Right there. Pee Wee Herman on Blue meth: Heh Hee Heh! Black Nerd: And now he's gone!

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.190
Critic: W-What they called him in for just two
lines? Black Nerd: (giggles) He got the deluxe treatment

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.120
half of these celebrities barely even got a
word! That was Kenan Thompson! Critic: What?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.080
Black Nerd: There went BJ Novak

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.900
Critic: Huh!? Black Nerd: Ooh! there's Jeff Foxworthy!
Critic: I didnt Even... Black nerd: Theres Wolfgang Puck! Critic: Why!

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.660
Black nerd: Dont miss Joan Rivers! Critic: They flew her in for this--!? Black nerd: And of
course John Oliver's one incredible line

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.740
John Oliver, also on blue meth: Oh marvelous! Critic: Please tell me he's there to do a report on how this movie is ruining America..

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.110
Black nerd: I think it speaks for itself
 NC (im getting tired of spelling the names):You're right...

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.590
NC: So Gargamel finally figures out that the Smurfs have been kept hidden because of an invisible

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.560
force field. BN: As we've gone from
children's fantasy to Star Trek

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.440
technology. NC: But some of them stumble
across a magic portal....

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.560
Don't act like you haven`t! where Gargamel
has them trapped. Gargamel: Looks like you got the short end of the stick!

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.320
Eyy Papa!?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760
Papa Smurf: Not this time Gargamel!

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.120
NC Doing an impression of Papa smurf: I`d much rather sacrifice my
life then listen to your heinous performance!

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.460
Gargamel: Must... Have.... Smurfs!!!!!

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.000
BN: Because it makes much more sense to chase 6 Smurfs as opposed to 94!

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Katy Perry taking the same drug as everyone who worked on the movie: I dont think We`re in Smurf Village anymore--!

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.090
NC: This leads them to wear every fucking
portal and family films leads to!

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.380
Both: New York City!

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.160
NC: Preferably the very pretty and/or
intimidating part.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.610
Patrick Winslow: Oh, hey, can we get a photographer over there? There's an arrival happening. Thanks. Welcome.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.970
NC: Uhhh.... why are we suddenly in an episode of How
I Met Your Mother?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.750
BN: Oh don't you know? this is Neil Patrick
Harris` movie now! NC: What? I thought this

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.770
was about Smurfs!

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.340
BN: Well, Critic, like most sellout
adaptations the title character really

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.040
has anything to do with the title itself.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.390
NC: So.. instead of being about little blue
people... BN: It's about an advertising VP

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.880
coming to grips with becoming a father!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.990
NC: So... we're in a romantic comedy that just
happens to have Smurfs

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.030
BN: Yep..  NC:..That's like having a holocaust film
that's only decided it needs Fraggles

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.400
BN: That comes out next week. (Whispers) I hear Oscar buzz!

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.760
Papa Smurf: Until we rescue Clumsy and
get back home,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.840
I need you all to stay close. NC: I know I
should be making fun of the product

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.410
placement but honestly, i'm just thinking
how much better this movie would be if

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.660
Blue Man Group played the smurfs BN: But they
wouldn't talk... NC: Exactly!

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.140
BN:And just when you're wondering if watching a cat vomit
would be more fun than watching this movie,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.160
the film decides to answer for you.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.020
NC: Infinitely more fun. BN: Yes. NC: It's like the disney world of fun in this
movie.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.360
BN:(Half-Heartedly) Cat vomiiiit!

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.200
Garfamel: Tiny locks of Smurfette!...

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:33.960
Oh, sweet folecular (wtf) ambrosia! NC: Am I the only one getting a bald Moe Syzlak

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.500
from an unfunny version of The
Simpsons?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.300
BN: So the simpsons now? NC: Up high- (High five)

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.500
Gargamel: Oh, I must find a laboratory! This should do nicely!

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.660
(Gargamel and CGI abomination step out panting)

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.040
Gargamel: Somebody's been working a dark and... terrbile magic in there! (Ironically movie's reviews)

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.020
NC:... Is it even worth wasting a joke on that one?-

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.240
BN: No, move on!

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.220
BN: While he tries to figure out how to get the magic out of her hair,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.320
Neil Patrick Harris visits his
pregnant beard while the smurfs try to

00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:01.970
break in.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.960
Clumsy: Woah, ugh, ahh!

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.660
NC: And this partakes in what i'm noticing more and more in bad family

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.630
films, especially in Raja Gosnell's films-
movement pull. BN: What, your'e anti-movement?

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.940
NC: No, I'm anti lazy movement. Movement that
only exists just to hypnotize your kids

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.620
rather than engage them. Engaging
movement involves a lot of variety. Sharp

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.440
stops, varying speeds, unexpected turns,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.430
this is what makes good visual
storytelling. Here everything is at the

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.750
same speed,  the same pacing, and the same
kind of movement. There is no variation

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.510
so there's nothing interesting about it.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.890
What's more engaging, watching Mario go
one speed throughout the entire game, or

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.190
having him stop, slow down, go backwards,
stomp on things?

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.690
This safe, boring, and repetitive movement
is the same as looking at a watch waving

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.800
back and forth.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.850
They're both trying to hypnotize and
relax you so that you don't think about

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.140
what you're watching,

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.230
and that's not what a movie is supposed
to do. You're supposed to think about

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.029
it, you're supposed to be sucked in!

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:07.010
But this method is an ingenious way to
numb your brains without feeling bored

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.490
so you think it must be doing something
right when really it's just junk food

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.920
for your mind, and it's all over the
movie.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.430
BN: Oh, I don't know I don't think there's
anything wrong with a constant... source of...

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.500
movement...

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.560
BN: Hey guys! As you probably noticed-

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.640
-There's a jumpcut there!

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.040
-And there! And there! :D

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.760
-Some might say might say it's a fast-paced way...

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.660
-For me to save on memorizing lines!

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.520
-It is! :D

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.420
-Boop ba boo do dee... random thing!

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.720
-Do you know hard it is...

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.220
-To.. do..

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:31.720
-This.. in..

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.660
-One.. go?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.700
Chester: Do I! BN: Chester, is that why you do the
fast editing? Chester: Is that what that is?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.780
I thought it was just a wizard. BN: You never
question how you could do this?

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.080
Chester: When you're as high as I am, you learn not to
question things.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.779
Both: WHEEEEEEEEE!

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.769
Both: Subscribe! Subscribe! Chester: Are we a magazine? BN: No, we're just supposed to say it.

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:50.300
Chester: Oh. Both: Subscribe! Subscribe!

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.900
(NC Stares disappointingly)

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.500
BN: (Sobbing) I'm a whore...

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.780
Nostalgia Critic Will Be Right Back!

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.130
BN: The Smurfs spot talent and decide to
attack him.  NC: Honey! Help!

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.029
I think they're gonna do me in the
Smurf! Patrick: Do not be fooled by their cuteness!

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:24.010
BN: So he's told who The Smurfs are and big
surprise, he finds it all kinds of

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.459
confusing. Grace: How crazy is this? They're little blue people!

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:31.060
Patrick: So, you're sticking with your "this is
actually happening" theory?

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.540
NC: That's actually a legit question, I
always had a theory that all this

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.360
movie was just a continuation of his
drug high from Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.100
BN: No, not even a drunk person would go this
far without

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.720
SQUASHING THEM.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.440
BN: Wanna get high?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.560
NC: Yeah.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.360
Patrick: Hear that, honey?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.240
They're only staying till an actual blue
moon rises, which could happen if the

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.240
little blue Santa man makes a magic
potion which at this point seems

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.410
completely plausible.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.709
BN: I don't think that was in the script, I
think Harris was just clarifying how

00:11:59.709 --> 00:12:01.740
horribly written this movie is.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:07.420
Patrick: And you're all named after your personalities? Do you get your names when
you're born or after you exhibited

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.350
certain traits?

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.520
Smurfs: Yeah. Yup!

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.280
NC: Ohhh, I see, so Clumsy has the personality trait of being clumsy, Grouchy

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.500
has the personality trait of being
grouchy, and Smurfette has the personality trait of...

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.020
Girl.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.540
Just.. girl, as we all know all girls just have one personality trait

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.020
BN: Says so much about her. NC: Yeah.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.120
Smurfette: (Excitedly) What?! You had one outfit on and now you're
wearing something completely different! Grace: Yeah, I...

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.600
Papa Smurf: Ah, Smurfette, she probably got the other one dirty.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.320
NC: I love how they're shocked that she can
wear different clothes but not that

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.730
she's pregnant.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.260
Having only one female made from nothing,
do you think they can even comprehend

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.120
the idea of a pregnant woman?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.420
BN: Yeah, you'd think in this movie that go more into how Smurfs procreate.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.660
NC: I say wizard. BN: I say artificial Smurf-ination.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.680
Creepy Pervert: I have all the answers right here~

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.320
NC and BN: NOOOO!

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.940
CP: Your loss, there's some might fine blue balls in here!

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:06.340
I had to write on the cover cause you're not ready yet to see a Smurf get smurfed in the smurf

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.600
One of those smurfs stands for "anus"! ( Í¡Âº ÍÊ Í¡Âº)

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.579
BN: But like most of Harris' performance, he
acts like he wants to get out of every

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:15.589
scene as quickly as possible.

00:13:15.589 --> 00:13:18.680
Patrick: I had a crazy morning and haaaaii Odile: What are
you doing?

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.320
Patrick: Um nothing I'm just.. I'm excited!

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.269
NC: So tell me Patrick, is that a Smurf in your pocket or are you

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.400
just happy to see me? ( Í¡Âº ÍÊ Í¡Âº)

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.260
Patrick: I need to home my message here. Gutsy: How about grab life by the great?

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Smurf: Have a Smurfy day!

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.740
Smurfette: I kissed a Smurf and I liked it?

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.380
Both: GET IT?!

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.990
(Smurfs start chanting demonically)

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.280
Patrick: STOP! Come on, none of you find that song
just the tiniest bit annoying?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.960
Smurf: I find it annoying!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.800
(Black Nerd snickers)

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.370
NC: Did you just laugh at a Smurfs movie? BN: No. NC: Did you just laugh at a Smurfs movie?!

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.440
BN: No... NC: Just remember every time you laugh at 
a Smurfs movie, God. Kills. A kitten!

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.560
It's in the Bible!

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.160
BN: Huh, I don't know how I missed that. NC: It's
in the hardcover, reads a little different

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.720
than the softcover.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.960
BN: Gargamel uses a Smurf hair to make his magic better, catching

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.180
the eye of Harris's boss, played by Sofia
Vergara.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.460
(Gargamel gibberish for 'I need to piss')

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.080
(Gross sigh of relief)

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.540
BN: Oh my god... NC: This is really happening
people!

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.230
BN: What do we do? NC: Just look away! BN: I can't it's
too awful! NC: Just close your eyes and imagine

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.040
one of your kindergarten favorites it's not
pissing into a bucket!

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.320
NC: Is it working for you?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.180
BN: PEYO IS ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE!

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.000
NC: Me neither, there's only one alternative!

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.920
NC: It's just so much better for some reason! BN: Yeah,
me too... but I feel like we're missing

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.920
part of the movie. NC: Oh you're right, you're
right, let's rewind that and see what we missed...

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.760
(Mixed screams of pain, terror and anguish)

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.160
BN: The Smurfs end up in a toy store, where of course, all sorts of

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.060
misunderstandings take place.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:49.120
Clumsy: I'm just tired of the whole dating game,
just say who you are and be who you say...

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.420
NC: Okay, first...

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.870
that looks nothing like a smurf, second
it's not even blue, third does he really

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.750
not know it's a pillow he has to know
it's a pillow I mean is that something the

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.060
Smurfs don't know, they just don't know
what pillows are? They have to have

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.910
pillows, their hats are kinda like
pillows, I mean for the love of God, HOW IS

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.480
THIS SCENE EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE-

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.700
1998 Jennifer Lopez: Really? Who gives a sh*t?

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.140
NC: Ah, thank you 1998 Jennifer Lopez, you're
right.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.080
The more question it, the more it shows I
care.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.860
Smurfette: Ooh, creepy. I hope they weren't looking for Stargazer too...

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.440
Dresses! You mean I can have more than one kind of dress?

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:27.300
NC: Wow she seemed to get past the impaled
heads and supposedly dressed up corpses pretty fast.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.360
BN: must be that defined girl personality.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.400
NC: Gargamel tries to catch them but ends up getting tased.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:41.560
Now... that HAS to be funny, Gargamel
getting tased? Good god, how can a movie possibly screw this up-

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.600
(Gargamel spazzing out)

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.600
(STILL not funny)

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.500
BN: Like that! NC: You couldn't even make Gargamel getting TASED funny...

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.180
He sounds like Professor Fink getting jerked off!

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.480
BN: Ugh, I don't think we need that image. NC: Nah, I don't think so either.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.520
BN: Much better. NC: Oh, but I feel like we missed part of the movie-

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.420
BN: In their spare time, Smurfette reveals her troubled past

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.440
Smurfette: I was.. created by Gargamel to trap the other Smurfs

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.500
Grace: Then what happened?

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:17.320
Smurfette: Papa saved me. He cast a special spell and then helped me become the Smurf I was meant to be!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.230
NC: Oh! So much for her backstory!

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.610
BN: Yeah, who cares! We have Harris' advertising
job to worry about!

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.920
It's not like this movie is about Smurfs!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.920
Patrick: Time to either celebrate, or file for unemployment...

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.600
BN: Huh, I think that was the
banner at the movie's wrap party.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.200
NC: But we don't need to worry about that for too
long as we partake in more movement porn

00:16:38.209 --> 00:16:42.230
which also conveniently serves as
trailer fodder- BN: -and product placement for

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.020
Guitar Hero and/or Rock Band

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:55.560
(Ball-rippingly bad rendition of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way")

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.920
NC: Was the Neil Patrick Harris crotch cam
really essential to the scene?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.820
BN: I'll accept it. As long as the Smurfs
don't rap, as long-

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.960
(Surprise.)

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.700
BN: OH MY GOD! (Slams hand on table)

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.100
BN: Who're they even singing to?  I know it's supposed to

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.160
be like a music video, but in terms of the movie they're just rapping into a corner

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.280
Both: LA LA LALALALA LA LALALA LA

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:20.840
BITCH!

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.920
(Both continue to recite demonic chant into corner)

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.940
Tamara: Soo, uh... whatcha guys doin'?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.420
NC: We're representin' foo!

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.960
BN: Yeah, playa if someone was down there lookin' at us we would look ama-zin!

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.700
Malcom: You look like you're being punished...

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.920
Both: WE ARE!

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.460
(Both sob)

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.740
Patrick: Doesn't it... freak you out sometimes?
Little guys depending on you?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.880
Papa Smurf: That's what being a papa is...

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.200
(NC imitating Papa Smurf): As the saying goes, "You smurf it, y' raise it."

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.520
BN: Gargamel is put in prison which... let me see if anything funny is happening here...

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.320
BN: Nope.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.460
As he magically summons an army of flies to save him.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.860
(Gargamel screams as he is almost ripped to shreds)

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.300
(And dropped.)

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.080
NC: Boy, even by Smurf standards that's just
weird!

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.640
But it looks like Clumsy accidentally tripped and sent the wrong design to the firm.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.360
As... most trips do? Which means the wrong ad is sent all over town.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.180
Patrick: You said they would bring good luck, this is anything but good! I
never should have let this happen!

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.180
I never wanted a house full of little
people running around!

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.180
(Nice going.)

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.580
BN: No, it's okay I only just meant it as a
metaphor for the baby!

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:39.740
Grace: Of all the people on the planet those
magical little creatures came to us. They

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.420
chose (cursed) us. Don't you see how absolutely
amazing that is this? This a

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.840
once-in-a-lifetime thing Patrick, this is
our blue moon.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.460
Kermit the Frog: Hm... y'know, it's amazing.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.380
You are 100% wrong.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.260
I mean, nothing you've said has been
right!

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.260
BN: Yeah, Kermit's right, nobody chose anybody.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.480
NC: Yeah, it's clearly just a series of accidental circumstances.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.340
BN: I'll give it this, though, it does make me crave blue moon...

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.820
NC: Let's go drinking after this... BN: I think that was a given.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.480
NC: But
thankfully Times Square is full of ironic

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.680
imagery and he realizes that hammered in
messages are good.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.220
BN: Meanwhile at an old bookstore, the Smurfs
are looking for a book of spells which

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.000
seems to be weirdly enough a Smurfs comic
book...

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.900
Papa Smurf: Secret rooms are hidden in the drawing...

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.340
Smurf: You see all that
in there? Papa Smurf: Look here, at the patterns on this page...

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.340
BN: So wait, Peyo wasn't just a cartoonist, he
was also a dimension jumper? NC: Or was he a

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.700
time traveler? Didn't this all take place in
the past? Kinda?

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.960
BN: And upon his discoveries all he
did was make cartoons about it?

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.880
I never though i'd say this but... Smurfs, you're
kind of hard to follow!

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:53.500
NC: Gargamel tries again to capture them
but Papa Smurf stays behind to get captured.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.870
BN: Why?! He could have just escaped with them!
NC: Well, then it wouldn't feed into the Papa

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.870
sacrifice-y talk that they had
earlier. BN: That doesn't mean you get

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.280
purposely caught for no reason!

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.620
(Beautiful music starts playing) NC: Doesn't it Black Nerd, doesn't it?

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.680
BN: NO!

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.080
NC: Well the director of Beverly Hills Chihuahua says it does so shut it!

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.000
BN: Have you seen Beverly Hills Chihuahua? NC: No,
have you?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.900
NC: (Whispers) You are part of the problem...

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.000
BN: But they get the portal to open up and bring
tons of Smurfs back to save Papa.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.320
(Smurfs chanting MORE demonic chant)

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:35.700
NC: Yeah... that doesn't really work as a war
song. It sounds more like a lullaby from Donald Trump.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.520
BN: Hm... an angry ward of people holding
weapons, chanting and wearing pointy white hats...

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.200
BN: For some reason I feel very uncomfortable...

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.180
NC: While that's going on, Papa Smurf is being
put through a machine to extract his essence

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.720
Papa Smurf: No! Onions! Agh!

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.880
NC: ....Was that a Smurf thing? Being afraid of onions?

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.460
BN: No.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.200
NC: Was there an episode when an onion killed his family?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.880
BN: No.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.580
NC: Could the onion-

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.540
BN: No!

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.600
NC: Then why the f*ck is he afraid of onions!?

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.380
BN: I don't know! Indiana Jones is afraid of snakes!

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.000
NC: But not produce! There's not a
scene in one of the movies where he's like-

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.900
Onions? Why'd it have to be onions?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.660
BN: Let's just
agree that the writers were probably on meth when they wrote this...

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.660
NC: There's no probably about it.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.780
NC: Blue meth-  BN: Blue meth!...

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.860
BN: Wanna get high? NC: Yes.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.060
BN: Oh but here's something neat we get
to see how Azrael gets the chipped ear!

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:47.660
NC: But... wait... if this happened after the
cartoon shouldn't there already be a chipped ear

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.700
BN: I guess it makes as much sense as
Smurfette saving Papa Smurf only to

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.500
immediately have him captured again.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.740
NC: Christ, this guy throws himself into
trouble more than Bella Swan!

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.520
Clumsy: I got it! BN: But Clumsy is about to
perform the action that Papa Smurf saw would doom them all.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.500
Papa Smurf: The visions... have never been wrong...

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.780
(NC as Papa Smurf): Except when they're completely wrong...
like this time!

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.460
BN: Just put that in the bag of other plot
holes this movie doesn't explain!

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.140
NC: Really? It's getting so big! (Slams bag on desk)

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:24.740
Papa Smurf: I owe you and apology, Clumsy... I believed more in a vision... than I did in you.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.400
(BN as Papa Smurf): From now on you shall be called
semi-competent Smurf!

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.440
NC: This leads to the Smurfs finally being
sent home.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.900
Papa Smurf: I should get going

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.940
I've got a smurf village to rebuild. Your
village has given me some ideas.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.850
(NC as Papa Smurf):  We're thinking about putting our garbage on
the street and acting like assholes to

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.100
anyone who looks at us funny!

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.960
Patrick: I smurf you.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.700
1998 Jennfier Lopez: Really? Who gives a sh*t?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.900
NC: So that was the Smurfs
movie. BN: But only by title this has so

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.460
little to do with the original cartoon!

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.360
Believe it or not, in 2017, they're
rebooting the Smurfs AGAIN fully

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.730
animated and more like the source
material, which makes perfect sense,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.090
because this movie has nothing to do
with the original Smurfs!

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.300
Look, you can do that with Garfield you can do that with the Chipmunks, but the Smurfs live in a

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.250
medieval fantasy world with dragons, with
wizards, with witches, with magic, with

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.330
sorcery, with adventure, and you
decided it was more entertaining to have

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:30.340
advertising executives, domestic
parenting, New York City,

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.910
Sony product placement?! That is not what
the Smurfs stood for,

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:39.100
it was magical, it was timeless and you
made it... 2000's!

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.440
NC: And yet, it was such a big hit. Why?

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.080
BN: I'll tell you why, because they threw a
lot of money and advertising at it with no effort.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.590
People forget how all over the place the
Smurfs were. It was a marketing monster

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.940
that couldn't be escaped. It grabbed older
people's nostalgia, younger kids love for

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:59.020
toys and enough celebrities to have
people shrug and be way too forgiving

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.980
because of how cute it was. NC: So wait,
you're saying you can make a bundle

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.059
through no effort at all as long as you
just advertise it right? BN: Pretty much. All

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:10.179
you need is something nostalgic,
celebrities, and someone who's

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.020
manipulated people through advertising
before...

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.500
Narrator: Coming this fall to a theater near you...

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.060
PET ROCK. It's your childhood favorite
like you've never seen it before. It

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.650
jumps around to pop songs, looks cute,

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:28.390
raps in the corner,  alters some white
idiot's life, and all while having a ton

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.190
of celebrity voices. You remember these
people, age group 5 - 37, don't you?

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.560
it's Amy Poehler-

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.580
Amy: WAFFLES! :D

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.040
Chistopher Walken-

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.040
Christopher: Mm, call me Chris... Chris Rock!

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.440
Selena Gomez-

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.920
Selena: The rock wants what it wants

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.340
Hey, she said the thing!

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.740
And of course,  Samuel L Jackson-

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.020
Samuel: Yeah, i'm
in everything so why not be in this.. motha f*cka.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.340
But you don't want a
movie called The Pet Rock to be about the Pet Rock,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.260
so we have several characters to derail
the plot, like Neil Patrick Harris as the

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.860
ad executive, Megan Fox as April O'Neil,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.840
Shia LaBeouf from Transformers-

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.340
Shia: DO IT.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.580
Alright! Jeesh.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.860
They're just about to ride with Natalie
Portman and Courteney Cox in a pink

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.520
convertible with He-man and Thor in the
back seat, with a soundtrack featuring

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.960
The Rolling Stones, Kid Rock, and other
rock related names.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.160
You know it must be good, it's on f*cking everything!

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.730
PETROCK The
Movie

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.480
It'll turn your heart of stone into a
heart of home! Coming up the same weekend as-

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.760
NC and BN: SON OF A-

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:57.840
*Humming*

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.440
Is that camera still on?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.950
Hey guys, Doug Walker

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:10.509

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:24.549
kind of knew is that I want to give a
shout out to certain charities that I

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:27.789

so I'm gonna do that at the end of every
video now i'm going to give a shout out

00:26:31.179 --> 00:26:35.139

00:26:35.139 --> 00:26:38.289
something about have had some contact
with and that's exactly what I'm gonna

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:42.759
do here i'm going to start off with a
charity that is very very special and

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.720
they're just we've seen him work first

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.500
and this is a camp for
children who have cancer

for you you're like any other kid and
all these kids come together and they

00:27:05.079 --> 00:27:09.459
share so many incredible experiences and
I remember we were there on the last day

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:13.779
it wasn't it wasn't a dry eye in the
house I mean it was just seeing all

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:15.639
these kids come together

00:27:15.639 --> 00:27:20.079
just having fun and hugging each other I
mean that they're saying goodbye to say

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:24.699
goodbye to each other and it was just it
was the most heartwarming thing you've

00:27:24.699 --> 00:27:28.389
