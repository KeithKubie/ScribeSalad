<v 1>yeah.

X,
Eh,</v>

14
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.150
you have some fun and sorry,

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.190
I'm so sick of being sick.

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.460
Just when the fuck is this gonna end.
I woke up Bodu do,

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.000
I had a fucking coffin fit that like four in the morning and uh,

18
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.090
you know,
it was upstairs.
I've been banished upstairs.
You know what I mean?

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.000
Like back in the day when people had like tuberculosis after the slumlord stuck

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.490
them in some damp,
dark fucking apartment for years and years and years.

21
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.950
And then he's poor.
Fucking tenants would die.

22
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:12.380
A lonely death and then they'd build a statue statue to the fucking slum.
Lord.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.400
My name is subway stop after him.
You know,
what was that one on?

24
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:20.750
Off The six,
the fuck,

25
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.540
I can't remember the name of the Stop I used to get off at all the time.

26
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.070
And walk over to the fucking,

27
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.300
I remember everything I saw in New York.
I just,
anybody at a statue.

28
00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:33.040
I just started looking them up on the Internet,

29
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.470
but it was all this shit that they did.

30
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.540
But if you went to about page three of four,

31
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.860
it was the other stuff that they did.

32
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.020
<v 0>Oh yeah.
Um,</v>

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.970
<v 1>people,
if I live long enough,</v>

34
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:54.080
I'm going to do a show this weekend at the Fox theater in Atlanta,
Georgia.

35
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.550
And then you know what I'm going to do then following day,
you know what I mean?

36
00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.470
Go on and do what bill?
Yeah,

37
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.830
I'm getting in a fucking rental car and I'm driving over to fucking Talladega

38
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.480
and I'm going to go watch a bunch of fucking rednecks watching their dream cars

39
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:14.950
going around the track.
One more time.
One more fucking time.

40
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.950
Hey,
you stock car racing going to change.

41
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:21.730
Now that Ford is fucking phasing out all of their sedans.
Did you guys see that?

42
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.990
They're not making any cars anymore.
They're going to still have the Mustang,

43
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.680
you know,
cause what would have fucking tourist rent when they come to la?

44
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.730
You got to get the Red Mustang convertible and put the fucking top down and

45
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:37.510
drive around like a dose,
right?
Oh,
do you know what you want to hear?

46
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.120
You want to hear some self-involved Shit.

47
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.210
They're always talking about the millennials.
You know what I mean?

48
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.290
You ask a millennial,
what's the top fucking social issue out there today?

49
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:52.090
And they'd say lack of self service,
you know,
in a tunnel.
No,

50
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:55.360
actually they said climate change and they're determined to tackle the issue.

51
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.670
That's what I just read today.

52
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.630
Millennials think that climate change is the number one social issue.

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.360
Of course it is.
They are 100% right.

54
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.050
God bless them and they're determined to tackle it.
You know,

55
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.490
wait till they get a little bit of debt under their belts.

56
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.780
Wait to those banker cuts,
costs,
get them under their fucking,
you know,

57
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.280
get a run on the wheel.
Yeah,
no wait,
did I get married?

58
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.130
Yeah.
Wait to that APP.
And so you start getting fucking Nag.

59
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:26.131
Then your priority becomes paying off my fucking house and fucking redoing the

60
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.200
garage.
So I got a place for myself.
But until then,

61
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.160
until that all right,
you saved the polar bears.
I hope you do it.

62
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.410
I hope you stick to help you keep it real,
man.

63
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.570
Like whenever you see an old hippie still rock the long fucking,
you know hair.

64
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.390
<v 3>Do you mean if he went bald?
Still has it all gathered in the back,</v>

65
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.480
you know?
Um,

66
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.130
<v 1>anyways,
what the fuck was I going?
I was,
God dammit.
Bility a tangent.</v>

67
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.040
So something I was going to talk about there.

68
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.140
What I brown was talking about cold medicine being sick.

69
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.720
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.440
<v 1>Led me to the cars.
Talladega.
Ah,
fuck.</v>

71
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.380
If I know,
I don't fucking know.

72
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.620
All I know is that I've been sick too fucking long and I've had this fucking

73
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.300
thing started Wednesday of last week.

74
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.080
These are these new super colt because everybody takes antibiotics and

75
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.120
everything,
right?
And rather than killing the virus,

76
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:24.970
all you do is slap it around a little pit and it toughens up.

77
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.220
You know what I mean?
It's like,
oh,
that,
you know,

78
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.950
it starts to know your tendencies.

79
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.780
He leads with the left fucking jap always follows it with an overhand right.

80
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.520
<v 0>Okay.</v>

81
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.420
<v 1>He doesn't like when you crowd them in the ring.
Oh Shit.
Somebody calling me.</v>

82
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.840
Oh,
it's my mother,
a mom.
I'm doing my podcasts.
Let me call you right back.

83
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.580
All right.
MMM.

84
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.770
Anyways.
Um,

85
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.510
<v 3>fuck.
I don't even want him talking about it anymore.
Oh yes.
Oh,
notice.</v>

86
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.200
So I woke up at like four in the morning,

87
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.710
just fucking hacking or hacking away and um,
you know,

88
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.590
upstairs in the guest room,
that's where I've been,
you know,

89
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.840
sent my wife is also sick,
you know,

90
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.170
but she gets to stay in the big bed.
Do you see how that works?
You know what,

91
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.870
the Nice fucking master bathroom right next door,

92
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.020
she has a fucking humidifier going.

93
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.810
Just got her fucking Kleenex with the,
uh,
you know,
you won't get a sore noise.

94
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.910
Knows fucking missed autumn.

95
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.990
I'm up in the fucking guest room,
you know,
with all my drawer,

96
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.910
my old drum DVDs and shit blow my nose with toilet paper.

97
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.180
It's how it works,
you know,
and you are,
what do you see?

98
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:48.990
All you see is women just constantly complaining about the way the way men treat

99
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:53.910
women and their position in society.
Right.
So as a society,
right.

100
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.810
What about me?
What about my existence?
Yeah.

101
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 1>Where's my ribbon?
Where's my Hashtag?
[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.790
<v 0>okay.</v>

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.380
<v 1>How come I can't get somebody fired?</v>

104
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 0>You know,</v>

105
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.020
<v 1>I'd actually been winning arguments lately with my wife.
It's been good.
You know,</v>

106
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:14.310
it's caused her to kind of like,

107
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.660
<v 0>yeah.</v>

108
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.540
<v 1>You know,
do a couple things around the house that I've been asking her to do,</v>

109
00:06:18.541 --> 00:06:20.880
but I know it's going to go back the other way.
Same Way.
Like she goes,

110
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.760
see you got to watch your temper and then for a few days I walk around smiling

111
00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:26.910
like Aluna tech before I go back to who I am.
But you know,

112
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:30.700
I accepted for who she is.
All right.
That's what you have to do after awhile.

113
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.030
<v 1>Yeah.
All you ladies out there,
you think he could have changed your man?</v>

115
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.500
You're not,
you're not going to change them.

116
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.830
The best you can hope to do is break his spirit.

117
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.440
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.</v>

118
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.530
<v 1>If that,
if that's what gets you off.
What about all of that shit?
Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.930
I've about a ribbon for all the broken men out there.

120
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.860
<v 1>I don't know why I'm talking about all of this shit.
It just fucking,</v>

122
00:06:55.861 --> 00:06:59.700
it always makes me laugh.
Um,
anyways,

123
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.820
how about those bro wins.
Here we go bro.
And say,
and we go bump up.

124
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.690
Wow.

125
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.280
Did I think we were going to lose that game seven now when we started our fourth

126
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:15.390
fucking line and immediately gave up a goddamn goal,
I was like,
wow,

127
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.800
that reminds me of certain,

128
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.590
somebody not starting to game crying before the Super Bowl.

129
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.390
The fuck are we doing right?
And we tie it up.
Then we go ahead.

130
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.621
All right.

131
00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:28.980
It was two to one and we scored on right before the first fucking period ended

132
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:32.250
or something
that was like,
oh boy,

133
00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:36.900
it's three to to look at that.
That's what I was,
it was one,

134
00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:38.710
nothing them.
Then one,
one us,

135
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.630
and then they immediately fucking scored like they always did and then we

136
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.870
fucking,
and we went up three to two and I'm like,
okay,
maybe,
maybe,
you know,

137
00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:50.190
whatever.
And then they score off to fucking goals throughout five to three.

138
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

139
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.040
<v 1>This is one thing I've noticed about the Bruins.
We don't hit anybody.</v>

140
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.760
Finally started hitting somebody in the third period.
But Jesus Christ,

141
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:00.560
when the other team is faster than you,

142
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.560
you suppose to add them to try to slow up doubt

143
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.720
given away too much fucking space.
I thought,
you know,

144
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.810
I thought Anderson looks shaky in the first period,
so I was like,

145
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.870
let's pepper him with some shots there in a second.
And uh,

146
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.180
we barely got a shot on him.

147
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.830
It felt so I thought that allowed them to settle down what Jesus Christ was
Iraq.

148
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.550
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

149
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.850
<v 1>I tell you,
you hate to see it yet to see it.
It fell it fellow fellow ginger,</v>

150
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.940
you know,
fuck it as a game like that,
you know,

151
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.840
I guess toward crew gives a little bit screened.
But uh,
he left,

152
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.510
he let up a fucking softy.
That next one would have.

153
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.860
Goal number five was a softy and also one of the first three wasn't a good one

154
00:08:40.861 --> 00:08:42.720
either.
Um,

155
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.190
<v 0>okay.</v>

156
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.780
<v 1>Not to put it all on him.
Uh,
but anyways,</v>

157
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.010
my condolences to fucking Toronto may police and Jesus Christ,

158
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.571
you know,

159
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:57.510
and you gotta give it up to the ones that still have the heart to fucking go

160
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.630
down to maple leaf square,
whatever the fuck they call it.

161
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.631
And stand there knowing that their joy is eventually going to turn to anger.

162
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.930
<v 1>And then they could just come be part of a fucking reaction video.
A bad one.</v>

164
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.600
But you have to go right.
There's a leafs fan.
You gotta go.

165
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.090
Cause one of these times you're going to fucking win.

166
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.370
I liked what that one guy in the leafs said.
He said,
obviously it sucks,

167
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.180
but I think in the future we're going to be a team to be reckoned with.

168
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.280
I always love that expression team to be reckoned with.

169
00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:31.620
They think they're going to be mmm.
You know,

170
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.330
full freckle settles down a little bit.

171
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:35.760
They get a little more playoff experience.
I'll tell you what the Bruins need.

172
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.970
They need a physical presence in front of the net

173
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.090
each day.
You know,

174
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.480
we still haven't made up for fucking Luke Cheech departure.

175
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.251
There's no,

176
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:53.790
we always had that runaway fucking train that would just flatten people.

177
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:57.210
Actually we used to have like three of them.
We just don't have that anymore.

178
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:58.920
Now we're fucking fast as shit.

179
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.800
At least I thought we were until we played the maple leafs.
Um,
anyway,

180
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:08.520
so now the Bruins move on.
We got to Tampa Bay lightning,

181
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.900
part of that fair to hockey fans down there.

182
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.420
I went to Tampa Bay lightning game down there,
right.

183
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.180
And went with four [inaudible].
We were sitting there and there was,

184
00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:21.890
he's a Florida northern Florida rednecks behind is some of my favorite rednecks.

185
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.860
I like rednecks,
you know.
Um,

186
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.440
there was not a fix shit I'll fix it.
Ain't going to fit but a,

187
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.640
it'll hang off Nass.
Um,

188
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.760
we were sitting there and they add on the diamond vision.

189
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.220
They put this little baby up there,
right.
You know,

190
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.850
they had an infant up on the screen.
The guy behind us goes,
look,

191
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.810
I had a little baby.

192
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.490
I don't know why they just stuck with us a little rest of the road trip.

193
00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.330
You drive it over to fucking Orlando dead silence in the car.

194
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.290
And the forest just be like,
yeah,

195
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.470
<v 4>hello baby
little baby.</v>

196
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.560
<v 1>MMM.
It was hilarious.
And then also scary,</v>

197
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:01.630
just listen to that guy cause he didn't sound real bright.

198
00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:05.590
And just the fact that you know,
his TJ's can also make babies.

199
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.300
I just wished that like your level of intelligence made you also like,

200
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.420
like your Iq should be the same level as your,

201
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:17.830
a reproductive like a potency.
Is that the right word?

202
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.830
Like if you're a fucking moron,

203
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.370
it should be a half court shot that you're gonna get somebody knocked up.

204
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.460
You know,
that's not how it works.
Dumb people usually have like that.

205
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.740
Super Jealous,
you know,

206
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.490
let me just stand next to somebody and they get fucking pregnant.

207
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.600
Just shooting out fucking kids.
Uh,

208
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.310
that's cause they're too dumb to plan.
You know,
they just lay it on the back.

209
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.690
<v 4>What feels good?
Feels good.
Feels good.</v>

210
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.640
<v 1>Well I was my belly sticking out.
Why is my belly moving?</v>

211
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.530
Does anybody else feel weird?

212
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.690
Are for that meal and then they just fucking shit the kid out on a sofa.
I mean,

213
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.690
that happens.
That's still happens in America out there.
On the Appalachian trail.

214
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.700
God knows Hollywood.

215
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.280
We'll go out there and put some cameras on it and turned it into a fucking

216
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.230
reality show.
And next thing you know,

217
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.290
we're buying it and there's fucking little kids sewing together.

218
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.020
Tee shirts with these fucking dopes faces on it.

219
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.200
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

220
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.400
<v 1>All right.
And that's what's wrong with this goddamn country.</v>

221
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.053
<v 0>MMM.</v>

222
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.510
<v 1>Jesus Christ.
I love all these people taking the bait on that fucking Kanye West.</v>

223
00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:33.200
Shit.
He obviously has an album coming out.
You fucking morons.
Relax.

224
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.510
Has he lost his mind?

225
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:38.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

226
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.590
<v 1>Did you learn anything with that beyond say album?
Well,</v>

227
00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:47.591
she was acting like she was all annoyed with Jay z and that there were all these

228
00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:49.370
problems at all.
What the fuck?

229
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.480
Everybody just starts gossiping and everybody buys the fucking album and they're

230
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:54.440
still together.

231
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

232
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.480
<v 1>How many fucking times you're going to jump on the hook.</v>

233
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.900
He's obviously recording the fucking album.
There's no more MTV.

234
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.270
Billboards are a lot of fucking money.

235
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.290
Why don't you just start saying some crazy shit that makes no fucking sense.

236
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.930
You know?
And then people will listen to your next album.

237
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.270
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

238
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.980
<v 1>I'm going to fucking do that.
Get my podcast numbers up.
What the fuck can I,
uh,</v>

239
00:13:25.981 --> 00:13:28.050
I'm going to just start saying positive shit about women.

240
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:36.810
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

241
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.050
<v 1>You know,</v>

242
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:42.050
I think the real problem beyond global warming then that swirl of trash out in

243
00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:47.610
the Pacific Ocean.
Even worse than Isis.

244
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

245
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.820
<v 1>Oh,
I got a text message.
Ah,
I dropped the phone.
Jesus Christ.
Tiki Barber.</v>

246
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.340
Pick it up though.
For Christ sake.

247
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.333
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

248
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.650
<v 1>Shut this fucking thing of I think the biggest problem</v>

249
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.580
beyond Isis and isis is a major problem.

250
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.160
I mean they're just like the Third Reich.

251
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.890
If the Third Reich had no planes or boats,
oh really?

252
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:18.990
Any technology,
um,

253
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is white male heterosexuals and their micro aggression.

254
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.003
Um,

255
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.050
which is why I have decided I can't even do this because you guys are going to

256
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.650
fucking retweet this thing and next thing you know,
it'd be some fucking,

257
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.750
I don't want to get involved in that.

258
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

259
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.030
<v 1>I was going to say that I've,
I've decided
no,</v>

260
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.600
I can't say cause because everyone's going to get all fucking upset.

261
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.600
<v 3>It rhymes with man.
Zishan</v>

262
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.810
that would be the ultimate,
right.
If you did that

263
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.240
<v 1>be funny.
If you,
yeah,
if you did that,</v>

264
00:15:03.241 --> 00:15:06.930
like as this as a sign of solidarity with all the pain that women have been

265
00:15:06.931 --> 00:15:09.050
through,
that you actually,
uh,

266
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.770
went through with the sex change operation and then everybody called you a hero

267
00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:17.580
and then Diane Sawyer interviewed you and they made you a woman of the year.

268
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.060
And then after all that cleared,
all these women came forward and said,

269
00:15:21.061 --> 00:15:23.970
you are grabbing ass and titties all through the 90s and two thousands,

270
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.220
then you'd be like,
well,
I didn't do that.
That was frank.

271
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.960
I'm Francis and I just feel like for me.

272
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.810
Right.
And then you're on the other side of the issue.

273
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.783
<v 5>MMM.</v>

274
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.850
<v 1>And they'd be like,
well,
isn't frank still in there?</v>

275
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.670
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

276
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.660
<v 1>And you could be like,
well,
I left frank on that,
that fucking operating table.</v>

277
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.490
I never was frank.

278
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.200
Frank is my white slave name given to me by my white parents.

279
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.600
Um,
Jesus Christ.
How much more time do I have in this fucking podcast?

280
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.430
I usually like doing these things,
man.

281
00:16:03.431 --> 00:16:07.690
But when my fucking head is all clogged like this,
you know,

282
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.320
when I lay down in my slippers having to podcast with a head cold,

283
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.310
that's a day's work.
People.
Now I know you guys are out there doing construction.

284
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:21.190
What the fuck do people do nowadays?
Everybody air quote works from home now,

285
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.490
which means they're out driving around on the highways during the day cause and

286
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:27.520
fucking rush hour traffic.
You know what I mean?

287
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300
Cause they saw something on Pinterest that they have to go pick up to add to

288
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:35.470
their fucking wardrobe for their party that night.
Right?
Uh,

289
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.600
we should go back to making our own clothes.

290
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.410
<v 3>You should go back to that.
You make your own clothes,
you grow your own Burgers,</v>

291
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.870
right?
You want to fucking Burger,

292
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:48.690
go slaughter that calf and then you figure out how to freeze the rest of that

293
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.160
meat.
Are you going to start this winter?
If there pilgrim,
um,

294
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.120
I think to somethings goes something like that's going to happen.

295
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.650
We're either going to regress to that after this shit hits the fan or this

296
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.680
illuminati stuff is true and the robots will kill all of us.
And uh,

297
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.790
oh wow.
That'd be amazing in the future.
Right?
This is Illuminati city.

298
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.300
Everybody's dead except for the Illuminati people.
Right.

299
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:19.400
And the other people that they,
they keep making,
they kept enough people,
right,

300
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.490
with good genes that they make fuck each other.

301
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:25.880
So they keep making babies and stuff that they can use to fucking,
uh,
you know,

302
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.380
as almost like a parts car,
you know,
for organs when they reach maturity.

303
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.530
I know this is fucked up,
right?
Um,
sorta like Westworld meets,
uh,

304
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.520
a guy with a head cold doing a podcast on a Thursday.

305
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.680
That's how I pitched this in Hollywood.
I come in,
I say hello everybody.

306
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.280
We do all this small talk,
but Baba Baba,
Baba,
you know,
I,

307
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.550
I'd read the fucking room,
I try to figure out where the laughs are going to be,

308
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.510
you know,
try to block out the ice cold person that do,

309
00:17:55.770 --> 00:18:00.600
she was just sitting there,
you know,
fidgeting with their fucking pen.
Um,

310
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.060
and I would,
I would just pitch,
I pitch the hell out of it.
So anyways,

311
00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:07.950
so then you have an Illuminati city.
All right.

312
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.110
And they feel like they've won but their actual actually prisoners because the

313
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:18.030
robots have the city surrounded,
you know,
and they still have some robots.

314
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.090
The older versions that are good,
you know,

315
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.490
that's still work with the people.

316
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.630
But the latest update of the one went fucking rogue and killed a couple of it

317
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.450
was like the first people that died other than the parts people

318
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:36.750
and like hundreds of years.
So they hit the fucking shield.

319
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.380
Then I got this big bubble like the Simpsons that one time.
Right?

320
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.370
They've got this big bubble over the fucking city and they stay in there with

321
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.190
the older version of the robots and they're the ones that have to try to protect

322
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:50.940
him as the fucking higher level ones are trying to figure out how to get into

323
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:53.580
the bubble.
And that's what it is.

324
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:56.790
And it's weird thing you'd have to root for these pieces of shit humans.

325
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.120
So then obviously what would happen is you'd have a really good looking parts

326
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:06.390
person like Ryan Gosling and he,
Hey Nia,

327
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.060
hi,
hi.
And he would,
uh,
he would somehow,

328
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.640
you know,
he'd bang like the hottest Illuminati person and she believed in him.

329
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.170
And then him and one of the lesser robots would then fucking

330
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.100
two feet,

331
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.840
the next level robots while freeing all the parts people and then killing the

332
00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:32.570
Illuminati people.
There you go.
And you could,

333
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.500
you could finish the story halfway through it and then get everybody to go to

334
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:38.970
the second one.
Right.
And then all yeah,

335
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.970
do have to do is just show up down at comicon.
Where in an Obi wan Kenobi rope.

336
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.530
And I think you've got $1 billion franchise.
What do you think?
Yeah,

337
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:50.360
you liked that movie?
I love it.
What would you name that movie

338
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.090
<v 1>bills?
Great idea for a movie.
Ah,</v>

339
00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.800
Jesus.
What are you doing on my phone?
I wasn't listening.
I'm texting myself.

340
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:04.380
Those pictures.
What pictures?
The pictures you took of me earlier with,

341
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.410
maybe that's it.
Yeah.
I had to get back to our show.
Oh,

342
00:20:09.411 --> 00:20:11.600
that's right.
I forgot we had a kid

343
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.400
come on you guys.
You know,
so he puts 10,000 hours into that idea.

344
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.700
You got yourself a good fucking movie movie,
movie.

345
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.090
There's a lot of hacky shit in there.
You know,

346
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.500
it's like Westworld meets fucking Moonraker,

347
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.880
uh,
with a dash a happy days.
You know,

348
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:40.090
cause at some point some all fucking Ron Howard Directs Ryan Gosling stars.

349
00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:42.500
He probably wouldn't do it because you already did blade runner.

350
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.100
Do you guys see that one?
The 20,
48 blade runner that moves movie was the shit.

351
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.663
MMM.

352
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.760
I just noticed I'd probably been coughing like every five fucking seconds on

353
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:59.110
this.
I apologize.
I apologize.
But I'm not going to take a cough drop.

354
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.740
Alright.
Cough drops if a socialist.

355
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.180
All right.
Anyway,
so you only like when you do an interview,

356
00:21:12.181 --> 00:21:14.100
when you got to fucking show coming up,
they go bail.

357
00:21:14.101 --> 00:21:15.920
So what can people expect from you are,

358
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.160
what are you gonna be talking about when I kind of town?
Wait,
what do you well,

359
00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:22.620
I can't fucking tell you that cause then the jokes are going to be over.

360
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.430
Everybody's going to know what I'm going to be talking about.

361
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.220
What kind of fucking question is that?
You sound like you're still angry

362
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.120
these days.

363
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.953
<v 0>Okay.</v>

364
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.890
<v 1>I'm not angry.
It's just my,
my default emotion.</v>

365
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.570
I walk around relaxed and then when anything happens,
good or bad,

366
00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:46.770
I get it and I don't know if it's good.
I don't get angry.
I don't know.
Hey,

367
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.560
we got a new advertiser.
Okay.

368
00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:53.010
We somehow convinced somebody else to get on this sinking ship.
Let's see here.

369
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.610
From the halls of mod to zoo,

370
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.940
to the shores of Tripoli.

371
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.290
I will tie my fucking password.

372
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.180
All right.
Oh,
butchers box,

373
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.690
butchers box,
and we're not talking about his wife.
All right.
Butchers box.

374
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.430
Now these guys actually sent me a bag of fucking butchered meat and I had a

375
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:25.120
steak the other day.
I may add my wife cooked it.
Ah,

376
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.220
tell me I'm not running shit in my house.

377
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.390
I was actually sick and she's a sweetheart.

378
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.430
She cooked it and it was fucking delicious.
It was a giant portion.

379
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.150
So much that I've actually saved it for a little bit of steak and eggs later on

380
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:37.984
this week,

381
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:43.140
a butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and finished beef.

382
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.820
I don't know what finished means.
They are.
That means they butchered it.

383
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.190
Free Range.
Organic chicken and heritage bread.

384
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:57.850
Pork directly.
Yeah,
to your door on a monthly basis.

385
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:03.070
Eat like you're in the Illuminati.
All their products are humanely raised.

386
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:04.951
Yeah.
Excuse me.

387
00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:08.970
Could you come over here if you wouldn't mind before I butcher your you and

388
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:12.180
never ever given antibiotics or hormones.
There you go.

389
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:16.660
If you don't want your kids to hit puberty at eight butcher blocks,

390
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.550
butcher blocks,
butcher box,
high quality,
healthy protein you can trust.

391
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.100
You can shake hands with these cows.

392
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.440
100% grass fed and finished beef free range.
Organic chicken.
We've said this.

393
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:34.240
Heritage,
bread,
pork.
What does Rick flair out there?

394
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.250
That's old world pork before they bred out all of the fat

395
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.130
in flavor to make it the other White Meat,

396
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.880
Aka this is the way they were meant to be.

397
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.070
I gotta look up heritage bread.
Pork.
That's fascinating.
Unbelievable.

398
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.740
It's like a mat and a old car with matching numbers.

399
00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.550
Unbelievable tastes as a huge different in taste between animals raised on

400
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:02.580
pasture and those fed and grain constant and concentration animal feedlot

401
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.990
operations.
Butcher box is changing that.
This is great.

402
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.350
There's more and more of these types of people.
Gotta love it.
Um,

403
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.300
and they offer free shipping anywhere in this,
in the 48 states,

404
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:17.300
the lower 48 Alaska.
Who's kitten home,
right?

405
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.580
You're fucking trapped in your own meat in Hawaii.

406
00:24:19.581 --> 00:24:24.581
You a eat pineapples over 20% off plus free bacon by going free bacon by going

407
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.740
to a butcher box.com/bar and using the discount code.
Bar B U R.

408
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:34.760
R I tried to,
shit,
I ate the shit.
I love this shit.

409
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:38.900
I back this shit.
Put your box.com/bar.
Um,

410
00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.690
you know,
I've got time to go to the butcher.
Use these guys.

411
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.100
I have to look up heritage,
bread,
pork.

412
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:50.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

413
00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.280
<v 1>You know,
every form of presidents always eating this shit.
Right?</v>

414
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.010
Okay.
Here we go.
Heritage bread,
pork heritage,

415
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:02.510
swine definition.

416
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.630
It's funny when somebody uses the word swine and it's not an insult.

417
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.950
I fucking love pigs.
There's certain animals that I,
I,
you know,

418
00:25:11.951 --> 00:25:14.230
I like all animals,
but I fucking love pigs.

419
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.720
Is any cooler than a little piglet running around deaf?

420
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:19.810
I like ducks.

421
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.190
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

422
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.950
<v 1>I like piglets.
He moves freak me out.</v>

423
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.960
Dogs are awesome cats I respect.
But you know what I mean?

424
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

425
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.351
<v 1>I,
you know,
I,</v>

426
00:25:31.351 --> 00:25:34.200
there's never any like sort of like every once in a while you meet a really cool

427
00:25:34.201 --> 00:25:36.450
fucking cat.
All right.
Definitely.

428
00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:39.540
But they got that Freddy Krueger claws and shit.
You know,

429
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.070
you turn around real quick and they'll like practice and killing you.
You know,

430
00:25:44.071 --> 00:25:46.380
you catch them stock in you and shit and fucking weird.

431
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.760
You wake up there on your chest staring at you

432
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.270
like that chicken misery.
All right.

433
00:25:55.271 --> 00:25:59.620
Purpose swine at better part of the American agricultural landscape since the

434
00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:04.270
arrival of the new world.
Colonists.
Why do they have to go that fucking far back?

435
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.640
This is why I don't read books.

436
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.330
Moby Dick get to the fucking whale.

437
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.490
Sorry.

438
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:19.490
Swine indigenous to Europe were brought with immigrants during the colonization

439
00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:22.920
of America.
Conventionals fucking things in a boat.
The wooden ship,

440
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.610
freaking the fuck out.
Riding over there with us.

441
00:26:26.611 --> 00:26:31.170
Hairless monkeys knowing they're going to get killed.
Um,

442
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.410
and the many different types of swine they brought had provided pork,
Lard,

443
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.850
pest control in land improvement services for centuries.

444
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.020
How to pork on a pig's help with pest control cause they fucking eat everything.

445
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.580
Now you have something else to look up.

446
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.330
This is how you lose a day on the Internet because there's always an answer.

447
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:54.810
Doesn't mean it's right.
But there's also someone who will,
some will have a page.

448
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.880
There's what?
I think there's wires.
What they do with varmints.
Uh,

449
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.950
modern bread associations maintain pedigree registries of pure bred animals for

450
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:10.050
each breed that descends from these colonial,
oh wow.
These are like the fucking,

451
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.620
the blue bloods of pigs as well as later introductions.

452
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.680
A registration of animals destined to become breeding stock is essential to the

453
00:27:18.931 --> 00:27:20.790
longterm security of the breeds.

454
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.140
Registration validates pure bred status of the animals and assures their

455
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:28.710
availability for conservation by future generations.
Many

456
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.420
swines but he swines Bree swine breeds that were once core components of

457
00:27:36.181 --> 00:27:41.181
regional cultures are now in danger of extinction as cultures of Homo,

458
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.910
Homo,
Homo,
generalized,

459
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.310
homogenized,
God,
I'm stupid.

460
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:52.580
And historic agricultural traditions abandoned the flavors and food traditions

461
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:57.760
that revolved around yet check out Monsanto for that one fucking lunatics

462
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.760
definition of heritage swine.

463
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.040
I don't even know if it's [inaudible].
They always said their fall.

464
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.720
People you blame,
who knows?

465
00:28:05.721 --> 00:28:10.721
Allegedly Monsanto heritage swine must adhere to all of the following oh

466
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:18.630
one I ranked a true chin.

467
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.300
Genetic bread.

468
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.520
The breed is a true genetic breed of swine.

469
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640
That is when made it together.

470
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.450
It reproduces the breed type.
All right,
I guess this is from Europe,

471
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.850
uh,
to de dos.
What does it ans times I,
I don't,

472
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.480
I can't do the German and dangered breed.

473
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.720
The breed is or has been endangered as defined by the livestock cons conservancy

474
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:53.450
and appears on or is recovered from the current conservancies conservation

475
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:57.480
priority list in the critically threatened Jesus Christ.

476
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:02.640
Long history in the u s pure bred.
I get it.
It's pure bread.
I like it.

477
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.260
There were fucking in danger and I'm eating them.

478
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.760
I'm meeting the fucking pig version of a fucking bald eagle.
Um,

479
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.600
what the fuck did I just,
I just shut that off and I,
I,
I wanted to,

480
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.070
what else did I want to look up?

481
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.280
What was it?
Oh,
how to pigs

482
00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.260
control pass population.

483
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.913
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

484
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.163
<v 1>Well eat bugs.</v>

485
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.170
Not how,
how on how to bill.
How do,

486
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.800
<v 6>okay,
here we go.</v>

487
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.330
<v 1>Well,
it just says,
forbid I then information was forbidden.
Practical,</v>

488
00:29:52.331 --> 00:29:56.410
feral pig control because feral pig population,
those are the wild pigs.

489
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.660
Anyways.
Fuck this shit.
How are their wild pigs,
by the way?

490
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.660
Were those the farmers that got scalped by the native Americans?

491
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.270
So they just stare.
Pigs just ran off.
Continue to fuck for centuries,
you know,

492
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.330
I dunno,
I don't have the answers to these questions,

493
00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.350
but I do have some bullshit I have to do at 10 o'clock.
Um,
all right.

494
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.560
That is the podcast.
This was a weird one.

495
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.070
<v 6>Okay.</v>

496
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.300
<v 1>All right.
But we came up with a good movie idea.</v>

497
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.920
We learned about heritage pigs and fucking a swine

498
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.920
<v 6>from Europe</v>

499
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.020
<v 1>and a Gopro Lynch and Celtics.
About those Celtics,</v>

500
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.290
but I try to wrap up these Pesky fucking Milwaukee Bucks.

501
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.540
You know I liked that one guy on on Milwaukee.
He looks like a fucking,

502
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.980
like a mid size minuit both really dark skinned guy.
He hit,

503
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.870
he had some fucking lay up or some shit to go up by four in the second quarter

504
00:30:56.871 --> 00:30:58.250
already.
Shush the crowd.

505
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:04.370
Like he just hit a game winning three does the second quarter and then they go

506
00:31:04.371 --> 00:31:07.880
on to lose the game.
I just don't,
I tie,
I don't understand these kids today.

507
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.400
All right everybody have a great weekend.
Your content and I'll see everybody in

508
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.930
<v 7>Atlanta and I'll see you down at the fuck race track count.</v>

509
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.240
Dad got come Saturday,

510
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.840
<v 1>listen to the music and enjoy another half hour of our greatest sets from a</v>

511
00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:27.140
Thursday just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast,

512
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.680
Thursday earlier this year or possibly this decade.
All right,
I'll see you.

513
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:32.783
<v 6>Uh,</v>

514
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.023
[inaudible].

515
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.590
<v 7>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

516
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:21.400
It's Bill Burger and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

517
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.160
April 26th April,
April 26th,
2010 how the hell are you?

518
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.650
I'm a little late today with the podcast doing it three 43 Los Angeles time.

519
00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:33.051
Uh,

520
00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:36.760
and you probably want to like do what the fuck you're supposed to be doing these

521
00:32:36.761 --> 00:32:39.780
Monday morning.
That's why you call it the Monday morning podcast.

522
00:32:39.781 --> 00:32:41.600
So when I come to work on Monday morning,

523
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.340
I have something to listen to rather than focusing on the fucking job that I

524
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:50.810
hate.
Well,
you're right,
landless.
I am late this week,
but you know what,

525
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:55.540
I was busy fucking busy this week.
Uh,
I,

526
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.740
I was doing shit this morning,
you know what I mean?

527
00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:02.360
And also not to mention I am filming this podcast for the first time ever.

528
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.870
I am allowing somebody else into the Monday morning podcast bunker until now.

529
00:33:09.351 --> 00:33:12.950
People just had to use their imagination to wonder what the fuck does bill look

530
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:17.780
like while he does this podcast?
Is he wearing a Tuxedo,

531
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.500
maybe a dinner jacket?
Is he sitting there?
You know,
I'm not,

532
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:25.940
I'm in pajamas in my t shirt with my little radio shack headphones on.

533
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.930
Does the exact way that you pictured me,
but I am filming at this week,
um,

534
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.070
because uh,

535
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:36.070
my DVD is a just about complete and now we are working on extras and I think I,

536
00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.550
my,
my last DVD I did the,
uh,
I did a little short history,

537
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.200
a bunch of clubs that I loved in New York.

538
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:45.680
So you kind of got that whole background and I figured out my mail do this.

539
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:47.090
Maybe I'll fill in the podcast,

540
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.860
edit out the hours and hours of unfunny moments,

541
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.680
right?
So you're going to actually hear the whole fucking podcast,

542
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:57.860
these idiots who bought my DVD who are going to watch it.
Just be like,
oh my God,

543
00:33:57.861 --> 00:34:00.920
this is the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen because of the wonderful world

544
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.740
of editing.
So he probably thinking like,
what are you doing bill?

545
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.820
You filming it yourself and you're going to edit it that,
that,
that does not,

546
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.450
that's not consistent with the more on that I'm used to listening to where

547
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.403
you're right.
I'm not,

548
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.270
I have the wonderfully talented Brian Spitz is a working the camera.

549
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.160
Yep.
That was him right there.

550
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:23.270
He actually shot my failed pilot last year on comedy central.
Remember that one?

551
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.740
That was fun and we got excited then we were like,
it's going to happen.
It,

552
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.930
it grew up with,
honestly,
it was a great fucking show,

553
00:34:29.931 --> 00:34:34.931
wasn't it pilots ever in the history and the history of failed pilots?

554
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:40.430
I would say we were.
Yeah,
we were,
we were in the,
you know,

555
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.960
we just failed as opposed to just a complete failure.
It'd be like,
you know,

556
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:48.710
have a patch.
Passing grade was 60,
I think.
I think we've got about 58 on that,

557
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.770
you know,
I don't know.
But you know what the weird thing is,

558
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:53.420
it's actually up on my end DB

559
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:56.250
<v 8>page.
That's what I love.
I don't know who put it up there,</v>

560
00:34:56.251 --> 00:35:01.170
but you're not supposed to put shit on there that isn't on TV or wasn't released

561
00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:04.950
in cinema or whatever.
And uh,
I,
for the life of me,

562
00:35:04.951 --> 00:35:08.520
I don't know how to take it down,
but um,
you'll take it care.
Okay,
thank you.

563
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.760
Because people,
all right,
well that's cool.
Can you actually,

564
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:15.840
can you actually call imdv okay.
Yeah,
but that's not a good,

565
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.150
I'm going to call those guys.
I'm going to call that website and uh,
yeah,

566
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.150
I'll get those guys on the phone to see what's up.
So yeah.

567
00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:23.130
So if you're ever wondering what the burn effect was,

568
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.320
that was just a working title that we gave it to him.

569
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.680
It never aired and it won't air and less.
I,
uh,

570
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.180
become hugely famous or infamous.
That's basically it.

571
00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:36.300
If I become a huge movie star or television star,

572
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.820
you'll probably up seeing it in some form.

573
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.890
Or if I go to a mall and I just started fucking,

574
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:47.940
you know,
killing puppies at the local pet store or whatever the fuck you do.

575
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:50.460
I wouldn't say shooting because every,
everybody's done the shooting thing,

576
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:51.294
isn't it

577
00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.840
<v 7>khaki at this point?
You know what I mean?
That's,
it's like,</v>

578
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:55.650
it's like if I was okay

579
00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.830
<v 8>comedian,
I went on on,
on stage and I started talking about airline food,</v>

580
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.970
basically going walking in to a mall massacring people,

581
00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.480
I think it's Hacky at this point,
you know,
Yawn.

582
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.710
If I can be so bold to say I'm fucking bored with that shit.
But anyways,

583
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.520
let's get to me and my big fucking week.
Do you guys have a big week?
Well,

584
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:17.910
if you didn't,
let me fucking tell you about my big week.
First of all,

585
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:20.870
I don't know if I've been talking about this on the podcast as I settle in

586
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.120
<v 7>Sofa.
Um,</v>

587
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:29.230
basically everything that identified me as the person that I am,

588
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.670
uh,
a month ago,
either it was expiring or I didn't have it.

589
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.180
You know,
I,

590
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.540
I basically could not prove that I existed with any sort of paper.

591
00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.200
You know,
my passport was expiring my driver's license.

592
00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:47.180
I needed to get that thing for about fucking two years.

593
00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:49.760
I'm not gonna lie to you when you first moved out to Los Angeles,

594
00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:51.590
I think they give you about six weeks to get it.

595
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.130
And I've almost been out here for three fucking years.
So,
uh,

596
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.230
and my New York license was expiring.

597
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.000
I didn't have a social security card that I could produce.

598
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.460
I had the number,
you know,

599
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.220
the Illuminati gave me a fucking number when I was eight years old.

600
00:37:07.221 --> 00:37:10.820
Let's get them on the wheel.
Let's get them on the wheel.
Let's get them in debt.

601
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:15.080
Are you in college?
Are you making 200 bucks a week?
Hey,
here's a visa card.

602
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.260
We'll give you a $3,000 limit.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

603
00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:21.890
Give us 25 bucks a week and just get it up to you three grand limit and we'll

604
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:25.580
fucking own your ass.
All right?
So I didn't have that.

605
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.930
What else didn't I have?
And My,
and my birth certificate,
I had nothing.

606
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:35.210
I had nothing.
So I was like a,
I was like,
fuck,
I gotta handle this shit.
You know?

607
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.700
Cause all of a sudden now I'm doing gigs in Europe,
you know,

608
00:37:37.701 --> 00:37:40.940
I think I'm going to Japan to perform for the troops.

609
00:37:40.941 --> 00:37:45.530
I need pieces of paper saying I am who I am and I have not done anything fucked

610
00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:49.310
up.
So a,
in one month I got my passport renewed,

611
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.220
I went down to the social security office,
I got that fucking thing,

612
00:37:52.221 --> 00:37:56.870
I found my birth certificate and the last thing I needed was my driver's
license.

613
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.340
So he figured out that driver's license,

614
00:37:58.341 --> 00:38:02.180
I mean that's a pain in the ass to take the fucking test.
You know,

615
00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.360
do you ever notice like what a pussy you become as an adult when it comes to

616
00:38:05.361 --> 00:38:09.200
tests?
Like I think once you don't take a test for what you're used to,

617
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.230
what as a kid,
people would always testing you.
You know,

618
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.750
we're having a spelling test,
run vocabulary tests,

619
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.440
some bully punches in the face.
He's testing you.
You know,

620
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.650
are you going to be a fucking man?
You know,

621
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:26.651
you Charles Bronson at age 12 or are you fucking a Richie Cunningham who I was

622
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.153
and got bullied

623
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.200
and sees no reason to go back to a fucking reunion now.
It wasn't that bad,

624
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:38.020
you know,
I'll be honest with you.
Uh,
when was it bad?
Maybe elementary school.

625
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:41.260
Beginning of middle school,
everybody hit their growth spurt and I didn't,

626
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:45.760
I still had a high pitch voice in a,
a an orange Afro.
That wasn't a good look.

627
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:50.050
That wasn't the look you wanted to rock is the youth says.
So anyways,

628
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:53.200
I have to take my driver's test out here.
And uh,

629
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.870
I brought it up with a couple of other La,

630
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.290
Los Angelenos and straight across the board,

631
00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:03.880
everybody was telling me like they had horror in their eyes and how difficult

632
00:39:03.881 --> 00:39:07.930
this fucking test was gone.
Oh my God,
dude,
dude,
it's dude,
it's fucking hot.

633
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.120
It's fucking hard.
They kept saying that.

634
00:39:10.121 --> 00:39:12.220
I remember I always lived out here 10 years ago.
I took the test.

635
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:14.920
It wasn't fucking hard,
like don't do it.
I'm telling you dude,

636
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:17.950
it was fucking heart.
And I had this girl with this party was this,

637
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.140
have you been to the DMV on here?
Oh my God.

638
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.320
It's not like the DMV anyway out la.

639
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.280
It's just like if on Dale and I kept saying,
well I bended the DMV.

640
00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.590
I've been doing it.
I know it's crowded.
And she just kept going now.

641
00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:34.010
Now like you don't understand and there's nothing worse than somebody just tells

642
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.050
you like you don't understand.

643
00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.560
It's like front somebody from Chicago when you're trying to tell them it was a

644
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:41.290
cold winter and then they got to go on about fucking now you don't know what

645
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:44.770
cold is until you're standing there rubbing your balls next to fucking Lake

646
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:49.300
Michigan.
You know,
like it's fucking minus 20 degrees in Boston.

647
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:52.910
But still,
that's,
you know,
my family all came from fucking the Midwest.

648
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.780
So anytime I had a paper,
when I bitch about the Colo,
let me tell you,

649
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:59.640
you don't know cold.
You don't go to Chicago.
Let me tell you,
go to Chicago.

650
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.050
You said they're all those fucking idiots.
Add some good barbecue.
I'll do,

651
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.260
do you don't know barbecue.
Go to fucking Texas.
That's where they got the bar.

652
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.460
Like,
like they're the only people who know that shit.
All right,

653
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.330
I've got a little upset there.
Don't hold it against me.
So anyways,
uh,

654
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.250
everybody's telling me I don't know what the fucking DMV is.

655
00:40:15.251 --> 00:40:16.084
You know all this does,

656
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:21.120
this just motivates me to pass this fucking test in the first time so I can just

657
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.060
make so I can justify me judging all these la Douche bags like that.

658
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:28.600
Just mentally weak fucking people.
So I started studying the test,

659
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:33.490
get the book and it's like 90 pages.
I was like,
fuck.
All right,
whatever.

660
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.510
Break it down.
I'm going to do 30 pages a day.
I outlined this book.

661
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.040
Huh?
What are you doing right now sitting in your cubicle instead of working,

662
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.810
looking at your spreadsheets,
what are you doing?

663
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.180
I hear what I fucking outline the book.

664
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:51.750
I outlined the book 30 pages at a fucking time meticulously like Tom Hanks in

665
00:40:52.361 --> 00:40:55.810
that movie when he was chasing Leonardo Dicaprio.
Catch me if you can.

666
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.830
I was like that,
that level of shit and I was,
I,

667
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.331
I just,
you know,

668
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:04.900
fucking broke the whole book down and then I sat there every day for 45 minutes

669
00:41:04.901 --> 00:41:09.220
to an hour and I went over all this shit in two days before the test.
Saturday.

670
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:14.200
I actually took the sections out than I than I still was having problem with and

671
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.150
I just fucking went hardcore on that section.

672
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.140
Memorize that and went through my all my outline.
I knew the whole fucking thing.

673
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.120
How you want to ask me some questions?

674
00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:24.010
You want to talk about parking near railroad tracks?

675
00:41:24.011 --> 00:41:26.530
I got to fucking answer for you.
Seven and a half feet.

676
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.610
If you're inside a seven and a half feet,
you're fucked.
18 inches from the curb,

677
00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.860
three feet from a fucking handicap ramp.

678
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.860
You know one of these fucking guys rolling by asking you for a quarter.

679
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.730
Those guys can't get and like three feet close to those guys.

680
00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.980
15 feet from a hydrated.

681
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.420
You've got to start signaling a hundred feet before you make a turn.

682
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.120
You get into the turning lane.
You can only drive in it for 200 feet.

683
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.590
He can't use it as a passing lane.
I had to shit down,
so I'm like,

684
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:54.650
fuck all these people.
I walked in there confident.
I'm talking Colby Bryan,

685
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.670
eight seconds left.
Give me the fucking ball.
All right.
I ironed my shirt.

686
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.750
I knew I was getting a picture of that day for my license to be nothing but

687
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:05.930
success.
So I walk in there,

688
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.350
I don't know what happened immediately I start getting fucking nervous.

689
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.290
You know like the first time I did Letterman,
right,

690
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.530
like the first fucking time you do anything.
I'm,
I'm fucking get nervous.

691
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:20.480
I've taken this fucker test four different times.
Took it in Boston,
passed it.

692
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.930
New York pastor came out of La 10 years ago.
I passed it,
moved back to New York,

693
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.560
passed the thing.
Why am I fucking nervous?
Cause he's fucking Las holes.

694
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.580
They have voices are in my head dear dude.
He fucking hot dude.
I fucking feel,

695
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.510
you know I forgot to mention is they all said the same shit.
Why?
Why they failed.

696
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.030
It is because they didn't study the first time because I thought it was going to

697
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:41.690
be easy cause they drive every day.
Do you really tell,

698
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:45.140
just think of how stupid that statement is.
Dude,
I drive every day.

699
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.070
I know how to do it.
It's those little things,

700
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:51.710
you know like what is a white curb mean?
You know,

701
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.810
you come up and it's painted white.
What does that mean?

702
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.220
Loading and unloading of passengers or picking up mail,
yellow curb.

703
00:42:58.221 --> 00:43:00.530
What does that mean?
Lie Loading and unloading of freight.

704
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.080
If you're not in a commercial vehicle,
the driver has to stay with the car.

705
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.020
I studied for the Shit me,
the Rock,

706
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.250
it's fucking going in and we're going to the next round of the playoffs.

707
00:43:10.251 --> 00:43:14.120
I was ready for that shit and I went in there and I,

708
00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.850
maybe there was just the overall anxiety,
the fucking place.

709
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.700
But I do the whole shit.
First of all I do,

710
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.650
what I always do at the DMV is I just blow off the line and I act like I didn't

711
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:28.040
see it and that I'm some sort of like,
you know,
royalty,

712
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.130
like I'm actually staying at the embassy for some fucking country you never

713
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:35.210
heard of.
I'm that guy.

714
00:43:35.211 --> 00:43:38.300
You know when you stand in line and you followed the rules and then you get up

715
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:42.200
to the fucking cashier lady and then there's that [inaudible] he was just

716
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:44.150
standing there to the side respectively.

717
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:45.980
Half an inch just behind your peripheral.

718
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:48.980
But you know he's there and you can't have a pause in your conversation because

719
00:43:48.981 --> 00:43:52.070
you know that asshole's going to jump in.
That's who the fuck I was.
And I said,

720
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:55.790
Hey,
I'm sorry buddy,
sorry.
And I wasn't sorry.
That was me really being like,
dude,

721
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:59.210
I'm interrupting you right now.
And I said,
ah,
I gotta take this,
uh,
you know,

722
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:02.690
I had a previous,
you know,
a schedule appointment,
where do I go?
They go,

723
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.380
you go around the corner,
whatever.
So thank the guy.
I wasn't saying thank you.

724
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.140
I don't know what the fuck I was doing is just trying to prevent the guy from

725
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:10.580
punching me in the face because I deserved it.

726
00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.680
And I went over to go take the fucking test and a,

727
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.630
I'm standing there and they only got like this walled off area.

728
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.200
Okay.
This is how confident was.
I didn't even,

729
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.520
I didn't even brush up out in the parking lot.
I was just like,

730
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:27.320
bring this shit on.
You want me to take Lebron?
I fucking got him.

731
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.630
Right.
So I walk in there right.

732
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.850
And you got to wait til like can only allow like five people in there at a time.

733
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:37.500
So the first dude walks out and uh,
you know,

734
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.260
they got the black dude behind the counter,
like the host scared straight.

735
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.170
You need to get your shit together,
kind of do,
you know,

736
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.000
and I'm just sitting there going,
oh fuck,
here we go.
Here we go.
This fucking guy,

737
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:51.340
this guy's breaking hearts all day and he doesn't even give a fuck.
Look at it.

738
00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.600
Look on his face.
He doesn't give a fuck that bill Parcells look on his face,

739
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:58.040
right?
So there's fucking Indian dude comes up and he,

740
00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.200
and he hands him the thing and the guy just fucking puts red all over it and the

741
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:05.670
guy fails.
And then I'm like,
oh,
fuck the any guy.
These guys are fucking smart,

742
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:09.450
right?
Indian guys are smart.
They fucking answer our phones over here.

743
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:12.330
I can't answer phones.
If somebody from India called me,
you know,

744
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:15.540
give myself a fake Indian name.
These fucking people are smart.

745
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.310
These people were running shit until the English fucked him over,
right?

746
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.190
This guy fucking pass.
But then I calmed myself down.
I'm like,
wait a minute,

747
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.670
this is a second language.
This is his second language.
If I went to France,

748
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:29.160
could I pass the driver's test?
Fuck No.
All right,

749
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.540
don't compare yourself to that guy.

750
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.150
And then the next year came up and it was a slacker.

751
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.700
This white kid who had like tight jeans yet,

752
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:38.730
they were hanging off his ass and I just wanted a boot him right in his fucking

753
00:45:38.731 --> 00:45:43.560
taint.
He passes.
So it gave me hope and I went in there,
I got the test,

754
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.450
okay,
I get eight hours sleep.
I took a deep breath and I'm like,

755
00:45:48.451 --> 00:45:51.210
here we go.
I have the test right in front of me.

756
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.710
And the first one was some bullshit about what is the legal alcohol level.

757
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.670
You know that you can drive on it.
I'm like,
this is a fucking joke.

758
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.800
I'm going to ace this test and dude,

759
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.860
I'm going to tell you right now after the first question,

760
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:09.000
it just went down fucking hill.
Listen to these questions.

761
00:46:09.001 --> 00:46:11.500
I'm studying all this shit about how close to park to a curve,

762
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.750
a curb and all that shit.
You must notify the DMV within five days.

763
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:20.130
If you sell or transfer your vehicle are cited for a traffic violation.
That's,

764
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.250
that's obviously no paint your vehicle a different color.

765
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.180
Sound like a fuck.
I didn't read that part.
I don't remember that part.

766
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:32.310
Sell a transfer your vehicle,
painted a different color.
Five days.

767
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:36.150
Sell a transfer your vehicle.
Don't you have to fucking tell them right then.

768
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:40.290
I won't.
They automatically know what the satellites,

769
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.700
they won't see that transaction.
Go down in the fucking driveway.
Do it.

770
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:49.200
And then this is panic just like,
and I,
and I,
and I was like,

771
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:50.280
oh my God,
what the fuck?

772
00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:54.060
And I got like six questions in and I literally put the number two pencil down

773
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.450
and I whispered,
yell.
I went really?

774
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.630
As I looked at the black dude when he wasn't looking at me,
of course,

775
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:03.660
totally passive aggressive and a do it.

776
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.680
I'm not gonna lie to you this fucking tests.
It was brutal.
It's a fucking brutal.

777
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:08.431
Like,
you know,

778
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:12.990
usually when you take a multiple choice tests it's like there's the obvious the

779
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:17.430
half,
right?
And then the fucking ridiculous.
Like when you drink a glass of water,

780
00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:20.070
should you a uh,

781
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.950
make sure you have enough air in your lungs

782
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.100
before sucking down the entire glass.
And if you do run out of air,
stop drinking,

783
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:34.210
inhale,
you know,
be smashed the glass against your head,
you know,

784
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:38.380
obvious shit,
right?
This shit was like,
when is it legal to use his cell phone?

785
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:43.240
I have the test right here without a hands free device while driving.
Okay.

786
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.930
When is it legal to use a cell phone without using a hands free device?

787
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.370
Have you got an answer?
A when making a call while stopped at a red light,

788
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.890
that's obviously no,
but here's the two close ones.

789
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.520
When making a call for emergency assistance or never,

790
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.280
when is it legal to use a cell phone?
Hands Free people,
hands free,

791
00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.110
hands,
free device.

792
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:09.460
And there's all this shit on TV going if you use your cell phone and it's as bad

793
00:48:09.461 --> 00:48:13.900
as fucking drinking and driving
in the book it said never.

794
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.330
And it said you could use it to for to make to make an emergency call after you

795
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:24.130
fucking pulled over and all that bullshit looked for somebody riding a bike,

796
00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.450
you know,
looking for an old guy,
one of those try sickles,
all of that shit.

797
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.750
So this just said when making a call for emergency assistance,

798
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:35.320
it didn't say you pulled over.
It didn't say you didn't pull over.

799
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:40.660
So I fucking panic than I wrote.
Never got it wrong.
All right,

800
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.110
this is still,
that's fucking stories taking 10 times as long.

801
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.070
And how long it took me to study for the fucking test.

802
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:50.020
Long story short out of 18 questions,
I got 15 right?

803
00:48:50.021 --> 00:48:50.770
Three wrong.

804
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:55.770
I fucking passed the test but I know I owe an apology to all you Los Angelenos.

805
00:48:56.801 --> 00:48:59.440
This was a hard ass fucking test.
It was difficult.

806
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.680
I know what you're thinking like that way you guys are all talking shit because

807
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.160
you're relaxed right now.
Right?
We find another difficult one here.

808
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.100
Highways are typically most slippery.

809
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.590
This is a desert question cause it doesn't rain out here.

810
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.370
And what happens is when it doesn't rain for awhile,
oil transmission,
fluid,

811
00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:19.510
fluid,
and gas all starts to coagulate.
And when it rains,
it's like,

812
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.340
I can't say it's like ice for God knows.
People drive like it out here.
But this,

813
00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.880
this is the question,
it says,
uh,
ah,
what the fuck was that?

814
00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:31.210
Highways are typically most slippery during a heavy rainstorm in the middle of,

815
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.140
in the middle of summer.
All right.
Middle of the summer.

816
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:39.350
It's fucking dry out.
You know,
maybe that's it.
And then it says when it's,

817
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.540
when it first starts to rain after a dry spell.
Well yeah,

818
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.080
yeah,
after a dry spell.
Absolutely.
But the summer's dry.
What the fuck writes?

819
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:53.860
And at this point,
my Mike fucking heart rate is going like 9,000 beats a second.

820
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.800
And then it says after it's been raining for a long time,

821
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.770
if it's been raining for a long time,
the roads are wet.

822
00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:01.450
It's going to still be fucking slippery.

823
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.910
But I know it has to do with it being dry out here.

824
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.510
So I fucking broke that one down.
I'm like,
all right,
it's the middle of summer.

825
00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.570
It's a heavy fucking rainstorm.

826
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.460
Who's to say it didn't fucking rain heavily the day before and had already

827
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:17.130
washed all the gas off.
So then I get,

828
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.560
so I guessed when it first starts to rain after a dry spell and I was fucking

829
00:50:20.561 --> 00:50:24.160
right,
but that's the level you had to break this shit down.
All right,

830
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:28.580
so I passed.
That's it.
They took my thumbprint,
the fucking Illuminati,

831
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.330
<v 8>you know,
sent that right to the Rothschild's fucking house.</v>

832
00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.330
Do you know those sons of bitches actually have the audacity,

833
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:39.740
the Rothschilds to have a book about the giant fucking house they bought in

834
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:44.240
England off of all their fucking Shylock money from the rest of us.

835
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:46.610
Do you believe you believe the fucking balls of that?

836
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:51.230
Evidently there's something beyond your mansion.
It's called a manner.

837
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.570
That's when you have you,

838
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.010
that's when you do take like fucking 12 mansions and you put it together and

839
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:00.710
like people don't even know how to get to your house.

840
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.010
Like I can guarantee you something right fucking now.
Oh,

841
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:07.400
this is a great way to see if they're running shit.
You don't,

842
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.520
when you Google maps,
like if you Google map where the fuck I live,

843
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.620
not only can you see my place,
they'll probably,

844
00:51:12.621 --> 00:51:14.870
you can probably see my brand new social security card.

845
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:18.590
No one gives a fuck about me.
But if you Google map the Rothschild's house,

846
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.070
I guarantee you it doesn't fucking show up like the Goddamn White House

847
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:25.010
because they're running shit and you know what?

848
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.750
They have my thumbprint on their fucking wall of the,

849
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.300
of their fucking nine mile wine cellar.
Does that make any sense?

850
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:34.830
Well it shouldn't because I don't read.
All right,

851
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:40.190
I'll fucking read anyways.
What else do I got going on here?

852
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.550
That wasn't bad.
Half for being filmed.
I didn't seem too self conscious.

853
00:51:43.551 --> 00:51:47.030
Look at that.
Got a big nod.
Eyebrows up.
I think it's going good.

854
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.990
The first filmed Monday morning podcast.
This is what I do.

855
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.090
If you've been listening to this,
I'm talking to the camera right now,

856
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:54.590
not to you go back to work.

857
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:57.350
He'd been fucking off already for 19 minutes and 40 seconds.

858
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.410
This is what I do every week.
I sit here in my,
in my,

859
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.300
in my pajamas and my little footlocker tee shirt,
you know,
is this footlocker?

860
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.070
I don't know what the fuck this is.
Footlocker,

861
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.640
like 87 t shirts for like $9.

862
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.660
If you ever wondered if you ever wondered,
hey,

863
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:19.520
did a three year old put this shirt together or was the person at least 16 you

864
00:52:19.521 --> 00:52:22.550
can never be more sure than when you go to footlocker and you buy those fucking

865
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.700
tee shirts.
When you get like nine of them for eight bucks,

866
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:30.200
that's guaranteed that that's not even child.
That's like toddler,
toddler,

867
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:33.380
fucking labor.
Be funnier if I could fucking say it.

868
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:35.990
So this is what I do every week.
Okay.
This is what I do.

869
00:52:35.991 --> 00:52:37.460
So if you want to listen to the podcast,

870
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.040
go to [inaudible] dot com click on Monday morning podcast.

871
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.600
You hate your fucking job.
Hopefully there'll be on iTunes at this point.

872
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.200
They will be,
I'm going to talk shit,
they're going to be on iTunes.
You know,

873
00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:51.070
I have like 14 listeners.
I'm trying to get it up to 15 whenever they,

874
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.860
whatever the fuck you want from me.
All right,
let's play it.
Okay,
I'm back.

875
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.660
I'm back doing the podcast.
Um,
all right,
let's get to the stories this week.
I,

876
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.020
uh,
that was the first story.
I'm just going to tell some stories this week.

877
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.420
I've got another one for you.
I'm at this point.

878
00:53:05.421 --> 00:53:08.570
Do you want me to pause Brian and go into another room to give people something

879
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:12.050
visually different to look at?
Should I do that?
All right.

880
00:53:12.051 --> 00:53:15.410
Let's try to hit pause here.
This is going to be really quick for you.

881
00:53:15.411 --> 00:53:18.350
People listening at home and say,
I'm going to pause and then we're back.

882
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.210
So I'm pausing right now.
All right.
Yeah,

883
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.070
we'll put bookshelves in there.
Okay.
We're back.
We're back.
We decided,

884
00:53:26.071 --> 00:53:28.770
you know what?
We already tried to do this and I fucking lost the whole podcast,

885
00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:31.590
so we're not doing it.
I'm recording right now.

886
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.450
We're just do you don't need to record this.
You don't even see me.

887
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:34.740
I'm not going to use this on the DVD.

888
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.250
This is just for the poor bastards at home listening.
I actually,

889
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:41.910
so that's my deal,
everybody.
I'm moving shit around my apartment right now.

890
00:53:41.911 --> 00:53:42.900
This is exciting.

891
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:48.330
It's exciting to audit in an audio way to hear the it isn't.
I know it's not,

892
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.370
dude.
You know what?
Is there any doctors that listen to this?

893
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:51.990
How fucking arrogant is that?

894
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.340
Like they have time between surgery to listen to a moron like me.
Well,

895
00:53:56.341 --> 00:53:59.220
a lot of doctors are arrogant anyways.
They save people's lives.

896
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:03.210
They get that God complex.
Just to let you know,
dude,
that's my water.
All right,

897
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:05.340
that's yours over there.
Okay.
Just letting you know.
I mean,

898
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:08.280
I like you when everything,
all right.
You did a great job on the pilot,
but let's,

899
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:12.570
let's keep it there.
Um,
I fucked up the arch of my foot.

900
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:16.650
I did it years ago from playing drums,

901
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:21.000
trying to get my foot as fast as John Bonham's having no fucking technique and

902
00:54:21.001 --> 00:54:25.590
not having stretched so that that tendon that runs from the ball of your fucking

903
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:29.750
foot to your heel.
Every once in awhile I fuck it up and it,

904
00:54:29.751 --> 00:54:33.780
and it just takes forever to heal and I don't know what I'm supposed to do about

905
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:36.810
it.
All right,
I stretch.

906
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.150
I got the tennis ball rubbing underneath it.

907
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.980
I know I'm not supposed to walk around,
but that's what I do.
Okay.

908
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.420
I use my feet.
A lot of people don't,
you know,

909
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:51.120
if you walk into a Mcdonald's and you see those people,

910
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:56.130
that's what they use their feet for to walk to their car to sit in their car and

911
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:59.040
then they don't even go in anymore.
They just drive right up.

912
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.530
So I want to know what else can I be doing?

913
00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:04.560
Is there any sort of aspirin that I can be taking to get the fucking

914
00:55:04.561 --> 00:55:07.820
inflammation down?
And you probably want it.
Okay.
You're,

915
00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:12.180
you're probably asking me this bill because not being able to use your foot is

916
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:15.900
fucking annoying.
It goes beyond that.
Dr.
So,

917
00:55:15.901 --> 00:55:18.930
and so I'll tell you what my problem is.

918
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.490
My problem is I'm going back east for,

919
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:27.420
for a friend of mine's daughter is graduating college and I have to go to the

920
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:31.090
graduation and uh,
I'm getting it,

921
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.450
getting together with some people I used to play drums with.

922
00:55:33.451 --> 00:55:36.180
We used to jam with back in the day when we all thought we were going to get on

923
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:38.490
MTV and be the latest hair metal band,

924
00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.690
the fact that you had a redhead and a hair metal band and then he could only

925
00:55:45.691 --> 00:55:48.150
grow a fucking Afro right there,

926
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.210
should've let you know that you weren't gonna make it.
So long story short,

927
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.980
we're getting together and rather than going back and playing the music we

928
00:55:55.981 --> 00:56:00.090
played in the 80s because that would just be too sad to go back and play my

929
00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:05.130
Michelle
or whatever the fuck we used to play.
We're like,

930
00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:06.510
let's do something more contemporary.

931
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:10.410
And I've always played single bass drum and I became a huge fan of Pantera and

932
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:11.041
shit.
So I go,

933
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:14.670
let's do cowboys from hell and it's got this insane double bass part.

934
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.260
And the second I said that Shit,

935
00:56:16.261 --> 00:56:18.480
I fucked up my foot and I haven't been able to practice.

936
00:56:18.481 --> 00:56:22.950
And meanwhile the guitar player,
the Bass Player,
they're all shredding,
you know,

937
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.930
ignoring their children.
So,

938
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:29.350
and here I am going to be the foundation of the band and my foot's fucked up.

939
00:56:29.351 --> 00:56:33.730
So I need a quick remedy.
All right.
I need something.

940
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:36.220
I need something fucking quickly here.
Uh,
that,

941
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.940
is there anything that I can take that,
that will just,
you know,

942
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:44.200
I don't want to take roids for my foot coming there with my right foot twice as

943
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.500
big as the,
uh,
my left foot.
You know,
I don't need that.

944
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.210
Have one big Jason Gme,

945
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:52.120
Roger Clemens Foot and the other one's walking around like Willie McGee.

946
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:55.870
I don't need that shit.
All right,
tell me,
what do I take aspirin?

947
00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:01.030
Aleve.
What do I take?
Come on podcast fucking free.

948
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.280
You can hook me up a little free medical advice.

949
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:08.680
Can you email me a prescription or that just literally,
and you're,

950
00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.810
you're fucking days as a doctor.
All right,
let's,

951
00:57:10.811 --> 00:57:12.490
let's continue on with the podcast.

952
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:17.620
As I sit here rolling a tennis ball underneath my foot.
Um,
the next thing,
oh,

953
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:19.570
here's a great story for you,
Brian.
You might like this.

954
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:22.900
Do you know I was a hero this week?
I was actually,

955
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.410
I did something heroic.
I have never,

956
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:31.300
I have never done anything heroic in my life.
Okay.

957
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.200
And believe me,

958
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.550
I've walked by house fires and saw people screaming saying there's a ladder

959
00:57:36.551 --> 00:57:39.820
right there.
Just put it up.
And I walked away.
I walked away,

960
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.840
sounded like I didn't hear him.
I'm that kind of a fucking guy.
Um,
no,

961
00:57:43.841 --> 00:57:48.400
this is the deal.
It was a Sunday.
And you know people go to Brunch on Sunday.

962
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:52.240
I'm like,
all right,
fuck it.
I'll go to brunch.
I'll go to brunch.
Right?

963
00:57:52.241 --> 00:57:56.950
Remember that bit?
Huh?
Paid $18 as fast as the Wa.
Is that a specialist?

964
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.730
How did that bit go?
Is that as,
I thought it was pastel.
It's asparagus.

965
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:04.960
I can't remember.
So we go to brunch and a,
you know it's usual shit.

966
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:07.870
Do you want to sit inside?
You want to sit out outside as a redhead?

967
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:11.920
I'm always going inside.
Let's fucking sit inside.
I got enough freckles.

968
00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.740
I've had enough fucking pain in my life.
Please.

969
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.270
Let's sit inside a,

970
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.380
but you know I'm always with brides cause they always want to go to brunch.

971
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:25.030
Oh it's fine.
It's too nice.
It's always fucking nice when they go to brunch.

972
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:28.120
It's never raining,
is it?
Right?
So.
All right,
let's sit outside.

973
00:58:28.121 --> 00:58:31.780
So we sit outside and because I'm the gentleman,

974
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.740
I have to sit with my back to the road so I can brace,
you know,

975
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:39.040
and protect my girlfriend and her mom in case a bread truck comes flying in

976
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.020
because the guys text messaging or something,
right?

977
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:44.910
So I'm sitting there and uh,

978
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.960
all of a sudden I just feel it.

979
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.980
I just feel like something's fucking wrong and something my caveman DNA,

980
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.740
like when you getting stocked by a saber tooth,

981
00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:57.370
tiger just kicks in and something just tells me to fucking look left.

982
00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:02.430
And I look left and here comes this crazy fucking lady and I'm talking crazy.

983
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:06.520
I'm talking shutter island.

984
00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:10.600
You remember that chick that shushed Leonardo Dicaprio set the second Leonardo

985
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.070
Dicaprio fucking reference.
There you go.

986
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.560
You remember that chick who shushed him and shutter island?

987
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:19.660
That's what this girl looked like,
except with sort of brownish red hair.
Okay?

988
00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:23.900
It's basically one of these people who should be getting professional help is

989
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:28.820
straight up bat shit crazy.
And uh,
this just,
this state is bankrupt.

990
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:32.870
So they just let them go.
They just let these fucking people go.

991
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.040
You're not see Sarah McLaughlin wine and about these people come out and rescue

992
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:40.430
these fucking,
these people who are talking to telephone poles.

993
00:59:40.431 --> 00:59:43.940
It's all about the dogs with her.
Her priorities are so fucked up.

994
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.460
It's ridiculous.
I hope she sees this.

995
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:50.330
I am so disappointed in you Sarah McLaughlin.
Huh?

996
00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.200
When are you going to grow up and stop whining about those little pussy ass

997
00:59:54.201 --> 00:59:58.760
fucking dogs?
All right.
That was mean.
All right,
let's get back to it.

998
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.590
So she starts coming down the street and she's like,

999
01:00:00.591 --> 01:00:04.340
she looks like she's going to start fucking crying.
Okay.
Like,

1000
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:05.810
and it's just one of those things,
you know,

1001
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.110
you just feel this fucking person's going to do something and I have a feeling

1002
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.520
they're going to do it to me.
So I,
I'm,
I'm working out my shit.
I'm like first,

1003
01:00:13.521 --> 01:00:17.900
fortunately the chairs where these really late wicker sorta kind of Douchey

1004
01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:18.733
Brunchy chairs.

1005
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.190
So I was just going to grab the fucking chair and I was going to smash her in

1006
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:26.720
the face if I didn't have time or if I had time I was going to leap to my feet

1007
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:31.520
on my bad fucking foot and out like a lion tamer.
Ah,
get back.
Crazy person,

1008
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:32.383
right.

1009
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.880
Start whipping her with the fucking tulips on the Nice,
beautiful brunch table.

1010
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.880
That's what I was going to do.
So she doesn't lunge at me,

1011
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:43.760
but she walks by me and is that awful moment,
the blind spot,

1012
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:47.690
you know what I mean?
Where she's not to my left,
she's not to my right.

1013
01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:50.240
She's right behind me and she fucking goes by me and I'm like,
thank God.

1014
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:55.241
Like I was seriously fucking nervous and I look left again just to,

1015
01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.550
you know,
I don't know why I looked left again.

1016
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:03.551
And then I see this fucking sad looking woman slowly following the crazy person

1017
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.930
with this look on her face like she had been wronged.
I,
next thing I know.

1018
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.670
Next thing I fucking know,

1019
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.300
she's talking to the table next to us and talking to us,

1020
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:17.180
talking about how that crazy woman had just walked up to her,

1021
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.020
reached up to her sweater and just fucking ripped.

1022
01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:24.020
I don't know.
She had a brooch.

1023
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:28.070
She just fucking took it off her chest and walked away with it.

1024
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:33.080
And I'm looking at the lady and she has the lady and she has this fucking hole

1025
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.260
in her sweater where something had clearly been ripped off.

1026
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.760
And for the life of me,

1027
01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.900
I don't know why I immediately just got up.

1028
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.920
I don't know why.
I have no fucking idea why I do what the fuck.

1029
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:47.000
I don't do this shit.

1030
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.660
I get up and now I'm going down the street following the shutter island lady

1031
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.360
with no training whatsoever in this situation.

1032
01:01:56.361 --> 01:02:00.710
I'm literally walking and now I couldn't sit down.
I couldn't get sit down.
Like,

1033
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:03.870
I have this,
this fucking Lee Marvin,
I'm gonna,

1034
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:07.010
I'm gonna make shit right moment.
And then I go,
you know what?

1035
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:08.870
Maybe I'll sit down and look at the biggest pussy ever.

1036
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.710
And not only my girlfriend and my mother's there,
so I had to keep going.

1037
01:02:12.711 --> 01:02:15.440
So now I'm following this girl and I'm literally,

1038
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.250
I'm fine.

1039
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:21.300
Never been so fucking nervous in my life because it would have been bad enough

1040
01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:25.950
if we,
if it was like a crazy dude.
A crazy guy is scary,
but at least you know if,

1041
01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.510
if,
if it gets physical,
I mean,
what?
What are,
what are the rules in that?

1042
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:32.700
Do you know Brian?

1043
01:02:32.701 --> 01:02:36.390
What did you know you can't hit a woman bought if she's crazy and she just stole

1044
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.950
approach.
How about a jab?
It's going to get a mitt and a face like Larry Holmes.

1045
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:45.750
So she doesn't see the overhand,
right.
Anyways,
I don't know what to do,

1046
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:46.590
so,

1047
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.860
but I can't go back to the table or I'm going to look like a bitch in front of

1048
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:53.550
my girlfriend and my mom saw,
I'm like,
fuck,
why did I get up?
Why did I get up?

1049
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:57.390
Why didn't I do?
Why didn't I say sit inside?
I wanted to sit inside,

1050
01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:00.540
but I didn't want to seem like a root prick in front of my girlfriend's mom.

1051
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:02.490
Like I tell her what to do.
Like she says,

1052
01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.190
kept fucking woman sit down in this situation.

1053
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:08.820
So I'm walking down the street and this is what I do.
She's on the sidewalk.

1054
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:12.120
I'm literally in the street.
Okay.
I'm like,

1055
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.340
is that circumnavigation I'm doing some police shit where I'm staying outside of

1056
01:03:17.341 --> 01:03:19.740
whatever she can throw at me scratching.
It's one of these people,

1057
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.950
you've got to get like a tetanus shot if you roll around the ground or hepatitis

1058
01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:26.070
assumption.
So I'm like,
what am I going to do?
What do I do?

1059
01:03:26.071 --> 01:03:30.270
So I don't know what happened.
I just said I,
I basically,

1060
01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:34.350
I just started going,
hey,
uh,
hey sweetheart.
Hey Sweetie.

1061
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.800
I basically,
I think I started calling her affectionate name,

1062
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
some like the 1940s hey,
a fucking tall drink of water.

1063
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:46.710
And I finally got her attention and she turns around and looks at me with this

1064
01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:50.470
crazy look with tears in her eyes.
And I just say,
ah,

1065
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:54.570
I think you have something that doesn't belong to you.
And meanwhile,

1066
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.840
it's fucking pathetic lady who just let her walk up to her to begin with.

1067
01:03:57.841 --> 01:04:00.660
It's like he didn't see that she was crazy.
That's why I'm in this situation.

1068
01:04:00.661 --> 01:04:02.160
Right.
She fucking,

1069
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.060
she ends up walking up to the girl and when I said,

1070
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.410
I think you have something that doesn't belong to you,

1071
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:09.390
she just sort of looked at me and like in slow motion,

1072
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.540
lifted up her left arm and she had this green pea soup look and sweater on and

1073
01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:19.050
she had the brooch pin to like just right around her wrist and she just held it

1074
01:04:19.051 --> 01:04:22.890
up.
So at this point I'm like,
I'm not touching this bitch.

1075
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:30.990
So I let the,
the,
the fucking victim lady with the sad puppy dog eyes,

1076
01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.140
she comes in and I'm basically sitting there like an NHL ref with respect for

1077
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:39.600
two goons that are about ready to go at it.
Right.

1078
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:44.520
And I'm just going to jump in when I see that I can jump into,
stop this,

1079
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:49.350
this fight that's going to happen without getting hit myself.
And uh,
so anyways,

1080
01:04:49.351 --> 01:04:53.100
the lady starts UNP unpinning the brooch and the whole time she's,

1081
01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:56.760
she basically followed my lead by being nice.
She just kept going.
Thank you.

1082
01:04:56.761 --> 01:04:59.220
I really appreciate it.
I really appreciate this.

1083
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:00.930
And she couldn't get the fucking thing off.

1084
01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:03.750
It was like one of those action movies with like the clock's going down for the

1085
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.420
bomb and I'm sitting there going lady and my head,
I'm like,

1086
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.870
would you get that fucking brooch off this crazy bitches arm?

1087
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:13.350
And I just kept looking at her right hand cause I knew at some point she was

1088
01:05:13.351 --> 01:05:16.590
either going to gouge your eye out,
just do some crazy shit,
right?

1089
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.060
Like you know that the scrap metal that these people put pickup and floss their

1090
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:25.150
teeth,
which she was just going to stick it right in the juggler.
So finally,

1091
01:05:25.151 --> 01:05:29.620
long story short,
she gets the fucking broach off and then we,
we,
we,
we back away

1092
01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.920
who's like,
ah,
exchange.

1093
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:36.400
Like we like we gave some money briefcase and we got to the abducted kid back

1094
01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:39.790
and we fucking walk away.
And I'm like,
Oh fuck.
Thank God.

1095
01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.640
Thank God that worked out and actually walked back to the,
to the brunch.

1096
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.823
All right.

1097
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.610
Walk back to the brunch and I got a fucking applause break from like all these

1098
01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.940
people eating eggs benedict and eggs Florentine.
It was fucking awesome.

1099
01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.730
How was a Goddamn hero this week?
People,
uh,
scared.

1100
01:05:57.731 --> 01:06:01.090
Nervous fucking dude.
I'll tell you Brian,

1101
01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:05.710
I didn't come within seven feet of this woman.
I was literally,
you know,
you know,

1102
01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:07.680
fucking ah,
the avenue out there and I can say where,

1103
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.790
cause I don't need psychos known where the fuck I live.
You know,

1104
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.420
like I'm anywhere near that level of notoriety.
Uh,

1105
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.890
I was literally fucking like,

1106
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:17.220
she's where that wall is over there and we're going,
hey sweetie,

1107
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.310
to people who didn't know what was going on,

1108
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.980
they probably thought some construction worker hitting on her look in the

1109
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:29.350
fucking games on there.
So,
uh,
yeah,
that was my week.

1110
01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.210
That was my weak people.
I got my past,

1111
01:06:31.211 --> 01:06:35.800
my fucking driver's test and I was a goddamn hero.
Huh?

1112
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.930
What did you do this week?
You know what that reminds me of?

1113
01:06:37.931 --> 01:06:39.940
What was that Shit he action movie that ended that way.

1114
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.350
That started that amazing [inaudible] bitch.
That fucking,
uh,
uh,

1115
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.060
it's let's to say Brian Johnson.
Brad Pitt's dating.
What's her name?

1116
01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.470
Natasha wrote Robin Linskey.
She got one of those.
I'm a hot girl names.

1117
01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.350
What's her name?
Angelina.

1118
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.180
You ever seen a fucking ugly girl named Angelina?
Natasha.
Brooke.

1119
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.830
That's like a hell of a gamble.
You just know your daughter is,

1120
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:07.450
is his fucking is going to be hot.
Right?
And she's going to go for the money.

1121
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.640
She's going for the gold.
So,
uh,
yeah.
What,

1122
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:15.490
what was that movie she did where she was the assassin and the whole movie was

1123
01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:18.550
kind of okay.
And then the movie ends with Blah,
blah,
blah,
and then it ends.

1124
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:22.930
He goes,
what the fuck did you do today?
Yeah,
no,
no,
not Mrs Mrs. Smith,

1125
01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:25.640
who was the one after that?
Morgan Freeman was in it and they stayed,

1126
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.780
shoot the gun in the fucking bullet would,
would go,
oh,

1127
01:07:28.781 --> 01:07:31.090
this is driving everybody on the podcast and nuts because they know the name of

1128
01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:35.070
it.
Well,
the movie basically ends.
He goes,
what the fuck did you do today?
I mean,

1129
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:39.920
did he got pissed?
Hi,
watched a mediocre movie.
Did I say meteoric?
Mediocre?

1130
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.480
All right,
whatever.
Go fuck yourselves.
Okay.
This is a what,

1131
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:46.630
35 minutes in 35 minutes.
And this is going to be,
like I said,

1132
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:49.690
it's gonna be a DVD extra.
And if you're watching this,

1133
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.040
I probably should've said this earlier.

1134
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.420
Maybe we'll do it in the wraparounds now to talk shop.
I was going to say,

1135
01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:00.400
where the fuck you can go see this,
get this podcast.
Um,
but here's something new.

1136
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.410
For some of you who've actually found my podcast,
which I love at this point,

1137
01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:05.620
to actually find my podcast.
It's like a fucking test,

1138
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.750
really weeding out the computer illiterate of which I probably couldn't even

1139
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:15.740
find my own podcast unless I,
uh,
if I didn't do it anyways,
we have a new page.

1140
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:21.200
Uh,
it's,
it's
www.themmpodcast.com

1141
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:27.643
www.capitallettersmmpandthenalllowercasepodcast.com.
Uh,

1142
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.310
I explained that bad the MMP or all capital letters.
All right,
fuck you.

1143
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:36.020
www.themlmpodcast.com.
Go there.
Um,

1144
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.510
I definitely think there'll be some pictures of Leonardo Dicaprio.

1145
01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:41.510
I make references to shit.
Sometimes Times people don't know what it is.

1146
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.270
The movie that I couldn't remember the name of,
of it's driving you nuts.

1147
01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:49.570
That'll be up there.
Uh,
and whatever else I fucking talked about.
And there's,

1148
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.270
there's youtube videos and all that type of shit,
um,

1149
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.980
of which this week.
You know what?
I don't have any youtube videos.

1150
01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.790
I've got to admit I was hardcore studying for this impossibly difficult,
um,

1151
01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.030
test.
What else do I got?

1152
01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.410
You want me to move again so we can have something different?

1153
01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.140
Where else would I go?
I went from the,
the,
the,
the,

1154
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:14.120
the Sofa where I was going to go into another room,
but I'm so paranoid.

1155
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:18.470
Then I'm gonna uh,
I got to stand up here for a second.
Maybe I'll be,

1156
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:21.080
I'll be standing up here.
Can you get that?
Can you get that with the camera?

1157
01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.490
Is this interesting to you people at all?
Oh,
here's one for you.

1158
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.800
The conspiracy theory.
Somebody sent me something from,
uh,
from England.

1159
01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:32.240
All right,

1160
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.920
cause the 14 listeners of my podcast of I'm going in or national with my failure

1161
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.870
,
um,

1162
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.610
we're saying that in England they're actually experimenting with,
um,

1163
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.600
using satellite to catch speeders satellite technology to catch speeders.

1164
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.860
Can you fucking believe that?
Somewhere in the middle of that,

1165
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.560
I just lost all outrage.
I knew I was fucking pissed.

1166
01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:01.170
I stood up and I just realized I was really hungry.
That's so,

1167
01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.680
that's one of those things that you gotta understand when you're starving to

1168
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:06.560
death.
If you sit down,
it doesn't feel as bad.
You know,

1169
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.250
if you ever watched those things when Sally Struthers back in the day you spend

1170
01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:10.910
next to those starving kids and what would you see?

1171
01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:14.350
They are always sitting down or laying down and you think it's because they're

1172
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:18.050
weak.
It isn't.
They could stand up if they wanted to,
but you just feel hungry.

1173
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.670
There's something about your pancreas sort of fills up that spot.

1174
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:27.080
I'll fuck you.
I know.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
Um,
all right,

1175
01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:29.480
let's get back to conspiracy theories.
Here's a conspiracy theory.

1176
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:30.770
Somebody sent me this week,

1177
01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:34.430
somebody sent me this this week as I put my podcast in my lap,

1178
01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.920
low level of radiation going into my nuts right now,
know what they should start.

1179
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:42.140
They should make the bottom and like give you some sort of optional lead suit

1180
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:43.970
with these things.
You know?

1181
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:46.610
I think that would be a great thing of Billy Mills was still alive.

1182
01:10:46.611 --> 01:10:50.600
If you could make like some sort of cell phone led helmet that comes in like

1183
01:10:50.601 --> 01:10:53.470
three different colors,
a manly color color,

1184
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.610
a a womanly color,

1185
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:59.690
and then a pattern.
There you go.

1186
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:03.710
And then when it becomes huge,
then you start putting sport logos on it.

1187
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.300
Then they do that with the snuggie.

1188
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:09.800
Then you could get like a redskin snuggie for all those people who get cold

1189
01:11:09.801 --> 01:11:14.360
while watching football.
Dude,

1190
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.031
I'm telling you,
man,

1191
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:17.220
that's how I'm going to parachute out of this fucking business.

1192
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:20.460
I got to come up with some bullshit and just,
you know,

1193
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.710
I scream all the time when I do my jokes.
I don't know how to,

1194
01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:25.950
I don't know if you ever notice his prime,
but I don't know how to write a joke.

1195
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:30.720
So when I do is I say fuck a lot and I just scream it,
you know,
and then the,

1196
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:33.810
the reverb of me yelling,
you can't hear that.
There was no laughter afterwards.

1197
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:35.410
So I already know how to do the Billy Mays thing.

1198
01:11:35.411 --> 01:11:37.260
So all we can do is just come up with some hunk of shit.

1199
01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:40.730
<v 7>All people,
all people.
That's where you got to go.</v>

1200
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.990
<v 8>Do you ever go into the,
I'm going to kill me.</v>

1201
01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:46.620
When I went to fucking Dwayne Reed one time and I saw that booster chair for the

1202
01:11:46.621 --> 01:11:48.240
toilet seat,
I was just like,

1203
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.450
<v 7>fuck,
that's brilliant.
Yeah.</v>

1204
01:11:52.451 --> 01:11:54.940
20 million later that said,
people,

1205
01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:58.780
you start in a booster chair and you ended a booster chair.
If you're lucky,

1206
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:00.700
if you don't end in a booster chair,

1207
01:12:00.701 --> 01:12:03.460
that means you got hit by a bus and what would you rather do?

1208
01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.141
Here's a question for you.

1209
01:12:05.141 --> 01:12:09.610
Would you rather get hit by a bus at 42 bang and some of the hot ass hardest ass

1210
01:12:09.611 --> 01:12:12.190
on the planet,
you know,

1211
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.260
or would you rather live to be 70 booster chair in the toilet?

1212
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:20.350
You know,
I've talked about this before,
right?

1213
01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.750
Your old balls hanging in the toilet water.

1214
01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:28.330
That's why they have the booster chairs.
So you're nuts on hit the water.

1215
01:12:28.331 --> 01:12:29.830
Oh my God.
Is it the eighties again?

1216
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.820
<v 9>So do one fucking boots to cheers.</v>

1217
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:37.760
<v 7>Um,
yeah,
this is the podcast.
Let's get onto the next thing.
Uh,
all right.</v>

1218
01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:41.330
That was me giving you a little button there.
This is the podcast and we're out.

1219
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:45.650
All right.
Conspiracy the week.
Bill,
you often talk about conspiracies.
Yes,
I do.

1220
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:50.300
Um,
this may or may not fall into that category,
but it definitely pisses me off.

1221
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:53.300
I love this guy already.
I don't know if this is a conspiracy,

1222
01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:56.780
but if fucking pisses me off.
Eyeball the eyeball with you so far,
buddy.

1223
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.800
All right.

1224
01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.800
I get my cable and Internet service bundled together from Time Warner last month

1225
01:13:03.201 --> 01:13:04.100
with my bill.

1226
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:09.430
I got an a in insert stating that they were modifying their privacy policy.

1227
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:15.050
Basically it states time Warner reserves the right to distribute my internet

1228
01:13:15.051 --> 01:13:18.290
content with or without my consent.

1229
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.150
From my understanding,

1230
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:24.020
this could mean anything from the searches I requested from Google to the

1231
01:13:24.021 --> 01:13:28.100
websites I have been to what rights do we have in this country anymore?

1232
01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.430
Just venting.
All right dude.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1233
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:34.700
Basically what they've been doing

1234
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:40.270
<v 8>entire fucking time since the beginning of the Internet is now becoming legal.</v>

1235
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.790
So for all you people out there who always thought like,
uh,

1236
01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.510
like I love when you watch like those,
those talk shows and they talk about,
um,

1237
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.710
<v 7>sexting.
Like you're,
you're,
you're text messaging,
you know,</v>

1238
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.440
<v 8>I want to fuck you from behind or whatever.
Why that sexy?
I have no idea,</v>

1239
01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.050
you know,
do you think their thumbs tremble but whatever,

1240
01:14:00.051 --> 01:14:02.010
I'm not going to judge or like they,

1241
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.380
they talk about Skype sex and there'll be like,
why do these people do this?

1242
01:14:06.381 --> 01:14:10.310
Why would somebody who had never done,
they always bring a psychologists on,

1243
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:13.660
right?
They always have a beard.
So you know that they majored in psychology,

1244
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:16.480
right?
And then they go,

1245
01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:21.010
they always say the same shit and there'll be just like,
well,
it's the,
uh,

1246
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.220
anonymity of it.
They,
they,
they feel anonymous.
And in that situation,
they,

1247
01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:29.320
they,
they,
they,
they do things that they normally wouldn't done.
Well,

1248
01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.700
first of all,
people,
it's not anonymous.
You dumb fucks.
It isn't,

1249
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:36.550
they just saying it's anonymous.
They just sent it.

1250
01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:38.470
We don't think that they're building a file on you.

1251
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:44.220
So all these fucking morons who've lived the life of the straight and narrow get

1252
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:48.640
on Skype and they stick their junk right in the camera.
You're an idiot.

1253
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.960
You're done.
You're already done.
Because they,
they're,

1254
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:55.540
they're building robots right now to re to fucking replace all of us.

1255
01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.650
And what did you then,

1256
01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.380
but they're going to keep some of us because somebody got an oil,

1257
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.100
they're fucking robot joints.
And what did you do?

1258
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.550
You stuck your Dick in the camera yet you processed,
it's over.

1259
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.460
It's over.
You gotta take the driver's test.
I won't even fly.

1260
01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:13.480
I wouldn't even study.
You're fucking finish.
You're going to get processed.

1261
01:15:13.481 --> 01:15:17.650
Just like those people and that fucking movie with that guy who just died.

1262
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.060
I can never remember the name.
What's the name of Patrick Swayze was in it?

1263
01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:27.340
Blood forced under new America.
What the fuck was it called?

1264
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:32.860
Here come the Russians pissing the radiator.
All that.
All that hatred is gonna.

1265
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.830
Gonna gonna eat you up.
Keeps me warm.

1266
01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.960
Remember that Ed Begley Jr was in it.
No,
he wasn't a fucking,
uh,

1267
01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:45.940
the kid who was in Seoul,
man was in it and he shot his friend avenge me.

1268
01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:51.340
C'Mon Red Dawn.
Jesus Christ.
Brian,
you're a fucking director.
Do you get that man?

1269
01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:55.630
When,
when you get let you live that panic,
that brain panic.
Okay.
You just got it.

1270
01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:59.860
Okay,
good.
I thought it was only me.
Uh,
yeah,
absolutely.
No,
this people,

1271
01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:03.310
if you want to watch porn like porn,
the porn industry is fucking,

1272
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:07.090
is going through what the music industry is going through right now where all of

1273
01:16:07.091 --> 01:16:09.970
a sudden the shit just became free.
All right,

1274
01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.210
so now everybody's fucking whacking off on the Internet thinking nobody's

1275
01:16:13.211 --> 01:16:16.450
watching what you fucking rubbing your shit out too.
They're all watching.

1276
01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:20.410
And that building a fucking file.
All right.
You think already,

1277
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:25.450
haven't you noticed why the president's keep getting worse and worse and they

1278
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:29.500
keep fucking getting on their knees and blowing the banks more and more?

1279
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:30.700
It's because of the Internet.

1280
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.320
All they gotta do is break out their internet file and show him some of this

1281
01:16:34.321 --> 01:16:37.810
shit that they know that they jerked off to.
When it's fights over,

1282
01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:39.400
it's fucking over.

1283
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:41.500
You got to do everything that they're going to say they're going to exposure.

1284
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:45.280
They didn't even need to take it in Dallas anymore.
That's old school.

1285
01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:47.740
That's why Kennedy got shot in the head.
If there was an internet,

1286
01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:49.930
he'd still be walking around and talking right now,

1287
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.050
cutting the ribbon at his fucking library,
shitting his pants.

1288
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.240
He want to give the eulogy at Fed head Ted's fucking funeral.
Um,

1289
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.160
yeah,
so that's,
that's what I'm saying.
Okay.
If you wanna,

1290
01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:04.090
if you wanna jerk off to something freaky,

1291
01:17:04.091 --> 01:17:07.930
I would say go to a porn store and just deal with the fact that the guy behind

1292
01:17:07.931 --> 01:17:10.490
the counter is going to know what you got.
Pay Cash

1293
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:14.420
<v 7>and walk away.
It's a done deal,
but if you're going to go on the Internet</v>

1294
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.970
and do some of this shit that you're doing,

1295
01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:24.470
all you can hope now is that you're going to get lost in the shuffle.
Actually,

1296
01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:27.890
you can continue to do what you're doing as long as you never try to effect.

1297
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:32.840
If you never try to effectively effect change,
you know what I mean?

1298
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.990
That's that's when they break out your Internet file.
Other than that,

1299
01:17:35.991 --> 01:17:40.190
it just goes on a fucking database,
but the second you start a movement going,

1300
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:41.180
you know what,
dude,

1301
01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.290
I'm sick of paying 25 bucks in my first bag when I get on a plane.

1302
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.080
If you get enough people behind you United,

1303
01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.270
well now go to Time Warner and be like,
yeah,
Russell Johnson.
Yeah,
open his file.

1304
01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:55.880
What does he jerk?
What's the most fucked up thing?
He's joked often

1305
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:02.450
that is the end of the movement because then Fox News will get it and they'll

1306
01:18:02.451 --> 01:18:03.090
just be luck.

1307
01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:07.550
Turns out Russell Johnson jerked off to a training in a midget last week.

1308
01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.420
This was the guy who's going to lead us.
Oh,
don't get me wrong.
I'm doing it,

1309
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:16.890
<v 8>Glenn Beck.
All right,
let me,
I don't,
oh that fucking guy.
Jesus Christ.</v>

1310
01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.010
I respect those guys cause they were in show business.
I just wish maybe,

1311
01:18:20.011 --> 01:18:22.470
maybe they can't admit that they're in show business.
It's like wrestling.

1312
01:18:22.471 --> 01:18:26.220
For the longest time they couldn't say that it was fake.
But now you know,

1313
01:18:26.221 --> 01:18:29.210
at some point come on,
just say,
look,
we're doing fake news.
We know.

1314
01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.850
We know who's gonna win in the end of this shit.
Oh No,
it's all horrible.

1315
01:18:32.851 --> 01:18:33.091
All right,

1316
01:18:33.091 --> 01:18:36.900
well how much time are we have to have 46 fucking minutes for those of you at

1317
01:18:36.901 --> 01:18:40.550
home,
I do 50 minutes every week.
It's a free fucking podcast.
Admit it.

1318
01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:43.620
You don't like your job.
Maybe you don't like your wife.

1319
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.610
Maybe you don't like yourself.
You need a laugh on a Monday.
I do this for free.

1320
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.470
Out of the goodness of my heart.
See that Brian?

1321
01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:53.190
I've been a hero every fucking Monday.
Maybe that's what inspired me.

1322
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.430
You know what takes it away?
That you can tell that I'm an ally.

1323
01:18:59.431 --> 01:19:02.340
I'm a piece of shit.
Cause if I was a true fucking hero,

1324
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.690
I wouldn't have told you that story.

1325
01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.900
I wouldn't have brought it up on the podcast.
It's like a heathen.

1326
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.250
I'm praying in public right now.

1327
01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.830
I should have just done some heroic shit and walked away.

1328
01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:14.400
That's when you're bad ass right?
Explosion.
You don't even look at it.

1329
01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:18.300
That's what I should've done.
And I didn't.
You know why?

1330
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:22.530
Because I'm a fucking coward and I'm,
I'm fucking blown away by the fact that I,

1331
01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:26.670
you know,
Bill,
it was a check you as soon as funny as she weighed like 70 pounds.

1332
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:31.020
That's a funny thing.
But she was crazy.
That's,
that's mental steroids.

1333
01:19:31.021 --> 01:19:34.020
When you're crazy,
they can all of a sudden pick you up to the airplane.
Spin like

1334
01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:36.630
<v 7>sergeant slaughter.
Did he do that?
He didn't do that.
Did he?</v>

1335
01:19:36.631 --> 01:19:41.030
He had the fucking Cobra Clutch.
All right,
let's wrap this podcast up with um,

1336
01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.260
<v 8>the overrated underrated segment.</v>

1337
01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:49.000
And this segment is people send in stuff that they feel is overrated or

1338
01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:52.030
underrated.
They make a list.
I comment on it and hopefully,

1339
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:53.080
hopefully it's hilarious.

1340
01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:57.610
I will tell you what his fucking overrated is buying a God damn shoe rack.

1341
01:19:58.490 --> 01:20:02.200
Are you like me?
I eat to the point where your feet have stopped growing.

1342
01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.460
You don't throw out your fucking sneakers and you've got 58 of them and you've

1343
01:20:07.461 --> 01:20:10.140
got shoes and he got boots and all that type of crap.

1344
01:20:10.670 --> 01:20:14.130
I've got all of that shit and they were filling up my fucking closet and I'm

1345
01:20:14.131 --> 01:20:16.050
like,
all right,
I gotta get one of those shoe racks.
Okay,

1346
01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:18.600
but I need one that can hold a bunch of shoes.

1347
01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:22.530
Don't look at the picture on the outside of the box because they put fucking

1348
01:20:22.531 --> 01:20:27.270
doll shoes on those goddamn racks.
And it looks like you can easily fit three,

1349
01:20:27.271 --> 01:20:31.020
four pairs of breasts and then you come home one pair of timberlands and a

1350
01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:33.360
fucking flip flop.
And that's a whole level.

1351
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.890
Then you can't take it back.
And this whole fucking thing annoyed me.

1352
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:41.100
That's overrated.
Overrated is doing that.

1353
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:43.140
Just leave your sneakers on the fucking floor.
You know what?

1354
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.700
Why don't you go down to fucking,
uh,

1355
01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.810
I was gonna say Grossman's go down to a wire,
the,
the,

1356
01:20:46.811 --> 01:20:51.360
the Home Depot and build your own shoe rack for a fucking adult.

1357
01:20:51.361 --> 01:20:53.480
I'm literally sweating in my own apartment here.
I'm Amy.

1358
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.750
I'm not going to be sweaty on the podcast.
That Comey,
who is that?

1359
01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.160
Who's this guy for those people at home?
Huh?
Who is that guy?
Remember that coach?

1360
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.920
I don't remember his coach either,
but he coached the team out in Vegas.

1361
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:09.570
Some of the teeth.
It looks like an old Elmer.
Fudd like Elmer Fudd fucked on.

1362
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:13.020
Zimmer.
That's what he looked like.
Jesus.
I was insulting.
All right.

1363
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:16.530
Here's one from somebody underrated.
Uh,
Quincy,
the show,
Quincy,

1364
01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:20.460
the Fonz and Sam alone get all the credit for getting the ladies.

1365
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.460
But Quincy got just as much as any of them.

1366
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:27.930
It seemed like he had a different chicken is on his houseboat.
Every episode.

1367
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:30.210
He was basically a silent assassin.

1368
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:35.400
The best part of it is that he used the word broad to refer to the ladies.

1369
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:38.070
Those were different times.
They really were.

1370
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.490
They really were a Jack Klugman is Quincy.
That was like a,

1371
01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:44.790
that was the end of an era.
Remember that Brian?
You ever hear like,
yeah,

1372
01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.750
when we were growing up,

1373
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:51.260
they the the casting couch when guys ran this fucking business and now look,

1374
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:55.320
you know what's funny is they taught a fifth day.
If the ladies,
if they ran it,

1375
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.860
that they were there,
it would be,
it would be better,
but it isn't.

1376
01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:01.590
It's just is unbalanced the other fucking direction.

1377
01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:06.060
Now you've got a bunch of pussies on TV who are afraid of their wives.
You know,

1378
01:22:06.061 --> 01:22:07.770
Ralph Kramden used to threaten every week.

1379
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:11.190
That's what I loved about that show because they still shown them being a moron,

1380
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:16.380
but he's still physically intimidated.
You know,
like Larry Johnson,

1381
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:22.650
he had that power forward respect on that show.
That's all I'm looking for.

1382
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:26.130
Just show a guy in a relationship was getting a little bit of fucking respect,

1383
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.500
you know?
All right,
I'm going over my time here.

1384
01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.190
The last thing we're going to talk about as bad covers.
I talked last week,

1385
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.180
ah,
somebody,

1386
01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:40.190
Mary j Blige to the cover of a stairway to heaven and a whole lot of love.

1387
01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:43.770
It wasn't bad,
but you know what I mean?
I Dunno.

1388
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:47.580
It's just one of those things where there's some,
some music.
It's just sacred.

1389
01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:52.830
It's sacred to you.
So no matter how talented somebody is a you like,

1390
01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:53.880
what the fuck?

1391
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:58.120
So I was talking to last really bad cover that I heard that it just really,

1392
01:22:58.150 --> 01:22:59.580
it just annoyed the shit out of me.

1393
01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:04.260
Well actually I was in a gym in somebody's had remixed are shit,

1394
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.280
did the remix of a

1395
01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:09.610
<v 7>sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones.
You know,</v>

1396
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:12.160
and I'm going to go out on a limb,
I think Mick Keith and the guy,

1397
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:15.160
I think they got it right the first fucking time.
These fucking assholes,

1398
01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:19.570
first of all,
first thing they do is they edit out the guitar solo.
Okay.

1399
01:23:19.571 --> 01:23:22.330
Take Keith Guitar Solo out.
And then at one point,

1400
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.930
literally dropped out everything other than Mick,

1401
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:27.430
Mick Jagger's voice,

1402
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:31.120
and then had some new updated like,

1403
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:35.810
like a Casio drum beat underneath it.
It was just,
Ugh,

1404
01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.610
it's just a fucking worst Scott Damn Song I've ever heard.
Jesus Christ.
Bill.

1405
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:43.720
How did I not make that funny?
I really bombed with that.
Like I started off,

1406
01:23:43.721 --> 01:23:46.570
it was decent.
I got lost in the middle of it.
You know,
I got freaked out.

1407
01:23:46.571 --> 01:23:50.750
I was like,
what if Mary j actually buys this fucking DVD?
I,

1408
01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.380
I went to that arrogance space.
You know what it was.

1409
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:56.290
You know what happened there,
Brian?
I cared.
I cared.

1410
01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:59.530
And the whole fucking thing went away.
All right,
let's see here.

1411
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:03.640
The last bad cover.
Um,
this here's one from somebody,
and I know this,
this,
this,

1412
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:05.770
this actually a segment is starting to blow up.

1413
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:08.610
I just didn't have time to put everybody,
so don't,
uh,

1414
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.450
everybody's bad covers on there.

1415
01:24:10.451 --> 01:24:14.440
I want to read these because you guys really came up with some great ones this

1416
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:19.390
week.
Um,
here's one that he says a,
all right,

1417
01:24:19.391 --> 01:24:20.230
this,
the cover,

1418
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:25.260
the cover song that pissed me off the most has to be slash in Fergie's slash in

1419
01:24:25.991 --> 01:24:30.991
Fergie from the black eyed peas featuring that dude from Cypress hill there.

1420
01:24:31.361 --> 01:24:35.770
They actually redid paradise city.
And uh,

1421
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.790
right there I was immediately going,
oh no.
Oh No.

1422
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.270
And he says all that energy and swagger on the of the original,

1423
01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:47.380
everything that made that song a bonafide classic is ruined in this version.

1424
01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:52.890
Anyone that really holds up slash is a god and trashes axel cannot honestly sit

1425
01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:57.520
there and tell me that this song does mortar ruin guns and roses name than the

1426
01:24:57.521 --> 01:25:02.230
Chinese democracy.
What a horrible,
infuriating idea.

1427
01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:06.520
Please,
please give this song.
That's the treatment it deserves on your podcast.

1428
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.931
I gotta admit,

1429
01:25:07.931 --> 01:25:12.931
I am a fucking huge is how big a fan of I am of slash like I was right with them

1430
01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:18.460
slash a snake pit.
I saw velvet revolver,
anything he does,

1431
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:20.140
I will go fucking see.

1432
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:23.380
I remember I saw Joe Perry project and he showed up and he played with the band.

1433
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:24.250
It was fucking awesome.

1434
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:28.870
I love slash but I got to tell you this one that I'm not trashing slash year

1435
01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:33.700
because even Dinero has made some bad fucking movies.
But uh,
here it is.

1436
01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:35.080
You guys want to hear a little,
I'll,
I'll play,

1437
01:25:35.081 --> 01:25:38.140
I'll just a little bit of this and I'm actually not worried about slash seeing

1438
01:25:38.141 --> 01:25:41.840
this because we won't have the rights to play this on the DVD.
So here you go.
Um,

1439
01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:45.160
I think it's been a really nice podcast this week.
Um,

1440
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.330
and you should appreciate it,

1441
01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:49.450
especially a free podcast from a hero such as myself.

1442
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.660
I just like saying that.
It's so fucking annoying.
Hey,
what are you doing?
Well,

1443
01:25:55.661 --> 01:25:59.530
I'm a comedian and also I'm a hero.
I'm a fucking hero.

1444
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:04.070
Uh,
as long as they're

1445
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.680
<v 8>crazy women and they weigh less than 70 pounds,</v>

1446
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:09.890
I am right there to do my duty as,
as,
as a,
as a stand up citizen.

1447
01:26:09.891 --> 01:26:11.900
So here it is everybody.
Everybody have a great week.

1448
01:26:11.901 --> 01:26:15.100
Thanks for listening to the podcast and we're going to close out with the,

1449
01:26:15.101 --> 01:26:19.730
the Paradise City 2.0,
I'll play a little bit of this shit.

1450
01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:25.040
Uh,
this is slash Fergie from the black eyed peas and that guy from Cypress Hill,

1451
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:29.600
you know the,
the fucking trio that we've all been waiting for for years.

1452
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.850
They finally came together and here's what it sounds like.

1453
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.993
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1454

<v 8>right here.
You're going,
okay.
Maybe they're going to save it.</v>

1457
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:01.490
Maybe they're going to save it.

1458
01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:07.593
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1459
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:14.390
<v 8>ah,
AH,
enough.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

1460
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.940
Oh my God dude.
You ever get like fucking embarrassed for somebody else?

1461
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.010
What the fuck?
You know,
I,
I hate,

1462
01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.890
I can't see why to rappers always have to let you know who the fuck is in the

1463
01:27:27.891 --> 01:27:32.680
building.
I can read the liner notes.
We got had slaves in the hell.

1464
01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.220
I know he wrote it.

1465
01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:41.020
The Duchess Fergie.
Ah,
that,
that that is,
yeah,

1466
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.440
that one didn't bug me as much as led Zeppelin.
I have to admit like,
cause when,

1467
01:27:44.441 --> 01:27:46.060
when guns [inaudible] roses,
when they came out,

1468
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:50.470
I was like 1920 already realize I could see myself becoming a loser.

1469
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.290
It's sent music that you loved when you had hope,
you know,

1470
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:55.950
speaking of which is one for my,
my childhood,

1471
01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.260
I hope for a speedy recover for our Bret Michaels man.
Seriously,
man,

1472
01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:02.980
I know a lot of people,
uh,
may,
may or may not like fucking poison,
whatever.

1473
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.850
You've got to hand it to the guy.

1474
01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:08.050
They stuck around for 25 fucking years and dies in the hospital right now.

1475
01:28:08.051 --> 01:28:12.640
So I hope that guy,
uh,
comes out better than fucking ever.
And,
uh,

1476
01:28:12.641 --> 01:28:16.450
that's it.
See,
that's what a hero does.
He brings it around,
or a nice moment.

1477
01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:20.830
