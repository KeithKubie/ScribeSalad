ANTHONY MAYS: Welcome to
Engineering Everyday Equity.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.060
I'm Anthony D. Mays,
software engineer

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.090
on the data visualization
team here at Google.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.940
In this series, we
discuss practical ways

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.180
in which we can build equity,
diversity, and inclusion

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.830
into the product design process.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.930
And in this episode
specifically, we're

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.630
going to talk about the
understanding phase.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.660
And so I would love to
introduce to you Livvie,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.490
who's going to help
us talk through what

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.230
the "understand
phase" is, and how

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.840
we can use some practical
tips to really understand

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.740
what the problem is.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.670
Thanks, Livvie, for
being here with us today.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.050
LIVVIE LIN: Thank you.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.010
Happy to be here.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.426
ANTHONY MAYS: In
our last episode,

00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:38.820
I had the great pleasure
of hosting Lea Coligado

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.730
and we talked about the nuances
between equity, diversity,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.920
and inclusion.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680
We also talked about practical
ways in which we can involve

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.710
stakeholders into the process,
such as by encouraging

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.450
executive buy-in, and allyship
And we also talked about things

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.200
like inviting folks
from diverse backgrounds

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.220
into the product discussion, so
perhaps hold lightning talks.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.210
One of the things that I find
sort of difficult to understand

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.610
is how I can better
get stakeholders

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.590
involved in the design process.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.690
Do you know what I mean?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.315
LIVVIE LIN: Yeah, I
know what you mean.

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:14.010
That can definitely
be a challenge.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.010
Because we're really trying
to balance let's push out

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.980
new features, but let's
also take the resources

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.500
to have diversity,
and inclusion,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.180
and make things accessible.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.310
I'm an accessibility
champion on my team.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.040
And I'm lucky to
have other people who

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.820
also value diversity, inclusion,
and accessibility on the team

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.460
as well.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.050
And together, I
think we mostly serve

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.380
to remind the
executive stakeholders

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.120
and people about the importance
of having this as a value.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.190
And beyond that, I
was born and raised

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.490
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.320
I'm Asian.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.090
I'm the child of
immigrant parents.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.730
And I also identify as
queer and non-binary.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.730
I think it's amazing
how diverse my team is.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.480
We have people who are different
ages, who have different work

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.850
experiences, different
backgrounds, race, gender,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.000
and even different
working styles.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.812
And I think everyone
brings something

00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:08.770
different to the table.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.359
And it's really great that
it's a safe place for people

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.900
who have different
perspectives to be

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.060
able to share their ideas.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.769
I also feel like
I've learned a lot

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.310
from being an
accessibility champion,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.040
in terms of just being
more cognizant of people

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.240
with different abilities.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.810
But it's really about being able
to see my work through someone

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.780
else's eyes.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.196
ANTHONY MAYS: Well,
yeah, I really

00:02:30.196 --> 00:02:32.224
appreciate you saying
that, seeing your work

00:02:32.224 --> 00:02:33.390
through other people's eyes.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.970
Because as someone who
is a black man, who's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.790
come from Compton, and
who's also Christian,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.070
I really think it's
important that people in tech

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.710
understand the unique
background from which I come,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.950
and for other people
that I know, and have met

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.930
in this industry
who are different

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.271
and don't fit the
traditional background.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.770
So I can really
appreciate that it's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.294
difficult to think
about empathy,

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:56.460
and to really practice that.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.020
It can be challenging at times.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.269
LIVVIE LIN: I'm glad that
I'm at a place where people

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.060
are able to share their
ideas, and I'm just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.030
able to learn, and just learn
more about other people.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.970
Because everyone has a story,
and something to teach,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.110
and something to learn.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.530
ANTHONY MAYS: So in terms of
talking about these ideas,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.930
I want to bring this home
to a hypothetical app

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.160
that I have called Scholar.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.130
And it's a hypothetical
app right now,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.840
but the more I talk
about it, the more I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.240
think I should spend some 20%
time, and try to get it done.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.600
But before we do that,
let's talk about the ABCs

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.970
of inclusive product design.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.130
The ABCS of inclusive
product design

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.620
are, A, address diverse needs
of current and future users.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.510
Though you may
have a target user,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.180
who else could possibly
be using your app?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.352
From what country
do they hail from?

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:45.810
What kind of
educational background

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.420
do they have or
access to technology?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.240
B, build for everyone,
with everyone.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.000
In addressing those
diverse user needs,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.540
does your team reflect
some of that diversity?

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.980
If your team is not diverse, you
are bound to have blind spots.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.760
C, continuously
test and improve.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.680
Through iteration
and debugging, you

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.690
may find your product
is not as inclusive

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.850
as you had originally thought.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.850
Did it somehow not consider
men and women, and the spectrum

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.230
of gender identities?

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.350
Does it exclude people from
different locations, beliefs,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.700
or backgrounds?

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.780
In various ways, we'll be
returning to these concepts.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.120
It's good to revisit
them to ask yourself

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.720
those high-level questions
that drive design functionality

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
along with important
questions of what problem

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.430
you are solving for, and what
is your underlying mission.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.682
Establishing the ABCs can become
second nature to your process.

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:43.140
So now that we know
about the ABCs,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.600
I want to talk a little
bit about this app

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.920
that I want to build.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.610
So again, the app
is called Scholar.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.340
And it's designed to
connect high school

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.840
students who are graduating
with schools and scholarships.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.890
And so it's sort of designed
like a dating app for students,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.070
that can help them connect
with the institutions

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.550
of their choice, and understand
more about what scholarship

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.080
opportunities are available.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.060
In the previous discussion
that I had with Lea,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.710
we talked about
some practical tips

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.020
for baking in
diversity and inclusion

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.340
into the design sprint process.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.860
And so now we want
to talk about,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.450
or I'd like to talk about,
understanding the problem.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.033
Are there some
practical tips that you

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:22.270
can give me in that area?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.120
LIVVIE LIN: So the first
part of the sprint,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.610
this "understand
phase," where we really

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.010
get to get into the
heads of the users,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.550
and together try to gain
an understanding of who

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.270
our users are, and how we can
make this product for them.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.920
We listen to lightning talks.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.110
And lightning talks
are essentially

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.990
where we are hearing
different perspectives of how

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.210
this app might be used,
and getting a better

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.810
understanding of the product.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.900
So the note-taking
process of this

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.780
is we're going to be
taking sticky notes.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.070
And we have blank sticky notes
where we write HMW on the top.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.010
And HMW stands for How Might We.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.550
And this is how we can
start reframing pain

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.019
points of our users, and
turn them into opportunities.

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:06.560
ANTHONY MAYS: Well,
that's excellent.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.393
That's a great idea.

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:10.530
Matter of fact, as it turns
out, got some HMWs already ready

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.040
to go.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.610
LIVVIE LIN: Oh, awesome.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.320
Let's take a look.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.611
ANTHONY MAYS: So all right,
here are a few that I have.

00:06:14.611 --> 00:06:17.730
How might we demystify the
college application process?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.780
Also, how can we make it easier
for high school counselors

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.340
to connect with their students?

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.500
And then also wanted
to know about how

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.530
we might help colleges
reach students

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.657
beyond just looking at their
SAT scores or their GPA.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:32.490
LIVVIE LIN: Awesome.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.510
This looks like a really good
start to some How Might Wes.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.019
Is it OK if I make
some suggestions?

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.060
ANTHONY MAYS: Absolutely.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.893
LIVVIE LIN: Awesome.

00:06:39.893 --> 00:06:42.870
So here you have, how might we
make it easier on high school

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.740
counselors?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.550
Well, I was recently reading an
article about how it can really

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.310
help students to start the
conversation about college

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.350
earlier, maybe
even middle school.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.005
It can really turn, "Well,
are you going to college?"

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:57.630
into, "Where are you
going to college?"

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.838
Make it more of a sure thing.

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:02.940
So what if we expand the
audience to younger ages,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:03.589
as well?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.130
ANTHONY MAYS: No,
I really like that.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.630
Matter of fact, I've got sticky
notes and marker right here.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.540
LIVVIE LIN: And maybe
another suggestion

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.820
could be, for
another How Might We,

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.360
how might we start the
conversation on financial aid

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.560
and merit-based scholarship?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.630
As a general piece
of advice, I would

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.200
say that you want to think
of a diverse group when we're

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.890
thinking about How Might Wes,
and call out if someone thinks

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.370
that a How Might We might be
relevant to too narrow a group

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.270
or might be too homogeneous.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.960
ANTHONY MAYS: So
you're saying that I

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.626
should think about
how to stretch it out

00:07:33.626 --> 00:07:34.590
to a larger group.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.298
LIVVIE LIN: Yeah.

00:07:35.298 --> 00:07:37.450
So next, shifting
gears a little bit,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.510
we're going to talk about
criteria for success.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.060
I would say when making
your criteria for success,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.250
go ahead and set some
inclusive criteria.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.380
So have you thought
about any of that?

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.796
ANTHONY MAYS: Yeah,
no, of course.

00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:49.960
I want to change the
world, so there's that.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.940
But here's what I'm thinking--

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.810
I'm thinking that
30% of my new users

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.270
should be first-generation
college students.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.520
In the challenge statement
that I talked about

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.950
with Lea earlier,
we talked about how

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.620
it would be great to build
an app in 2018 that connects

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.440
high school students with
the colleges and scholarships

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.699
that they need,
and to specifically

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.490
focus on first-generation
college students.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.940
So I'd love to see 30%
of my new user base

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.970
be first-generation
college students.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.410
I think it'd also be great--
piling on top of that--

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.170
having an additional
10% of new users,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.597
say, who are outside of the
normal college age of 16 to 18.

00:08:28.597 --> 00:08:30.180
LIVVIE LIN: Yeah,
I'm liking how we're

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.280
expanding and diversifying
the user base right here.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.159
I also see that you have
a How Might We help people

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.730
with disabilities,
and just in general,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.460
making sure that college
admissions process is

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.790
more inclusive.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.100
So I would say, maybe we could
think about some criteria

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.050
in terms of making sure we give
specific call-outs to colleges

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.780
that have good diversity
ratings or strong student

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.004
life for underrepresented
minorities.

00:09:00.004 --> 00:09:02.170
ANTHONY MAYS: OK, yeah, so
I see what you're saying.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.920
You're saying that I
can also use this app

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.780
to incentivize institutions
that focus on diversity

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.450
and inclusiveness,
and sort of give them

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.970
a pat on the back to help
encourage them to do it more.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.960
LIVVIE LIN: Yeah, sure.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.500
ANTHONY MAYS: Thank you,
Livvie, for joining us today.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.333
I really appreciate
your wisdom and insights

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:18.720
and helping us with the
understand phase of the product

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.540
design process.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.880
So great having you.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.940
LIVVIE LIN: Yeah, thank
you for having me.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.023
I had a really great time.

00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:25.530
And I'd love to hear
more about Scholar.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.702
Keep me posted.

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:28.410
ANTHONY MAYS: Of
course, you know I will.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.550
So let's just
review real quickly.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.210
We talked about the ABCs
of the inclusion process--

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.280
A, addressing the
needs of not just

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.740
our current users,
but also future users.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.490
And we talked about B, building
for everyone, and lastly, C,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.530
continuously testing
and improving

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.060
on what we're building.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.740
So those are great ABCs.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.490
We also talked about HMWs,
How Might Wes, and thinking

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.460
about how to keep from
making them too specific

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.520
so that we're focusing just on
a homogeneous group of users,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.830
but really expanding
to think about all

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.910
the potential users that might
be interested and able to use

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.410
this app.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.290
We also talked about making
the criteria for success

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.880
as inclusive as possible.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.970
Thank you for joining us on this
episode of Engineering Everyday

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.200
