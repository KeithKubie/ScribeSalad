a higher sensation figure ok whereas a

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679
a higher sensation figure ok whereas a
 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.440
a higher sensation figure ok whereas a
lower sensations no that's crazy why

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
lower sensations no that's crazy why
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149
lower sensations no that's crazy why
would I want to do that you know that's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
would I want to do that you know that's
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.539

to do well as our first items for our

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
to do well as our first items for our

thrill and adventure seeking subscale ok
then we asked what what about be well we

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039
then we asked what what about be well we
 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.219
then we asked what what about be well we
know one of the other aspects oh yeah

when we looked at sex drugs and we asked

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219
when we looked at sex drugs and we asked
 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.029
when we looked at sex drugs and we asked
questions about the would you like to do

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039
questions about the would you like to do
 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.219
questions about the would you like to do
this would you like to do that or in the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
this would you like to do that or in the
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.379
this would you like to do that or in the
case of sex what do you like to do you

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:54.389
case of sex what do you like to do you
 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:57.020
case of sex what do you like to do you
know or what are your attitude store

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
know or what are your attitude store
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370

that they permissive attitude some of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
that they permissive attitude some of
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.800
that they permissive attitude some of
those sort of things we looked at so

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
those sort of things we looked at so
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620
those sort of things we looked at so
that's how I got the initial items now

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
that's how I got the initial items now
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.300
that's how I got the initial items now
we have different kinds of items now the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
we have different kinds of items now the
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.010
we have different kinds of items now the
don't include content just a need for

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
don't include content just a need for
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.590
don't include content just a need for
excitement

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600
 
 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.950
 
well I would say to be a publishing

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960
well I would say to be a publishing
 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.730

professor teaching you can't be too high

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
professor teaching you can't be too high
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.860
professor teaching you can't be too high
because if you're too high you know you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
because if you're too high you know you
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.330
because if you're too high you know you
know you're out of y'all doing other

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
know you're out of y'all doing other
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.310
know you're out of y'all doing other
things not you're not doing research and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
things not you're not doing research and
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.640
things not you're not doing research and
writing so but I was i would say i was

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
writing so but I was i would say i was
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.790
writing so but I was i would say i was
higher than the average than the average

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
higher than the average than the average
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.060
higher than the average than the average
professor okay now recently that became

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070
professor okay now recently that became
 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.340
professor okay now recently that became
a moot point when they discovered this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350
a moot point when they discovered this
 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.310
a moot point when they discovered this
gene the doping for receptor gene now i

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320
gene the doping for receptor gene now i
 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.570
gene the doping for receptor gene now i
was in england by this time I was

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
was in england by this time I was
 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.330
was in england by this time I was
getting on an age my it was my last

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
getting on an age my it was my last
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.110
getting on an age my it was my last
sabbatical but I had the chance I was in

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
sabbatical but I had the chance I was in
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840
sabbatical but I had the chance I was in
the genetics lab there and I had the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850
the genetics lab there and I had the
 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.100
the genetics lab there and I had the
chance to have my own DNA examined for

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
chance to have my own DNA examined for
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.190
chance to have my own DNA examined for
the presence of this particular gene the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
the presence of this particular gene the
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.530
the presence of this particular gene the
form of the gene so I didn't I found I

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
form of the gene so I didn't I found I
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.690
form of the gene so I didn't I found I
had the long form of the gene which is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700
had the long form of the gene which is
 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.890
had the long form of the gene which is
the type associated with

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
the type associated with
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.830
the type associated with
sensation-seeking but as I explained to

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
sensation-seeking but as I explained to
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.660
sensation-seeking but as I explained to
my colleagues there my sensation seeking

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
my colleagues there my sensation seeking
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.210
my colleagues there my sensation seeking
at that by the time he was 16 my

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220
at that by the time he was 16 my
 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.710
at that by the time he was 16 my
sensation seeking was confined to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720
sensation seeking was confined to
 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.900
sensation seeking was confined to
writing the top of the double-decker bus

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
writing the top of the double-decker bus
 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.580

in London you know because eight you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
in London you know because eight you
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.530
in London you know because eight you
know you may have a gene for something

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540
know you may have a gene for something
 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.780
know you may have a gene for something
but the its expression is affected by

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
but the its expression is affected by
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.530
but the its expression is affected by
other biological factors related to age

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
other biological factors related to age
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.370
other biological factors related to age
normally like the rise in mao with age

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
normally like the rise in mao with age
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.450
normally like the rise in mao with age
which reduces sensation-seeking

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460
