conscientiousness because orderly people
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620
conscientiousness because orderly people
seem to be more sensitive to disgust and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
seem to be more sensitive to disgust and
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929
seem to be more sensitive to disgust and
disorderly people that seems to be why

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
disorderly people that seems to be why
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.499
disorderly people that seems to be why
they're orderly but the higher you are

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
they're orderly but the higher you are
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.010

an IQ the less disgust sensitive you are

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020
an IQ the less disgust sensitive you are
 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.510
an IQ the less disgust sensitive you are
now we don't know exactly why that is

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
now we don't know exactly why that is
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.969
now we don't know exactly why that is
maybe it's because you know maybe you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
maybe it's because you know maybe you

impulsive so and you can have a pretty

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
impulsive so and you can have a pretty
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139
impulsive so and you can have a pretty
vicious personality disorder that's

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
vicious personality disorder that's
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.910

behavior and a complete inability to put
long-term plan into operation and still

long-term plan into operation and still
have a high IQ so

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
have a high IQ so
 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.380
have a high IQ so
what are the things we really can't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
what are the things we really can't
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.050
what are the things we really can't
figure out it's just a hell of a thing

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
figure out it's just a hell of a thing
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.059
figure out it's just a hell of a thing
to try to figure out is like the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069
to try to figure out is like the
 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.619
to try to figure out is like the
relationship between IQ and

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629
relationship between IQ and
 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.759
relationship between IQ and
industriousness is zero and that just

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769
industriousness is zero and that just
 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.800
industriousness is zero and that just
makes no sense to me because most of the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
makes no sense to me because most of the
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.660
makes no sense to me because most of the
brain models are predicated on the idea

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670
brain models are predicated on the idea
 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.420
brain models are predicated on the idea
that your ability to engage in long-term

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430
that your ability to engage in long-term
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.300
that your ability to engage in long-term
planning is a factor that's associated

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310
planning is a factor that's associated
 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.660
planning is a factor that's associated
with intelligence but then industrious

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670
with intelligence but then industrious
 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.759
with intelligence but then industrious
people seem to not only engage in long

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769
people seem to not only engage in long
 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.440
people seem to not only engage in long
term planning they seem to do it right

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
term planning they seem to do it right
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.180
term planning they seem to do it right
so that they feel more industrious they

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
so that they feel more industrious they
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.770
so that they feel more industrious they
put their plans into operation then the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780
put their plans into operation then the
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.020
put their plans into operation then the
plans actually work but it's not

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
plans actually work but it's not
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.140
plans actually work but it's not
correlated with IQ so that then I can't

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150
correlated with IQ so that then I can't
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.000
correlated with IQ so that then I can't
figure out well obviously the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
figure out well obviously the
 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.250
figure out well obviously the
industrious person in some way is able

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
industrious person in some way is able
 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.470
industrious person in some way is able
to regulate their own behavior you know

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480
to regulate their own behavior you know
 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.479
to regulate their own behavior you know
they're not procrastinating for example

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
they're not procrastinating for example
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.030
they're not procrastinating for example
and you think that that the ability to

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
and you think that that the ability to
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.640
and you think that that the ability to
not procrastinate would be a cognitive

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
not procrastinate would be a cognitive
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.339
not procrastinate would be a cognitive
feature but it doesn't seem to be and we

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349
feature but it doesn't seem to be and we
 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.479
feature but it doesn't seem to be and we
have no idea what makes people

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489
have no idea what makes people
 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.160
have no idea what makes people
industrious and we can't figure it out

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170
industrious and we can't figure it out
 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.289
industrious and we can't figure it out
so it's just incredibly potent

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299
so it's just incredibly potent
 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.259
so it's just incredibly potent
predictors just about as powerful as IQ

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
predictors just about as powerful as IQ
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.099
predictors just about as powerful as IQ
and we have no idea what it is

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109
and we have no idea what it is
 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.220
and we have no idea what it is
so so if you you know if you think if

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230
so so if you you know if you think if
 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.170
so so if you you know if you think if
you have a smart idea about that and you

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180
you have a smart idea about that and you
 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.699
you have a smart idea about that and you
want to pursue it like feel free because

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709
want to pursue it like feel free because
 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.319
want to pursue it like feel free because
there's a big mystery there that no

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329
there's a big mystery there that no
 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.789
there's a big mystery there that no
one's been able to crack and we've been

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799
one's been able to crack and we've been
 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.520
one's been able to crack and we've been
at it for a long time and it had almost

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
at it for a long time and it had almost
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.780
at it for a long time and it had almost
no success

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790
no success
 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.370
no success
you know we had people do things like

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380
you know we had people do things like
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.210
you know we had people do things like
the given sentences of enzymes and you

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220
the given sentences of enzymes and you
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.490
the given sentences of enzymes and you
sort of randomly distributed and then

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500
sort of randomly distributed and then
 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.960
sort of randomly distributed and then
we'd have them count to use you know

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
we'd have them count to use you know
 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.599
we'd have them count to use you know
