00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:11.086
&gt;&gt;Noah: Here, I'm able to do things
that affect how San Diegans think

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:19.606
about water, and I'm able to do
something where I can put my mark

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:24.086
on the world that I will
soon be coming into.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:35.376
&gt;&gt;I'm Noah, 16, and I go to
the San Diego Met High School,

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:40.486
which is a school where
students start participating

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:45.816
in an internship program, beginning
in first semester of ninth grade.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:54.846
Coastkeeper, their mission statement
is to have drinkable, swimmable,

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:57.146
and fishable waters in San Diego.

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:01.436
Basically, we want more fish in
our rivers, we want our rivers

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:07.526
to be cleaner, and we want it--
them to be less filled with trash.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:17.656
&gt;&gt;Noah: The internship program
is a great way for students

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:21.336
to find new opportunities,

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:27.906
to do things that they might not
do during the normal school day,

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:33.296
meet people who they wouldn't meet,
have experiences, get training--

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.916
get trained to do things,
basically just here's how you need

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.016
to get your foot in the door.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.506
&gt;&gt;Dennis: When Elliot Washor
and myself had the opportunity

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.246
to create a new school, we
really closed our eyes and said,

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:52.876
"If we didn't know
there was such a thing

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:54.586
as school, what would it be like?"

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:58.176
And it wouldn't be the 50 minute
classes and you ring a bell

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:00.706
and you run to some other place,
that's not what learning is.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:01.966
&gt;&gt;Travis: We have low oxygen,

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.716
high bacteria then there's
really something in the water

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:05.506
that we need to figure out.

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:05.656
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:05.656 --> 00:02:09.276
&gt;&gt;Travis: What's the worst bacteria
that we have here in San Diego?

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:10.046
&gt;&gt;Noah: Tijuana, no question.

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:10.806
&gt;&gt;Travis: No question, yeah.

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:14.086
&gt;&gt;Dennis: And so we set out
that every kid was going

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:15.546
to have their individual
learning plan,

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:18.096
what are your skills,
what are your interests?

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:19.486
Then we send them out
in the community

00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:20.876
where the real world's there,

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.636
and they work two days a
week, from ninth grade on.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.626
&gt;&gt;Elliot: So instead of
going from school to work,

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:29.976
we really go from work to school.

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:33.546
What are the real academics
in the real world

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:37.066
that are really being used, and
then use that as a motivator

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:41.746
to get kids more engaged in school.

00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:48.786
&gt;&gt;Travis: Having Noah
working alongside me is,

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:51.626
I think both really valuable for
Noah, and really valuable for me.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.406
For Noah, he gets really
an insider's look

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:56.886
at what it's like to have a career.

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:03.256
Today we went to the San Diego River
and we collected some water samples.

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:06.786
First thing we did is we
collected a unfiltered water sample

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:11.186
that we're going to bring back to the
lab and run bacteria analysis on it.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.306
So that's how we measure if
the water is safe to swim in.

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:19.616
We also took a second
sample where we filtered it,

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:23.206
which was what we did with the pump.

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:26.326
That filtered water is going to
be used to measure nutrients,

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.966
and dissolved metals in the water.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:30.966
&gt;&gt;Noah: So it's a high salinity.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.516
&gt;&gt;Travis: Which is interesting
because we had a rain, recently.

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:34.116
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.886
&gt;&gt;So rain, you would expect--

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:38.326
&gt;&gt;Yeah, wash out all the salt.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:42.466
&gt;&gt;Noah: He's shown me how to do these
things that I had no idea how to do.

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:44.236
He's taught me how to sample.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.476
He's basically taught me how to use
Excel, and all the advanced formulas.

00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:49.756
&gt;&gt;Travis: That's perfect.

00:03:49.856 --> 00:03:51.886
You see how when it dips down?

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:52.276
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:53.896
&gt;&gt;That dip is right on the line--

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:56.806
&gt;&gt;Noah: Yeah, yeah it's perfect.

00:03:56.806 --> 00:03:59.016
&gt;&gt;Travis: Noah has the same job I had

00:03:59.256 --> 00:04:02.126
when I was 23 years old
and finishing school.

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:08.526
He does data entry, he does
quality control checks.

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.796
I really rely on him at this point.

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:17.166
You know, he's 16 years old,
and I could not do the job

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:18.526
that I do now without him.

00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:19.606
&gt;&gt;Ready?

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:19.686
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:20.576
&gt;&gt;Let's go.

00:04:21.296 --> 00:04:27.366
&gt;&gt;Noah: Getting off campus lets me
be able to do things and see things

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:33.506
that I would never be able to see,
except for like career day on campus.

00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.606
&gt;&gt;Travis: When he graduates
high school,

00:04:38.196 --> 00:04:43.576
he's going to have three years,
maybe four years of work experience

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:46.786
in a lab, and I think it's
really going to set him ahead.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.706
When he's in college applying for
jobs, he's got that extra bump

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:54.866
of work experience, of
relevant work experience.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.066
&gt;&gt;Noah: To have an idea of what

00:04:57.176 --> 00:05:01.726
to expect before starting your
first job, seeing people work,

00:05:02.146 --> 00:05:05.396
it helps you know the environment
and know where you're going.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:07.926
That's what's really
great about this.
