00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.877
In general, when we solve an absolute value equation, we want to split it up

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.096
into two parts. One with an answer that's positive to represent the distance to

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.948
the right of zero, and one with an answer that's negative to represent the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.989
distance to the left of zero, or negative 7. And here, since we have multiple

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.777
answers, we can list our answer as a solution set. So, the solution set is

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.941
negative 4 and 3. Remember to use the curly braces for the solution set. In

00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:27.616
general, we usually list the numbers from least to greatest.
