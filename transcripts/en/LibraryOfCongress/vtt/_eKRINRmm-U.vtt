00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.370
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Hi, good morning.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.560
I'm Tomoko Steen here at
the Science and Technology

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.080
and Business Divisions
Library of Congress.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.450
I'm a Research Specialist
in Specialized in Science.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.890
In fact, today's speaker
is a Professor of Business.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.380
So, in fact the business expert

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.410
in my division should have been
introduced this excellent speaker,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.430
but I happened to get
to know him and so lucky

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.630
to learn a lot about his research.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.750
So, today's speaker Professor
Ketcham is the professor

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.060
at the University of Houston.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.410
And he's kind enough to come

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.250
and share his current
research on the space ethics.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.460
A lot of people ask me you
know, what space ethics is,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.260
I think you have to ask him.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.110
And he has a PhD from the
University of Texas at Austin

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.540
and he is also CPCU, I'm
not an expert in Business,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.640
so I'm not familiar with it,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.410
but he is chartered property
casualty underwriter, also.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.970
And that is -- he's a
property casualty insurance

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.730
and risk management expert.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.120
So, a very interesting
you know, point of view.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.130
Looking at space topics from
the business point of view.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.620
And we -- you know
facing a commercialization

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.440
and the space exploration has
been always very much a concern

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.610
for the two scientists I actually
posted a new, just available

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.300
and Carl Sagan, but now
it's commercialization --

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.530
it's another concern
and it's exciting

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.280
and very interesting
things to think about.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
And today's topic is space ethics.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.510
So before further ado, please
join me to welcome our speaker.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.250
[ Applause ]

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.010
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: Thank
you Dr. Steen, thank you Library

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.890
of Congress and thank all
of you for coming here.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.680
Now as a risk management
guy people accuse us

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.990
of wearing both belts
and suspenders.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.550
But, what we're talking
about is the ultimate risk

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.140
and that of course, is in space.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.680
Space, the final frontier.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.940
These are the voyages
-- oh, no, no, no.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.570
No, let's go back a little bit
farther than Star Trek and see

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.900
where we began in the space race.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.610
Now what I want to do is I'm going
to take you back at the triangle --

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.690
I have to hit the triangle,
the page up button, right?

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.720
Okay. I'm going to take
you back just be --

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.150
just months before President
Kennedy announced his vision

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.310
of putting a man on the moon
before the decade was out.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.760
Outgoing President Eisenhower
gave his farewell address.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.960
In it he said, "The prospect of
domination of the nation's scholars

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.740
by federal employment, project
allocations and the power

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.950
of money is ever present.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.280
And is gravely to be regarded.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.760
Yet in holding scientific
research and discovery and respect,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.200
as we should, we must also be alert
to the equal and opposite danger

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.620
that public policy could
itself become the captive

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.710
of a scientific technological
elite".

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.980
The military industrial complex
has dominated the space program

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.320
since its beginning.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.540
Even before Sputnik the idea of
weaponizing space with missiles

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.800
and satellites has been the
centerpiece of government policy.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.430
Industry has elbowed its way
into the fray capitalizing

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.490
on communications, GPS and
other military advances

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.070
to improve communication, weather
forecasting and the lives of people

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.390
and business around the world.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.660 position:56%
Like any effort begun in war was the
space race technology finds its way

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.860
into the hands of people who
are not associated with war.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.530
As unfortunate that war is the
genesis of such improvements,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.730
but we as a species seem not
able to extract ourselves

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.920
from conflict and combat.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.910
Now I am going to ask you to
channel Carl Sagan for a minute.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.850
And think what was his famous word?

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.860
Billions. So, I want you to think
in billions and even trillions now,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.070
because what people are
saying is they're getting,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.070
what Green Span might have
called irrational exuberance

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.650
over the prospect of doing
really great things in space.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.700
"The National Space Society
claims it's rationale

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.230
for promoting space settlement is
a survival of the human species",

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.030
even going that far
we're looking at.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.270
"The Space Frontier Group, a
California-based advocacy group

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.680
with a similar vision,
claims it is dedicated

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.730
to opening the Space Frontier

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.600
to human settlement as
rapidly as possible".

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.570
Billions. Think billions.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.670
Now in 2008 Jacques Arnold and
Andre Gabuv declared ethics is

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.790
in some sense the frontier
in space exploration.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.660 position:56%
The frontier of exploration is being
pushed outward at a rapid pace,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.010
bringing the need for
complex ethical analysis

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.220
to the floor today, and
not into the future.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.790
We're embarking upon a new use
for space and that is peace.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.460
Physicists and astronomers
increasingly use space

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.850
to improve our understanding
of the universe and its forces.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.860
We have discovered
water, precious minerals,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.870
rare earth elements
on celestial objects.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.620
We scan the Heavens for alternative
earths and goldilocks zones;

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.820
we're conditions for
life might be present.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.380
We gaze longingly at
Mars for opportunities

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.360
to support a separate colony
for life outside of the earth.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.670
Companies like planetary resources
have informed mine asteroids,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.280
once the technology
becomes available to do so.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.430
Moon express plans on
mining rare earth element,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.140
helium three on the moon
within the next few years.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.900
Enigmatic India, with its
intractable poverty has

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.920
since the 1960's built a
successful space operation that's

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.990
very economical.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.010
And will undoubtedly
attract many who want to get

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.570
to space very inexpensively.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.540
&gt;&gt; Space has been made available
for humanity; however we must face

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.640
and overcome considerable
hurdles to do so.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.550
As Eisenhower warned us we are
still primarily thinking technology

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.060
in the space race.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.310
It is now we must consider,
begin to consider the human,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.030
and not just the long term
survival ability of a Mars lander.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.010
But the sociology and
ecology of space colonies

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.560
and its companion the
macro economics

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.090
of space industry and commerce.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.760
Here's why we must begin now.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.160
Successful international space
station re-supplier space X is

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.250
working on a rocket capable
of holding 100 passengers

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.770
on a long trip in order
to place their goal

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.260
of one million persons on Mars.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.370
Mars One, from the Netherlands
wants to send a colony to Mars

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:20.000
on a one way ticket to be
funded by a Truman like show,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.030
reality television series
about the colonists.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.630
Very interesting prospect.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.320 position:56%
Space X warns that the risk of death

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.820
for these new age astronauts
will be high.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.030
Why? Colonists will be ordinary
humans, not the astronauts

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.590
that weave the logic
driven, risk calculating,

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.960
cool under fire astronauts that
we've been used to in the past.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.960
&gt;&gt; While the National Space
Society has been discussing space

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.740
settlements since the
mid-1970's we remain today

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.680
like Lewis and Clark and Sacagawea.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.270
Who on the urging of
President Jefferson set

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.950
out into the wilderness of the
Louisiana Purchases to see what use

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.750
of the New Republic could
make of all this wilderness.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.410
Of course, we did make
use of the land

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.530
and have prospered and
grown because of it.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.140
We also did some nasty things

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.680
to the indigenous inhabitants,
both human and animal.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.570
The wilderness of space is
our next place of exploration;

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.880
however distance radiation, vacuum,

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:31.260 position:56%
cold and time itself far exceed the
considerable obstacles Lewis, Clark,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.270
Sacagawea and others endured

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.080
on their 19th century
voyage of discovery.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:44.160
Star Wars and Star Trek both
present space as a place of war.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.680
Where they're armed with the
force of photon, torpedoes,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.150
military organizations, pit right
against mite through federation

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.750
or empires with efforts towards
diplomacy, but diplomacy backed

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.040
up with weapons, we
can only imagine.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.880
Little mention is made of
the millions of people who go

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.960
through their lives
with quiet desperation

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.840
and the frontier outpost exposed
to adverse weather, hostile forces,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.320
corruption and bandits, just

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.390
like our own pioneers endured
furring the 19th century.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.410
We read the Dystopian
novels like Red Rising

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.230 position:56%
about the Martian mining community
that becomes a caste system complete

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.840
with its disposable untouchables.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.980
These fictional accounts
explore not only the fictional--

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.640
explore not only fictional
human proclivities

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.060
to put prophets before
people and far outposts

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.970
where industrialists create new
mining communities reminiscent

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.240 position:56%
of those company towns, so prevalent
in the early industrialization

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.150
of this country and Europe.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.330
When we build space colonies we
will bring our own human issues,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.880
frailties and problems with us.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.180
Space gives us an opportunity

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.790
to rethink our own propensity
towards war and hadjemite.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.970
However our nascent efforts
foretell an [Inaudible] beginning.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.760
We continue to weaponize space.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.900
We conduct science and
business alongside spy

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.600
and weaponize satellites.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.620
Like the rivers of the 1960's we
have riddled near earth space lanes

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.020
with space junk is becoming
a critical navigation hazard.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.460 position:56%
Even as we pursue space productivity
we are confined to a little world

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.510
of 25,000 miles circumference,
which we can use --

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.100
continue to use with
considerable abandon.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.250
Space is huge, measured in
light years, not kilometers.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.960
We can rationalize that we
should litter some place

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.930
but there are many others that
are pristine and we can go there.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.800
We can solve problems of
over population, refugees,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.440
poverty by establishing kindliness
on Mars, who will take our tired,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.300
poor and hungry masses
learning to breathe free.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.650 position:56%
Breathe is the first operative word.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.740
The second is radiation.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.040
The third gravity.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.660
A third of our own.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.550
We may have to live
underground like moles on Mars

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.100
because the planet
has no magnetic field

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.090
to deflect the sun's radiation.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.950
For the foreseeable future
we must important everything,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.450
even water if we can't
distill whatever water

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.420
that is near the surface,
which is likely even

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.310
to be more salty than the Dead Sea.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.450
I suggest that before we go too far

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.880
in conquering space using some
same brute force we've used

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.580
on our own planet in its
orbit, that we pause and begin

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.200
to understand both the implications

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.650
and opportunities that
space provides.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.260
In other words we need to consider
what we might become an ethics

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.760
of space, including how we
govern and police ourselves

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.440
as we begin the human
occupation of the cosmos.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.290
Any ethics we have of space
necessarily will involve societal,

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.020
organizational and
business implications.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.070
We went to the moon to
prove military superiority.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.060
We must know think beyond pure
science, weapons and begin

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.550
to reason like business persons.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.440
But within an I told you,
reasonable, ethical foundation

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.110
as a restraint against
undo exploitation

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.030
of people or celestial bodies.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.060
Economics will certainly
be an early challenge

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:25.250 position:56%
of deep space once we figure out how
to thrive outside of our own planet.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.180 position:56%
Regardless of the persistence outcry
against regulation, we let business

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.990 position:56%
and comments run without significant
hindrance, this is a good thing

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.970
because it produces competition,
innovation and wealth.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.540
On earth we can inspect
manufacturing facilities, products

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.770
and monitor how people
are treated by industry.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:49.680
How long will it take and how much
will it cost to send an inspector

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.260
to human outposts 10
million miles away?

00:13:53.260 --> 00:14:01.670 position:56%
What do the patrol vessels that will
stop piracy, looting and maleficent;

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.590
where are our aircraft
carriers in the universe?

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.020
Well commercial vessels
need to be like Star Wars

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.930
and the Millennial Falcon
bristling with guns.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.120
Let Captain Han Solo
operate like a 19th century,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.220
18th or 19th century pirate

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.020
and the rich space lanes
of the asteroid belt.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.870
Are we ready for a
Klondike Gold Rush

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.780
where everyone is for
himself or herself?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.750
Are we ready for Bad Bart,
hanging judges and cattle wars

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.690
in the prairie outposts of space?

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:36.990
Planetary resources that would
be space miners have identified

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:42.570
asteroids consisting of near
pure platinum, each worth as much

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:48.110
as get this, a trillion
dollars or more if mined

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.750
and brought back to earth.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.340
Will we let miners like we did

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.180
in the Klondike simply rush
towards these celestial objects

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.740
because they have the will
and the finances to do so?

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.770
The first will be like robot
miners and space dump trucks

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.490
that will bring ore
back to the earth

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.740
or even facilities of
space for processing.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.330 position:56%
How much is it going to cost to
bring this stuff back down to earth?

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.350
We as yet don't know.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.480
This was the case in the
Klondike and other gold rushes.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.580
This platinum rush will
benefit the first miners most.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.180
After we saturate the earth with
more platinum than we can use,

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.390
even as we create markets
for platinum ware,

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.680
hubcaps and bathroom faucets.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.760
The cost of mine asteroids
will become prohibitive

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.140
when the market crashes.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.220
Mining the asteroid belt takes
such onus to earth's environment,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.710
perhaps even more so than the
gold rush and other mines have.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.150
Errant equipment, disasters and
other accidents can alter the orbit

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.570
of space objects, perhaps
even sending one or more

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.290
on a trajectory towards earth.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.950
How will we regulate space mining?

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.470
Just as important, who
will own the asteroids?

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:04.940
In 2015 President Obama signed the
HR2262 which permits US citizens

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:10.100
to own asteroid resources
both here and in space.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.290 position:56%
When we divvy up the asteroid belt
like the colonial powers of the 18th

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.680
and 19th century, or we will
declare the asteroid belt

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.470
as we have declared the open
sea, the heritage of humanity.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.870
And subject to no individual
sovereign.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.670
Well least asteroids
feels like we do

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.650
to oil drilling rights,
for how long?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.100
Will we create depletion
deductions and taxes

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.510
as we whittle away space rock
and return it to the earth,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.410
the moon or mars for processing?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.580
Who will be tasked with enforcing
the asteroid that we need to -

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.880
we actually need to create?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.660
The UN? The UN has been useful
dealing with many earthly issues

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.270
and has debated in many countries
have signed the space treaties

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.710
and declarations.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.490
Is the UN really the right
place for space governance?

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.650
This is important concern
because there are many questions

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.540
about governance in space.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.860
One looming one is who will
police incredibly vast space lanes

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.360
against piracy, space junk and
other navigation issues or step

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.190
up when interplanetary mining dump
trucks are hijacked and ransomed

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.020
or sold on the black market?

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.430
We will send earthly
microbes into empty space.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.940
The planets, their moons
and other celestial bodies.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:39.380
We've already done so despite
the heroic efforts of NASA -

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.100
on NASA's office of planetary
protection and the statements

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.230
by COSPR, Committee on
Space Research at the UN,

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:51.690
scientists who are committed
to microbe free landers.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.490
We have diligent cleanliness,
standards for orbiters and landers.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.920
The operatal standards cannot
prevent some spores and bacteria

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.780
from hitching a ride to the moon,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.190
mars or any other body we have
visited or intend to visit.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.720
We brought life to Mars.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.410
We don't know yet whether we'll
be reanimated or reanimate itself.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.230
But it's on our rovers.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:19.540
It just takes one bacteria
to find a niche and divide.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.420
That's the issue we have
to deal with, with life.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.000
Remember the old saw
from Jurassic Park?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.170
Life finds way.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.360
When we land the first human
with a gut full of bacteria,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.260
skin crawling with tiny mites,
viruses and other critters,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.290
steps outside the air lock we bring
life to the place where we step.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.800
Any breach in the air suite
or hole will light the scape.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.350
Some life might take in
places in the wild or inside

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.820
in enclosed colonies and begin to
evolve separate from the earth.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.660
We know for example that the
international space station is

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.640
creating its own ecology.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.430
Microbes are evolving to thrive
in the conditions present

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.040
at the station and the
migration of people in and out.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.910
When we establish a Martian colony

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:05.160
and it must become more
or less self-sufficient.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.400
What schemes of ecology
are we going to establish

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.670
to maintain a viable system
of life for the long term?

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.580
What mix plants and animals?

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.120
How will we deal with the evolution
or normal cycles or even accidents

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.080
that threaten the colonial
ecosystems we likely will need

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.430
to maintain for our
own existence on Mars?

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.360
Later we may want to
[Inaudible] Mars

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.700
if we could ever figure
that one out.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.260
But in either case we're still
create a separate evolving world

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.170
where microbes that
once evolved only

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.530
on earth will evolve
independently on Mars.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.960
Travel back and forth will create
opportunities for invasive species,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.680
insects and others to wreak havoc

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.210
on other celestial bodies
and even earth itself.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:57.270 position:56%
Humans have little regard for inner
generational justice beyond the next

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.050
two generations comprising
children and grandchildren.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.700
Our lives only extend that
far and to think beyond one -

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.880
what's become a clouded
about the uncertainty,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.280
then it isn't our problem.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.570
Business horizons are often
90 days or at most a year.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.550
We rationalize and say "Well
our grandparents had to deal

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.190
with it, let them deal with it".

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.650
Our own death is a finality we
cannot seem to think beyond.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.820
What I'm asking is that we think
beyond the next two generations

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.890 position:56%
and at least begin a dialogue on the
major issues that we, as a species

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.200
and even life itself will be
facing over the countless millions

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.870
of generations into the future.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.580
I'm not asking us to predict
the state of humanity, the world

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.770
and our ventures in space
a billion years from now.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.520 position:56%
What I'm asking is that we establish
a line of dialogue for as many

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.380
of the issues of space and
space ethics we can envision

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.700
that we will likely encounter.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.500
We are entering a new phase
which I call the cosmo scene.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.410
We call it the Anthropocene
is the term used by many

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:12.430
to describe humans, humanities
impact on the earth ecology.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.750
The dinosaurs had their
own scene, we have ours.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.990
The cosmo scene asks what impact
we're going to have on space,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.340 position:56%
first space in our solar system
which is vast enough, and then next,

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:31.230
the Milky Way Galaxy that
is dissonance unimaginable.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.920
If we can better phrase the
basic questions we will need

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.880 position:56%
to continually address, I suggest we
will embark upon a path towards an

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.330
inter-generational ethics of space

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.170
for which we will eventually
look back

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.630
and say this is much crowning
achievement as a theory

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:52.380
of relativity, the first man moon
mission and the idea of democracy.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.170
The independent science center
committee on space research,

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.520
COSPR and our own NASA
are good places to begin.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.810
But we must ad, and Dr. Steen knows
this, economist, business persons,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.910
financial analysis, financiers,
social psychologists, sociologists

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:15.400
and biologists in addition to
doctors, engineers and physicists.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.300
We want to create not only
an economic engine of space

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.900
but also a viable ecological and
sociological colonization system

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.170
in places hostile to
humanity and life itself.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.290
There's not enough time in
this forum to discuss each

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.730
of the questions associated with
commerce, travel, habitation,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.860
alien life and other
topics we need to explore.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.390
We need more forums like this one

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.760
where such questions
can be developed

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.380
and debated before we begin the
process of living and working

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.070
in space on another
celestial bodies in earnest.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.920
I suggest we must do this
before those who want

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.230
to exploit the heavens set
problematic precedence's

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.430
that may be difficult to overcome.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.140
I'll spend the rest of
this time I have with you

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.210
to begin the discussion
of one issue in more depth

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.110
and that is human space governance.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:10.170
And there's not been a
lot of attention on this.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.770
Governance of human space
travel to this point has been

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.750
in the command control
style of the military.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.290
This is expected to
continue on the space station

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.930
and probably even the
first lander on mars.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.940
Science and military
were together not only

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.320
to design scientific protocol but
to produce the discipline and chain

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.370
of command in the limited
space of the space station

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.400
or future exploratory landings.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.760
Astronauts have been like Seal
teams, they work together,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.150
they know how to solve
problems and everything else.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.580 position:56%
Look at the good, bad and the ugly
in our world; our colonies are going

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.820
to contain all sites
of - types of persons

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.330
and attitudes, we'll need jails.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.830 position:56%
We'll need drug and alcohol
clinics, we'll need suicide watches.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.190
The scope and size of things
that will change once industry

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.030
and government begin permanent
colonization endeavors.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.490
There are a number of possible
governance models I would

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.570
like to explore with
you a little bit today.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.080
These are not all of them by
any means, but they're a taste

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.770
of what we might be up against.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.150
One we can call the off shore
drilling platform model.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.350
This will be a commercial
venture where workers are employed

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.600
by specific business or government
enterprise to work full time

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.390
for a period of time at a site.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.020
For example, at an
asteroid mining operation.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.120
While we have employment
rules for US companies

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.130
on employment treatment, pay,

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:43.750
safety and other requirements
we do not have a workable system

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.450
for other worlds at this point.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:51.120
Granted we have five space treaties
covering governing to some extent,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.530 position:56%
space exploration, near earth orbit,

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.110
rescue liability equipment
regulation, registration

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.770
and a treaty to make
space a peaceful region.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.840
None of these has really
been tested;

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.740
none includes governance
to any real extent.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.320
Disease, conditions of
space, force measure,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.510
lack of transparency are all issues
where enforceability from earth

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.140
or even other outposts
may be challenging.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.080
Distance and time also
complicates worker only outposts.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.990 position:56%
Workers maybe required to work for
years or even decades without relief

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.580
because the cost to
transport them to

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.220
and from work will be prohibitive.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.010 position:56%
With present equipment capabilities
a round trip journey to mars will be

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.350
like a sea voyage around the
world in Magellan's time, long,

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.770
stressful and quite often boring.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.970
Magellan could stop and
replenish his stuff on islands.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.930
We can't even do that
as we go to Mars.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.190
We can expect troubles, fights,
medical emergency, insurrections,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.530
suicide and any other
manner of irregularities

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.360
when people are confined
in restricted place

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.410
with the same persons for
month or years on end.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.520
Can you just imagine hearing
this every day for a year?

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.820
Are we there yet?

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:18.150
And can you play the
license plate game in space?

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.740
No. Lots of video games and
people bouncing off walls.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.320
The lack of social structure in
the off shore model compounds us.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.830
There may be no spouses, children

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.950
and life outside the
work environment.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.360
We'll likely find that the off
short oil platform model is not

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.310
sustainable ultimately because of
the time and challenges of space

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.660
for anything other than our moon.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.050
Another model is what we
call the expect community.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.620
This is where business
ships the workers

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.550
and their families to
remote work outposts.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.510
This will become a more
or less permanent outposts

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.820
where families live, work,
socialize and go to school.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:56.550
The expect community is really the
model for the old company town.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.360
The question of governance
looms large here as it did

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.030
in the company towns of old.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.590
The employers, the
community administrator,

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.760
the source of commerce,
the owner of property

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.000
and the purveyor of justice.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.230
There will be limited
power of the community

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:15.710
to overcome oppressive
tactics by the business itself.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.850
One cannot challenge
the work conditions

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:20.520
on the threat of being sacked.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.610
What if one is sacked?

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:29.220
Okay we're going to send
you home in three decades,

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.760 position:56%
what do you do between now and then?

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:39.340
This one may be touted as being
fair, equitable and wonderful

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.610
from the shiny pamphlets of
employers who want you to go there.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:48.070
All I remember is the food
pickers from the Grapes of Wrath.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:55.020
Shiny posters, great work,
great pay, neither one happened.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:28:00.340
A third approach has a
number of different options.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.120
All are based upon a pioneer model.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.080
Recall that when we decided
to populate the prairies

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.530
in the 19th century
we offered free land.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.230
In the space pioneer model
we probably will have

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.880
to offer the equivalent
of the sod house.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.220
The containment vessel essential
for life at a remote outpost.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.820
People will still arrive as
settlers rather than squat

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.710
and improve the land as were the
requirements don't own the land

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.140
during pioneer days.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.720
Persons will be picked based

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.770
on their skills required
to sustain the outpost.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.100
You've got to have a certain amount
of doctors, you need a lawyer,

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.930
you need biologists,
you need farmers,

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.230
you need a little of everything.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.630
You need sanitation experts, you
need water, people, everything.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:49.470
And a strong governance
approach, the local colony legally

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.220
and constitutionally is
attached to earthly governments.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.990
This form of governance early on
will look like the current command

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.900
and control ventures but
will need to involve checks

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.260
and balances not unlike what
is available in the US today.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:08.120
And this time hype of outposts
there will be the need to be

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.610
of all things we find and
communities or more, governments,

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.180
jobs, entertainment,
education, medical care

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.870
and justice will need to be there.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.060
The beginning colony will
like have as its primary goal

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.390
to become self-sufficient
and self-sustaining.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.430
This likely will require regular
supply missions from earth

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.080
to replace medicines and machinery
not be possible to produce

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.610
at the earliest outposts.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:37.250
Early outposts may be
run almost like communes

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.660
where there will be little need for
capitalist economy, just survival.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:46.010
Likely these colonies will be
expensive to establish and operate.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.870
Who is going to continue
to pay for them

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:54.530
when they don't necessarily turn
a profit for how many decades

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.430
or hundreds of years perhaps?

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.400
An alternative to same
model we might call pioneer

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.040
condominium community.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.820
In this form of governance the
colonists invest their own money

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.990 position:56%
in the colony and pay off
creditors, which might be government

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.770
or industry at the very beginning.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.450
Eventually such colonists will own
a piece of the colony and can sell

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.560
or dispose of it per
colony regulations.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.670
We must also worry that the
billionaires will buy up units

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.870 position:56%
and turn tenants into sharecroppers.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.730
And another variation
of condominium,

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.430
pioneer condominium model,

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.910
the government subsidizes
the entire colony.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.360 position:56%
The colonies are then winged off the
subsidies, sort of like a mortgage

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.750
over time as it begins
to produce surplus goods

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.070
which can be exchanged
for earthly goods.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.170
Individuals may then be
deed a title much the same

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:49.150
as the pioneers, our
pioneer ancestors.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.000
What if they cannot produce
enough to eliminate the subsidy?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.300
What happens then?

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.000
We don't have any provisions
for this?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.630
Likely you can imagine
other organizations systems,

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.770
the pioneer form of organizations
more likely to be feasible

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.310
on a large celestial body
such as the moon or mars

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.970
in a large scale operation.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.230
Colonies may be established next
to or near industrial operations

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.850
such as mine or manufacturing
facilities, some workers will be

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.470
in the factories or mine and
some will be doing other jobs,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.270
producing food, recycling
waste and water,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.390
governing policy, education
and justice.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:31.070 position:56%
In any of the scenarios the question
of independence and what that means.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.380
All colonies will have
measures of independence just

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.440
like earthly pioneers;
however we know

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.730
that our own revolution
was fought in part

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.760
because of taxation
without representation.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.820
Earth, what services are
you really providing us now

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.740
that we're pretty much
operating on our own?

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.050
How come we have to
pay all these taxes?

00:31:55.050 --> 00:32:00.500
Distance and time will spread
earthly resources thin,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.670
insurrections, revolts, mutinies,
takeovers and despites could occur

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.730
and become entrenched before
a policing vessel can arrive

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.030
at the colony.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.070 position:56%
In a weak earth governance approach,

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.710
colonies may also become separate
countries which means the need

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.470
for a galactic organization

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.090
that governs interspatial
commerce, defense and immigration.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.090
Enforcement to rein in rogue
colonies presents other

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.300
humanitarian issues.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.220
Penetration weapons in a confined
colony that's about as thick

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.900
as a tin can will surely
be disastrous.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.570
Then of course no matter
what system of governance,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.290
these will be pioneer outposts.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.210
It's not likely the medical care
will approach that on earth,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.170
mortality rates are
likely to be higher.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.150 position:56%
Psychological issues associated
with depression, phobias, anxieties,

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.350
suicide will likely require a
different approach to psychiatry

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.860
and close environment outpost.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.270
Think submarines, especially
nuclear submarines that are

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.840
out for a very long period of time
because they don't have to refuel.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.140
They can make their own water.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.300
They can recycle the air.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.120
However we've seen before where the
pioneers those are left the East

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.990
Coast to settle in the plains were
a hearty bunch, who sought relief

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:17.050
from crowded cities,
farming communities

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.650
where there was land too
expensive for the poor to purchase.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:25.770
With atmospheric challenges before
any [Inaudible] occurs you can't

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.110
spread out, you're
stuck in a small space.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:33.520
You can't get those 40 acres
out there and that mule

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.630
because there are no more 40
acres, everybody has their own.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:47.510 position:56%
So what becomes of earth in this new
planet, inter-planetary space model?

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:51.680 position:56%
With growing population on that, any
persons who can't see the value of -

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.290
can see the value of
migrating to a space outpost

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:58.250
because they have no
opportunities here.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.240
As production becomes more
automated and we enter in the era

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.840
of driverless cars, store-less
purchasing, what would people do

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.090
with their lives without jobs?

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:12.430
Likely in the US we are probably
- that's not in our blood

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:17.160
to give someone a sustainable
living wage for not working,

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:22.780 position:56%
even if they can't get a job because
they don't have the proper education

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.760
to do what the new jobs demand.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.360
Will space colonies be places where
these workers will go to find work?

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.830
No matter what form of outpost
we envision or ever build,

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.630
early efforts are likely to
produce economic equations

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.100
that will first rely
on heavily on subsidies

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.140
or large debt to entrepreneurs.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.890
We do not yet have an economic
model in space that accounts

00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:47.910
for the extraordinary cost of
travel in existence and the pursuit

00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.610
of profits from productivity.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:55.570
We may see the early - the
asteroid farmers make fortunes,

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.240
the law of supply and
demand on precious metals

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.310
and other commodities will likely
make these remote operations less

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:07.170
and less profitable until there
is a large enough space economy

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:09.620
to support that kind of activity.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.260
We require a better understanding
just of what economic engines

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:20.650
of space will be out there and how
will they operate, and what forms

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.580
of social organization and
governance that will work in space?

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.860
Remember space is going to be a
lot different than here, confined,

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.060
minimal resources,
not huge environment.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:40.120
Trashing the one Fichus Tree might
earn you a place not just in hell

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.190
but somewhere else entirely.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:47.530
We must factor in transportation,
operating in existence cost

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.590
and space compared to earth.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.070 position:56%
We might discover that the economics

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.670
of space does not require including
earthy in a viable two way -

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.890
as a viable two way trading
partner except for select products

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.340
or commodities that cannot
yet be made in space.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.890
Industry and persons on earth
probably can supply themselves

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.190
better than we can from space.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:12.390
The cost to live from the earth,
in necessary goods for space,

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.190
for space colonies likely will
continue to be prohibitive.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.940
Further isolating the
earth from space trade.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.480
Presuming low cost robotic vessels,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.930
the expense to do the same may
be less from our moon to mars

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.230
or through the asteroid belt

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:31.340
because all experience
less gravity than earth.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.150
I suggest that there is a
distinct possibility that trade

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.910 position:56%
between space parties might become
independent from earth in many ways,

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.650
including raw materials
such as ores for smelters

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.290
and manufacturing facilities,

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.250
seas and frozen food trade,
medicines and the like.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.260
Persons who become
accustomed to or are born

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.910
in lower gravity may not
be able to visit earth,

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.540 position:56%
let alone face off earthly diseases.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.460
Education might also become a
commodity as candidates compete

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.460
for entry into mars as
elite Olympus University.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.720
Finally, what about democracy?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.310
It depends on how much
return and control

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:17.090
with the billionaire Elon Musk and
others want from their investment.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.940
How beholden will space colonists

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.030
and travelers be to
space entrepreneurs.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.550
Will they install their
governors and administrators

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:29.020
as the European monarchies did
when they established colonies?

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.040
These are all questions that must
be asked before the ships begin

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.050
to launch.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:39.020
Which form of governance or
economics am I advocating?

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.630
I'm not advocating anything because
we don't have all the answers yet.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.070
As a matter of fact we
have very few answers.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.460
But what I'm asking is that we
begin today to ask questions

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:54.410
and put the question of governance,
social organization and justice

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:59.150 position:56%
in the forefront of any long term
discussions of venture, of commerce,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.830
or commercialization
outside of earth's orbit.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.130
Thank you.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:08.510
I look forward to your questions.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:14.340
[ Applause ]

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.640
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Sheen: Any questions?

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:24.280
&gt;&gt; You talked a lot about
history and some of the things

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.640
that manifest destiny [Inaudible]
Blade Runner was a movie

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:44.330
that was made in 1982 talking
about a couple years from now

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.350
and that deals with
the concept of slavery

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.330
and it's laboring [Inaudible]
to society [Inaudible].

00:38:52.330 --> 00:39:04.320
I'm curious, we have a lot
of problems here today.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:11.630
We have slavery still
here today in some forms.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.340
What's your thoughts
before we go anywhere,

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.260
solving a lot of the
issues we still have here

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.720
and maybe I think this is good
because it gives us balance

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.610
and comparison to say what if we
get to mars and we need to have

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.980
in place, as we know
it from history or now.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.270
But what do we need to solve
now before we get to mars.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.690
What are your thoughts
on that perspective?

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.370
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: So the
question is what do we need

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:39.040
to solve now and specifically
one of the questions

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.000
that was asked was
about slavery itself.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.680
And Red Rising specifically
talks about issues

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:52.410
of businesses employing
slaves in the deep mines.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.700
They did all the work while the
people, the golds on the top,

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.250
the reds were at the bottom,
the golds were at the top.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.060
The golds basically were
like the gods of old.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.070
They basically pranced around,
did all sorts of things.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.640
They were the intellectual
bunch and the people

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.940
down in the bottom were the brawn.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.240
My suggestion is not
necessarily that we're looking

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.660
for a Utopian world outside, but
we can start clean if we want to.

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.310
Meaning that if we know that there
are things that are difficult here

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.610
on earth, do we have to
bring them into space?

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:15.910
Can we start with more
Utopian ideas?

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.210
Can we talk about social
responsibility and a social license

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:18.860
to operate for companies in
space, as opposed to just the idea

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.160
that shareholders should
have their total return?

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.910
And as long as we obey the laws
we can do anything we want.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.110
I don't know about you
but I really don't want

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.830
to have my employer be
in charge of my life.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:38.900
Because you know that they're
not as well versed in governance

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:43.950
as the people who are the governors
of today; so I agree with you.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.980
We may not be able to
solve the problems on earth

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.760 position:56%
but maybe we can create environments
on mars and other places that people

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.110
on earth look up to and
say "This is a better deal,

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.520
why can't I go there"?

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.800
And if all the best and
brightest leave here to go to mars

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.750
because it's a better place,

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.610
what's going to have to
happen here on earth?

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.450
They're going to - in
order to retain the best

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.850
and brightest they're going
to have to do a better job.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.150
So, yes thank you.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.020
&gt;&gt; So I'm wondering from
the industry perspective,

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:23.980
have you looked or analyzed
much the [Inaudible].

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.280
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: The what?

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.050
&gt;&gt; The biosphere to
enclosure experiments.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.710
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: I have not
looked at those, the biosphere -

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.010
&gt;&gt; Biosphere too.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.310
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham:
Biosphere too,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.620
no I have not looked
at them specifically.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:39.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm curious because they do - the
biospheres were existing in models

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.270
that were somewhere
between command control,

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:47.290
off shore drilling platform,
[Inaudible] pioneer and yeah.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.230
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: I
think we can learn from things

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.590
like the biosphere model.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.090
They are very important
to learn from.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:00.070
Dr. Steen is working right
now on Chernobyl to look

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.440
at genetic differences
from radiation.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.880
We have that issue in mars,
unless we live in the latitudes

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.900
that may be there on mars,
we're going to be exposed

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.790
to a lot more radiation,
just like the critters

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.480
and the humans in Chernobyl.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.070
So yes, experiments
like what you're talking

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.510
about that are self-contained
biospheres are critical.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.790
Because what they do for us
is they tell us what kind

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:28.050
of biosphere do we need to
bring to another planet?

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:33.030 position:56%
In order to sustain ourselves first,
but then the second question is

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:38.520
that in a few billion years from
now the sun is going to expand

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.390
and we're going to become
yesterday's barbecue.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.620
There won't be anything
left on earth.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.330
Now people are talking about
oh, let's come up with a plan

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:51.400
to move the earth out
and move it back.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.620
Okay, I like science fiction too,

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.980
but maybe terraforming mars
is a better route to go.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.890
But we need to know what
do we terraform mars with?

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.910
Do we want giant redwoods?

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.540
Do we bring whales?

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.840
Who has to come?

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.240
What has to come?

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.100
What needs to create a
long-term environment?

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.970
With environments - you're talking
with very small, which we're going

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:26.080
to be dealing with we have to
look at the lack of biodiversity.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.910 position:56%
If you have three acres of corn and
it's all genetically engineered corn

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:35.360
or not necessarily GMO, but
has been bread over the years

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.080
and that's all we have,
someone brings a corn musk

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.190
to that little place, they don't
have a chance, so absolutely.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:52.100
We need to have those kind of
experiments on the earth today.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.400
Yes?

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.310
&gt;&gt; Could I back up a little
bit, now and looking at the -

00:43:57.310 --> 00:44:00.770
you mentioned the United Nations

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.400
and I guess you mean
the Outer space Treaty -

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.700
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham:
The moon treaty,

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.000 position:56%
there are a bunch of other treaties.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.480
&gt;&gt; The space treaty talks
about with its parties

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.550
and the exclusive purposes.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:19.330
The United States has interpreted
that will allow the possibility

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:23.750 position:56%
of [Inaudible] operations out there?

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.670
Why isn't it worth
spending more time looking

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:35.170 position:56%
at a more internationalized approach
to the use of space in terms

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:41.050
of international entities doing
things, like joining forces

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:50.120
with the space platforms now, the
international space and things

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.060
like monitoring of that military
activities here through -

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.660
what the French talked about
already in the late 70's

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.850
and international satellite
monitoring agency?

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:05.040
And it worked putting some
effort into that sort of thing?

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.340
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham:
So the question is,

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.540
is it worth putting
effort into creating more

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.710
or less an international
cooperation group?

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.740 position:56%
And that is one of the big questions
that I have is what should that look

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:20.580
like and what should that contain?

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.460
I say early on and I mean
very early on we're going

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.370
to run into space piracy.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:34.260
We're going to have someone hide
behind a planet with a weapon,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.390
a guided missile that can be
sent to this orbiter out here

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:46.110 position:56%
to disrupt the commerce of that
particular platinum mining facility.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.720
We are going to have
people who are going

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.050
to trash each other's satellites or
other orbiters where they're going;

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.720
so I definitely believe
that there is a need

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.420
for an international organization.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:01.350
And quite frankly, let's face
it the economics and cost

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:09.350 position:56%
of this thing are going to require a
worldwide matrix of people involved

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:13.500
with not only creating
the rockets to get there

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.010
but the governance issues, the laws
an international law of the sea

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.730
for space that works on that
particular kind of thing.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.050
Near the idea of the
outer space treaty.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:29.780
And dealing with issues of
problems such as the introduction

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.020
of microbes into other places.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.940 position:56%
So I agree, yes that's why I brought

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:40.420
up the question is the UN
the proper place for that

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:44.570
or are they earthly bound and we
need to look at something different

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.900
because this is a whole different,
as they say kettle of fish,

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.750
or kettle of aliens -
whatever you want to call it.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.030
Yes?

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.830
&gt;&gt; We don't' have a
particularly good history

00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:01.410
of utopian communities on earth.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:06.860
They don't last long, why would
we do a better job in space?

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.680
&gt;&gt; Christopher Ketcham: So the
question is why would we want

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.550
to do a utopian community in space
since they haven't worked on earth?

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:21.900
Again, I'm not advocating for
something that is not allowed

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.110
to change as which
utopian communities are.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:31.350
What I'm trying to explore with
this is the early iterations

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.200
of what we're going
to have to deal with.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.190
If we look at a - the
original moon launch,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.710
even the international
space station.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.440
They are in some respects utopian
communities because they operate

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.720
in a command and control model
that says in order to be successful

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:54.020
in what we're doing we have to
create this kind of an environment,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.610
which includes restrictions
on people,

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:59.420
etc. But what I'm saying is
there's going to be an evolution

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.900
of community out there from more
of a command, control situation

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.310
as these things get larger.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.680
But we need to have a way of
preventing some of the kinds

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.330 position:56%
of problems that we've had on earth.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:18.420
What happens if there's a pull
pot on the Martian colony?

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.440
When is anyone going to be able

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.670
to get there unless
we've parked you know,

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.800
the Star Ship Enterprise
outside of Mars

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.660
to be able to take care of that?

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.310 position:56%
So we have a whole different way of
looking at things it says going back

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:39.050
to your other questions about can
we do something better in space

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:40.560
than we've done on earth?

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.130
So there's kind of an equilibrium
there as far as the discussions

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:48.570
of what we're dealing with when we
can progress to different layers

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.300
of governance and different
forms of governance.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:55.890
Maybe there are ways of once we
figure out how to terraform mars,

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:01.390
of actually doing a go west young
man type of approach to let people

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.230
who are coming in and
populating the areas

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:09.590
so that we can improve the amount
of oxygen coming from the plants

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:11.540
that are expected to grow there.

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.000
So there's all sorts of
opportunities for evolving.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.210
But I think the word
justice, you know

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:22.850
and specifically John Rauls
definition of justice.

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:27.100
Justice is fairness, given the
situation and what we're talking

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.080
about and even the
laws, law of people.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.980
What are the basic rights
of humans and animals

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.560
and even plants and other places?

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.180
We need to look at those particular
things, ask those questions

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:45.370
to be able to define
space communities

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.060
and they're going to be different.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.440
You're going to have small
communities in asteroid belt.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.360
Large communities perhaps on mars.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:58.350
And perhaps some wild
thing that's headed off

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:03.230
to Alpha Centauri those are all
going to be different environments

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.010
and are going to require
different forms

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.580
of at least initial governance.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.650
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: Any
other questions?

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:19.260
I hope we have continuous
discussion on this topic.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:23.510
Please join me thanking
today's speaker.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:26.500
