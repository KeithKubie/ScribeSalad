Hey it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. This is different, it's really

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.070
a big deal. I have been invited to go to
the White House to sit down with the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.890
President of the United States of
America for 10 to 12 minutes to discuss

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.230
issues that matter to me and matter to
you. This is a huge honour and I want

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.520
to get it right. The interview is framed
as a response to the State of the Union

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.140
address which you can watch on Tuesday
at 9 p.m. Eastern time at youtube.com/whitehouse

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
I would love for this to be
different. I want to ask questions about

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.530
scientific topics, something I care about. What about the personal things about

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.699
being the president? Wouldn't that be cool? We have a huge opportunity here. The

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.600
format is going to be really cool, they
created a small version of my office that's

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.440
going to be there at the White House so
we can just hang out and talk like we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.929
always do, except the President is there. We shot a short promo for it out in LA and I'll

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.629
introduce you to the other two YouTube creators that's gonna be there with me.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.760
Okay so we're in LA and they have created sets for us. This is the Smarter Every Day set

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.170
You got Ingrid

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.710
and sWooZie

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.430
- My good side. -[laughs]

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.550
This is where I'm at. [whispering] Gotta be quiet.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:32.450
["Hail to the Chief"-style music]

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.070
Ingird, you've got a lot of beauty stuff and
many other things right?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190
- And life things, you know?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.930
[music]

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.320
There is no other country on Earth where
something like this could happen and I'm

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.330
extremely excited and honored to be
taking part. So, here's how we're going to come up with questions:

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.630
Number one: click that link right there. It'll create a Tweet and automatically

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.280
populate the "YouTube Asks Obama" hashtag. Do that! I'll be filtering through those.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.050
Number two: leave an intelligent, respectful comment on this video or number three: go to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.720
the Ask Reddit thread I'm going to be making. People are going to be upvoting and downvoting;

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.310
we got to get the best questions in front
of the Commander-in-Chief. I'm most

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.800
excited about your science questions, and about your fun questions for the President.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.120
Anyway, please check those out and watch the thing. It's going to be live on January 15th

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.600
at youtube.com/whitehouse. So
that's it! I'm Destin, let's get smarter

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.400
every day, together, at the White House
with the President of the United States. Have a good one.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.920
