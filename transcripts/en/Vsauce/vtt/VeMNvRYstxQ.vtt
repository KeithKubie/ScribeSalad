00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.320
A vending machine toy capsule wall

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.160
and Charlie Sheen mask

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.559
Vsauce, Kevin here.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.660
This is Mind Blow.
You know Mario Kart's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.080
Rainbow Road?
Well, here's the rainbow walk way.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.939
It's a 52 metre panorama located on the
roof of a building in Denmark

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.260
and visitors can walk around.
Wow.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.679
So that's what life as a hula hoop looks like.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.570
Well, alright. And here's what the
tallest LEGO building looks like.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.629
Children in Brazil pieced together
500,000 LEGOs

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.440
and then a guy on a crane stacked them
over 102

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.670
feet.
The Reactable's an electronic musical

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.219
instrument with a tangible user
interface. By placing blocks on the table

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.309
and interfacing with the visual display,

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.980
a virtual modular synthesizer is operated and,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.380
okay, just check this out.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.560
Okay, now which one of these things is a robot?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.440
And time's up.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.510
Now, beer bot. Exploders guns are
kind of like a paintball gun

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.320
mixed with a water gun. They use amo
called "H2 Grow Exploders"

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.340
that can shoot up to 85 feet. These dairy
cows in China have been genetically

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.530
modified to produce human breast milk.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.160
Sun explosion.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.180
Hey, you kids want some wet ice cream? 
This amphibious ice cream van,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.000
the first of its kind, floats around
London and makes about as much sense as

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.020
trombone flame thrower.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.650
This flame bone is made up from plumbing, torch

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.180
and compressed air parts and shoots a 21 foot

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.200
fireball.
Which maybe the armor sleeve can stop.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.160
Equipped with a high-voltage stutter,
video camera and flash light.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.920
A pull pane preps the stutter
and a button on the palm activates it.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.150
It's encased with a hard shell and,
oh, there's Kevin Costner.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.450
Finally, here's the Zelda theme brought to you by

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.010
the Tesla Orchestra.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.980
I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.800
"The ages of a father and son add up to 66.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.810
"The father's age is the son's age reversed.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.140
"How old could they be?"
There are three possible answers/

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.130
The first person to get all 3 answers
right and name the anime reference

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.080
in this video will be our genius of the week.
So good luck.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.320
And as always,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.880
thanks for watching.
