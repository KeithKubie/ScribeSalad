[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:09.590
&gt;&gt; All right. Now we're on to the fun stuff. Can we start optimizing now?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.030
&gt;&gt; Yep. Let's just focus on the steps before

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.370
the render tree construction, so, the DOM and CSSOM,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.250
because those are usually the steps that are the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.250
worst offenders and make your page. Render very slowly.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.700
&gt;&gt; Well, we did talk about streaming HTML to the client as fast

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.820
as possible so the browser can start building the DOM. Is there anything else?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.950
&gt;&gt; So that's definitely one. What about the size of the HTML?

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.119
&gt;&gt; Hm. Well, I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.130
guess we should keep it as small as possible.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.860
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's another good one. Let's take

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.340
a look at some strategies that will help us

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.830
with this. Let's say we want to optimize the HTML file in front of us. The first

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.860
thing to notice is that we have CSS

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.560
comments, HTML comments, and JavaScript comments. Now, these comments

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.590
are very helpful for developers. But guess what

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.380
the browser's going to do when it encounters them.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.960
&gt;&gt; It's going to ignore them.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.390
&gt;&gt; Exactly. There's no point in even shipping them to the browser. We can

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.170
minify the file and reduce its size.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500
To learn more about minification check the link

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.710
in the instructor notes. Once you've done that you should also compress the file

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.800
and make sure they are cached by

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.640
the browser. Once again, check the instructor notes.
