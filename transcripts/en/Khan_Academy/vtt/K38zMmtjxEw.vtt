00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.000
Determine whether the
system has no solutions

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.344
or infinite solutions.

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:06.760
So they're telling us right
from the get go that we're not

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.340
going to have one nice,
clean solution here.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.374
So let's just try to
solve this system.

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:12.790
And so to solve
the system we want

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.040
to eliminate one variable first.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.710
So let's say we want to
focus on eliminating,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.600
let's eliminate the x's.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.160
So if we want to
eliminate the x's,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
if I multiply this
first equation over here

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.650
by negative 4, then this
will become a negative 8x

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.270
which should be able to cancel
out with this 8x over here.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.560
So let me multiply
it by negative 4.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.580
So times negative 4.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.000
So 2 times negative
4 is negative 8x.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.920
Negative 4y times
negative 4 is plus 16y.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.150
Negative 4 times
z is negative 4z.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.060
And then that is going to be
equal to negative 4 times 3

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.050
is negative 12.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.190
And then let me just
rewrite the second equation

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.410
right over here.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:05.190
We have 8x minus 2y
plus 4z is equal to 7.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.540
And now we can add
these two equations

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.250
and hopefully
eliminate the x terms.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.100
Negative 8x plus
8x, they eliminate.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.600
16y minus 2y is 14y.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.580
And then negative 4z plus
4z, those also eliminate.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.630
We were able to eliminate and
x and a z in one fell swoop.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.190
And so we get 14y
is equal to-- we

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.990
have negative 12
plus 7 is negative 5.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.544
We have negative
5, just like that.

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:36.960
And actually, we
could solve this.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.501
This is one equation
and one unknown.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:40.630
But we haven't used the
third constraint yet.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.080
We haven't used this
constraint over here.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.770
So we have-- we could
actually solve it.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:57.180
Just divide both sides by 14 and
we get y is equal to negative 5

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.100
over 14.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.910
So that's interesting,
but it doesn't necessarily

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.640
tell us much about
the solution just yet.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.162
You want to be very careful
about back substituting

00:02:07.162 --> 00:02:08.620
and all of that,
because we haven't

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.180
used all of the constraints yet.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.780
We still haven't used
this third constraint.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.930
So our goal was to eliminate
x's from the get go.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.430
So let's still try to eliminate
x's using these second two

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.047
constraints and see if we
get anything interesting.

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:21.880
And the reason why I'm
being especially wary

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.046
is because they're telling
us that this thing either

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:26.770
has no solutions or an
infinite number of solutions.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.839
So let's use these
second two constraints.

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.380
And we can eliminate
the x here if we

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.890
keep the first
equation the same.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.077
And we multiply the
second equation by 2,

00:02:34.077 --> 00:02:35.910
because this will become
a negative 8x which

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.180
will eliminate.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.260
So our first equation is just 8x
minus 2y plus 4z is equal to 7,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.345
just rewrote it.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:45.970
And then the second
equation over here.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.980
I'm going to multiply it by 2.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.586
Negative 4x times
2 is negative 8x.

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:57.550
y times 2 is plus
2y, positive 2y.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.830
Negative 2z times
2 is negative 4z.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.910
And then negative 14
times 2 is negative 28.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.180
And something very interesting
is about to happen.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.644
When you use these
two constraints, when

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:13.560
you try to find the
intersection, essentially,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.870
between these two planes, you
get something very bizarre.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.430
8x minus 8x is 0.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.170
Negative 2y plus
2y is another 0.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.030
4z minus 4z, another 0.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.712
And 7 minus 28 is negative 21.

00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:31.170
So using these two
constraints, you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.430
get this kind of nonsensical
statement or inconsistent

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.780
statement that 0 is
equal to negative 21.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.150
This obviously can never happen.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.510
So this is, we end
up with no solution.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.440
If we got something like
0 is equal to 0, or 21

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.080
is equal to 21, or
negative 21 is equal to 21,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.860
then it would mean that we have
the same exact planes which

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.160
would mean we have an
infinite number solutions.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.570
In this circumstance right here,
we have the same coefficients.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.830
But when you add them
up in this weighted way

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.520
you get a different result.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.150
So these are actually going
to be parallel planes.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.390
So if you were to graph
this plane and this plane,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.480
one would look
like that and then

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.126
the other would look like this.

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.209
And so that the only way
that they could intersect

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.800
is if 0 is equal to negative 21.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.290
And we know that's impossible.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.642
They never, ever intersect
these two planes.

00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.100
So regardless of this first
constraint and all of the stuff

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.460
we did here, these two
planes will never intersect,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.830
these two right over here.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.938
And so we have no solutions.
