00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.070
Let's go back and talk about pixels.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.540
By the way everybody know
what pixels stands for?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.910
Pixels stands for picture element.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.060
If you talked to a television
engineer thirty years ago,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.450
forty years ago, he talked about pels.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.890
Computer people call them pixels.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.320
Television people call them pels.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.290
Little bit of information.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.790
So we know that we have pixels
at every sort of location,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.130
x y in image it has some we'll
just use the word color for now.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.570
So let's zoom in on a little,
area, here and we take a look at

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.220
some particular pixel, and we can say,
that pixel's at X location,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.670
here it says 243, Y location of 84,
and what's the value in that pixel?

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.480
Well the value actually
was three of them, right?

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.560
And here they are.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.720
A red, a 150, a 173, and
81 written as R G and B values.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.225
Those are the values, the intensities
of each of the three channels.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:49.845
Red, green and blue.

00:00:49.845 --> 00:00:50.655
All right?

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.575
So, the color, here, are vectors.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.835
Remember, we talked about
them as being a vector image?

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.145
Right?
So, at every location,

00:00:57.145 --> 00:00:59.575
we get a different vector.

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:03.930
By the way, you see, over here, on this
white pixel, it says 254, 255, 251.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.010
This is obviously an eight bit
image that goes from zero to 255.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.610
If this was a floating point number
that we let go from zero to one or

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.293
floating point image, then that would
be you know 0.98, 0.999 or 1.0 and

00:01:15.293 --> 00:01:17.540
0.97 or something like.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.480
All right.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.240
So those three values together,
give you the perceived color.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.880
When you're displaying an image,
what you're really doing

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.290
is you're plotting a different
locations on the screen.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.630
A vector by essentially turning on a red
light or green light and a blue light.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.690
You're essentially doing a plot of
those colors, but when you look at it,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.390
it looks like a, picture, alright?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.150
What would happen if instead
of plotting them in x y,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.520
you plotted them in RGB space?

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.820
Okay?
So you're going to make them be the same

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.560
color as before, but you're going to put
them down in a, in a three dimensional

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.405
space not according to x, y, but
according to what their RGB value is.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.075
Well, so here I have that
same little picture, and

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.225
I pull out the first, pixel.

00:02:04.225 --> 00:02:07.405
And you can see here that red is 152,
green 50, blue 40.

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:12.405
So that's what down here and
this is in this three dimensional space.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.522
All right?
All right?

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:17.652
Here's another point closer to white, so
it's all the way up, in the corner, and

00:02:17.652 --> 00:02:20.372
finally, here's a,
third point, all right?

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:24.632
So these are plotting these
pixels in the RGB Space.

00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:27.952
So we go from Image Space
to Color Space.

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:32.862
So, let's take those fruit pixels,
and plot them all in RGB Space.

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:34.340
What would that look like?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.800
Well, it would look like this, and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.410
this is sort of, kind of an elegant,
three dimensional, plot of that.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.690
And what you can notice right away
is that the pixels are sort of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.190
grouped, right?

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.490
These kind of reddish pixels presumably
have something to do with the apples.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.010
You know, what are these whitish pixels,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.790
we'll they're going to
be the background.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.350
And here are these yellowish pixels,
probably have to do with the oranges.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.190
And you start to think about, you know,
we might be able to use your location in

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.540
color space, to try to segment out
the different parts of the image.
