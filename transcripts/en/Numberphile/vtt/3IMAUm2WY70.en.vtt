00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Gonna write it down. So here we go.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm not even gonna try and say it cause it's a bit too big.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.340
Two three eight five

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.260
seven nine.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.560
Like your salary?

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.980
Yeah, something like that, eh?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.160
So I'll tell you something funny about this number, and I will say why this is interesting.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.720
This number happens to be 13 times 53 squared

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.000
times three eight five three

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.640
times nine six one seven nine. Now the funny thing about that is what I've written down there is the prime

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600
factorization of this number. So all these are the prime numbers, these - 13 is prime, 53 is prime,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.919
3,853 is prime, and 96,179 is prime.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.020
So this is the prime factorization of this number, but look at how you could have got this number.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.460
There's your 13, right?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
There's your 53.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.860
There's your 2.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.660
There's your three eight five three, and there's your nine six one seven nine.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.100
What have we done here? I haven't done this. This is a guy called James Davis.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
He's not a mathematician as far as we understand, we're not really sure who he is,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.000
who's actually very recently come up with a counterexample

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.120
to one of John Conway's $1,000 problems that he's posed.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.080
John Conway - big guy, big famous mathematician, you know, very important.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.500
He's come up with these five problems, the idea being if anybody can solve them or you know, find counter examples, that sort of thing,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.420
then they'll - he will give them $1,000.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.420
And so we're accustomed really in mathematics to have these problems

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.720
that you don't expect to see solved in your lifetime.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.120
So I think he owes this guy James Davis $1,000 right? and here's why,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.500
so what was the problem that that John Conway posed?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.940
Well, it's the idea of climbing to a prime.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.580
So if I take any number, so for example 60, say,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.460
then what I do is I write down the prime factorization of this number.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.000
So in the case of 60, that's 2 squared

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.680
times 3 times 5.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.500
Now what I do is - this is the iteration that John Conway suggested is -

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.480
all those powers, I bring them down. Okay?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.000
So I write this as two two three five.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.560
So I now get the number 2235.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.820
Now I do the prime factorization again, so this happens to be

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640
3 times 5

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.260
times one four nine.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.460
So now you use this, you do the iteration again, you create a new number,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.480
and the new number of course is going to be three five one four nine. OK.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.980
This is a prime number, OK?

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.520
So John Conway's conjecture was if you do this process,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.300
you carry out this process for any number, you'll always end up with a prime number.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.800
So just to give you another example

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.060
let's take 25, say. It's of course 5 squared. So 5 squared, I bring down the 2 so I make 52.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.000
Okay. 52 is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.860
2 squared

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.720
times 13.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.700
And so I bring down the 2,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.780
so that's two two one three and that's prime. Okay.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.620
So it seems to work, well it's worked in two cases. That's hardly a proof, right?

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.940
But no, there's many examples of this.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.000
It wasn't - no counterexamples were known.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.820
If you take the number 20 for example, people have done over a hundred iterations of this, this procedure.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.020
Still not managed to climb to a prime yet. 20 is a bit of a funny one.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.600
But anyway, there was no known counter example to this

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.600
until just a few days ago, this guy James Davis responded to a post that a blogger,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.880
a mathematician blogger called Hans Havermann had put on the Internet discussing this.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
So this is a few months - this is about 7 or 8 months old, this post.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.180
And then the other day James Davis posted "I've got a solution to this."

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880
And here was his solution.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.760
So what he realized of course was that if you get caught in a loop, you end up going back to the same number,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.660
then you have a counterexample, right? Because you're always supposed to end at a prime, right?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.860
So if you get caught in a loop, you're never going to end up at a prime.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.840
So this is one loop later.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.120
Just straightaway you hit a loop, right, you start off with this number, you do the prime factorization,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.740
and then you drop all the powers in the way that we've just described, and you end up back with the same number, okay?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.920
So this straightaway is a counterexample to the conjecture,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.980
so this is how he's earned his, you know, his thousand dollars.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.440
And it's kind of - I think it's kind of nice that you know, today,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.420
even today that, you know, people can without being professional mathematicians, professional physicists, whatever,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.040
that they can still come out and actually have an impact. This is a lovely example of it.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.740
I don't know. I don't like thinking of my impending death.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.360
And, you know, I haven't got all that many years left. I don't quite know how many.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.000
But I do still like doing mathematical things so I do.
