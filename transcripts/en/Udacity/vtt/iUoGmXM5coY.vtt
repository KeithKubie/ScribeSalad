00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.818
Well let's see.
When I plug in x = 0,

00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:03.440
I just get 0 + y is 10.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.150
Which means y is 10.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.592
If I plug two I get 2 times 2 + y = 10.

00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:12.845
Which is 4 + y =10.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.980
And if I subtract 4 from both sides,
I find that y = 6.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.680
And I can go through similar thinking
to find when x is 4, y is 2.
