the vision we have at the center is to

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389
the vision we have at the center is to
 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.150
the vision we have at the center is to
develop technology to help people live

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160
develop technology to help people live
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.250
develop technology to help people live
independently and for that we are

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260
independently and for that we are
 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.470
independently and for that we are
thinking of various systems to help you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480
thinking of various systems to help you
 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.510

this technology is something that gives

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780
this technology is something that gives
 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.310
this technology is something that gives
one the newfound capabilities or

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
one the newfound capabilities or
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.280

preserves capabilities and that in

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290
preserves capabilities and that in
 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.700
preserves capabilities and that in
itself might have a more profound effect

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
itself might have a more profound effect
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.040
itself might have a more profound effect
on their quality of life because they

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050
on their quality of life because they
 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.110
on their quality of life because they
feel better about themselves and what

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
feel better about themselves and what
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.889
feel better about themselves and what
they can do one of the very important

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899
they can do one of the very important
 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.110
they can do one of the very important
activities within the center is what we

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
activities within the center is what we
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.410
activities within the center is what we
call person and society thrust we have a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420
call person and society thrust we have a
 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.100
call person and society thrust we have a
group of people who work with us to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110
group of people who work with us to
 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.230
group of people who work with us to
connect us with the users and evaluate

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
connect us with the users and evaluate
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.300
connect us with the users and evaluate
what we're trying to do and what we have

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310
what we're trying to do and what we have
 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.410
what we're trying to do and what we have
done from users point of view quality of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420
done from users point of view quality of
 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.969
done from users point of view quality of
life technology really couldn't be done

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979
life technology really couldn't be done
 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.330
life technology really couldn't be done
anywhere else than here because of the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
anywhere else than here because of the
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.749
anywhere else than here because of the
assets that we have because of the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759
assets that we have because of the
 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.699
assets that we have because of the
assets within the university one of the

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709
assets within the university one of the
 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.440
assets within the university one of the
things that we would love to see happen

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450
things that we would love to see happen
 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.859
things that we would love to see happen
is that there is a contribution from

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869
is that there is a contribution from
 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.010
is that there is a contribution from
every department on campus and so a way

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
every department on campus and so a way
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.319
every department on campus and so a way
to seed these new types of interactions

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329
to seed these new types of interactions
 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.779
to seed these new types of interactions
between and among the various

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789
between and among the various
 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.069
between and among the various
researchers particularly ones who

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079
researchers particularly ones who
 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.739
researchers particularly ones who
haven't yet gotten involved that's a

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749
haven't yet gotten involved that's a
 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.649
haven't yet gotten involved that's a
part of our recipe for not just growth

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659
part of our recipe for not just growth
 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.169
part of our recipe for not just growth
but successful growth well the societal

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179
but successful growth well the societal
 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.589
but successful growth well the societal
needs for quality of life technology is

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:50.599
needs for quality of life technology is
 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.419
needs for quality of life technology is
obvious the world is getting older

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429
obvious the world is getting older
 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.629
obvious the world is getting older
unless we have technological advancement

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639
unless we have technological advancement
 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.839
unless we have technological advancement
to reduce the cost to make it make the

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849
to reduce the cost to make it make the
 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.770
to reduce the cost to make it make the
help accessible by everybody

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780
help accessible by everybody
 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.010
help accessible by everybody
the situation will be worsen we have a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
the situation will be worsen we have a
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.280
the situation will be worsen we have a
leadership position now and to advance

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
leadership position now and to advance
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.330
leadership position now and to advance
that position and become a really a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
that position and become a really a
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.460
that position and become a really a
global presence in creation and then

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
global presence in creation and then
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.850
global presence in creation and then
commercialization of these new

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
commercialization of these new
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.030
commercialization of these new
technologies that's part of our

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
technologies that's part of our
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040
technologies that's part of our
opportunity that's part of our destiny I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
opportunity that's part of our destiny I
 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.880
opportunity that's part of our destiny I
believe

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
