JENNA TAYLOR: Welcome.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.480
Thank you everybody for
being here with us today.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.800
And to our friends on
livestream and later on YouTube,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.712
also thank you for joining us.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.420
I'm Jenna Taylor.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.890
I'm one of your food program
managers here in the Bay Area,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.720
and I am super
excited to welcome you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.794
to our panel in honor of
Women's History Month.

00:00:21.794 --> 00:00:23.460
We are graced with
the presence of three

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.090
amazing female culinarians--

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.520
Tracy Des Jardins, Joanne
Weir, and Tanya Holland.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.805
Welcome to Google.

00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:31.200
TANYA HOLLAND: Thank you.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.920
JOANNE WEIR: Thank you.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.128
TRACI DES JARDINS: Thank you.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510
JENNA TAYLOR: So I assume
everybody here knows you well,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.440
as I do.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.480
But introduce yourself.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.810
Give me your-- how do
you identify yourself?

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.990
Knowing you're all
women of many talents.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.180
When you meet someone,
you say, I'm Tanya.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.635
I'm--

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.260
TANYA HOLLAND: Chef and owner of
Brown Sugar Kitchen restaurant

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.000
in Oakland.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.350
I always like to make sure
people know it's in Oakland.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.340
JENNA TAYLOR: What
about you, Joanne?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.280
JOANNE WEIR: So, I do a
lot of different things.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.440
I've written-- I'm
a cookbook writer,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.570
I've written 17 cookbooks.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.170
I own a restaurant in Sausalito,
Copita, modern Mexican.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.460
I have a television show.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.500
I've been on television
for 17 years--

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.150
PBS and Create.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.870
And there's one more
thing-- oh, and I also--

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.320
I actually teach all over.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.470
I'm really a teacher first.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.261
I probably should have
said teaching first.

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:34.440
But I rent villas in Italy,
France, Spain, Morocco,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.810
and Greece, and I
spend weeks each year,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.400
four weeks each year,
Spring and Fall,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.457
to take people to
spend a week with me

00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:42.540
in these beautiful villas.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960
So I do a lot of
different things.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.365
I love my job.

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.240
JENNA TAYLOR: Sounds
like a job worth loving.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.145
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.027
Tracy, what about you?

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:53.860
TRACI DES JARDINS: I
always introduce myself

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.910
as Tracy Des Jardins,
chef and restaurateur.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.140
I'm based in San Francisco.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.802
I like to call myself a cook.

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:02.010
And that's how I started out.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.140
That's what I still am--

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.280
I'm sort of most
grounded in that world

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.699
of the tactile
relationship with food.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.729
So that's kind of--

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.020
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.561
In fact, I'm very
interested in that.

00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:13.680
How did you start out?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.200
How did you-- what made you
want to become a cook or a chef?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.194
TRACI DES JARDINS: I went
to college when I was 16.

00:02:22.194 --> 00:02:23.610
I graduated from
high school early

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.470
and went to UC
Santa Cruz and kind

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.300
of bottomed out pretty quickly.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.480
And I had a passion
for two things--

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.560
skiing and cooking.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.700
And I'd taken cooking on as a
hobby when I was in high school

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.140
and skied my whole life.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.820
And my parents were
really pissed at me,

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.950
so they weren't going to support
my desire to be a ski bum.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.230
And so I said, OK, well,
I'm going to become a cook.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.520
And I quickly landed in a really
serious kitchen in Los Angeles.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.190
And I didn't ski
for like 15 years.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.310
So it didn't exactly turn out
the way that I had intended,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.954
but I can't complain.

00:02:57.954 --> 00:02:59.370
JENNA TAYLOR: So
first let me say,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.610
I also went to UC
Santa Cruz, so you're

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.420
in the presence of
multiple Banana Slugs.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.760
TRACI DES JARDINS:
All right, cool.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.843
JENNA TAYLOR: But beyond--

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:09.119
you also went to Europe
and trained, didn't you?

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.410
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yeah, I did.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.210
JENNA TAYLOR: Tell us just a
little bit about what that's

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.190
like, not only as an
American-- which I know

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.530
makes it difficult--
but as a woman.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.577
Do you feel like it was
a different experience?

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:20.160
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Yeah, so this was--

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.000
I went to France to work
for the first time in 1986.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680
And I worked in four
different kitchens in France.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.310
Two of them were three star
kitchens, and two of them--

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.180
Michelin-- three star kitchens,
and two were two stars.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.230
I was the only woman in
all of those kitchens.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.660
And I was the only
American in three

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.030
out of four of those kitchens.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.440
And so it was--

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.530
I was kind of way ahead of
the curve in terms of people

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.834
who started looking at going
to Europe and studying food.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.500
At that point in time,
there were really

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.390
not restaurants in
the United States

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.817
that were of that same caliber.

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:06.150
We didn't have restaurants
then like the French Laundry,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.312
and Alinea, and all of
these Michelin two and three

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.020
star restaurants.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.780
And so if you really wanted
that kind of exposure,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.089
you had to go to France.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.630
And France was kind
of the stronghold

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.180
at that point in time for
that tier of restaurants.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.010
So it was very difficult,
to answer your question.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.680
It was-- I didn't speak
French when I went.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
Although I had food
technology-- those terms

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.270
were part of the vernacular
that we used in kitchens here.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.830
But it was a new frontier.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.000
But I lived and breathed
what I was doing and had

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.950
a strong desire to take what
I could from that experience.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.980
And so I could ignore
a lot of the stuff that

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.114
was really challenging.

00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:46.530
JENNA TAYLOR: I
think we all learn

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.989
how to filter that stuff out
when we're doing what we love,

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:49.488
right?

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.760
TRACI DES JARDINS: Exactly.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.301
JENNA TAYLOR: Joanne,
what about you?

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:55.620
How did you decide you wanted
to be a chef or a cook?

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.260
JOANNE WEIR: I don't think
I really had a choice.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.345
My mother was a professional
cook, my grandfather,

00:05:00.345 --> 00:05:01.220
my great grandmother.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.000
So for me it was just--

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.070
I learned food from the
time I was an infant.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.680
Food was very important
in my family's home.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.010
I remember going and spending
every single Saturday

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.630
during the summer
at my grandfather's

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.490
farm in the Berkshires.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.550
And he had butchered
the chicken.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.170
He had made the rolls.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.110
He had everything-- made
homemade mayonnaise.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.790
He made potato chips.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.470
We would sit under
the maple trees,

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.630
and they were these
beautiful maple trees

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.700
that he had even made
his own maple syrup.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.330
And we would have maple
walnut ice cream for dessert

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.260
that he hand churned.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.170
So for me--

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.340
I thought every kid
grew up like that.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.160
I really did.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.980
I just had this very
charmed, delicious kind

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.380
of upbringing from both
sides of my family.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.590
So I think for me, really,
food was just something

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.060
that was just in my blood.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.810
JENNA TAYLOR: It's just life.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.310
JOANNE WEIR: But I
did go to school.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.170
I studied fine arts
and also art education.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.280
And I taught in
Boston for a few years

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.252
before I said, oh
my god, I can't do

00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:02.460
this for the rest of my life.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.380
And then I went to study--

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.450
and then I started cooking
with Madeleine Kamman.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.180
So very strong female
role models in my life.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.660
My mother and Madeleine
Kamman and Alice Waters.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.969
So that's kind of my
background with food.

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:17.885
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.579
What about you, Tanya?

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.620
TANYA HOLLAND: I've been
fascinated with kitchens

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.570
since I was little.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.780
So my-- one thing I remember
growing up-- when I was five,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.080
we moved into our first home.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.360
And in the garage I had
a miniature refrigerator

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.420
stored in the sink.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.230
And I was always in
there making something.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.630
I don't know.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.430
And then I got my
Easy Bake Oven,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.620
and my dad showed me how to
make my first cake from scratch.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.520
And my parents are
from the South,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.930
and they had this
gourmet cooking

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.054
club when I was growing up.

00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:48.230
So all our entertainment
and social life

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.420
was around cooking
and entertaining.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.270
So when I got to
college, like Joanne,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.006
I thought everybody
lived like this.

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:56.630
None of my kids--
um, none of my kids--

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.487
none of my fellow
classmates knew how to cook.

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:01.820
They were all ramen noodles
and peanut butter and jelly.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.220
And so I started hosting dinner
parties and started studying.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.780
Ended up with a degree--

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.072
JENNA TAYLOR: It worked out OK.

00:07:09.072 --> 00:07:10.613
TANYA HOLLAND: Ended
up with a degree

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:12.240
in Russian language
and literature.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.660
Didn't really do a lot with
that until two years ago,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.532
which I'll explain later.

00:07:17.532 --> 00:07:20.080
And then after school
I started working

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.660
in restaurants in college.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.910
But I worked in the front
of the house for seven years

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.330
before I went to cooking
school in France.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.329
And then I knew I wanted
to be a restaurateur,

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.870
but I really wanted
to know the food.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.000
A lot of the most
successful restaurants

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.750
are chef owner operated.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.460
So--

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.918
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
how do you feel

00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:40.400
that front-of-house time
informs your experience

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.360
as a restaurateur?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.650
TANYA HOLLAND: Oh, it's great.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.400
It's significant.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.730
And I think both sides
should experience

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.690
working on both sides.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.055
You have understanding for their
needs of timing and information

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:55.570
and education as a chef.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.930
What's necessary?

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.300
Also you know what's possible
and what's not possible.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.899
But I think, yeah,
it's really important.

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:06.190
JENNA TAYLOR: One of the
things we were talking about--

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.650
spoiler alert,
before we started--

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.490
is this really
fascinating correlation

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.020
between what I see as women
in tech and women in food.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.340
They're both traditionally
male-dominated industries.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.710
And I think there's
still a lot of work

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.820
to be done in order to get
some measure of equity--

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.550
if we ever get there.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.980
What is-- I'm very
interested in your thoughts

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.740
on-- how can we move the needle?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.610
Google's trying to do a
lot of work at our scale.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.400
But what does that look
like in the food industry?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.309
How can we affect change
in bringing more women

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:44.720
to the fore?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.220
Anyone.

00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:50.210
JOANNE WEIR: It seems so strange
to me that we even say this.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.754
Because I always think
of women as the cooks.

00:08:53.754 --> 00:08:54.920
I mean, we're the nurturers.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.539
So for me, when I worked at Chez
Panisse, I was the only woman.

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.080
Like Traci said, I
was the only woman

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.960
in the kitchen for about
three years in the cafe.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.180
And honestly, I didn't think
really anything about that.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.002
I really didn't see it as odd.

00:09:11.002 --> 00:09:12.710
It's only now that I
feel like I'm really

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.240
looking at that much more.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.820
I don't know.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.300
TRACI DES JARDINS: I
used to think that we

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.340
should ignore the gender--

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.580
I mean, the way that I got
through the obstacles that

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.830
stood in my way was to
never really think about it.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.100
And to kind of think of
myself as just one of the guys

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.970
and get through it.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.430
And for a long time I sort of
said, you can't focus on that.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.510
And didn't really believe that
as a female chef, restaurateur,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:47.300
running kitchen, that I should
actually help or facilitate

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.870
women's betterment
in the kitchen,

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.747
or really promote them, or
give them an extra hand.

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:53.330
I just thought, oh,
I'm going to treat

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.010
everyone exactly the same.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.174
And I think that that
obligation actually

00:09:57.174 --> 00:09:58.340
needs to shift a little bit.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.920
And we who have made it
need to extend ourselves

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.310
beyond just sort of that
standard of treating everyone

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.880
the same and
facilitate a leg up.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.410
And that doesn't
mean that you have

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.410
to make choices differently or
necessarily that you would hire

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.220
somebody that was
less talented, per se,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.510
but just to seek resources
and support and access.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:27.770
And that's something I've
set about personally to do

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.060
is to kind of try and reach
my hand out a little bit

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.774
and give a leg up where I can.

00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:33.190
JOANNE WEIR: I
think that's great.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.270
One of the things I
said to you before--

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.220
I did this--

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.380
I was a judge for
the Good Food Awards.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.807
And I was telling you this.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.390
I was talking to
John Scharffenberger,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.530
and we were just
sitting there and having

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.530
this great conversation.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.130
And this young woman walked
up and she said, Joanne,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.800
I want to talk to you
just for a second.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.466
She said, I'm so sorry
to interrupt you,

00:10:51.466 --> 00:10:53.860
but I want to thank you,
because you've been such a role

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.450
model for women in the kitchen.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.980
And honestly, I was shocked.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.612
I had never, ever
thought about that.

00:10:58.612 --> 00:11:01.070
And I'm telling you-- that was
like two or three years ago.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.910
I had never-- and I'm just
curious, have you ever

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.520
thought about that yourselves?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.380
TANYA HOLLAND: I think about
it all the time, personally.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.049
And I want to quote this.

00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:12.840
There was a woman--

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.190
I was at an event
not too long ago--

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.324
and she said a line.

00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:17.740
I was like, I'm
going to say that.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.580
So I've been a black
woman my entire life.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.480
I don't know any other thing.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.270
So I don't know which experience
is really affecting some

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.940
of the challenges I've had.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.120
Am I being-- is it
gender or is it race?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.704
And it's both.

00:11:30.704 --> 00:11:31.995
And I can't really separate it.

00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.460
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
probably both.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.650
TANYA HOLLAND: But I never--

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.070
point is, I didn't
see a lot of people

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.410
who looked like me
doing what I wanted

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.100
do coming up in
restaurants, and I never

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.320
found the mentor that I wanted.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.300
My goal is to
mentor and to become

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:48.130
that role model for young women
of color, or people of color,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:55.660
or just whoever wants to
get access to information.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.280
Access to opportunity that
I blatantly did not receive

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.740
because of what I look like.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.915
Whichever reason that could be.

00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:06.040
JENNA TAYLOR: That's great.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.873
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah.

00:12:06.873 --> 00:12:08.680
JENNA TAYLOR: I think
it's interesting.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.470
Because you go back between--

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.950
I started my career
in construction

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.410
and now being in food--
clearly both very

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:16.060
male-dominated fields.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.380
And I saw at a young age, the
choices were-- act like a man

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.372
or be ostracized as other.

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:27.080
And I don't like either
of those choices.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.420
MULTIPLE SPEAKERS: No.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:28.160
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.785
TRACI DES JARDINS: I think that
that's a really important point

00:12:30.785 --> 00:12:33.994
that I think that we
have tried to define

00:12:33.994 --> 00:12:35.410
successful women
in the same terms

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.030
that we define successful men.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.950
And we're such
different creatures

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.220
that we need to actually come
up with really different ways

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.590
to value women's qualities.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.110
And they're not going
to be qualities that

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.606
are the same as successful men.

00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:49.980
JENNA TAYLOR: Nor
should they be.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.040
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Nor should they be.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.873
And that's where we
have to really break out

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:53.917
of this thinking.

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:56.500
And I think that's where we get
into this, "powerful women are

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.615
bitches" or any of
this kind of stuff.

00:12:57.615 --> 00:12:59.740
TANYA HOLLAND: That's what
I was going to say also.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.540
When we have similar
attributes as men,

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.990
if we're ambitious, if we're
stern, if we're direct,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.510
then it's also translated in
such a different language.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:07.930
JENNA TAYLOR:
We're intimidating.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.300
TRACI DES JARDINS: Absolutely.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.970
JENNA TAYLOR: And
she's so bitchy.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.330
TRACI DES JARDINS: Bitchy.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.010
Right, right.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.677
Bitchy.

00:13:11.677 --> 00:13:13.510
JOANNE WEIR: I was in
a meeting with women--

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.370
with several powerful
women the other day.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:21.117
And a man kind of lost it in
a very unprofessional way.

00:13:21.117 --> 00:13:23.200
And all the women in the
room looked at each other

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.320
like, I'd never
get away with this.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.090
But I'm so interested
in a new paradigm.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.120
There has to be a way,
to your exact point,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.190
to represent an
other that can be

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.720
prominent and unique and
special and doesn't have to be

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.592
replicative of what's existing.

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:44.800
TRACI DES JARDINS: And that's
the model that we need,

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.008
and that we need to look
for, and we need to support.

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:48.330
Because you even see--

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.906
I think you even see women
categorizing women like that.

00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:52.030
JENNA TAYLOR: Very much so.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.070
TRACI DES JARDINS: And
that's super problematic.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.690
We don't support each
other, I think, often.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.110
And we criticize
certain attributes,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.646
and that's just not going to
get us where we need to go.

00:14:02.646 --> 00:14:05.020
TANYA HOLLAND: Well, and also
the expectation that's set.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.490
This is definitely
something that

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.020
comes up in race discussions.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.682
When people have
low expectations--

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.140
I've had that happen
to me, myself.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.610
And they're like,
you speak languages?

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.250
You went to college?

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.541
It's like, yeah, uh-huh, I did.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:15.450
But also--

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.750
JENNA TAYLOR: Which languages?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.712
Russian.

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:20.170
TANYA HOLLAND: They
don't expect us

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.350
to have these-- to be driven.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.540
Or they have expectations
of, like, oh, she's

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.380
got to be matronly
and nurturing.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.690
And I have people who-- that's
their projection towards me.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.020
I'm like, no, I'm good.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.140
I don't need to pretend
to be your mother.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.200
So there's-- like you said,
something's got to change

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.270
around--

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:39.910
TRACI DES JARDINS:
There's one more point

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.368
I'd like to make
on this, because I

00:14:41.368 --> 00:14:43.900
think it's really important.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.890
I actually have not felt
that much discrimination

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.510
coming up through the ranks.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.120
And I don't feel that my
gender actually held me back.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.950
And sometimes I think it
was actually it was a plus.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.430
But age-- I just
turned 50 last year.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.310
And now I'm really
feeling that sense

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.700
of discrimination in our world
that I never felt before.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.605
And it is crushing.

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:14.320
It makes me really
angry, because I

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.330
think we've got a huge
issue in this country

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.710
in particular around age.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.820
And particularly--
absolutely against women.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.990
Because it's fine--

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.698
JOANNE WEIR: You mean,
why you can't even

00:15:24.698 --> 00:15:25.900
tell your age, actually.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.750
TRACI DES JARDINS: Well, I do.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.874
I make a point of doing it.

00:15:27.874 --> 00:15:30.624
JOANNE WEIR: Well,
you might not after.

00:15:30.624 --> 00:15:32.290
JENNA TAYLOR: But I
think it works-- age

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.830
can work in both directions.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.740
Like, I experienced it as being
a young woman in an industry

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.320
where-- disrespected
by older men.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.870
So it seems the
theme that I hear

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.300
is that really
erasing all of that

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.510
categorically, to have it
be more about authenticity

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.590
and representing, to your
point, like an authentic self

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.951
as a role model, not a "woman"
or a specific type of role

00:15:56.951 --> 00:15:57.450
model.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.290
But just that seeing more
successful authentic people

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:06.300
of all types be more prominent
and outspoken about that

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.800
could potentially have impact.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.100
TRACI DES JARDINS: Absolutely.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.810
TANYA HOLLAND: Well,
I think we don't all

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.730
want to be defined by
how we are outwardly.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.970
I mean, I get that a lot,
where I get put into a box

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.770
and defined by how I look.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.214
And I never define
myself that way.

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:22.380
But you realize when you
go into a room, or a space,

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.210
or whatever, and people--

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.380
they think they have
you figured out.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.020
And we all do--

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.270
I guess we all profile
to a certain extent.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.370
JENNA TAYLOR: It seems
that-- yeah, absolutely.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.210
I think we do.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.500
And I think a lot-- especially
being at Google-- about the way

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:43.620
that technology and media
and the accessibility

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.965
of information-- like
this is going to be

00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:48.510
livestream and on YouTube.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.970
So what is essentially a
pretty intimate conversation

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.600
here could potentially
reach thousands of people,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.799
and I believe it will.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:59.340
What do you guys
think about the ways

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.160
that we can leverage technology
to move this conversation

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.920
across a larger scale?

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.270
Is that useful?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.030
And if not, what do we do?

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.230
Grassroots?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.230
Community?

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.710
The Women's March on--

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.900
around the-- I was going
to say on Washington,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.310
but I was in Oakland,
and it was big there.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.685
JOANNE WEIR: I
was in Washington,

00:17:20.685 --> 00:17:22.788
and it was very, very powerful.

00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:24.829
JENNA TAYLOR: Clearly
there was a presence there.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.037
TRACI DES JARDINS: It was
incredible and peaceful and

00:17:27.037 --> 00:17:29.030
positive.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.580
JOANNE WEIR: And supportive.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:30.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Right.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.660
Not a single arrest.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.868
TRACI DES JARDINS: Inclusive.

00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:34.610
JENNA TAYLOR:
Inclusive of everyone.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.920
So the power's there.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.959
How do we tap into it?

00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:39.500
JOANNE WEIR: That's
what we're trying

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.575
to figure out through
conversations like this.

00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:42.950
TANYA HOLLAND:
And like you said,

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.990
it's about access for anyone,
whether it's minority or women.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.279
Someone asked me
earlier today, what

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:52.070
is one of your biggest
business challenges?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:56.000
And I said, access to capital,
access to real estate,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.470
access to information.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:58.000
Access.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.840
That's it.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.870
I am motivated.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.995
I am direct.

00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:02.120
I know exactly what I want.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.240
But if doors don't
open, if you're not

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.450
at the table where certain
parties who can influence

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.470
and effect change,
then what can you

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.149
do if you don't have access?

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:16.190
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yeah,
and that's a real thing.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.670
I mean, I look at
some of my peers

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.369
who've been on a
parallel trajectory.

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.410
And a lot of them have
been a lot more successful

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.840
than I have, because they've
had business partners that

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.450
have swept in and
done that part of it.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.810
I mean, I'm kind of a one-woman
show in terms of not having

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.000
that absolute business partner.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.280
I've tried a few
times and actually not

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.590
had great success with
finding the right person.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.169
And so I do all
that stuff myself.

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:43.710
So I'm doing the
business side of it,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.570
and I'm doing the
creative side of it.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.590
And it's a lot.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.050
It's really cumbersome.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.900
And it's-- and I look
at my peers out there,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.840
and they've got it nailed.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.910
And they've got
somebody that's managing

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.080
that whole side of fundraising
and real estate acquisition

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.010
and all of that stuff.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.100
And there are probably
a lot of reasons

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.440
why that's the case, but--

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.024
JOANNE WEIR: I do have a really
strong partner, Larry Mindel

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:10.190
being a very strong partner.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.600
And I've learned a ton from him.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.240
But also, he's great
about working with women

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.400
and very respectful.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.500
And so I've had a
really great experience.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.810
I've been really lucky.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.830
And I also came to
restaurants very late.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.230
I mean, I've only been
in this for five years.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.340
You've been how many?

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.660
TRACI DES JARDINS: 34.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.410
TANYA HOLLAND: 30.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:39.020
As Traci was saying, I can give
a lot of examples of her peers

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.220
who are male that
are not as talented,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.340
but they get the access.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.905
And they have major--

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:47.030
TRACI DES JARDINS: Empires.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.571
TANYA HOLLAND: Empires, exactly,
that what I was looking for.

00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:52.190
Because men tend to finance men.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.250
And they tend to create a team.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.120
A banker told me that
years ago in Boston.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.120
Like, men won't-- it'll
be like a football team.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.570
Let's just get together
and make this happen.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.069
Let's win.

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:04.130
And we don't operate in
that same way-- women.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.440
We're more collaborative.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.035
And I don't know.

00:20:08.035 --> 00:20:09.170
It's just different.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.830
TRACI DES JARDINS: Maybe
we should have just

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.930
learned to play golf.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:13.920
TANYA HOLLAND: I
still regret that.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.440
My dad--

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.020
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a joke,
but I did take golf lessons

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.530
because so many of my meetings
happen on the golf course.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.130
So one of the things that
the Google Food program has

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.590
been working on over
the past five years

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.640
is a small business incubator
program specifically

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.194
around food trucks.

00:20:33.194 --> 00:20:34.610
So we have a food
truck fleet here

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.800
that we created in
partnership with Off the Grid.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.216
But we have a small offshoot
of that called Instructional,

00:20:39.216 --> 00:20:43.130
where we get people, especially
women and minorities, who

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.530
want to operate a food
truck and have an idea.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.650
And then we work with them over
time to incubate their concept,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.932
and design their
truck, and their menu,

00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:52.640
and then we teach them
how to operate it.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.770
And then we let them
operate it on campus

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.510
to get going for a
year, and then we

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.980
send them out into the world.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.563
And I'm listening
to this conversation

00:20:59.563 --> 00:21:02.420
and I'm thinking that there's
potential offshoot here

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.230
where we could begin growing
an incubator to connect people

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:07.400
with the access.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.140
Because if Google's
whole mission

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.120
is to organize the
world's information

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.430
and make it universally
accessible--

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.799
and I think that there's
potential we should discuss.

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:20.340
TANYA HOLLAND: And I don't think
we've really addressed here,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.500
how could the tech and how
does that come through?

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.291
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:23.440
What can we do?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.690
TANYA HOLLAND: Go ahead, Traci.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.860
TRACI DES JARDINS: No, no.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.620
You go.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.420
TANYA HOLLAND: No, I
was just going to say,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.880
again, it's accessing
to diverse communities.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.640
Where I am in West
Oakland, not everybody

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.460
has internet access
or computer access.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.020
JENNA TAYLOR: We're
working on that.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.890
Literally.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.760
TANYA HOLLAND: I think that
would be really, really great.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.218
JENNA TAYLOR:
Universal internet is

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:45.490
a huge project in multiple
ways at Google right now.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.800
And I think we'll make make some
progress on that, but still--

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.100
TANYA HOLLAND: And also
realize in particular-- well,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.310
you have a restaurant now--

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.960
in the restaurant
business, we have

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.930
such diverse social economic--

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.090
diversity as well.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.460
So a lot of our employees
don't have the same access.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.150
And that's where we are very
different from the tech world.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.790
Most everyone who works with
you-- even though they might

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.940
be different ethnicities--
they have a college degree,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.770
similar economic backgrounds.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.990
But we are just
all over the place.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.790
JENNA TAYLOR: I'll say that's
true maybe of Googlers,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.920
but we even just
on the food team

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.930
have like 4,000 partners who
help us operate our program who

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:29.310
are everything
along the spectrum

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.285
of socioeconomic status.

00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:32.326
TANYA HOLLAND: Oh, great.

00:22:32.326 --> 00:22:35.010
JENNA TAYLOR: So we think
quite a lot about quality

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.910
of life for those people,
and the jobs that they're in,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.110
and growth within those
jobs, and quality of life.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.570
Many of them commute
in several hours

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.110
and work another job in the day.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.402
TANYA HOLLAND: Well, then
this might be a sore subject,

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.443
but we've got to figure
out how we don't lose all

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.110
of our good cooks to you guys.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.440
JENNA TAYLOR: I agree.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.190
I need them.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.495
But I know you need them, too.

00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:59.411
TANYA HOLLAND: It's
really, really challenging

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.469
for us in the Bay Area.

00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:02.260
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.968
We were speaking about
this a little bit,

00:23:03.968 --> 00:23:07.230
like the flipping
of the model for not

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.640
only wages within the food--

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.780
especially in the Bay Area-- but
within what the jobs even are.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.750
So what do you think
are some of the things

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.910
that you see shifting
that are going to continue

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.677
to evolve in the coming years?

00:23:19.677 --> 00:23:21.510
TRACI DES JARDINS: I
think that there's just

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.890
got to be greater efficiency.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.080
I mean, in traditional
restaurants

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.850
you go through this whole
process of taking a carrot,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.030
dirty from the field, and
processing it down the road.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.300
I think that having some
consolidation of those efforts

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.760
that we all repeat in
our individual places

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.260
are solutions that could happen
around things like food prep.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.949
I think we need big solutions.

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:47.490
The economic model is just not
working in restaurants anymore

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:48.750
at all.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:54.750
And we all believe in a higher
hourly wage and minimum wage--

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.980
and believe in it absolutely--
and health care for everyone.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.990
There's no question that those
things should be in place.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.310
However, the burden to us as
business owners is too great

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.830
and is taking out our
entire profitability.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.190
And we're in a crisis.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.050
And that crisis
has really started,

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.090
I think, in San
Francisco, because we've

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:19.200
been enduring these business
burdens for, I don't know,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.587
8 to 10 years now.

00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:22.920
But that's starting to kind
of march across the country.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.110
And as that happens, we're
going to see a lot more people

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.830
respond to it.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.740
And you see it a lot in
the press these days.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.510
The model's really broken.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.900
And we need a new one.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.870
And so we've got to
find those efficiencies.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:34.830
It's not clear, though.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.710
I don't think it's clear to
anybody what that path is.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.210
JOANNE WEIR: I think
it's especially

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.710
hard in San Francisco.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.620
It's really hard and
especially because of tech.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.930
It's really difficult.
It's difficult to find

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.820
front of house, back
of house, everything.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.820
TRACI DES JARDINS: It's
the cost of living, too.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.150
And it's-- I think that the
city created a lot of subsidies

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.794
for these big companies to
come in and have San Francisco

00:24:57.794 --> 00:25:00.210
as their headquarters, which
has driven up the real estate

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.330
prices and made it really
untenable for the minimum wage

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.100
folks to be able to survive.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.704
And even at $16 an
hour, that minimum wage

00:25:07.704 --> 00:25:09.120
is not going to
solve the problem.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.670
Not even close.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.240
It's the same conversation
we're seeing everywhere.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.470
TANYA HOLLAND: Whereas we--

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:17.970
I don't know about
you, but I wasn't

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.160
paid when I cooked in France.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.190
We made investments
in our career,

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.330
but it's not really feasible
anymore for people to do that--

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.300
to work for free, to work
for cheap, thinking like--

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.592
JENNA TAYLOR: I'll sleep
on a park bench for a time.

00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:33.000
Not so much, anymore.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.180
So what problems can a company
like Google help to solve?

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.584
What could we do to
help at a large scale?

00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:45.750
TANYA HOLLAND: I don't know.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.374
Subsidize our line cooks?

00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:50.949
JOANNE WEIR: Yeah,
that's a good one.

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:52.990
TANYA HOLLAND: Maybe
there's some mutual benefit,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.940
like they work for us
for a couple years,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.550
and then they come
to Google cafeteria.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.800
JOANNE WEIR: Housing
would be good.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.870
TRACI DES JARDINS:
I think there has

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.250
to be an appreciation for
the tactile nature of food.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.410
The hospitality industry--
we're nourishing people,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.326
we're welcoming them
into an environment where

00:26:10.326 --> 00:26:11.600
we're taking care of them.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.800
And we need greater efficiencies
in terms of how that's done.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.030
But you also don't want to
make it so technological

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.910
that you lose that tactile
relationship with it.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.234
There's probably some virtual
way that you could eat food.

00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:25.900
But would that--

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.800
JENNA TAYLOR: Doesn't
sound delicious.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.174
TRACI DES JARDINS:
No it doesn't.

00:26:28.174 --> 00:26:30.190
And it's so basic to our nature.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.260
Food is such a basic thing.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.990
You don't really want to
take it so far away from--

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.510
it's really special in that way.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.310
And so it's
challenging, I think,

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.620
because you can think of a
million technological ways

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.070
in which you could change the
experience in a restaurant.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.857
But do we really
want to do that?

00:26:47.857 --> 00:26:49.940
JENNA TAYLOR: I don't
think-- maybe front of house

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.670
not as much.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.430
It seems there's got to be some
efficiencies or innovations

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.430
in the kitchen space,
or in the supply chain,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.790
or production chain,
or some of those jobs.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:03.250
Like, we were speaking a
little bit about dishwashers,

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.900
dishwashing.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.660
It's really difficult to
find dish machine operators

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.450
and similarly really
difficult to find

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.340
people to pick the food.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.690
Those jobs-- we find the
median age rises year over year

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:19.060
every year, because there
aren't younger people coming

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.500
into those roles.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.270
So those are the
places where we look

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.455
for the potential for technology
to really change the game.

00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:26.830
TRACI DES JARDINS:
And I think it

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.260
is going to be in
robotics and the ability

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:34.649
to do some kind of basic
prep stuff that is--

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:36.065
there could be a
lot of innovation

00:27:36.065 --> 00:27:39.640
around a machine that
could shuck fava beans

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.640
and take the membrane off of
them and that kind of stuff.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.710
Because it takes hours and
hours and hours of people's time

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.120
to do that kind of thing.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.370
And it's not efficient.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.145
And to have a human being
doing that is not necessary.

00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:53.020
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's one of the biggest

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.150
things we try to do for
our chefs' teams here,

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:58.930
is we're always looking for
ways to cut out the lowest

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.380
value, least satisfaction
jobs, so that people can

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.270
do better, more creative work.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.900
We always say, use the robots
for the work that nobody

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.540
wants to do, and then
let the people do

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.650
the really good stuff.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.757
TRACI DES JARDINS: Like trash.

00:28:13.757 --> 00:28:15.340
It's the last thought
that anyone ever

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:20.256
puts into designing something,
but it is so important.

00:28:20.256 --> 00:28:21.380
I talk about garbage a lot.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.930
I don't know why.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.720
It's a big thing in kitchens.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.420
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a huge thing.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.503
And in fact, I'm very
interested in your thoughts.

00:28:27.503 --> 00:28:30.250
So waste and waste management
and environmental impact

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.450
is really big here.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.880
How do you think about
waste in your operations?

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.379
JOANNE WEIR: Carefully.

00:28:36.379 --> 00:28:38.170
TRACI DES JARDINS: It's
really interesting.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.020
Because I think it was
about 14 years ago that I

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.490
set about trying to
figure out how to-- it

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.531
was before San Francisco had
a really great composting

00:28:46.531 --> 00:28:47.030
program.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.250
And so we started to do it
ourselves and figure out

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.380
a program where we
could contain the waste

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.380
and send the compostable
stuff back to the farmers.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.000
And now we're sort of at the
forefront of that whole idea.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.461
Again, we can create much
greater efficiency with regards

00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:04.960
to all that.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.090
Because it is still
pretty archaic

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.560
in terms of how it's done.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.310
JOANNE WEIR: But we're
much more efficient

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.616
than we were, much more--

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:13.900
even just a few years ago.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.620
TRACI DES JARDINS:
And leaving a lot less

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.869
of an environmental footprint.

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:17.680
I mean, we now--

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.650
the percentage of our
garbage that goes to landfill

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.990
is now less than 10%.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.080
Where 14 years ago, when
we started this work,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.000
it was probably more like 90%.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.500
Because it was
probably just bottles

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.330
that were being recycled.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.800
So that's a great leap.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.880
But you think about
the sorting and all

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.610
of that stuff that
still goes on,

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.480
and we could create
much greater efficiency.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.910
Because it's still going from
me to the garbage facility,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.540
getting composted,
when it really

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.540
should just be going
directly back to the farms.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.410
Because we already
have those pathways.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.702
And so why isn't that happening?

00:29:50.702 --> 00:29:52.410
TANYA HOLLAND: We have
a community garden

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.200
down the street that
we compost with.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.215
So it's literally
three blocks away.

00:29:56.215 --> 00:29:59.234
So that's been really helpful.

00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:01.400
So our compost-- because
we used to let it build up,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.150
and then it gets really
stinky, and we get

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.260
flies, and all that stuff.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.010
But now we don't have
to worry about that.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.520
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
great, and you

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.840
can see it going right
back into your community.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.970
TANYA HOLLAND: And
we're ahead the game

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.200
in the Bay Area as well, too.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.660
Where if you go back east--

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.265
TRACI DES JARDINS:
In New York, I

00:30:15.265 --> 00:30:16.960
don't think-- they still
don't have greenways there,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.543
I don't think.

00:30:17.543 --> 00:30:20.050
And it's like, they're
taking all this garbage

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.450
and putting it on these
barges and sending it

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.320
out to the landfill.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.850
It's insanity.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.880
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
truly frightening.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.140
I can't even think about that.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.040
So what do you see as
the future of food?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.890
Where are we going
with food in America?

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.702
What's next?

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.910
TANYA HOLLAND: Well, I know
what I don't want to see.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.970
I don't want to see so much
automation that we're not

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.040
having dining experiences.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:45.930
There's so--

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:46.888
JENNA TAYLOR: No more--

00:30:46.888 --> 00:30:48.942
Eatsa can't take over the world?

00:30:48.942 --> 00:30:50.900
Nobody there to talk to
you to order your food.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.650
TANYA HOLLAND: No.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.050
I mean, a combination of it.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.340
And I understand grab and
go, the importance of that.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.615
But I think--

00:30:57.615 --> 00:30:59.365
JOANNE WEIR: Fast casual.

00:30:59.365 --> 00:31:01.240
TANYA HOLLAND: I'm
working on a fast casual--

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.160
JOANNE WEIR: Oh, I know.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:02.420
Me, too.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.650
TANYA HOLLAND: Everybody
is because we're trying

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.360
to make money in the industry.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.074
JENNA TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:31:07.074 --> 00:31:09.490
TRACI DES JARDINS: I think
that's where the curve is going

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.420
is that fast food and what we've
done as fine dining for so long

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.130
are starting to merge together.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.960
And we're seeing--
I mean, I think

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.070
also food TV has changed food.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.880
When I started 34 years
ago, what we did in fine

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.250
dining was just
this very small--

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.930
was for a very small
section of the population.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.490
And now, food is in everyone's
living room every night.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.450
And that's--

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:35.617
JOANNE WEIR: Yes, thank you.

00:31:35.617 --> 00:31:36.741
TRACI DES JARDINS: Exactly.

00:31:36.741 --> 00:31:37.760
Thank you, Joanne.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.970
JENNA TAYLOR: I did see
you on "Top Chef Masters".

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.277
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yes, indeed.

00:31:42.277 --> 00:31:43.360
JENNA TAYLOR: That's true.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.920
TRACI DES JARDINS:
And you can look at it

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.060
positively or negatively.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.660
I feel like we've had this
whole world opened up now

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.020
where everyone in the
United States and beyond

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.370
knows about our restaurants
and our food and food culture.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.680
And there's an aspiration,
even if they've never

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.936
been exposed to
it, that they think

00:32:01.936 --> 00:32:03.310
in the back of
their mind, I want

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.850
to go and eat in this particular
kind of restaurant one day.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.780
And that's super cool.

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:11.620
JOANNE WEIR: I want
to go to Norway

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.070
and eat in this
particular restaurant.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.570
But I think what's
really great is

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.340
the simplicity and
the direction of that

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.590
and the focus on ingredients.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.739
I think it's so great.

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:23.780
And I know we've been
going that way for so long.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.580
But I think right
now I love that.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.170
I just I think that that's--

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.710
I'm so happy that that's
how people are thinking.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.470
And I know your food is
probably not in that direction,

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.380
and I'm so happy that it's
not molecular gastronomy.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.020
But I think that one thing
that you do very well though

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.460
is to really--

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.790
you're able to find
things through Google.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.140
So we really have to
thank you for that.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.380
Because we can find anything,
and anything we want to eat,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.690
or anything we want to buy,
or anything-- any place

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.740
we want to go to eat.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.220
So thank you for that.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.170
JENNA TAYLOR: The world's
information and making

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.570
it universally accessible.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.300
Yes.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.550
I will pass that along.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.220
JOANNE WEIR: So you
continue to do that.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.670
Thank you.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.586
JENNA TAYLOR: We will.

00:33:02.586 --> 00:33:03.340
We will.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.752
What do you think?

00:33:04.752 --> 00:33:06.460
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah,
I was just thinking.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.160
I was like, so
maybe a Google Cafe

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.215
or like a little Google
station in West Oakland

00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:14.501
that that neighborhood could
have access to information,

00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:15.000
access to--

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.375
JENNA TAYLOR:
We've been lobbying

00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:17.687
for an Oakland outpost.

00:33:17.687 --> 00:33:19.520
And there's a lot of
us who live in the East

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.879
Bay who wish that was the case.

00:33:20.879 --> 00:33:23.170
TANYA HOLLAND: In West Oakland,
though, that could also

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.410
benefit the community somehow.

00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.520
It's sort of like the
last frontier that's

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.370
right in the center of the Bay.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.649
That's still a very
under-served community.

00:33:32.649 --> 00:33:33.940
JENNA TAYLOR: I love that idea.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.934
We'll circle back.

00:33:34.934 --> 00:33:35.850
We'll talk afterwards.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.420
I like it.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.920
TANYA HOLLAND:
Selfishly, of course.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.160
I want you there, too.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.510
JENNA TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.409
So when you're not cooking,
what do you love to do?

00:33:43.409 --> 00:33:44.200
JOANNE WEIR: Travel

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.550
TANYA HOLLAND: Eat.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.990
JENNA TAYLOR: Eat and travel.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.225
Those go together, I think.

00:33:49.225 --> 00:33:51.685
You travel to eat
at different places.

00:33:51.685 --> 00:33:53.177
Or at least I do.

00:33:53.177 --> 00:33:54.010
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.335
Definitely travel
to eat for sure.

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.710
TRACI DES JARDINS: My job
isn't a lot of cooking anymore,

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:02.685
sadly, so I actually
cook at home a lot.

00:34:02.685 --> 00:34:04.060
JOANNE WEIR: Isn't
that the best?

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:04.960
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Yeah, it is the best.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.585
And it's a totally
different experience

00:34:06.585 --> 00:34:08.010
than cooking in restaurants.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.810
It's become sort of a hobby.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.040
It's become a hobby now
instead of a profession.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.290
JOANNE WEIR: I made this--

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.600
this year, January
1st, I was like,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.230
I am not going to sit in
front of the computer all day

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.290
anymore.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.550
I mean, I still do it.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.040
But I said, I'm
going to cook more.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.289
I'm really going to cook more.

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:27.460
And I've been doing
the same and loving it.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.530
Because that's the thing
that I love the most.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.530
Obviously that's why
we all got into it.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.892
And we've stepped
so far away from it.

00:34:33.892 --> 00:34:34.600
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.392
So you had a really rough day,
what do you make for yourself?

00:34:39.392 --> 00:34:40.600
JOANNE WEIR: Roasted chicken.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.590
JENNA TAYLOR: Ah, that's mine.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.400
JOANNE WEIR: Roasted
chicken would be mine.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.024
TRACI DES JARDINS:
I make Mexican food.

00:34:47.024 --> 00:34:49.429
I mean that's my comfort food.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.902
JENNA TAYLOR: What's your go-to?

00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:53.110
TRACI DES JARDINS: You know,
I love to make carnitas.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.880
That takes a little while.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.770
It's kind of a long cook time.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.140
But any kind of tacos.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.280
I love making salsas.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.510
I make all different kinds.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.162
And I love to make them at home.

00:35:03.162 --> 00:35:04.870
The other day I made
a really simple one.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:10.270
It was just boiled
tomatillos and chopped up

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.144
serrano chili and cilantro.

00:35:12.144 --> 00:35:13.810
I mean, it was so
simple, because I just

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.430
didn't have anything else.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.440
Usually I use a lot
of dried chilies.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.780
And it was incredibly delicious.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.030
I just ground it in a
molcajete, because I didn't even

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.170
want to turn the blender on.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.717
I just wanted the quiet--

00:35:25.717 --> 00:35:27.050
JOANNE WEIR: You wanted to cook.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.690
You really wanted
to get in there.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.273
TRACI DES JARDINS: I just wanted
the whole tactile experience.

00:35:30.273 --> 00:35:33.851
And dead simple and so
delicious-- three ingredients.

00:35:33.851 --> 00:35:35.350
JENNA TAYLOR: What
about you, Tanya?

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.770
TANYA HOLLAND: I go out.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.260
JENNA TAYLOR: So
where do you go?

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.718
TANYA HOLLAND: I
love to be served.

00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:42.040
I love the dining experience.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040
JENNA TAYLOR: So where's your
favorite place to go right now?

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.950
TANYA HOLLAND:
Actually, I really

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.360
love The Cook and Her Farmer.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.110
I love raw meat.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.615
JENNA TAYLOR: I was
just there last weekend.

00:35:49.615 --> 00:35:51.240
TANYA HOLLAND: Her
flavors are so good.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.400
Her food's so clean and local.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.085
JENNA TAYLOR: Swan's
Market in Oakland--

00:35:55.085 --> 00:35:55.440
amazing food stalls.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.250
TANYA HOLLAND: I
usually sit there

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:57.760
at the counter and talk to
her while she's cooking.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.810
JENNA TAYLOR: Cooking her
farmers-- one of them.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:00.380
TANYA HOLLAND: Which is what
I hate when people do to me.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.620
They talk to you.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.010
But she's good, she talks--

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.810
we talk about-- we talk
about the business,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.299
and how we can't find help,
and how expensive it is.

00:36:07.299 --> 00:36:08.590
JENNA TAYLOR: Sorry about that.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.850
TANYA HOLLAND: But anyways.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:10.840
JOANNE WEIR: I have to
tell you my other one.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.700
Because I've been spending
a lot of time in Morocco,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.680
and I've been making
tagines left and right.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.740
When you started to
talk about Mexican--

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.840
mine is Moroccan right now.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.930
I love the flavors--

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.090
preserved lemons and cumin and--

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.320
love it.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.297
JENNA TAYLOR: Amazing.

00:36:27.297 --> 00:36:29.950
So favorite Bay
Area restaurant--

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.770
you got me thinking about it
with Cook and Her Farmer--

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:33.610
right now.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.167
Not one of your own.

00:36:36.167 --> 00:36:37.750
JOANNE WEIR: I love
Octavia right now.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.140
TANYA HOLLAND: I
haven't been there yet.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.098
JOANNE WEIR: I love it.

00:36:40.098 --> 00:36:42.535
I like-- it's right around
the corner from my house.

00:36:42.535 --> 00:36:43.480
It's so easy.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.457
But I like it.

00:36:44.457 --> 00:36:45.790
JENNA TAYLOR: What do you think?

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:48.995
TRACI DES JARDINS: I still
go back to Zuni all the time.

00:36:48.995 --> 00:36:50.620
I probably have been
to that restaurant

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.780
more than any restaurant
my entire life.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.670
And I just always love it.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:56.485
It's just the vibe.

00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:58.570
It's that room.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.790
And the new chef,
just bless her,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:06.370
is really upholding Judy's
whole vision for food.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:10.450
And it hasn't changed,
which I think is remarkable,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.450
that her vision is
still preserved.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:18.610
And it's really difficult to
nail that really simple food

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.047
and to hold up that
kind of tradition.

00:37:21.047 --> 00:37:23.380
And that restaurant's been
there for a really long time.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.630
And I just really
appreciate the old--

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.577
I mean that's my go-to place.

00:37:29.577 --> 00:37:30.660
JENNA TAYLOR: I love that.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.760
What's another great
spot in Oakland?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.510
TANYA HOLLAND: Well,
The Wolf just opened.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.690
And I love their other
restaurant, Wood Tavern.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.870
And their chef is a
woman, Yang, and they just

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.710
created a really
good vibe in there.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.340
It's historically the Bay
Wolf for many, many years,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.440
and he wanted to turn it over
to some local restauranteurs.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.841
He actually asked me, but it
wasn't the right opportunity

00:37:50.841 --> 00:37:51.340
for me.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.015
And they've done
a fantastic job.

00:37:53.015 --> 00:37:55.390
Again, food, it's really simple
and accessible but really

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.530
well done.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.010
And yeah, I think that will
become my new favorite.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:37:59.230
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, good.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.563
I'll have to check that one out.

00:38:00.563 --> 00:38:01.480
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.070
JENNA TAYLOR: So you were
telling us a little bit

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.090
about your new spot.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.160
So what's next?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.860
Share.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.661
TANYA HOLLAND: Well, I'm working
on a location in the Ferry

00:38:08.661 --> 00:38:09.160
building.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.260
I have a lease there.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.532
And so we're
designing it and going

00:38:12.532 --> 00:38:14.890
to call it Brown
Sugar Kitchen Counter.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:15.650
Fingers crossed.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.410
So we open up in
about six months.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:19.635
Also working on a second--

00:38:19.635 --> 00:38:21.100
I don't know, I'm
totally crazy--

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.860
location in Oakland.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.981
Bigger and Badder
Brown Sugar Kitchen.

00:38:25.981 --> 00:38:26.980
JENNA TAYLOR: I like it.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.144
TANYA HOLLAND: And
a Napa location

00:38:29.144 --> 00:38:30.310
hopefully in a couple years.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:31.170
And then we'll see.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.795
I want Brown Sugar
Kitchens everywhere.

00:38:32.795 --> 00:38:33.970
So that's my goal.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.180
I don't know who's
going to run them, but--

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.000
and then another cookbook
kind of in the works

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.900
and maybe some TV stuff.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.502
JENNA TAYLOR: So
not too many things.

00:38:43.502 --> 00:38:44.710
TANYA HOLLAND: Quiet at home.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.293
JENNA TAYLOR: Resting
on your laurels.

00:38:46.293 --> 00:38:46.810
I like it.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.931
What about you?

00:38:47.931 --> 00:38:49.180
JOANNE WEIR: So I am working--

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.150
I'm in pre-production
for my next TV show.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.430
So it's called
"Plates and Places",

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:57.880
and we just shot in Morocco,
in Italy, and in Greece.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.950
And we're shooting in October.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:05.050
We're shooting in France,
from Lyon to Arles on a barge.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.300
So that's a really exciting
project, because it's--

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.675
JENNA TAYLOR: It
sounds terrible.

00:39:08.675 --> 00:39:09.980
JOANNE WEIR: I know.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.355
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm sorry that
you have to go through that.

00:39:12.355 --> 00:39:13.440
It's taxing, clearly.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.720
JOANNE WEIR: Exactly,
I'm exhausted just

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.470
thinking about it.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.384
But anyway so--

00:39:18.384 --> 00:39:20.800
TANYA HOLLAND: I could work
as a translator if you wanted.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.270
JOANNE WEIR: In Russian.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.478
TANYA HOLLAND: No, in French.

00:39:22.478 --> 00:39:26.649
[SPEAKING FRENCH] I
speak French better.

00:39:26.649 --> 00:39:27.940
JOANNE WEIR: So I'm doing that.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.120
And I'm also working on opening
a cafe within the University

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.470
of Massachusetts, which
is where I went to school,

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.660
a Mediterranean cafe.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.090
It's funny, because I opened
Copita, which is Mexican.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.580
I wrote 16 books about
the Mediterranean.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.830
And I write one
book about tequila

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.810
and open a Mexican restaurant.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:45.850
But I do like tequila.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:50.532
And so I'm not a swilling
woman, but I like to kill it.

00:39:50.532 --> 00:39:52.240
But anyway, so those
are the two projects

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.080
I'm working on right now.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.246
And who knows if there's
going to be another Copita.

00:39:55.246 --> 00:39:56.690
I'm sure there will be.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.080
JENNA TAYLOR: And I know
you have a new endeavor,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.465
but what's on the horizon?

00:40:00.465 --> 00:40:04.100
TRACI DES JARDINS: Which new
endeavor are you talking about?

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.365
JENNA TAYLOR: What's
on the horizon?

00:40:06.365 --> 00:40:08.740
TRACI DES JARDINS: Jardiniere
is turning 20 in September,

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.485
and so I'm kind of focused
on celebrating that.

00:40:11.485 --> 00:40:13.360
JENNA TAYLOR: Rightfully
so, congratulations.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.540
TRACI DES JARDINS: I like to say
nothing's new, because I've got

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.970
plenty on my plate right now.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.310
But that's never true.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.720
I'm thinking about the next
iteration of Jardiniere,

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.640
the 2.0 if you will.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.220
It's time for a little
change and a shift in--

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.220
I think it's an homage to my
proteges that have come up

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.960
and are dedicated
and loyal to me

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.360
and letting them have a
say as to what they want

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.510
that restaurant to be like.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.090
And so that's a
conversation we're having.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.410
JENNA TAYLOR: That's a
really beautiful idea.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:44.890
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yeah.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.430
Yeah.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.930
So it's time for me to
kind of pass the torch

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:52.480
and let the others really
rise up and have it be theirs.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.566
So that's a great transition.

00:40:55.566 --> 00:40:56.940
JENNA TAYLOR: And
how has it been

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.150
owning a spot in the Presidio?

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.364
It's a little different.

00:41:00.364 --> 00:41:02.530
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yeah,
so the Presidio restaurants

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.211
are in conjunction with Bon
Appetit, a management company,

00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:05.710
and--

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.030
JENNA TAYLOR: They
are also our partner.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.529
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Yes, I know that.

00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:10.690
And I've had incredible
opportunities

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.260
with and through Fedele Bauccio.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.160
And he's just an
inspiration always.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.420
He's a complete visionary.

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.160
And so the Presidio restaurants
are a work in progress.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.070
I've got really incredibly
talented chefs out there,

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:28.690
and we're toiling in a way
that you get people to come out

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.190
to the new frontier, which--

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.190
JENNA TAYLOR: I guess
there hasn't traditionally

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.849
been that type of
offering in Presidio.

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:35.890
TRACI DES JARDINS: But
the Presidio-- and working

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.723
with the Presidio trust
has been incredible.

00:41:37.723 --> 00:41:41.830
I mean, it's just an amazing
park and land and just

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.015
a really important part of
San Francisco in the future.

00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:47.612
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, I'd love
to see it developed more

00:41:47.612 --> 00:41:49.945
in that arena and just bring
a different type of traffic

00:41:49.945 --> 00:41:52.600
to the Presidio, a different
type of experience there.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.800
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Yeah, we have gardens,

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.300
and we're able to
grow food there.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.230
And so it's--

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.770
I feel like we're just at the
beginning of our food program

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.180
there and where it can go.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.400
And they're building
that whole parklands,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.490
and so there's lots of exciting
stuff to come out there.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.050
JENNA TAYLOR: That's great.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.090
As we're talking,
I hear you guys

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.310
saying all of the different
things that you're doing

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:16.000
and this vast spectrum of
opportunities and roles

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.710
and hats that you wear.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.444
How do you keep it all balanced?

00:42:20.444 --> 00:42:22.360
And if you know, I really
want you to tell me,

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.170
because I'm trying
to figure it out.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.360
TANYA HOLLAND: I think we
all agree, right, there

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.150
is no balance.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.280
JOANNE WEIR: Yeah.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.090
I'm more balanced now, though,
than I was in the past.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.150
So it's much better.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.800
God.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.758
JENNA TAYLOR: So is it
just shifting your focus

00:42:33.758 --> 00:42:35.840
over time, or in the
moment, whether it's

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.220
long term, short term?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.420
TANYA HOLLAND: I think it
probably goes in cycles.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.550
Like for me right now,
I feel like it's all

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.300
happening at once.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.716
I have all these
new opportunities

00:42:41.716 --> 00:42:43.060
to open operations.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.210
But I was kind of on
a plateau for a while,

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.700
and then I was able to
really do a lot more

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.810
traveling for fun and other
things that I wanted to do.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:54.760
So it's sort of like
you put a little--

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.290
put the time in the bank,
and then you work a lot.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.305
And then you go and
you take some time off,

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:01.810
and that's kind of
how it goes, I think.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.360
JOANNE WEIR: I do
think as a woman,

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.140
and as female, it is easier
to balance all those things.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.150
Because I do many
things in one day.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.520
I can be working on
one project and then

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.170
jump into something
else that I think

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.960
for me that's possible to do.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.420
And so I can't see
doing it any other way.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.395
I love doing what
I do, and I love

00:43:23.395 --> 00:43:24.520
all the different projects.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.927
If I only did one, it wouldn't
be good for me, I think.

00:43:27.927 --> 00:43:30.010
TRACI DES JARDINS: When I
had only one restaurant,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.970
I could be there all the time.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.360
And it was only open
six days a week,

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.420
and so I pretty much was
in the building running it

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.610
for every hour that it was open.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.350
As I expanded, I couldn't--

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.444
I figured out that I couldn't
perform a particular role

00:43:44.444 --> 00:43:46.360
in any one of the
restaurants, or I was really

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.750
going to fall short in my
obligations to my team.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.536
And so now I kind of float
between them and don't--

00:43:53.536 --> 00:43:54.910
And so there's a
freedom in that.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.890
And it's almost as--
the busier you get,

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.840
the easier it is
to take time off,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.600
because you don't perform
a particular function

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.500
in any one of those places.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.280
So I think unplugging
every once in a while--

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.866
and I don't think
I've really done it

00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:10.240
in like three
years, because it's

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.420
so easy with all of our
devices to stay connected.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.660
But I just went to Indonesia
and was in a really remote place

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.100
and didn't look at my email
or my phone for a whole week.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.560
And it's just really
important to do that.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.352
And it turned out--

00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:26.768
I didn't think I was going to
have access to the internet,

00:44:26.768 --> 00:44:27.610
but I did.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.500
And I chose not to.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.230
And it was an epiphany
for me, because I realized

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.977
I can make that choice.

00:44:33.977 --> 00:44:36.060
I can just turn this stuff
off and not look at it.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.976
JENNA TAYLOR: And the
world didn't end, right?

00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:39.550
TRACI DES JARDINS:
It did not end.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.560
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
always the fear.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.060
TRACI DES JARDINS: Yeah.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.643
JENNA TAYLOR:
Everything will be fine.

00:44:42.643 --> 00:44:45.610
What does it look like
when you disconnect?

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.650
JOANNE WEIR: I don't
think I do it very often.

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.360
I really don't, not enough.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.480
Doing that for one week,
all I'm thinking about

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.541
is how many emails
there would be after.

00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:55.040
That's all--

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.748
TRACI DES JARDINS:
I'm still digging out.

00:44:56.748 --> 00:44:58.750
JOANNE WEIR: Yeah,
absolutely, oh my god.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.285
I just--

00:44:59.285 --> 00:45:00.910
TRACI DES JARDINS:
But it was worth it.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:01.910
JOANNE WEIR: Yes.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.840
No, I-- when you said it, I
thought, I'm going to try that.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.020
But no, I just don't
do it very often.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.790
I mean, I travel and
I'm still looking

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:11.440
and I'm still staying connected.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.100
I am.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.170
I mean, if I don't look
at email for a whole day,

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:16.067
I think that's really
an accomplishment.

00:45:16.067 --> 00:45:16.900
JENNA TAYLOR: It is.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.190
I mean, it sounds like it is.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:20.134
For you, I think
it absolutely is.

00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:21.050
What about you, Tanya?

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.150
How do you get away from it?

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.400
TANYA HOLLAND: It's hard, too.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.650
I mean, I've kind of
made a vow to myself

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.655
that I was going to go to
Maui at least once every year.

00:45:29.655 --> 00:45:33.340
And if I'm in the water,
I can't take my phone.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.700
I can't take my phone in
the water, so I can't--

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.940
or really on the
beach, get sand in it.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.617
So that's like my getaway.

00:45:39.617 --> 00:45:40.700
JENNA TAYLOR: I like that.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.075
I feel like it's
a little bit sad

00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:44.625
that we have to trick ourselves
into being disconnected.

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:47.083
TANYA HOLLAND: But as soon as
I get back to the hotel room,

00:45:47.083 --> 00:45:48.270
I like--

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.479
JENNA TAYLOR: Well-balanced.

00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:51.020
JOANNE WEIR: Checking
into the hotel,

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.347
can you give me the Wi-Fi code?

00:45:54.347 --> 00:45:56.180
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm so
excited to talk to you,

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.060
but I would also like to
give our audience a chance

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.512
to ask some questions?

00:46:00.512 --> 00:46:01.970
It's a little silly,
because I have

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.303
to repeat your question so
that people on the livestream

00:46:04.303 --> 00:46:04.860
can hear it.

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.568
But if you can bear
with me through that,

00:46:06.568 --> 00:46:10.682
I'd love to answer anything
anybody has to ask.

00:46:10.682 --> 00:46:12.140
OK, I'm going to
be super concise--

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.910
how do you compare
the quality of food

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.890
here in America to food
elsewhere in the world?

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.487
It was much better
stated by you.

00:46:19.487 --> 00:46:21.320
JOANNE WEIR: One thing
that I'd like to say,

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.450
because I work a
lot in Europe, is

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:26.030
it depends which
country you're in.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.520
For example, in Italy, the
ingredients are incredible.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.410
But I think we in
the Bay Area are

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:35.030
so spoiled that our food, our
ingredients, are exceptional.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.100
But I do see, in
traveling around the US--

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.180
because I teach around
the US a lot too--

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.760
I see that the quality of food
is getting better and better

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.464
and better everywhere.

00:46:46.464 --> 00:46:48.880
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah, I agree
that we're just spoiled here.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.270
So any place by
comparison, it's like, wow.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.150
And like Joanne said,
depends on the country, too.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:47:00.080
I think France-- where
we both learned to cook--

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.120
one of the reasons why
I loved being there

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:06.300
is there was a multi-acre garden
behind the school where I was.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.030
And so we were
really at the source.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.150
JOANNE WEIR: And in
markets every day.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:12.780
TANYA HOLLAND: People
shop in markets.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.070
That's their grocery store.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:19.250
But other countries
maybe not the case.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.710
What I saw when I was in
Kazakhstan two years ago--

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:25.970
I went as a culinary diplomat
through the State Department.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.220
They have nothing to work with.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.800
It was really-- potatoes,
a lot of root vegetables.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.384
Seasonality is not
really a thing there.

00:47:36.384 --> 00:47:38.300
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, I
grew up in the Bay Area.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.300
And I moved to
Virginia when I was 18

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:46.412
and was shocked at the produce
selection or lack thereof.

00:47:46.412 --> 00:47:47.120
So I think it's--

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.320
TANYA HOLLAND:
Where in Virginia?

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.236
JENNA TAYLOR: Roanoke.

00:47:49.236 --> 00:47:50.070
TANYA HOLLAND: Oh.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.140
I went to University
of Virginia.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.306
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, we could
talk about that UVA, yes.

00:47:53.306 --> 00:47:56.090
I did not, but nearby.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.987
What do you think, Tracy?

00:47:57.987 --> 00:47:59.945
TRACI DES JARDINS: I
think there's always the--

00:47:59.945 --> 00:48:02.970
I come from the Central Valley,
a small town in the Central

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.770
Valley, which is the bread
basket of the country, really.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.210
A lot of food's grown out there.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:13.080
But it all got exported and
moved from where I grew up.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.630
So we had a really
paltry selection

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.560
of stuff in the
grocery stores there.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.480
JENNA TAYLOR: The irony of that.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.440
TRACI DES JARDINS: What's that?

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.220
JENNA TAYLOR: That's ridiculous.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.845
TRACI DES JARDINS:
Yeah, it was insane.

00:48:20.845 --> 00:48:23.240
It was like-- it was
moved from someplace else

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.700
to come to the grocery
store in the town.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.600
So we grew a lot of our own
food in a kitchen garden.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.810
If you've got a little tiny bit
of space, you can grow food.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.971
And you see that a lot.

00:48:34.971 --> 00:48:37.220
Like the farmer's market--
the Alemany Farmer's Market

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:38.960
in San Francisco--
a lot of those folks

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.120
are old ethnic
families that just grow

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.010
the stuff in their backyards.

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.880
And it's really interesting
that there's this opportunity

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.370
to grow food in all kinds
of little tiny places

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:53.495
and diversify the selection that
you have at your fingertips.

00:48:53.495 --> 00:48:55.870
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, that's
something we care a lot about.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.020
We were just talking about
sock gardening and ways

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.900
that we can move into
land that is severely

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.430
under utilized and put in high
performing farming systems,

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.740
just to bring fresh food to--

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.170
TRACI DES JARDINS: To
neighborhoods, communities

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.430
that it's really needed.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.946
And it doesn't require
a lot of space.

00:49:16.946 --> 00:49:19.070
And that's kind of the way
that it used to be done.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.040
People really used to grow
their food in their backyard

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.200
and raise their own
chickens and eat those.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.590
And it was just a different
relationship to food.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:30.050
The industrialization of it
here has really, I think,

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.300
affected-- poorly--
our environment.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.590
And diversity of
products that we have

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:41.181
has really had a negative
impact on food sources.

00:49:41.181 --> 00:49:42.680
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm
hopeful that we're

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.860
swinging back in the
right direction with that.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.470
TRACI DES JARDINS: I think
the interest goes a long way

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:50.270
and so does people's curiosity.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:53.330
And that's where I can really
say, thank God for food TV,

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:57.860
and the information that
Google provides the world,

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.610
that we can really be
aspirational in what we seek.

00:50:03.812 --> 00:50:05.270
JENNA TAYLOR: What
advice would you

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:10.040
give to your 25-year-old
self looking back?

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:10.710
JOANNE WEIR: Go.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.980
You go first, that's fine.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.050
TRACI DES JARDINS:
So I am completely

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:16.770
fascinated with Mexican food.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.760
And if I could have
my time back that I've

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.910
put into my culinary career, I
would take a really deep dive

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.980
into Mexican food.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.430
Because I think there's
still so much to discover,

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.610
and I wish I had the time
to go for that discovery.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:36.180
So I think picking
an area of interest

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.450
and taking a deep dive into it--

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:42.260
even though I think we
are overstimulated now,

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.360
and there are so many
different opportunities

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.320
that I think that sometimes we
don't really thoroughly explore

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.039
a certain thing that we
might be interested in.

00:50:51.039 --> 00:50:51.830
It could be baking.

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.900
It could be any
number of things--

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.250
to really take the time and
learn about a subject really

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.730
thoroughly.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.520
JOANNE WEIR: I would say for me
is the best education that you

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.480
can possibly get, and
also the best experience,

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.640
and then making
connections along the way.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.360
TANYA HOLLAND: I
probably would have

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.693
said, like, you should have
stayed in engineering school

00:51:15.693 --> 00:51:20.520
and gotten an MBA
like I told you to.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.270
JOANNE WEIR: But that
sounds so boring.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.120
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's the problem.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.297
It might be right, but
it's probably not right.

00:51:27.297 --> 00:51:29.880
JOANNE WEIR: Well, unless you're
passionate about engineering.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.630
You could be passionate
about engineering.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.540
TANYA HOLLAND: But I
did follow my passion.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.430
Family members thought
I was a little crazy,

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:36.540
and what was I doing?

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.520
Especially when I did have
opportunity to do other things.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.390
But follow your
passion, for one.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:44.610
And you do have to keep
reinvesting in yourself.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.590
So don't always chase the money.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.530
Sometimes the experience
you can get for a position

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:56.880
that might seem beneath you or
whatever, it's really worth it.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.880
Now you don't have to buy
magazine subscriptions

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.900
like we did.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.200
You can go online.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.760
But I was always buying
cookbooks, attending events,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.860
networking-- as Joanne said--

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.370
continue to make contacts with
people, make yourself known,

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:13.470
get to know people.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:17.751
I wish that I had just
continued to seek out

00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:20.250
like just a chef who was going
to take me under their wings.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.114
I just kind of
settled into jobs.

00:52:22.114 --> 00:52:24.030
I was like, OK, it's not
going to happen here,

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:25.696
but I'm just going
to work through this.

00:52:25.696 --> 00:52:27.570
But I wish I had
just kept trying

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:30.960
to find that one chef who
would have mentored me.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.140
But then I just was like,
I've got to do this on my own.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.330
Because there was
a certain place

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.529
I wanted to be in my career.

00:52:39.529 --> 00:52:41.070
JOANNE WEIR: You
mean like right now?

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:46.170
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you deal
with men taking direction

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:48.930
from you as a female
leader in the kitchen?

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.810
Has it been an issue for you?

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:54.242
JOANNE WEIR: Subtly.

00:52:54.242 --> 00:52:56.700
TRACI DES JARDINS: That hasn't
really been an issue for me.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.390
But I can be a fairly
aggressive person,

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:02.660
despite my little small self.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:13.762
I could always prove
myself and do their jobs

00:53:13.762 --> 00:53:14.720
better than they could.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.950
And that was my way of proving
myself, and making sure--

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.279
I mean, size matters,
I guess, and sometimes

00:53:21.279 --> 00:53:22.820
there were things
I couldn't pick up.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.150
But other than that,
for the most part

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.890
I could work
circles around them.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:32.420
And that was my method
of making them listen.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.840
So I don't know if maybe
that's an answer that's

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.620
particular to me.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:43.070
But I think dealing
with it head on,

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.530
and asking them the
question as to why

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.640
they don't think that they
should be listening to you,

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.487
and making the point.

00:53:52.487 --> 00:53:53.570
JENNA TAYLOR: Call it out.

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:54.040
TANYA HOLLAND: Yeah.

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.060
I have to agree a
little bit with Traci.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.030
But since we are talking gender,
I have to tell this story.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:02.960
I was standing by the counter,
looking at my cooks one

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.120
day from outside,
just making sure

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.310
everything was going all right.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.900
And there was a
couple next to me.

00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.140
And the man looked at his
wife and said, oh, that guy

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.200
must be the head chef.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.520
And I was just like, excuse me?

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.400
This perception
is still going on.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.090
Just because he was the tall
white dude in the kitchen.

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:23.540
And like, that's my worst cook.

00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.750
He's like-- I said it myself.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:26.590
I have this guy.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:28.360
JOANNE WEIR: He just
saw that, actually.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.094
He's watching this.

00:54:30.094 --> 00:54:32.510
TANYA HOLLAND: Well, there's
been a lot of tall white guys

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.610
that have come through.

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.280
JENNA TAYLOR: It's that
insidious, institutionalized

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:38.880
perception.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.640
TANYA HOLLAND: Exactly.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.875
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm so hopeful
it's shifting over time.

00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:44.034
TANYA HOLLAND: We have to.

00:54:44.034 --> 00:54:46.075
JENNA TAYLOR: We have time
for one more question.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:49.240
Yeah.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:49.970
How is risk?

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.540
And how do you address it?

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.334
And did it make a difference?

00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:54.750
JOANNE WEIR: I had
just finished--

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.080
I studied in France for a
year with Madeleine Kamman.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.830
And I came back, and
I thought I was going

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.230
to just conquer the world.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.200
And there were two restaurants
that I was trying out

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.650
in-- one was Square One and
the other one was Chez Panisse.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:11.210
And I remember deciding that
Chez Panisse was definitely

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:12.740
the place for me.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.250
And I worked there for
two weeks for free.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:19.580
And I remember every single day
I would meet with David Tanis,

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.020
and he would say--

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.342
would you come back tomorrow?

00:55:22.342 --> 00:55:24.800
And I kept going, god, I've
got to come back tomorrow again

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.730
for free.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.560
And I did that for
two weeks, and then it

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.120
went on for another week.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.400
And then it went on
for a few more days.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.500
And I remember
going home one night

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.690
and like crying and
going, oh my god, this

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.400
is really, really crazy.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.780
Should I do this?

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.430
Should I really stick this out?

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.620
And the next day, thank
god, I got offered a job.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.450
But it was really the
right thing for me,

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:45.860
and I'm so happy that I did it.

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.620
It was such an
extraordinary experience

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.510
for me to be there
for five years.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.150
And even to this
day, I go back there

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:55.880
and I continue to work
because I just love the food,

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.800
I love the whole philosophy.

00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.320
And it taught me so much
about my life and who I am

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.560
and how I hire people and
how I work with people.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.712
So I wouldn't turn back.

00:56:08.712 --> 00:56:10.930
JENNA TAYLOR: What
do you guys think?

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:12.430
TANYA HOLLAND:
Opening my restaurant

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:16.000
in West Oakland in 2008-- a lot
of people saw that as a risk,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.560
and I was just desperate to
have a kitchen to work in.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:23.140
And I knew that there was
a bit of a captive audience

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.020
in the community.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.480
And I had to get in my car
to get a cup of coffee.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.870
I lived about five
blocks from there.

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.440
And I just believed if I
built it, they would come.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.560
And I called it a really
kind of happy accident,

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.970
because I was actually
shopping around a Creole Bistro

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:41.950
concept that was going
to be more upscale.

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.780
But I could not-- no
one would lease to me.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:45.905
Because they said, you've
never owned a restaurant.

00:56:45.905 --> 00:56:48.340
I was looking to be in the
financial district and business

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.830
district of Oakland.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.750
And that's where I landed.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.320
So you just have to go for it.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.470
And like I said, now I have
this brand that it's beyond me.

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.110
I haven't even--
it's not something

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.310
that I-- it was never my
intention to get up at 5:00

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:06.490
AM to go cook eggs, OK?

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.640
But it's good.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.160
Risks are worth it
most of the time.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.320
Yeah.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.720
JENNA TAYLOR: Memorable
risks for you?

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.892
TRACI DES JARDINS: Every day.

00:57:15.892 --> 00:57:18.100
The restaurant industry is
such a high risk business.

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.058
I don't think that there's
really anyone that's

00:57:20.058 --> 00:57:21.880
risk averse that's in it.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.390
But I've taken on this new
challenge in the last five

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:29.050
years to pick something that
I'm super afraid of every year

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.330
and overcome that fear.

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.030
And there are lots of them.

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:37.450
I used to be terrified to sit
and talk in front of people

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.610
and address a room
full of people.

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:43.390
It used to make me lose
sleep for three weeks.

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:50.500
And so I have picked a thing
and tried to get past it.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.180
Recently I was in Indonesia.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.240
And I've been in the
water my whole life,

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.740
and my family all scuba dived.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:58.810
And I was a competitive
swimmer in school,

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:01.900
but I never wanted to get
certified to scuba dive.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.210
Never wanted to be under
the water with a breathing

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.410
apparatus.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.300
And I was super
afraid of sharks.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.410
And I went to this eco preserve
there that has a ton of sharks.

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:14.170
And I got in the water with
them, and I went scuba diving.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:18.580
And I have found this
new love for what

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.200
exists under the water.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.940
And I've been avoiding
it my whole life

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:23.320
because I had these fears.

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.680
And so I pushed myself
through these things.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.190
"Top Chef Masters"-- I
was terrified to go on TV

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:32.560
and do that as well
and made myself do it.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.680
So sometimes if you can
push through that fear

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.700
and face up to
it, you can really

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.340
discover things about yourself
and find a different way

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.214
to express yourself.

00:58:44.214 --> 00:58:46.630
JENNA TAYLOR: What a perfect
way to end this conversation.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.790
I hope you all are as
inspired by that as I am.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.509
Thank you so much for your time.

00:58:50.509 --> 00:58:51.550
TANYA HOLLAND: Thank you.

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:53.700
JOANNE WEIR: Thanks, everyone.
