00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:02.367
Within the forecast fragment class,

00:00:02.367 --> 00:00:04.569
when the refresh menu item is selected,

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.430
we read from SharedPreferences.

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.294
Since they are key-value pairs,

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.817
we get their value stored 
for the location key.

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:13.158
If there's no value stored

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:15.684
then we fall back 
to the default location.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.132
Then we pass the location 
into the fetch weather task.
