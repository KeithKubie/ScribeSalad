00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:13.740
[ Silence ]

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.700
&gt;&gt; Harriett Green: And I'm
really excited to join this day

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.830
of invigorating discussions about
our Digital Collections as Data.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.260
And I'll be speaking,
as Kate indicated,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.540
about the new initiative we've
launched to train librarians

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.680
in methods for digital research.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.870
So, I'll first give -- briefly
give context around the issues

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.010
that motivated our projects
and some of the landscape,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.310
and then talk about
our project itself.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.150
So, as we've seen and heard
from presenters earlier today,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.550
accessible digitized content
and data is increasing rapidly,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.640
and the roles of libraries
are changing accordingly

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.720
as more researchers and
teachers integrate data

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.020
into their work and scholarship.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.180
As the Association for Research
Libraries Strategic Thinking

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.650
and Design Initiative
report, declares in its vision

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.260
of the future, "In 2033, the
research library will have shifted

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.830 position:56%
from its role as a knowledge service
provider within the university,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.450
to become a collaborative
partner within a rich

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.300
and diverse learning
and research ecosystem."

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.600
End quote.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.950
This future declaration
frames how librarians are

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.070
and will encounter new needs
and types of research queries

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.090
that challenge our
skill sets, knowledge,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.750
and scope of library services.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.100
And it's been made evident
today, the deluge is eminent

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.530
for the humanities and social
sciences, as much as the sciences.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010
So, in light of all this data
that we have in the humanities

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.630
and social sciences, how
can libraries prepare

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.110
for [inaudible] supporting,
emergent data-driven research?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.150
So, I won't repeat the points made
by previous presenters about data,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.420
but I wanted to highlight
this characterization of data

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.420
from the Our Cultural
Commonwealth report,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.990
published about ten years
ago from the American Council

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.500
of Learned Societies,
because it's in the context

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.260
of building cyberinfrastructure for
the humanities and social sciences.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.940
And it defines concisely but
thoroughly the richly diverse types

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.880
of data that research needs,
and the report goes on to say

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.190
that cyberinfrastructure
isn't just the hardware

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.330
and the software, but
it's the people.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.990 position:56%
And to quote, "A cyberinfrastructure
for humanities

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.650
and social sciences must encourage
interactions between the expert

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.690
and the amateur, the creative
artist and the scholar,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.250
the teacher and the student.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.300
It's not just the collection
of data, digital

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.820
or otherwise, that matters.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.510
At least as important as the
activity that goes around it,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.490
contributes to it, and
eventually integrates with it."

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.790
End quote.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.640
So, of equal importance to the
data, is the researcher, teacher,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.100
and librarian/research
expert who explore,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.340
expand, and curate the data.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.920
That's where [inaudible] and what
libraries are and should be doing

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.170
to engage in digital scholarship.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.730
So, there've been a number
of studies in recent years

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.230
that have looked at how libraries
are accommodating their spaces,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.190
services, and personnel, to serve
in digital scholarship needs.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.290 position:56%
And among others, the newly released
ARL SPEC Kit 350 by Rick Mulligan

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.310
on digital scholarship
centers and libraries,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.240
found that support
is relatively new,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.490 position:56%
so that of the responding libraries,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.150
67% of the digital scholarship
library personnel had joined

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.450
within the last five years,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.520 position:56%
and 75% have been doing this digital
scholarship work only for less

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.370
than 5 years, and digital
scholarship support is frequently

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.680
distributed across the libraries,
for the librarians and archivists

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.220
to professional support
staff, and student assistance.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.520
Support for digital scholarship

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.170
in libraries is growing
rapidly, but is still nascent.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.730
And then on the individual level,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.140
other studies have examined what
librarians are doing digital

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.320
scholarship now and what is needed.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.420
So, there've been two recent
volumes from ACRL and Purdue,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.590
that present a variety of use cases

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.910
of digital humanities
programs and projects.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.560
And groups such as ACRL's
Digital Humanities Interest Group,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.230
and the new library special
interest group, and the Association

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.870
for Digital Humanities
Organizations,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.170
are spaces where library

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.380
and communities involved
in DH, are growing.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.280
And then several libraries have
also begun to launch programs

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.710
to train their librarians in
digital scholarship skills,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.740
such as University of Maryland's
DH Incubator which Trevor will talk

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.980 position:56%
about in a few minutes, the Columbia
Library's Developing Librarian,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.080
and Harvard Library Lab among
many other -- several others.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.740
But despite these initial advances,
there's a still a ways to go.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.140
And how can we empower all
academic librarians to engage

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.230
with digital scholarship
and new forms of research?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.030
So, this is where our
project intends to step in.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.110
We've proposed a project
to the Institute of Museum

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.150
and Library Services
which they kindly funded,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.520
that's called "Digging
Deeper, Reaching Further,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.090
Libraries Empowering Users

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.210
to Mine Hathi Trust
Digital Library Resources."

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.340
So, for the next few minutes, I'll
talk about how our project seeks

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.820
to build librarians'
capacities and skills

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.400
in digital scholarship methods,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.270
specifically by connecting
librarians to collections,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.640
digital collections,
via skill-building

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.370
and research methods
for tech mining.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.650
So, to first talk about
our motivations

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.160
and philosophies for the project.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.380
To set the context,
our work is based

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.090
in the Hathi Trust Research
Center which is the research arm

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.910
of the Hathi Trust Digital Library.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.680
Many of you may be familiar with
the Hathi Trust Digital Library,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.360
as a digital library of over
14 million digitized texts

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.050
and materials, over 5
billion pages at last count.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.590
In the Hathi Trust Ecosystem,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.910 position:56%
the digital library collects digital
content, provides public access,

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.250
and preserves the digital content,
while at the research center,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.310
we enable researchers to gather
content from the digital library

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.200
into curated datasets, or what we
call work sets, and then analyze

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.720
and produce new scholarly findings.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.100
The Hathi Trust Research Center
is jointly led by the University

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.580
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and
Indiana University Bloomington,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.370
and we collaborate on
research development

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.030
of HTRC services and
researcher support.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.900
And we most prominently facilitate
researcher access to textural data,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.710
so at the moment, you can obtain
access to the public domain corpus

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.710
as full text and then other
more granular formats,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.010
but our ultimate goal is to provide
access to both out of copyright

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.680
and in copyright text, via tools

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.050
that facilitate non-consumptive
research.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.190
My HTRC colleagues are working on
these new developments very soon,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.920
and that's a -- more details can
be found on our website for that.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.680
But as we develop tools and
research resources in the HTRC,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.470
we increasingly realize that in
order to develop effective services

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.390
for users, we need to know
how to go about their work,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.880
and learn firsthand from them,
what they need to do or --

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.070
and/or support large scale
text analysis research.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.040 position:56%
So, in the last year, we conducted a
user assessment study for the HTRC,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.040
consisting of about 15 to
16 interviews thus far,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.990
with scholars from a
variety of disciplines,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.820
technologists and librarians.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.010
The HTRC team members, Alex
Kinnaman, Eleanor Dickson,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.800
and Peter Organisciak,
did some initial analysis

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.750
of the interview data
that we've coded,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.120
to develop preliminary
user personas.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.940
The digital project
librarian, the faculty member,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.450
and the graduate student.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.110
And so, we're finalizing
our analysis,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.980
and these personas are not concrete
by any means, but they begin

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.460 position:56%
to characterize the different levels
of users that engage with our data.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.030
You have the faculty team member,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.500
researcher with advanced
tools or advanced needs.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.970
The newer graduate student
researcher who's still exploring

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.270
methods and tools.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.150
And then there is the
research support personnel,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.400
characterized here as the
digital project librarian.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.600
And this user persona of the
digital project librarian,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.350
particularly caught our
eye and affirmed something

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.790
that we'd been considering.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.330
As we seek to engage researchers
and using the collections

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.290
of the Hathi Trust Digital
Library, in their scholarship,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.500
we realized that librarians
are a critical linchpin

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.420
in connecting researchers to the
data and tools, as they strive

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.390
to provide access to data and
match tools to the researchers.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.280
Well, and there's the circle.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.350
And so, in 2015, we were awarded a
three-year Laura Bush 21st Century

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.070
Librarian Program Grant
from the Institute

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.820
of Museum Library Services,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.590
to develop a digital
scholarship training program

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.820
from academic librarians,
as titled there.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.260
And I want to highlight the
word "empowerment" in our title

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.790
because empowerment
is key to our program.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.670
We seek to teach librarians
about the fundamental approaches

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.900
to text mining, how to
work with textual data,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.180 position:56%
and then as I'll explain in a
minute, enable them to teach others.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.310
And then given that the HTRC
is the anchor for our training

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.030
and the textual data
is core to the HTRC,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.400
the focus of curriculum
is on text mining.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.510
But our goals are preparing
librarians in ways and able them

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.730
to support digital
scholarship more broadly.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.660
So, here are our formal
goals, as listed up here.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.790
Arming librarians with new
content for instructional services

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.090
that address the curricular
and research needs of students

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.380
and faculty pursuing digital
scholarship, empower librarians

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.780
to become active research
partners on digital projects

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.080
at their institutions, and
provide foundational knowledge

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.910
to transform academic library
[inaudible] commons and DH centers

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.760
into more data intensive,
collaborative learning spaces,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.470
through the use of this curriculum
and the knowledge that enables them

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.230
to participate in scholarly
dialogues.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.720 position:56%
So, our project team is listed here.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.560
It's led by me, and then the co-PIs
include my Illinois colleagues Beth

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.030 position:56%
Namachchivaya and Steven Downie, and
we have four partner institutions

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.450
who span different sizes and types
of higher education institutions.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.270
So, in the end, at University
Bloomington, which again,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.810
is our HCRC partner as well and
is led by co-PI, Angela Courtney.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.890
Lafayette College, a
liberal arts college,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.810
Dean Neil McElroy and
Terese Heidenwolf.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.810
Northwestern University
with co-PI, Geoff Morse.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.210
And University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.060
Stewart Varner was our original
co-PI, but with his departure

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.570
to Penn, Amanda Henley
is now joining our team.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.470
So, the project began
in October 2015, again,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.280 position:56%
and we spent the last year
developing the curriculum but ceased

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.320
to train librarians and [inaudible]
professionals in approaches

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.190
and tools frequently used
in text mining research.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.800
And this year, we're now
launching pilot workshops,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.320
at all five partner
institutions, this fall and spring,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.850
to test drive the curriculum.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.730
So, to talk about the
curriculum in a bit of detail,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.770
the anchor of the curriculum is
the tools and services in the HTRC.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.060
So, we teach them to work
with the HRTC portal,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.860
which enables researchers to again,
build datasets of text, work sets,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.990
from the public domain corpus, and
the Hathi Trust Digital Library,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.910
and then they can run a selection
of data mining algorithms

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.840
that are preinstalled with the
portal, of course with the caveats

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.140
that were mentioned earlier today.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:37.210
And then also, we are teaching
them how to extract other ways

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.620
of getting Hathi Trust data
through things such as the API

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.800
and what we call "extracted
features."

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.920
But we also realize that librarians
operate in many different contexts

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.280
and field a wide range of
research questions, so,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.260
our focus to really teach about
the fundamentals about text mining,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.730
and perhaps what we might
call "data science skills."

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.920
We introduce participants to the
command line, how to harvest data

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.260
through web-scraping, how
to clean tabular data,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.870
and how to run basic Python
scripts for data manipulation

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.430
and basic types of text
analysis such as word frequency.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.040
Our curriculum is targeted
at beginners mostly,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.680
and the platforms we use in
teaching, such as PythonAnywhere,

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.930
are -- end up making these skills
and activities as widely accessible

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.890
as possible, in various
teaching environments.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.740
And so, we ultimately aim to build
foundational skills in text mining

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.020
in librarians, through a
train the trainer approach.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.670
After the attendees participate in
our workshops, we hope to put them

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.190
on the road to developing
these foundational skills,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.420
and they also will be given a full
suite of instructional resources

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.430
and tools at their disposal
to then teach the workshops

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.370
at their own institutions.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.610
So, next year, after
we do the pilots

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.340
and refine the curriculum
a bit more,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.700
we'll conduct a nationwide
road show workshops

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.770
that will train LIS
professionals at major conferences

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.800
and in key geographic areas
around the United States,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.280
and teaching both the HTRC
rules and the principles

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.770
of large scale text mining.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.240
After the workshops conclude,
we will refine our materials,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.930
one last time, and
then release a tool kit

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.500 position:56%
that will contain a finalized
package of the curriculum materials,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.170
tutorials, and other resources that
all librarians can take and use,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.330
and it'll be hosted on our
open institutional repository.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.770
And another outcome we hope to
build is a network community

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.530
of librarians, who want to
continue these conversations

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.450
and share their experiences as
they begin to teach text mining

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.890
and digital scholarship
at their own institutions.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.140 position:56%
And also, throughout the project,
we'll be conducting a research study

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.520
that assesses the process
of curriculum development

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.640
for digital scholarship methods
and also examine strategies

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.700
for LIS professional development.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.730
In this way, we hope to
build a community practice

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:48.000
around a curriculum as the trainers
become -- trainees become trainers.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.370
So, our project I believe will
be a significant step forward

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.010
in addressing the questions
of how do we build skills

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.480
in digital humanities
and digital scholarship,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.850
and for data driven
research in our libraries.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.690
And I propose that there
are a couple particular,

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.430
larger issues that we should
consider and begin to think --

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.940
rethink about librarianship as
we increase our interactions

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.470
with digital scholarship work.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.640
So, first as been made clear
by previous presenters today,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.330 position:56%
we need to re-conceptualize our work

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.350
and collection curation
and engagement.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.670
So, [inaudible] our librarians
are collection managers,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.040
but most of us touch and interact
with collections, and various ways

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.970
for reference to cataloging,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.890
to information architecture
and interface design.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.000
And with the rapid rise in digital
collections and our own holding

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
as well as throughout
the scholarly landscape,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.830
from the vast digital
resources, such as the Hathi Trust

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.280
through to our small local digital
collections, librarians will have

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.700
to engage with collections as
digital curators become familiar

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.410
with data acquisition,
and think broader --

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.260 position:56%
think about the broader multiplicity
of ways that users want to engage

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.010
with our collections in
digital and physical formats.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.850
And another key area
and opportunity along

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.780
with this is how librarians
can engage in more points

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.270
in the research lifecycle.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.880
So, scholars across the disciplines
are gathering varying amounts

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.380
of data, incorporating
data in different stages

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.440
of the research process, and are
looking to the library as a source

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.510
of research support beyond
just providing research

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.940
and reference guidance.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.420
And this is reflected in the
changing nature of who we're hiring

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.690
in the library for areas such
as data curation, GIS analysis,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.680
and data and scholarly publishing.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.010
The 2011, Value of
Academic Libraries Report

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.580
from the Association of
College and Research Libraries,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.660
notes that quote, "Research
collaborations between faculty

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.080
and librarians, continue
to benefit both partners.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.480
Faculty benefit from library
resources and librarian expertise.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.460
Librarians benefit
from the opportunity

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.580
to secure the library's future as
a significant partner in research

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.060
and scholarship," end quote.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.410
The Value Report is only one of
a number of studies that suggest

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.570
that research partnerships
between researchers

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.750
and librarians is more
necessary than ever.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.020
So, in conclusion,
I believe projects

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.730
such as ours will catalyze broader
thought processes on how to train

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.650
and prepare librarians
to meet the demands

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.640
of data driven research
and scholarship.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.570
We might consider these questions.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.780
What infrastructures do
libraries need to build or revise

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.590
for supporting digital scholarship?

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.970
How do we empower librarians
to build the skills needed

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.800
to respond to new research needs?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.360
And how can librarians
share skills, materials,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.340
and resources for supporting
digital scholarship?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.960
So, as we think more about how
do we translate our collections

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.830
into usable and accessible
data, I believe that the skills

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.560
and research connections forged
by librarians with faculty

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.800
and researchers will be key
to advancing our success.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.260
So, I want to thank again, the
IMLS for supporting our project,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.200
as well as the Hathi
Trust Research Center,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:47.510
and our partnering institutions,
image credits, and thank you.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:59.940
[ Applause ]

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.200
&gt;&gt; Trevor Munoz: Device switcheroo.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.230
I have learned after a
long, painful experience,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.900
that I can't type my password and
start talking at the same time.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.420
So, my computer is very secure

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.260
but I definitely can't
multitask for that password.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.910
So, I want to say that
I'm absolutely thrilled

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.330 position:56%
to have been invited to speak today,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.090
alongside so many folks
doing such amazing work.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.390
I hope that there is not a level of
jaded cynicism at which you know,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.690
getting to speak at the Library

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.750
of Congress is not really
all that, because it is.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:47.110
And I'm particularly pleased to
be on this panel for two reasons.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.760
One, because my co-panelists
are both people

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.060
from whom I have learned a lot

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.590
and whom I continue
to look to, to learn.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.690
But also, because this topic
of developing communities

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:02.240
of practice is one that I have a
lot of complicated feelings about

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.790
and that I love to talk about.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:13.380
So, am I'm going to try to do this
in the context of this initiative

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.800
that we're working on the at
the University of Maryland,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.350
"Synergies Among Digital Humanities

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.520
and African American
History and Culture."

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.200
And in a couple minutes, we're
going to put that sort of front

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.540
and center, but I wanted
to just sort

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.910
of make one other personal note,
which is to say that I engage

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.210
with collections, you know,
sort of me personally,

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.010
I engage with collections
as data in a number of ways.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.060 position:56%
I occasionally write code to do some
analysis or satisfy a curiosity.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.170
I have been guilty of committing
the occasional data visualization.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:46.690
However, my main job is to work
with people who are doing things

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.200
with collections or want to
do things with collections,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.120
and these are both analog
and digital collections.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.340
Or maybe more precisely, my
job is to help bring together

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.330
and facilitate groups of humans
who are engaged with data.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.900
And so, I want to talk about
the ways in which we're thinking

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.530
through some of the
issues that arise

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.680
in the context of this initiative.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.060
So, "Synergies Among
Digital Humanities

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.780
and African American History
and Culture," is the formal name

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.900
of our project, but
it's far too long

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.970
to keep saying over and over again.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.080
So, we also refer to it
as the AADHUM Initiative,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.610
and that's what I'll
be doing henceforth.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.900
You'll notice that English grammar
forces us to put those terms

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.820
in one order for euphony,
but it is important

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:37.310
that the African American part
comes first, AADHUM, ADDHUM.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.630
So, this is our project hashtag,
where hopefully we will be able

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.930
to have further conversation
around this topic.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.130
And I should also say that
what you're hearing today is

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.290
of course only one voice from
what is already a sort of large

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.630
and multifaceted initiative.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.540
So, this is me.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.480
That's my Twitter handle,
my contact information.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.900
But of course, I'm also speaking
to you as a member of a community,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.340
or really multiple
other communities.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.940
The people who have been
working hard for two years

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.850 position:56%
to make this initiative a reality at
Maryland, the team of people beyond

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.880 position:56%
that who are now joining the project
and contributing their skills.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.240
And yet, even though this
project is only really seven

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.380
or eight months old,
already the number of people,

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.380
the community of people
who are engaged

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.030
in this work, is quite large.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.000 position:56%
So, I can only speak to you know,
the limits of my personal experience

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.910
and my reflections on the work that
we are collectively doing together.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.860
And I think it's important not to
forget that we are always enmeshed

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.900
in these larger communities.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.120
And I'll come back to
that point in a second.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.040 position:56%
So, the website for today's event
explained in the kind of intro text,

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.600 position:56%
that "The rise of accessible digital
collections," I'm quoting here,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.350
"coupled with development of tools
for processing and analyzing data,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.900
has enabled researchers
to create new models

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.540
of scholarship and inquiry."

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.450
I'm a humanist, so I
can't help sort of picking

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.710
at the terms of the debate.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.320
And so, I think one way that we
can then understand communities

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.630
of practice, is as one model of
these new modes of scholarship

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.270
and inquiry, which is to
say, communities are part

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.110
of how accessible digital
collections may be coupled with

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.530 position:56%
or may fail to be coupled with tools
for processing and analyzing data

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.740
to do work that matters
to other humans.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.700 position:56%
And so, my basic premise then is
that a world of collections as data,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.900
depends upon the design and
nurturing of communities.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.030
And the phrase, "communities
of practice," I think is an --

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.250
it's important to realize
that this is a subset, right?

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.240
The phrase "communities of
practice," is a term of art

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.730
and it comes from a
particular place.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:02.850 position:56%
To sketch this history, very briefly
and to do it absolutely no justice

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.080
at all, the original nexus for
the concept of "communities

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.650
of practice," is in
workplace anthropology

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.870
and it was chiefly focused on
understanding adult learning

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.450
and improving adult learning.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.430
And it was further developed
to describe sort of ad hock

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.070
and improvised ways of sharing
knowledge within organizations,

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.230
within workplaces, to
quote, "Get the job done,"

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.010
when existing knowledge or
managerial direction falls short.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.110 position:56%
And of course, people who've engaged

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.690
with this idea have
also been interested

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:37.930
in how these practices create and
reshape the identities of workers,

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.100
and thus perhaps, unsurprisingly,
the concept of "communities

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.040
of practice" have been taken up
and discussed as a managerial tool,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.660
especially for breaking
through institutional barriers

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.620
and promoting, quote, "innovation."

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.340 position:56%
Andrew Cox has provided a very
useful overview of the seminal works

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.880
on community of practice in
a 2005 article in the Journal

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.150
of Information Science, for those
of you who are interested in more.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.900
And the progression that he
traces is certainly toward a more

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.840
and more sort of organizational
studies, managerial approach,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.000
to communities of practice.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.040
And so, then what should we take
from the career of this term

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.650
of our communities of practice,
as a concept to take back with us

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.110
for our reflections on how we
think about collections as data.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.320
Certainly, there is much to like.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.710
Learning as an active,
social process,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.360
not a mechanical transfer
of skills and knowledge.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.010
The emphasis on improvising
new forms of work

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.790
when old ones no longer suit.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.640
The seductive allure of breaking
through institutional barriers

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.410
and building a group identity
with other like-minded folks.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.070
Certainly, I think the
energy around today's event,

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.440
is certainly an expression of
the hunger that we often feel

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.900
when we use a term like
"communities of practice," right?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.580
We want to find others like us

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.760
who are doing things the
way that we're doing.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.740
And that can be both beneficial
and I think it can also block us

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.040
from seeing other things.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.100
So, what might the two easy
acceptance of communities

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.080
of practice as our vehicle
for thinking about communities

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.420
in the context of collections,
not allow us to see?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:18.740
I think there's a tendency to
treat communities of practice

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.760
as though they might
be an emergent property

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.690
of materials and methods, right?

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.600
If you make materials available and
you have people who might be expert

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.160
in certain methods, or who are
becoming expert in certain methods,

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.180
they will find each other,
they will do amazing things,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.750
and certainly that is true.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.700
And some of the central
scholarship on communities

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.830
of practice can certainly be read

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.250
to support this sort
of quasi-emergent idea.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:50.030
But in my experience, this is
really almost never the case.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.160 position:56%
We're not seeing something
important that's actually happening.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.070 position:56%
It's important to remind ourselves
that communities are not spontaneous

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.290
or organic, and to quote the
wonderful critical theorist,

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.480
Miranda Joseph, who's written
beautifully on the idea

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.400
of community, "To invoke community
is immediately to raise questions

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.580
of belonging, and of power."

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.940
And that I think is one area
in which the work we're doing

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:21.040 position:56%
within the ADDHUM initiative is sort
of asking us to push beyond the idea

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.110
of communities of practice that
we've inherited from a kind

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.250
of organizational studies context.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.130
And that context, it sort of
notoriously has done very little

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.320
to grapple with sort of
notions of power and dominance,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.940 position:56%
which of course an important element

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.630
of the communities
that we all live in.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.680
I think it's important to
understand that communities

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.050
of practice are always communities
within other communities.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.280
The work of designing them,
because it is intentional design,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.630
and nurturing them, also
intentionally, will always be done

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.420
in the context of the communities
in which we already live.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.760
The structures of power, the
relationships between people

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.870
of different backgrounds,
different experiences,

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.450
that exist in those
communities already.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.000
We don't get to just sort wipe
the slate clean, and talk in very,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.840
sort of narrow, technocratic terms
about communities of practice

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.460
as though they weren't
already imbricated

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.890
in the American community,
the D.C. community,

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:20.210 position:56%
whatever community we find ourselves
living in, the campus community,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.870
that we -- and we have to sort of
take this into account in terms

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.690
of both design and nurturing.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.640
And maybe that not everyone who's
working in our community, you know,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.540
comes to work you know, with the
same sort of emotional experience

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.010
of things happening out
there in the larger world.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.980
And so, this is why I
think it's imperative not

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.050
to let the active work of
community development sort

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.350
of fall below the level
of our full attention,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.330
because this work demands every
bit as much as the building

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.070
of collections, or the
development of tools.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.650
And we are responsible

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.000
for the communities we
create or fail to create.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.670
I think listening to the
talk earlier, you know,

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.180
we're working toward being maybe
a little bit more like some

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.610
of those fan [phonetic]
fiction communities

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.170
that we were hearing about.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.390
And that might look
different from the way

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.560
that we understand communities
of sort of senior scholars

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.640
and junior scholars, or academics
and members of the public.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.080
So, to try and explain a
little bit more of what I mean

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.800 position:56%
in concrete terms, I'll say a little
bit more about how we're working

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.430
through these challenges
in the ADDHUM initiative.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:32.240 position:56%
The initiative is funded by a grant
from the Andrew W Mellon Foundation,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.440
and we're about three-quarters
of the way

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.910
into the first year of
three years of work.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.280
With the leadership of the dean of
the college of arts and humanities,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.170 position:56%
Bonnie Thornton Dill [phonetic], the
work of ADDHUM is led by the Center

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.660
for Synergy, under the direction
of Sherry Parks [phonetic]

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.830
and the Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.380
or MITH, under the direction of
my boss, Neil Frysat [phonetic].

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.190
Also, partnering in the
initiative are the Center

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.280
for Global Migration Studies,
the David C. Driscoll Center

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.250
for the Study of Visual Arts,
and Culture of African Americans

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.770
and the African [inaudible], as
well as the university libraries,

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.180
where I report to my other boss.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.460
And the work of ADDHUM is
led by our faculty director,

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.760
Catherine Knight-Steele [phonetic],

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.160 position:56%
and includes post-doctoral
associates, MITH digital humanities,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.260
research faculty and staff,
an advisory board of scholars

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.260
from multiple disciplines
invested in the study

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.060
of African American culture and
history, librarians and archivists,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.270
graduate assistants, and we hope
faculty, students, librarian

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.570 position:56%
and cultural heritage professionals,

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:30.780
and members of a still wider
community that we hope to fold in.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.140 position:56%
And it's worth saying, since Harriet
mentioned, the earlier iterations

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.780 position:56%
of the digital humanities
incubator which is part of our plans

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.740
for the ADDHUM initiative, that
we've gone from the first iteration

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.850
where it was solely focused on
building up skills and capacity

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.290
in among our librarians, to a model

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.280
where everyone is all
mixed together,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.280
and we take on that
greater challenge

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.360
of having all these
people mixed together

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.900
with their different
experiences, different expertise,

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.700
because ultimately, I think that's
the way we need to be working.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.890
And so, the goals of the ADDHUM
initiative are to advance

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.230
and expand the fields
of digital humanities,

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.590
and African American history and
cultural studies, and to develop

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.300
and diversify the pipeline for
the next generation of scholars

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.140
and professionals who foster
engagement at this intersection.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.670 position:56%
Which is to say that we are directly
engaged in building communities

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.590
of practice, in building
communities,

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:25.980
and that these communities will
be a measure of our project,

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.990
as much as any of the scholarship,
whether it be digital projects

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.510
or traditional publications, or
new courses, or public programing,

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.590
that we also produce, right?

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:40.880
We are willing to be measured by
the community that we are creating,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.260
because that is a critical
part of the work

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.070
that the grant has
set itself out to do.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.140
So, rather than produce a
single research project,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.260
ADDHUM seeks to transform
both the digital humanities

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.090
and the African American
cultural studies fields.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.370
And so, to accomplish
this goal, we'll you know,

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.670
we will do a number of things.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.030
We will foster of cohort
of scholars and students,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.600
working at this intersection.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.950
This cohort will facilitate
all the kinds

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.730
of people that I just mentioned.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.500
We'll be creating and revising
new courses at the University

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.700
of Maryland, in disciplines
related to African American history

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.410
and culture, which is
frankly all of them.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.610
And to provide training and
development opportunities

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.490
to support local and regional
participants in conceiving

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.790
and producing new research.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.860 position:56%
I'm coming to that part in a second.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.080
We're also planning to
organize a national conference

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.580
to bring together those parts
of this network that we can --

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.070
who are doing digital research
like this, that we can touch,

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.910
that we can reach, and to
oversee digitization description

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.830
of archival collections
at the Driscoll Center

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.240
and the George Meany Memorial
AFL-CIO Archive at the University

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.640
of Maryland Libraries, that
are relevant to research

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.290
on African American labor,
migration, and artistic expression,

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.070
which are the core themes around
which we're organizing our work.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:59.830
And I want to stop here and
say also that this is only sort

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.120
of the latest entry in work
that many people have been doing

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.890
for a very, long time, right?

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.120
Again, we're not wiping
the slate clean.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.170
It's not -- we are
not newly bringing

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:13.270
into being this collaborative
community between people working

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.680
in digital ways and people studying
African American history and life.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.680 position:56%
There's a long history of such work,
and we are just happy to be joining

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.210
that conversation,
trying to do our part.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.890
So, lest the central point be
lost in all of these details,

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.610
the way I would describe
our community of practice,

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:36.810 position:56%
our community, is to say that ADDHUM
is a community invested in the study

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:42.350
of African American history and
culture, and I want to phrase it

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.910
that way because I think often,
because of the history of the term

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.430
"communities of practice,"
we find ourselves using it

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.560
in far too technocratic
a sense, right?

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.570
That it's about skills
transfer or achieving some sort

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.280
of organizational mission.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:07.480
And so, we're putting the
idea of all the different ways

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.020
that we could use digital methods,
digital tools, digital collections,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.350
to study African American history
and culture, at the center.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.550
And by no means does that mean
we are giving up being invested

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.580
in a vision of digital
work that explores new ways

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.430
of using computing, and that
is informed by you know,

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:27.640
the scholars who have studied
African American history

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.690
and culture before our
project even began.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:37.250
And a lot of the work right now, is
sort of imagining the programming

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.330
that we call the digital
humanities incubators,

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:43.160
though we have called the digital
humanities incubators in the past.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.940
And my colleagues,
Catherine Knight-Steele

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.830
and [inaudible] Linblad [phonetic]
are really leading this work

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.200
and I'm really sort of
reflecting and reporting

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.060
on the great work that
they are doing.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.920
And as I kind of hinted,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.450
the DH incubators have
been an evolving process,

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:00.730
where we started very much in the
idea focused on being a way of sort

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.320
of incubating project ideas, right?

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.890
Building particular
skills and capacities

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.780
such that librarians
could do digital projects.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.540
And that has some positives
as far as they went,

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.520
but then the next time we got a
chance to run this programming,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.540
we decided that we would
put the data at the center

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.650
and that has been a new idea that
has sort of stuck with us, right?

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.810
That we put the data in the center,
and ask our community all the ways

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.010
in which they might wish to
respond to it, without presuming

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:35.060
that we know particular methods or
techniques that we just simply need

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:40.380
to communicate outward to them.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.910
The Scholar of Visual Culture,
Laura Wexler [phonetic],

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.410
makes a nice point with
regard to crowd sourcing,

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.030
and talking about how we go
beyond sort of using the crowd

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.290
for data collection or data
production, and being open

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.960
to all the other ways in which the
community might wish to respond

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.230
to a given dataset or a given
collection, and to also be open

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.510
to taking that in, even though
it goes beyond say perhaps

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.080
simple transcription.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.670
And so, the idea of the
incubator is still evolving,

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.940
and we're evolving this
idea with the ethics

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.770
of building a community
fully in mind, right?

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.690
So, this perhaps means, "How do we
stay in touch with people who come

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.930
into contact with us or engaging
with us, for longer than we might,

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.990
if it was simply skills
training, right?

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.550
How do we build an
ongoing relationship?"

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.420
Another aspect of it is, "Where
do we do this work, right?"

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.390
We're all sort of embodied
people and the spaces

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.970
in which we do this work
and who else is in the room,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.700
matters a lot about who
can access and who can feel

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.000
like they're part of our community?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.850
So, that's an aspect that
we're really thinking about.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:51.080
And [inaudible], pardon
my pronunciation,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:56.050
who are sort of some key
practitioners from the tradition

00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:00.010
of participatory design, have a
nice way of thinking about this,

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.880
and they are citing actually
the work of Lucy Suchman,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.600
the feminist historian
of technology.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.890
And she's arguing that we need
to get away from viewing things

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:12.690
as discreet objects, and
networks of devices, but instead,

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.980
to start viewing design work and
technological development as quote,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.340
"Entry into networks of working
relations, including both contests

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.650
and alliances that make
technical systems possible."

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.750
And as [inaudible] Vincent
and [inaudible] Wright,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.250
this is hard design work, where
various context or practices

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.040
and technologies concurrently
undergo change,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.760
and therefore demand continuous --

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.900
what they call, "continuous
infrastructuring," and aligning

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.010
of partly conflicting interests.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.110
So, I think it's useful to
think about the work we do

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.480
about building community around
collections, around data,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.840
as this work of continuous
infrastructuring, to think about it

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.650
in terms of the people who
are in our communities,

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:01.020
the emotions that they're having,
the desires that they have,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.760
the goals that they have, and then
to structure the work that we do

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.420
around how do we imagine sort

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.510
of aligning all those partly
conflicting interests,

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.040
not getting caught up in
the rush of finding people

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.920
who are just doing things like
us, but to think hard and do

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.930
that hard design work, to
do the hard design work

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.760
of continuous infrastructuring,
or of designing

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.750
and nurturing communities.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.370
So, just as a closing thought,
it seems to me that communities

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:33.030
of practice may be a find starting
point, for how we imagine access

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.600
and use models, for
digital collections,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.620
but it certainly can't
be the stopping point.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.710
Most of the core scholarship on
communities of practice is 20

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.890
and 30 years old, which of
course doesn't make it outdated

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.550
in the humanities, but I'm
sure people have said lots

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.570
of interesting things since then.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.340
And in the spirit of being good
interdisciplinary borrowers,

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.570
we should probably try to
engage those ideas as well.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.800
And I think it's particularly
important, as we do this,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.080
to think about how we
make collections as data

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.730
into what Miranda Joseph calls

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.890
"legitimate sites of
empathy of concern."

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.690
Thank you.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:17.330
[ Applause ]

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.910
&gt;&gt; Marisa Parham: I'm
another computer person,

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:35.290
so give me a moment.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:40.190
I've always had this dream that I
would chat and say witty things,

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.170
as I got set up, but
[inaudible], no.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:48.370
I won't go so far as to
say the dream is dead,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:55.360
but it's not thriving.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.910
But fortunately, I have my
bag, my mommy bag of dongles.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:17.790
So, I've been interested
today in sort of thinking

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:23.430
about how things can be
pulled together, right?

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.040
I'm not here necessarily
to pull things together,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.340
but I'm always interested --

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.870
this is one of the problems
of coming up end of the day.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.120
I'm sort of interested in
where we can find connections

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.600
between the things that
have always been said.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.740
This my like way of copping out
of the fact that like I'm going,

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.100
so much at the end of the day,
and there's so much to say

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.340
because of course I've been sort of
hyper-stimulated by all the stuff

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.120
that people have said before.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:51.890
So, I want to begin today by
thinking about the kinds of issues

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.400
that emerge when we think about
data as a personal matter.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.260
So, often we speak of collections
at large, and we're thinking

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.930
about small things, right?

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.010
So, there's a way in which
we talk about collections

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.950
when we're thinking about sort
of you know, digital humanities

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.060
and library work and archives and
so on, but when you're thinking

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.200
about the raw material that
constitutes collections,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.500
you're often just talking
about personal things, right?

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.110
Some point, much of what we
refer to as something pulled

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.000
into a collection was
something personal.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.400
And that's a little bit of what
I want to talk about today.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.290
Right? Collections are letters
in attics, the boxes of receipts,

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.860
piles of playbills
in someone's closet.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.680
I had the huge privilege of being
able to go to the Museum of --

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.090
the National Museum of
African American History

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.180
and Culture opening this weekend,

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.860
and a lot was made I think
rightfully, of how so much

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.920
of this sort of material history
has been left out of conversation

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.100
because it's been squirreled
away in the attics of people

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.400
who are not included in those kinds

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.480
of archival conversations
previously.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.360
So, it was really sort of weighing
on me as I prepared this talk

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.350
in thinking about collections.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.850
I also want to think about what is
gained and lost in the transition

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:03.510
from one kind of narrative space,
the local and the personal,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.430
into other kinds of
uses, the archival,

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.790
the computational, or so on.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:12.350
And even though I prefer not to
belabor the usual dichotomies,

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.330 position:56%
even though I kind of began with one
in my title, I've pulled this term

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.690
"Datum Storytelling," because
it helps me think about issues

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.770
that emerge at the intersection of
data, the way we talk about it now,

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:27.600 position:56%
data, big data, so on, to reveal the
excavated, the collected, the scene,

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.230
and the personal, which can be
all those things, but also brings

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.110
with it, a sense of what
is at stake in ownership,

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:37.590
management, or the control thereof.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:41.210
If we accept that there is
any conceptual value in data,

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.800
then we must also accept that
our lives have always been lived

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.100
in streams of data.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.310
Data is the trace.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.360
I'm thinking here of recent works.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.340
For instance, the work
done by Lupi and Posavec,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.810
this project you may have
seen called "Dear Data,"

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:59.160
in which to each person, they're
both artists, collected all kinds

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.590
of personal information, then
converted the personal information,

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:07.200
tracked over a week, into hand
drawn data visualizations.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.190
I found this super
interesting, right?

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.870
I'll put it back so you
can see a little bit more.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.880
I found this super interesting
because there was a way

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.990
in which it kind of took this
notion of tracking, right,

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:20.620
the watch you wear, the wearables
and so on, and made it back

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:24.820
into what we usually think of as an
easier kind of analog art, right?

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.910
So, I was interested then in sort
of how they talk about it as well.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:33.570
This is a quote, "We've always
conceived 'Dear Data,'" they write,

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:37.670
"as a personal documentary, rather
than a quantified self-project,

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.580
which is a subtle, but
important distinction.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.270 position:56%
Instead of using data just to become
more efficient, we argue we use data

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.160
to become more humane, and
to connect with ourselves

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.800
and others at a deeper level.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.080 position:56%
For Lupi and Posavec, life is parsed
in the data and so transformed,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:58.000
produces newly [inaudible]
raw material for art,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.790
story, and visualization.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.830
In 'Dear Data,' each datum
is self-consciously deployed

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.070
to tell a story."

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:11.130
Datum storytelling then, is a way
of thinking about intentionality

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:14.640
in archival development
collection, and without losing

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.580
at the same time, sight of people.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.880
The sight of the human.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.850
And later on, I want to
interrogate this notion

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:24.150
of the human just a little bit, but
for now, we'll go with this, right?

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.230
But when we're thinking about this
in data, the human, the person,

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.760
is a referent and I'm
thinking of a human

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.490
who can self-consciously
manage, disseminate,

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.150
parlay, and remix their trace.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:39.200
This reminds me of some
of the restorative work

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.490
that we know happens as we age.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.890
Telling stories and returning
to our personal collections,

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:49.450
grounds our sense of self very
much in that which is familiar.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.300
And so, the metaphor I always use
for this is this notion of sort

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.070
of digging in the crates,
right, a sort of hip-hop term.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.100
The idea is that this
is sort of archive

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.710
that you're constantly digging
through, but you're digging

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.080
through it with the
interest -- I'll put it back.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.990
You're digging through it in
the interest of being able

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.130
to show people something new.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.760
So, the archival is
specifically deployed.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.450
Again, the new is made out of
the old, which sounds very corny

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.070
when you say it like that,
but when you're there, right,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.770
it's a moment of intense,
sort of meaningfulness, right?

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.070
And it's very corny.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.370
I was looking for it.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.220 position:56%
There's this old, sort of, you know,
God, it was really embarrassing

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.940
because I was looking for it and
I realized it was essentially

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.500
on a Coke commercial or something.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.810
It won in some moment of marketing.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:34.360
And it was this old, sort
of, you know, Mary J. Blige

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.070
and Method Man commercial,

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.970 position:56%
and in that commercial they were
playing the song, "You're all I Need

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.780
to Get By," and it was like
a kid upstairs listening

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.830
to the hip-hop version, and then
the grandparents downstairs,

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.950
listening to the old, sort of
Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell version.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:51.480
And the idea was like, they
showed the split space, the floor.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.440
And upstairs, right, you have the
kid stomping out, and downstairs,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.090
the grownups are like, "Yes, they
finally found the truth," right?

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.720
So, this notion of sort
of digging in the crates,

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.500
I've always found really
interesting.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.680 position:56%
And I think it's useful for thinking
about the individual making choices.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.940
The generational and community.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.200
It also brings to a
forefront, the idea of curation.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.930
The idea that the past itself is a
collection, and that we think today

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:22.360
about processing that collection,
to give historical contour

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.120
to an otherwise infinitely
mutable present.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.310
The idea of digging
in the crates brings

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.480
with it, the joy of discovery.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.940
A joy amplified by
artistic transformations

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.720 position:56%
that archival discovery will enable.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.730
What is more difficult
to conceptualize however,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.590
are the limits, or if there
should be a limit to that digging.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.720
In an essay titled, "The Digital
Afterlife of Lost Family Photos,"

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.090 position:56%
Teju Cole describes work done by the
artist Zun Lee, you can see it here

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.330
on the screen, called
"Fade Resistance."

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.300
In this project, Lee
takes as his medium,

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.400
found photographs of
African Americans.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.170
So, the kind of stuff
we were talking about --

00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:59.660
or I was talking about
in terms of the museum.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.420
The stuff in attics, the
stuff at flea markets, right?

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.800
These collections of photographs
that have been orphaned now.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.870
So, no one knows to whom they
belong, but we know of course

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:09.680
by virtue of being
photographs collected,

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.780
they were important to someone.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.080
Right? How do we fill that gap?

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.610
How do we think about this?

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.780
Cole recounts one of Lee's
anecdotes from the project,

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.240
and I'm going to share it
here because it encapsulates

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.680
in a different way, how we might
experience the transition from data

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.450
to datum, in our increasingly
digital life worlds.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.000
"Who took these photos?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.300
Who do they depict?"

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.660
Cole asks.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.790
"The basic contextual details,
we would usually expect

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.080
from snapshots are missing here.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.840
The absence of this
information is bitter sweet.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.170
We are bewildered, but
we are also ferried

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.700
over from the imagery
into imagination.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.050
In Lee's case, the story

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.320
of his orphaned Polaroids
took a surprising turn.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.660
When he uploaded some
of them to Facebook,

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.430
the social network's facial
recognition technology immediately

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.150
began to match then
with real people.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.960
Lee was not sure who
was doing the tagging.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.270
Intrigued and wary, he sent
a message to one individual

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.620
who was tagged in several
of the pictures.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.150
There was no response.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.800
Then several weeks later, he
got a message from the same man.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.630
A curt request, that he
take the pictures down."

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.790
Of the experience Lee notes, I
quote, "He's already been thinking

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:20.470
about how databases and
tags are not neutral.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.950
How they can wind up being hostile
towards communities of color.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.180
I completely understand,"
Lee told Cole.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.640
Quote, "This man was saying, 'We
are not willing participants.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.750
The black body is used
as a commodity,

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.550
as something that is surveilled.'

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.980
The man was telling me,
'No, you're not welcome.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.280
This is not art.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.850
Get the hell out of our lives.'

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:44.070
And I understood it."

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.600
In so far as collection
bespeaks curation, in our work,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.420
we must also be ready to think
about the rightful sense of danger

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:53.180
that the very idea of being
collected might bring.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.590
And by extension, the technically
invasive work or conversion

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.720
of objects and moments into data.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.540
The parsing and the combine.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.690
So, it was important by the
way, I should note in this talk

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.250
that I'm actually quite
a technical person,

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.470
so it's kind of a shadow
technical talk behind this.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.220
When I'm talking about sort of
parsing collections and data,

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.570
I'm thinking about some of the
stuff we got earlier today,

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.670
of thinking about using
images as text for instance.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.970
I'm thinking about [inaudible].

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.540
I'm thinking about the ways in
which we break these larger things

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.860
down into smaller,
compartmentalized,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.680
and remixable units, right?

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.980
The parsing.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.280
So, to be clear, it's
like a shadow behind.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.720
It's like detect shadow.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.360
Right? But I only have so
much time, so I'm just rushing

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.930
through the other part for now.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.200
Oh, I wish I could
have a super hero name,

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.490
like tech shadow, but whatever.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.830
So, sorry.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:42.290
So, I'm also taken with the
problem of disappearance,

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.250
which by the thought
works against this work.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:51.440 position:56%
In his essay, one example Cole turns
to actually is this one, this photo.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.250
As he reads the back of
a photo, he says quote,

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:59.220
"It's adjust that it was paste into
an album, and then ripped out."

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.110
And people do this kind of work and
be -- and are familiar with this,

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:05.020
even sort of the blackness of the
glue which shows it was archive.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.530
It was a particular kind of glue
that was used, so when it was paste

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.520 position:56%
into the album, it was made to last,

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.820
but then it was nonetheless,
ripped out, right?

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.500
How do we map and mark
that transition?

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.150
How do we think about it?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.380
As well, this is no mere
glue stick decision.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.650
As equally significant
to us then in this image,

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.420
is what is hidden from us.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.770
Much of what is at stake in this
example, comes down to ownership.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:35.470 position:56%
For the idea of personal collection,
is also an exercise in exclusion.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.360
Right? And my example, is
that I've been doing work

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.310
for the last few years on
Octavia Butler [inaudible] archive

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.270
which is just amazing.

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:45.410
But whenever I'm working, I'm at
some points sort of overwhelmed

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.340
by a sense that I have
to be careful in thinking

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.120
about that archive
as her collection.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.160
It's a collection of her stuff,
but insofar as she died, suddenly

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:59.190
and unexpectantly, and young,
we must as researchers live

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:02.520
with the fact that she had
little hand in this curation.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.820
I always wonder what she would have
thrown away and as everything there

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.960
like little slips of
paper, receipts,

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.570
all kinds of private
information, right?

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.280
On the one hand, the fullness
of that archive is a boon

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.820
for researchers like
me, but because she's

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.170
so carefully otherwise
crafted her public life,

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:23.140 position:56%
I know that her deletions would have
probably been just as instructive,

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.140
albeit ghostly, as is somewhat
wholesale and [inaudible].

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.170 position:56%
I'm intrigued in thinking about what
it means for her to lose so much

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:34.980
of that narration, to lose
agency despite legacy.

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.940 position:56%
Digging in the crates and permission
just really can't always coexist,

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.690
when we're thinking of the past.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.520
Many of course have taken
up the ethical questions

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.570
of opening archives and so on, but
I just want to think about this

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.980 position:56%
for a moment as a way of introducing
this notion of how we might mourn,

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.320
in the midst of opportunity.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.620
But I'll move on.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:58.210
At the forefront of thinking
about purpose in the [inaudible]

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.580
of digital work, for me
has been a commitment

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.900
to openness and we hear this a lot.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:03.200
It's important work.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.930
Which as many have pointed out,
unlock some of the negative

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.650
or oppressive ownership
relations historically associated

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:10.600
with resource enabled entities.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.370
Collecting from sometimes
even willing, but usually not,

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:18.150
others when a big institution comes
and gets all your stuff, right?

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:22.370 position:56%
Regardless, if openness, publicness,
and access, are the hallmarks

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.930
of decolonial approaches to archive
making, and I believe they are,

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:28.810
I am also nonetheless
interested in the meaningfulness

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.910 position:56%
of exclusion, elision, and deletion.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.840
But sometimes, even
[inaudible] making.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.750
The meaningfulness in other
words, of storytelling.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.570
I am thinking here of Michelle
Caswell's [phonetic] work

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.990
on thinking about the kinds
of agency made possible

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:46.700
through the collection, also the
deployment, of archival materials.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.210 position:56%
In inventing new archival
imaginaries, theoretical foundations

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.370
for identity-based community
archives, Caswell reminds us

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:57.720
that quote, "Memory archives
are not just memory activists,

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.360
but visionaries whose work
reconceives imagined worlds

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.860
through space and time."

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.610
In aligning archival work
with memory and its futures,

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:10.500 position:56%
rather than only with historical
recovery representation of the past,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.760
Caswell offers us a way to
think very instrumentally

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.800
about our own archival projects.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.740
If, following Caswell,
archives are quote,

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.970
"Not just about documenting a
more diverse version of the past,

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.810
based on the identities of present,

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:25.930
but rather by uncovering
previously untold, ignored,

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.890
or misinterpreted histories."

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:30.560
Communities can imagine and
reimagine different trajectories

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.690
for the future, so it's
not just enough to say,

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:34.970
"We're going to expand our
archive by putting more kinds

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.140
of people into it," right?

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.730
This notion of empowerment
around the archive is also

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.230
about making the archive
available in such a way

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.560
that it can also be disseminated by
the communities that need it most.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.440
Right? It's an important
distinction.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.240
Thinking about this, I would argue,

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.990
gets us towards the generative
possibilities of eliciting data,

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.530
even computationally, from datum.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.810
In a talk titled, "Networked
Knowledge, Digital Spaces:

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.570
Storytelling as Decolonial
Methodology," Emily Legg,

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:07.100 position:56%
building on the work of scholars of
indigenous memory in history asks us

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.340
to think in very material
ways about quote,

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.660
"Storytelling as knowledge-making,
and a way of knowing

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.480
that it's not placed
within one individual

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.190
who passes down to others.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.640
Instead, it is knowledge that
exists in a network state,

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.220
within a row of the community
as knowledge partners."

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.200
Again, I offer not all of this to
make a commentary on the difference

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.820
between storytelling and like
the [inaudible] versus data

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.930
and like the machines or something.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:34.010
But that if we're thinking
about how to decolonize

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.240
that which is collected,
we must also be thinking

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.160
about knowledge transfer, and
therefore thinking differently

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.090
about design and interface.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.630
The motion quote of knowledge is
seated in its [inaudible] context,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.280
and emerges when we're supposed
to listen to it, the idea right,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.000
is that you can't necessarily
approach and archive,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.850
already knowing what
you're expecting to get.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.700
A proper archive, and this
is something that's come

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.980
up all day today, it's
called serendipity, right?

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.750
The idea right, is that
the archive is a depository

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.840
that also teaches you, and
that teaching depends on you

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.810
on some level not knowing
what you're going

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:13.370
to get when you go there.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.990
But as you can imagine, this is
a very compelling design problem.

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:21.250
How do we enable these
arrivals, right?

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.230
And underlying some of this,
right, I'm thinking about you know,

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.530
someone like [inaudible], right,

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:30.030
when we're decolonizing
knowledge points out, quote,

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:34.670
"Decolonization is not about only
design, tinkering with the margins.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:38.810 position:56%
It is about reshaping, turning human
beings once again, the craftsmen

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:43.580
and craftswomen, who in reshaping
matters and forms, need not to look

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.890
at preexisting models and need
not to use them as paradigms."

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.510
One of the deepest problematics
we know of so many archives,

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:51.930
or archival collections,
digital collections,

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:55.420
is that they're modeled, right,
on different kinds of repositories

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:58.310
that assume you're working
materially with the papers at hand.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:00.170
The digital is in fact different.

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.820 position:56%
I know many people are talking about
this, but when we're thinking again

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.220 position:56%
about what interface can do, we need
to be parlaying the digital rather

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.450 position:56%
than imagining we're reproducing
some lost art form, some lost world.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:14.870
So, my idea of physical space in
its own ways was also oppressive.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:18.450
So, at Five College Digital
Humanities, we try to really work

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.660
on ways of integrating
these sort of theoretical

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.450
and conceptual understandings,
alongside sort

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.750
of very material practice again.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.690
It's like again, the sort
of shadow background.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:28.080
I'm talking about real projects.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.380
I'm talking about [inaudible].

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:30.680
I'm talking about D3.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.980
I'm talking about all these things.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.750
Right? I'm just trying to give you
a different visuality [phonetic]

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.050
for thinking it through.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.730
A different kind of visualization.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.470
One example of this work is a
Zine Scenes project [inaudible]

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:41.270
"Beyond the Riot."

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.610
That's been a really
interesting project.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.080
Now, to say a little bit
more about it quickly.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.500
It works with what are essentially
very localized zine collections.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.840
So, small magazines made
in very small communities,

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.140
even just between friends.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.340
And as you can imagine, this
holds a wealth of information

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.090
about women's lives, right,
in the last 30 to 50 years.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:06.280
It holds enormous information,
right, about all the ways girls

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.210
for instance interact
with pop culture and ideas

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:09.510
about growing up and so on.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.410
It's a corpus that's
impressive, but at the same time,

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:14.660
you're explicitly dealing
with materials that were made

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.250
on some level, to walk
a very fine line

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:19.860
between the private and the public.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.140
Right? They're made to be
shared, but they're private.

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.700
That's a difficult
line to think about

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.480
and I think Twitter social media,
that gets in a similar place.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.900
It's public but also
kind of private.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.920 position:56%
You wouldn't actually just jump into
someone else's Twitter conversation,

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.340
if you don't know the people.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.580
And sort of thinking about
what that means, right?

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.650
So, they changed the project
-- not changed the project,

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.020
but sort of [inaudible]
the project in,

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.600
into thinking about not just
a repository, but a quote,

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.460
"interactive digital
subcultural platform."

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.180
Right? The PIs, Alana [inaudible]
and Michelle [inaudible]

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.290 position:56%
from Hampshire College, and Leslie
Fields from Mt. [inaudible] College,

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.580
along with their [inaudible] DH
undergraduate fellow Norm Miller,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.480
realized that not only does a
collection enable a vast number

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.820
of computational, mapping, and
visualization possibilities,

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.230
but that clicking -- but that
sorry, eliciting the narrative

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.000
and experiential meaningfulness
of these incredibly localized

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.380
and specific texts, also make
creating some form of encounter,

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.560
interface, that could
enable the user

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.140
to understand how the experience
of finding a zine is as important

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.960
as what the zine itself holds.

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.330
That the experience of
navigating the archive is

00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:29.080
as much an educational experience

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:34.110
as finding the actual object,
which the archive holds.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:37.120
Much of the zine's value then,
reproduces what we've been reading

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.580
about and thinking about in terms
of sort of indigeneity in archives,

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.930
in reproducing a [inaudible]
moment of discovery, right?

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.710
A moment when you realize,
"This is it.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.970
I did not know this was it.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:49.890
How did I live without this?

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.370
What is this?"

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.570
Much like musical improvisation,

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.370
this sense of discovery
requires the production

00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.150
of an incredibly, deeply
tagged archive.

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:02.610
So, this thing I'm calling
[inaudible] and spontaneous,

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:08.100
in fact requires an eminently,
deeply tagged, meta data,

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.260
machine readable, structure,
because if we imagine

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.770
that interfaces can function in the
kind of flexible ways that we would

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:17.590
like them to, the ways
I would like them to,

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.120
I'm getting away from
the [inaudible].

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.420
It's a sad day.

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:25.310
But, in ways we want them to
work, right, then there's a way

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:27.640
in which we have to go
in the opposite direction

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.050
of what one imagines this
conversation might go, right?

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.570
We turn back to the
machine readable.

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:34.530
We turn back to the
compartmentalize.

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:39.100 position:56%
We turn back to the smallest bits
of data, because it requires, sorry,

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.270
it produces the flexibility
that makes possible more kinds

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.230
of interfaces, more
kinds of exchanges.

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.870
It's a quandary.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:50.970
We have to break it even
more than we realized.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:55.380
This means moving away from
retrieval as the archive's purpose.

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.320
And instead, focusing
on enabling users

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.280 position:56%
to personalize their encounters, to
bring what they made to the archive,

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.590
and by virtue of their
own specificity,

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:06.000
use it to make their own things.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.570
I'm happy to say more about this,

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.760
particularly as the Zine
Scene's project must also grapple

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:14.140
with the kinds of resistance that
Teju Cole wants us to think about.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.530 position:56%
When to exclude, and when to delete?

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.060
Many items in the collection
were likely produced by people

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.070
who never intended for them
to be disseminated at the kind

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.350
of scale digitization
makes possible.

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:27.380
