Sometimes you implement a monetization
strategy that looks great on paper, and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.140
after you give it a chance,
you realize it's not making any money.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.940
&gt;&gt; There could be a lot of reasons.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.885
In these cases, you want to
see what your users are doing

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.995
while they're interacting
with your sites or app.

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:21.615
&gt;&gt; In the examples that follow, we'll
use google analytics, and you can take

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.985
the principles from our examples and
use it in other tools if you want.

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:30.495
&gt;&gt; We'll be investigating in four
areas: user behavior, crashes and

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.595
exceptions, out performance,
and special events.
