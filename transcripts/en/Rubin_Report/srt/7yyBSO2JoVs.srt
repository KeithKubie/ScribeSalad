1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,250
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,150
So for you, for ion,
it's not just academic.

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:10,740
Where do you think the
bravery comes in for you? I,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,880
cause I can tell there's nothing that
I could possibly ask you here that you

5
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,670
wouldn't give me the clearest,
honest answer.

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,600
And that isn't always how it is with
everybody, obviously as an interviewer.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,700
But where do you think that comes from?

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,440
Candor as well as being one of
my greatest weaknesses. I think

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,490
I was probably brought up in a rather
combative family in a rather competence

10
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:39,210
part of the world. I grew up in, in
Glasgow, in the west of Scotland and

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,080
to a physician and a,
and a physics.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,060
That's right. My mother was a physics
teacher. My father was a doctor. Yeah. Uh,

13
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,790
and they were the first in their
families to go to university.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,160
My grandfathers had served
in the world wars. Uh,

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,080
Scots have a self image of
themselves as being a courageous.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,680
The Scottish regiments were famous.
I wrote about this in my,

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,990
one of my earliest books. The busy of
war were famously the sharp end of,

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,160
of the British military.
Uh,

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,450
we marched towards the sound of gunfire.

20
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,610
Bagpipes playing.
That's the self image that uh,

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,300
a small Scottish boy growing up in the
1960s and seventies was encouraged to

22
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:24,134
have.

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,470
I remember vividly the
day that nine 11 happened.

24
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:32,630
I was sitting in Oxford
where I was then teaching,

25
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:37,280
but planning I'd planned and was
intending to fly to New York, uh,

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,400
very shortly to give a lecture on
nine 12 at New York University.

27
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,190
Uh,

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:48,190
indeed I was booked into a hotel very
close to the World Trade Center and my

29
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:53,711
response when I saw the attacks
was somewhat a bloody minded.

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,180
My response was very shortly afterwards
to resign my post docs for them go to

31
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:05,030
New York University and I
taught there for two years in a,

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,480
I suppose a mood of defiance that the
attempt to terrorize would not terrorize

33
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:17,111
me when I met a on a nine
more than nine years ago now,

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,140
it never crossed my mind
as I fell in love with her,

35
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:25,670
which happened very fast,

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,380
that this implied some meaningful,

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,200
a threat to my person.

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,290
Even when the FBI came to tell me that
there had been a threat against me,

39
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:42,500
something that I'd seen them due to
a on them more than one occasion.

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I never gave it a second thought because
obviously my calling different from my

41
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,290
grandfathers who were called
to fight in real wars.

42
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,190
My more much more manageable
callings is to protect her.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,260
She's one of the great heroines of our
time and extraordinary courageous woman

44
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,090
who's been through a hell of a lot and
who has never shirked from seeing what

45
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,040
she believes is wrong with modern Islam.

46
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,440
So it,

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,940
it is second nature to me to
be there with her in that,

48
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,050
in that fight, in that war, that's
what it turns out to be. My warm,

49
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,150
I always used to wonder
as I was growing up,

50
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:35,290
why is it that my generation isn't really
been called on to fight wars the way

51
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,160
my grandfather's generations were
called on and then it turned up.

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,300
Then my water turned up.

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,450
You briefly mentioned this earlier when
you're talking about ion and Brandeis,

54
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:50,451
but can you explain this intersection
of Islamism and the left,

55
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,830
how, why this has occurred?
This confuses a lot of people,

56
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,380
this idea of the oppression
Olympics and you know,

57
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,720
I've got plenty of theories on
this that we've knocked out, but,

58
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,620
but what do you think it is that has
attracted something that is completely

59
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:09,330
totalitarian and control with another
thing that's so completely total? I mean,

60
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,590
I guess that's the answer right there.

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,690
Well, there are many unholy
alliances in, in history and uh,

62
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,010
no don't. Many people will gravely, uh,

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,760
surprised when the Ribbentrop Molotov pat
was announced and the Soviet Union and

64
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,610
Nazi Germany formed an alliance.

65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,180
So we shouldn't be entirely surprised
when seemingly odd bedfellows jump into

66
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,234
bed.

67
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,780
In the case of the Islamists and the left,

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I think it's pretty clear to
me that the Islamists are the,

69
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,140
the leading partner and the leftists are
broadly the useful idiots because the

70
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,910
Islamists have a strategy.

71
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,940
It's there in Muslim Brotherhood and other
documents for expanding their network

72
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,290
in the west.

73
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,830
And part of the strategy is the kind of
a partnership that they have formed on

74
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:20,560
campuses against, uh, against her foes.

75
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,670
One way in which this works is
that you use the issue of Israel,

76
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,120
uh,
to forge the packs with the left.

77
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,950
So you get the left's longstanding
animosity towards Zionism,

78
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,720
uh, and you essentially say, well, we
entirely agree with you about that. Let's,

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,640
let's have an event about
how wicked Israel is. Uh,

80
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,490
and so that's the gateway
drug into accepting.

81
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,120
The next thing is, well, headscarves
are actually empowering for women,

82
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,550
don't you think?
Uh,

83
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,760
and isn't it actually Islamophobia
to be in any way of Sharia law.

84
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,410
So you play the multiculturalists
cultural relativist card, uh,

85
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,120
and you again depict any critics
of radical Islam as it, as in fact,

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,250
uh, engaged in some kind
of orientalist project, uh,

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,220
or essential list project to other people.

88
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,520
Always talk about othering
and academia, uh, Muslims.

89
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,690
And you blur the
distinction between Islam,

90
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,210
Islamism and Muslims as people.

91
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,450
So this has been going on for awhile
and the left has broadly fallen for it.

92
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,030
And it, to me, it's just astonishing.

93
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,190
I remember looking at the
list of academics who had,

94
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,310
who had argued that I aren't,

95
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:44,240
should not receive an honorary degree at
Brandeis and it included professors of

96
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,190
Queer Studies, uh, female professors
of gender studies. It's incredible.

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,320
You kind of feel like
saying to these people,

98
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,440
have you taken a look at what the Muslim
Brotherhood envisages have you read

99
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,690
Khatibs works?

100
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Do you realize that the project is the
permanent demotion of women to second

101
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,980
class status and potentially a
capital punishment for gays? Is,

102
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,350
is that something you are aware of?

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,830
And I can only conclude that
they aren't aware of it and,

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,720
and have been very thoroughly duped
as useful. Idiots usually are.

105
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,890
So it was that basically, because
both of these movements want power.

106
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,440
So the useful idiot part of this is that
Islam is a really just using the left

107
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:33,080
who attain power and they're doing it
all in the name of diversity and all of

108
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,960
these things. And eventually
once that power is attained,

109
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,060
then for lack of a better expression,
I mean,

110
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:41,750
you basically decapitate them and
then you've got, they did it for you.

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,520
They did the work for you. Yes. I mean,

112
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:47,390
I always used to joke with ion that,
uh,

113
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,800
when we lived in Cambridge,

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,801
it would be fun if all my enemies and all
her enemies came and protested outside

115
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,780
our house together because
after about 20 minutes a day,

116
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,630
they'd fall on one another and they
would be the most tremendous fight.

117
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,110
I do think that power is part of it,

118
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,230
but if one looks back at the
history of another intolerance,

119
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,660
totalitarian ideology of Marxism,

120
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,150
there's a combination of power
and are a kind of idealism,

121
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:25,420
one must call it that, uh,
in the square in the Torah.

122
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,990
I tell the story of how the Soviet
successfully penetrated the British

123
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:34,991
establishment by recruiting spies and
Cambridge and the people they recruited

124
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,620
had leanings to the left
that were inspired partly by
revulsion at those aspects

125
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:42,970
of,

126
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,970
of British imperialism or British
class society that work in many ways a

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,070
legitimately open to criticism.

128
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,330
There was an idealism there
at the beginning of guide
Burgess's involvement in

129
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:01,410
Marxism, sympathy with workers during
the time of the Great Depression,

130
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,900
but those were the useful idiots that the
Soviet cynically recruited to be spies

131
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,000
who, whom they persuaded to betray their
countrymen in what was the single most

132
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,860
successful act of,

133
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,950
of Russian espionage of them
all recruiting these highly
educated people from an

134
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,900
incredibly exclusive network,

135
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:26,280
the Cambridge Apostles and the related
network that led to Bloomsbury.

136
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,080
This was a brilliant strategy.

137
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,060
Something similar is going on here
because I think there are great many naive

138
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,810
young people who are drawn to
the rhetoric of social justice.

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,930
I encounter them often,
people who say, oh,

140
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,180
there should be limits on free speech
because I don't want such and such, uh,

141
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,830
such and such as feelings to be hurt. And
then naive. They have a very naive view.

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,100
Somehow that can be a circumscribed
form of free speech and know in which

143
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:56,910
nobody's feelings get hurt.
That's not the pursuit of power.

144
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,070
That's just naive city.

145
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,720
And the people who know how to exploit
that naive city are both people amongst

146
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:07,380
the Islamists and people amongst
the leftists who are pursuing power.

147
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,730
But you can never really get to power
without the useful idiots without the

148
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:16,080
naive idealists who think that they're
going to build utopia with your hell.

149
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,850
Yeah. And I don't have to
tell you, they're usually ends
up in dystopia. Right. So,

150
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,280
and that's, that's something that
is hard to persuade people of your,

151
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,890
I keep reflecting on
the curious revival of,

152
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,200
of Margaret Atwood's the Handmaid's tale,

153
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:36,201
which is always taken to be a vision
of what happens when right wing people,

154
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,480
uh, take over America. And to me,

155
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:43,700
the amazing thing that is almost
never observed is that, uh,

156
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,220
something very like this has happened.

157
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
It happened in Iran after 1979 and it
happened after the Taliban came to power

158
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:53,940
enough Ghana's Stan.

159
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,190
So we don't need to fantasize about
crazy evangelical fascists turning women

160
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,870
into baby machines. This has already
happened, but it was done by Islamists.

161
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,840
It was done by people pursuing
an extreme version of,

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,370
of Sharia. And yet almost
nobody who enthuses about, uh,

163
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,160
Margaret Atwood's book realizes that
it is actually really quite powerful

164
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:22,161
realization of what a theocratic
Islam as regime does to women.

165
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,580
All right. So I want to shift gears
a little bit here and we can either,

166
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm going to let you choose.

167
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,910
We can either go the historical root
or we can go the present route. Where,

168
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,630
where are you feeling first?
I do want to do both.

169
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,970
I think the key to applied history,

170
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:40,050
which is what I've spent my whole life
doing is that you do both and you can't

171
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,430
do one without the other because no,

172
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,640
you can have no real insight about
the present without the past.

173
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,350
So why don't we talk about the president
and our try to show why to understand

174
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,140
that you need history. All
right, very good. So, uh,

175
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,980
there are a couple of
things that are interesting

176
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,910
that you've, you've staked out positions
out over the past couple of years. Uh,

177
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,970
we briefly, right before we sat down,
we talked about Brexit for a second.

178
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,180
So you originally were for,
were against Brexit. Yeah.

179
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,030
Then you came around for it. Now it seems
to be in this odd limbo that I think,

180
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:13,070
unfortunately, most people in
America don't even understand what's,

181
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,500
what's going on. I don't think most people
in Britain on this plan. I'm sure. Um,

182
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,170
so when I was reading your position
on this, I at first I thought,

183
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:20,911
well wait a minute.
As a,

184
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,430
as a conservative and as someone that
wants some autonomy over his country,

185
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,690
I was somewhat surprised actually
that you weren't for it originally.

186
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:31,870
So can you explain your original position
and then how you changed on that?

187
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,450
The two reasons, um, while
I was on the side of remain,

188
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,630
remain in the EU, uh, back in 2016,

189
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,230
one was pure personal loyalty to friends.
Uh,

190
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,930
David Cameron was prime minister.

191
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,920
George Osborne was chancellor of the
Exchequer and they are friends of mine.

192
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,783
And I,

193
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,950
I felt obliged as a friend to
support them when they decided,

194
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,660
uh, to stick with the EU
and not to recommend Brexit.

195
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,200
Did,

196
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,690
did that friendship supersede what your
feelings were or was that because you

197
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:05,380
really trust

198
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,470
well, that was, they could
get it done. The swung. Okay.

199
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,100
And I think the reason
that I was willing to, to,

200
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,170
to get on board with Romaine was that I
found that arguments of the Brexiteers

201
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,550
deeply unconvincing.
Uh,

202
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,930
I remember one night sitting down and
reading a lot of stuff by Daniel Hannon,

203
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,860
one of the deeding advocates
of, uh, of leaving.

204
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,950
And I remember thinking that
this was just intellectually,

205
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:34,951
completely third class and unconvincing
the s the notion that Britain would be

206
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:39,490
better off economically
outside the European Union,

207
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,930
wouldn't have passed muster
as, uh, an undergraduate paper,

208
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,280
nevermind a graduate of paper.

209
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,700
So I felt that the Brexiteers case
failed intellectually because they were

210
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,690
claiming implausibly I thought
that you could have a free lunch,

211
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:58,180
that you could leave the
European Union and be better off.

212
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,780
And that just seemed to me to be
intellectually completely deceitful.

213
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,970
I think it would have been harder
for me if they had said, honestly,

214
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,120
this is going to cost quite a bit,

215
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,020
but it's worth it because if we leave,

216
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,540
then we shall have the ability
to control our borders.

217
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,620
Uh,

218
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,620
and we shall have a autonomy at a time
when Europe is pursuing a federalist

219
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,870
course. But that wasn't the argument.
The argument was that at the area,

220
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,370
cause [inaudible] here are going to
get the money. This was the argument.

221
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,061
We get together,

222
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,820
money that we give to the European Union
and we'll get to build spend on the

223
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,330
national health service cause we will be
in fact better off. And that was a lie.

224
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,800
And I'm not good with lies. It was
a clever lie. It works politically.

225
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,190
And I give credit to Dominic Cummings
for crafting a message that was a PD both

226
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:56,420
to conservatives until the voters,
the Conservatives got immigration control,

227
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,300
Labor voters got the national
health service, gets the money.

228
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,500
So this was brilliant politically, but it
was mendacious I think heart. And so I,

229
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,870
I oppose the, uh, Brexit when it happened.

230
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,760
Uh,

231
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,760
what struck me in the subsequent
months was that while I had been,

232
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,230
while I had been on the side that lost,

233
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,990
there was a good reason why we lost.

234
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,420
And the good reason was that
we went around saying how
much it was going to cost.

235
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,910
And I think we were right about that.
I think ultimately,

236
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,710
at least some of what the Treasury said,
we'll try,

237
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,470
we'll turn out to be true about the cost.

238
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,370
But that wasn't what people cared about.
And when you went into pubs, as I did in,

239
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,490
in in Wales, in England, and in Scotland,

240
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,570
there was a question to which you could
not give an honest answer without losing

241
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,624
the debate.

242
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,160
And I'll tell you what that question was
because I was asked it multiple times.

243
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,870
You'd make the case about the cost.
Nobody was interested in the cost.

244
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,190
They would say, listen, Neil,

245
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,910
about the 1.3 million Muslims,

246
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:09,080
the Germans have just let in to Germany,
because that had just happened.

247
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,220
If the Germans give them German passports,
can they come here?

248
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,550
And the only honest answer
to that question was yes.

249
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,590
Yeah.

250
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,300
So immigration was the issue.

251
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,900
And I think for a significant number
of people are in England and Wales

252
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,330
especially, was less so in
Scotland where Brexit was defeated.

253
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,830
The realization was that Britain
had lost control of immigration,

254
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,030
that people had been promised net
migration in the tens of thousands in the

255
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,350
1990s under the Blair government.

256
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,860
And they'd ended up with net migration
in the hundreds of thousands.

257
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,410
They saw the chaos in Germany.

258
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,250
They saw the waves of migration
coming on and from Syria,

259
00:16:56,251 --> 00:17:00,480
but from all over North Africa and uh,
and even South Asia. And they said,

260
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:05,250
and I remember David Cameron using this
phrase, get me out of here. And that was,

261
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,820
that was the driving
motivation for the Brexit vote.

262
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,050
And I think it was legitimate because
I think that Angela Merkel had made a

263
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:15,510
catastrophic mistake in
throwing open the gates.

264
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,840
I think it will have dark
consequences for the future of,

265
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,010
of Germany and of Europe. And I do
not blame British voters for saying,

266
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,290
forget about the cost of Brexit.
We really need to get out of this.

267
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,210
So I take, took the view by the
end of 2016 that you had to,

268
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,380
you had to respect the fact that ordinary
people had cut through the crap of the

269
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:40,800
debate and had got to the
heart of the matter are.

270
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,180
And the heart of the matter wasn't the
cost of Brexit. Uh, which is what I had,

271
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,390
I think mistakenly focused
on prior to the reference.

272
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,270
What was it like you as a
public person and you know,

273
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:54,090
someone that writes about this stuff
and puts your opinions out there to,

274
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,630
to have that realization. I think it's
very important if you write regularly,

275
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:02,220
if you are what we call a
public intellectual, uh,

276
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,590
to be willing to admit
that you've been wrong.

277
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,080
I think you have to be prepared
to say I was wrong. And I,

278
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,120
I think I was wrong in the sense
that what I wish I had done

279
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,740
looking back was,

280
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:24,741
I wish I had said to David Cameron and
George Osborne in the spring of 2016 when

281
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:30,180
it was clear that the Europeans were
going to make no meaningful concession on

282
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,181
the immigration issue when they basically
sent an insulting proposal about what

283
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,320
could be done about migration.

284
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,920
That was the moment I should have said
to Cameron and Osborne, forget it. Yeah,

285
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,810
you should campaign for Brexit if
that's all they're going to offer you.

286
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,870
If they're so completely oblivious to
the very real concerns about immigration,

287
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,470
then you should campaign for Brexit
instead of which we stuck with it.

288
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,050
And that was,
that was David Cameron's great mistake.

289
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,050
He should have said at that moment,
if that's all you've got,

290
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,680
I'm going to recommend Brexit
to the voters and it would
have saved him too. So,

291
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,850
so you'd think it was just
a bad negotiating ploy that
he just didn't use some

292
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,610
leverage to say we're going to have
to walk away from this. There was,

293
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:14,790
there was a moment when he should have
walked away and I should have advised

294
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,500
them to walk away.
So yeah,

295
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:21,390
I think one has to recognize when one's
made a mistake with such consequences.

296
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,891
The second thing,

297
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:27,891
which is worth knowing about this is
that the people who then inherited power

298
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,100
after the fall of Cameron and Osborne,

299
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,720
we're not the people who had
campaigned for and one on Brexit.

300
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:40,560
It was people who'd been on the remain
side. Theresa May became prime minister.

301
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,960
Uh,
I always knew that would be a disaster.

302
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,320
I did not have high regard for
her prior to the referendum.

303
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,880
The Daily Mail essentially put her in
that position and also Boris Johnson,

304
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:54,990
Michael Gove and others because they
bungled, uh, the leadership contest.

305
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,870
So we then ended up with
a terrible combination,

306
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,270
which was a commitment to Brexit,

307
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,370
but it's execution in the hands
of people who had been remainers.

308
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,820
And I think the result is the worst
of both worlds because right now we

309
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:14,100
essentially have the
psychological reality of Brexit.

310
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,970
I think British public to a large
extent has accepted that we are leaving,

311
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,300
but the execution is a total mess
by invoking article 50 early on,

312
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,950
the UK in essentially seeded the,

313
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,310
the power and the divorce to the European
Union and the concessions have come

314
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,650
one after another.
Ever since then.

315
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,240
And we now find ourselves in the odd
predicament that I think Theresa May is

316
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:47,241
saying that Brexit means you cease to be
a voting member of the European Union,

317
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,760
but you remain within the customs union,

318
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,220
potentially even within the single
market and you accept all the rules and

319
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:56,830
regulations of the European Union.
You just don't have any power.

320
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,610
If that's the end game,
then it's a disaster.

321
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,870
So the people that are trying to stop
this now, they want to invoke some,

322
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,760
some pretty crazy extreme stuff, right?
I mean there would be some really,

323
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,950
very rarely if ever used rules,

324
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:16,030
am I right about this that would actually
allow this to allow the stay to occur?

325
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,390
Well Anderson, I think those games
without getting into all of them,

326
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,320
I knew everything.

327
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,890
There is a level of complexity in
the discussions now in London that is

328
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:28,891
bewildering to most ordinary British
people when people start talking about Max

329
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,320
Fac and the customs
union or the complexity.

330
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,130
That's why it's such a confusing way.

331
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:35,680
Cause I discussed it with Douglas Murray
and he was even a little confused.

332
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:39,880
So it's actually not confusing in the
sense that what is happening is that

333
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,881
Theresa May is trying to get Britain to
accept the realities of belonging to the

334
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,860
European Customs Union,
which would preclude Britain
having its own trade policy,

335
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,140
uh, with our leaving the European
Union's decision making body.

336
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,000
So essentially in that
version, Brexit is just, uh,

337
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,500
you have the responsibilities, you
just don't have any power anymore. Uh,

338
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:07,650
which is definitely not what the British
public was told that it was getting in,

339
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,810
in Brexit. Uh, the,

340
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,830
the bigger problem in my mind is,
is not one that,

341
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,190
that we've discussed.

342
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,440
And that is that all of this will end
in tears to the point at which Jeremy

343
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,441
Corbyn,

344
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,980
the most left wing leader of the Labour
party has ever had in its history,

345
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,981
becomes prime minister because to Reesa
Mae is leading the country towards this

346
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:35,140
very unhappy compromise. At some point,
the people who truly believe in Brexit,

347
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,850
Jacob Riis smog, uh, for example,
uh, perhaps Michael Gove,

348
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,073
uh,

349
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,280
they may decide we can't ultimately
accept this and the government may fall.

350
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,590
But the problem is that
if the government falls,

351
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,750
then Jeremy Corbyn has prime minister.

352
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,400
If the government doesn't fall and we go
all the way to the finishing line with

353
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,310
this Theresa May version of Brexit,

354
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,830
then I think the Conservatives will
lose the next election in 2022,

355
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,210
and Jeremy Corbyn will be prime minister.

356
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,710
So the worst there about
Brexit is in my view,

357
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,530
that if it is bungled in this way,

358
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,630
it will open the door to a
truly leftist government.

359
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,040
And that will be far more economically
damaging than anything Brexit has done.

360
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,960
And that's the nightmare scenario for
me and probably socially damaging and

361
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:25,150
finger zillion other reasons deeply.
We are,

362
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:28,840
we should be extremely suspicious
of Corban and his people.

363
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,540
They are committed Marxists.

364
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,410
They've been on the wrong side of every
issue in my lifetime with a possible

365
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:37,210
exception of South African apartheid.

366
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,720
And I do not trust them with the keys to
10 Downing Street because I think that

367
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,300
their ultimate agenda is a
truly revolutionary one. Uh,

368
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,880
and it poses a threat to
the fundamental liberties,

369
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,080
the traditions of the constitution.
It's a dangerous, dangerous prospect.

370
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,840
And I'm much more worried
about Corban that about Brexit.

371
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:57,591
I mean,

372
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,950
this is how I feel about what's happening
with our left in America through that.

373
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:05,120
You guys are giving us basically
the precursor to this. I think

374
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,740
one of the lessons of history and now
we can bring history in is that with

375
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,990
populism, you, you get two flavors.

376
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,110
In a typical backlash that would
come after a financial crisis,

377
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,370
uh,
the political establishment discredited.

378
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,650
There's a backlash against,
uh, inequality, uh,

379
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,240
all of the things that typically
follow a financial crisis,

380
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,840
but there are two possibilities.
There's the populism of the left,

381
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:34,900
which is the tax,
the rich solution,

382
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
but the populism of the writers more
potent because it says that it's about

383
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,270
immigration, it's about
globalization, it's about free trade.

384
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,270
And so broadly speaking,

385
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:49,720
there's a very good study that shows
this after big financial crises,

386
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,200
the populace of the right do better
because they offer a more plausible story.

387
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,780
But if they don't deliver and they
generally don't cause quite hard to make

388
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,640
immigration control and terrorists
pay quite hard actually to make your

389
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:05,680
constituents better off
with those policies,

390
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,100
then the pendulum has a tendency to
swing to the populism of the left.

391
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,780
And that has happened in Britain really
quick because Corbyn became popular very

392
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:17,320
soon after Brexit.
It's slower here,

393
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,710
but the fear must be that if the Trump
experiment goes as wrong as the vast

394
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,490
majority of of intellectuals expect it to,

395
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,450
the pendulum will swing to the
left of the Democratic Party.

396
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,540
And that scenario seems to me
more and more plausible are,

397
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,970
and I don't think that's a,
that's a not an appetizing. Yeah,

398
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean that, that, that's
genuinely scary to me.

399
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:46,180
But I want to back up for one second
because the moment that you had that,

400
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:49,510
you said a few times happened in these
pubs when you would go there and people

401
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:53,290
would say this about 1.3
million Muslims in Germany,

402
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,340
how do you, so okay, so if you were
listening to the mainstream media,

403
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:00,010
they would say these people are all
racist. That's what they would tell you.

404
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,840
They're,
they're racists and they're bigots.

405
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,630
I suspect that's not what
you think of these people.

406
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,500
Although there probably was a certain
amount of people that are just racist and

407
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:11,560
don't like people of a different
color or a different culture.

408
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,620
How do you even have that conversation?

409
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:16,850
Because that's what's so much
of this is about, cause you,

410
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,170
I'm sure it would have a pint with these
people and you talk to them and realize

411
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:24,550
that they weren't racist. They were
actually just worried about their future,

412
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,660
which is legit.

413
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,960
But if you can't have that discussion
because every time you open your mouth

414
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,370
they tell you you're racist. Well then
we know what you end up with. Look,

415
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:36,400
I would be a very strange,

416
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,460
if I took a bigger view on the
subject because I'm an immigrant,

417
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm an factor about to become

418
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,080
an American citizen. Uh,
in a matter of weeks.

419
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,490
My wife was a refugee who go from,
um,

420
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,290
uh,

421
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,640
Somali originally to the
Netherlands by applying for asylum.

422
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,203
Uh,

423
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,980
and so we would be the last couple to
take a kind of a bigoted view on the

424
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:10,020
immigration issue
because we are the grids.

425
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,870
When I had conversations on this subject
at the time of the Brexit referendum,

426
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,900
I remember realizing that the opposition
to immigration was not plausibly a

427
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
racist because I remember somebody making
the point that he was as worried about

428
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,340
the people from Lithuania and Poland
coming to Britain as he was about people

429
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,980
from Syria and Iraq. And, uh,

430
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,310
and you probably know that people
from Poland Lithuania, a pretty white.

431
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,310
So here's the thing,

432
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:50,030
what we all need to recognize is
that if immigration shoots up,

433
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,600
if it grows from,
in the case of Britain,

434
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,760
10,000 or 20,000 a year to
200,000 to 300,000 a year,

435
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,910
perfectly unprejudiced people will say,
that's too much.

436
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,070
This is going too fast.

437
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,640
And that I think was
the dominant argument.

438
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:16,710
Of course there are people who
are racists in any society,

439
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,430
but the striking thing about Britain is
actually that it's not a terribly racist

440
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:21,264
place.

441
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Did you see many people protesting against
Prince Harry's decision to marry an

442
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:32,160
American of mixed mixed race? I was there
a couple of days before the Bolivarian.

443
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,700
There were huge crowds.
Uh,

444
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,520
this matches extraordinary
popular with ordinary people.

445
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,540
So I think it's hard to argue that
racism played any meaningful part are the

446
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:51,540
white supremacist elements in Britain
is really, is really very insignificant.

447
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,680
And actually one of the ways in which
the British like to define themselves is

448
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:58,200
as being tolerant,
uh,

449
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,290
memories of the war of not entirely faded,

450
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:06,000
even as the wartime generation
gradually disappears from the scene.

451
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,980
What was the war against Germany?

452
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:10,830
About it was a war against
the ultimate racist state.

453
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,300
What hurt Jeremy Corban the most
in the last three or four months?

454
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,630
The evidence that there are antisemitic
elements within his faction of the Labor

455
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:22,860
left that hurt him.

456
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,100
And it's important that that argument
keep being made because it has real truth

457
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:33,600
to it. And I think ordinary
people think that's not good.

458
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,860
So I, I think this is not really
about racism. It's not about bigotry.

459
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,220
It's about how rapidly
should immigration occur,

460
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,380
how large should flows be across borders.

461
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,340
And the lesson of history is that if
you allow a real surge in immigration,

462
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,580
there will be a populist backlash against
is what happened in the United States

463
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,630
in the late 19th century.

464
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,280
The peak in the 1880s the foreign born
percentage of the population in the US

465
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,210
was about 14% and gone up
from relatively low level,

466
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,720
it's about 14% same thing
has happened in our time.

467
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,770
It was down I think below
7% in the mid 20th century.

468
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,910
In the period after World
War II immigrants, we're a
relatively small proportion.

469
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,620
NATO foreign born citizens were pretty
small portion of the US population.

470
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,620
And then from the 1980s onwards,

471
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:25,621
the proportion surged and the
character of the immigrants changed,

472
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,450
uh, that the places that
they came from change.

473
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:31,120
And these changes are
bound to elicit a reaction.

474
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,180
It always happens and it's not enough
for people in the liberal elites who by

475
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:41,320
and large don't live in areas where
immigrants and come to say what a terrible

476
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:46,270
deplorable bunch of chauvinists you are
for not wanting for not wanting more

477
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:50,500
immigrants. That's simply, that's
simply historically stupid. Uh,

478
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,430
and the other thing that stupid about
this in the United States is, uh,

479
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,940
the people on the left who want
to legitimize illegal immigration.

480
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,970
I think for many people who
were attracted to Trump,

481
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,630
the issue was the illegal
quality of the immigration.

482
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,930
The rule of law is a big deal
in the English speaking world.

483
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,200
And people don't like to hear anything
that simply says amnesty for lawbreakers.

484
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,740
Well, if you're a law abiding citizen
and you're suddenly told, well,

485
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,890
yet the law applies to you,
but there are these other people,

486
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:23,860
it's not going to apply to you. Then
your natural reaction is, screw this.

487
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,940
That's why I thought one of his best
lines, he doesn't use it as much anymore.

488
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,620
But during the campaign where
either a country or we're not,

489
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,390
I thought was a really effective line.
You either have laws or you don't. I mean,

490
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:39,070
that in essence is the
truth. So let, let's shift to
Trump a little bit here. Um,

491
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,580
I think that we're kind of
in a similar spot with him,

492
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,980
which is that it's better
than the alternative.

493
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,560
That that's certainly
how I feel at this point,

494
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,270
that all of the forces that we've spent
the last hour plus talking about would

495
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:57,271
be that much more emboldened against
free thought and all and free expression

496
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,400
and open inquiry and all the things that
we care about and historical fact and,

497
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,540
and everything else.
If he was in president right now,

498
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,660
I am deeply ambivalent about all of this.
I think it's,

499
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,940
it's very, very hard, uh, to say,

500
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,550
uh,

501
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,550
a good word about the
personality of Donald Trump.

502
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm with you. I, it was a reason that I,

503
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,900
I found it impossible
to support him in 2016.

504
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,840
I think one has to
acknowledge that he has,

505
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,800
uh, used inflammatory language, uh,

506
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,670
on the issues we've talked
about immigration, uh,

507
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,800
that he has a record of, of, of lying,

508
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,320
which is,
uh,

509
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,040
even by the standards
of American presidents.

510
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,130
Pretty remarkable.
Uh,

511
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,580
and so the familiar list of things about
Donald Trump that most of my friends

512
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:09,020
find objectionable is Kinda
hard for me to, to dismiss.

513
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,970
But I said I'm ambivalent for a reason.
On the other hand,

514
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,760
number one,
what if he lost?

515
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,440
I said this to Sam Harris a few weeks ago.
Let's run the counter factual.

516
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,620
This is what historians should do.
Let's imagine an alternative history.

517
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,830
If Donald Trump had lost
the election by let's say,

518
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,160
the same narrow margin that he wanted it,

519
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,710
how would all those people who voted
for him have felt and how would they

520
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,810
behaved?
To my mind,

521
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:46,811
the election of Donald Trump
is a cathartic moment for
those people so despised

522
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:52,580
by the liberal elites that they
could refer to them as deplorables.

523
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:58,390
The people who voted for Donald Trump
are not by and large are racists,

524
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,610
are not by and large, uh, uh,

525
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,500
anything like Donald Trump is personally.

526
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,580
What attracted them to
Trump were two things,

527
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,410
which as with the Brexit campaign
will legitimate number one,

528
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,550
they were attracted to Trump's
policy positions on trade,

529
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,940
on immigration, on Islam, at and on, uh,

530
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,680
the somewhat corrupt liberal elite that
had been run in the country for the

531
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:35,180
previous eight years. So I think they were
attracted to Trump's policy positions,

532
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,060
but they were also attracted
to his cultural position.

533
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,300
And I think about half of
American populism is cultural.

534
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,840
What attracted the friends I have
who supported Trump to Trump was his

535
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,730
fundamental shift in language,

536
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,050
away from the politically correct
talking points of the political class,

537
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:58,550
Republicans and Democrats alike to
a demotic normal way of speaking,

538
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,700
such as you would here in
the typical American bar,

539
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,480
more or less anywhere in the country
except Cambridge, Massachusetts, Stanford,

540
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,600
California, and the rest. Now I,

541
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,060
I remember thinking on
the eve of the election,

542
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,410
if you line up all the people who are
going to vote for her and you line up all

543
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:18,170
the people who are going to vote for him,
which line would you rather be in?

544
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,720
Remember at that point, I'm not
a citizen. I don't have a vote,

545
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,650
and I thought that's easy.

546
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,520
I'm with the people who are so pissed
with the political establishment that

547
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,870
they're ready to take a chance on this
guy because they see no other way to

548
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,870
shake things up the way.
My friend Jerry Blake put it to me,

549
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,760
Ex Marine Corps Xn YPD
never went to college,

550
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,970
helps take care of my wife's security.

551
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,740
Jerry said to me early 2016 two
things that stuck in my mind for us.

552
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:53,640
He told me Trump was going to win,

553
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,440
but then he said the two reasons
why he supported Trump. Number One,

554
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,290
he tells it like it is.
Number two,

555
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,460
he's going to shake things up by,
he tells it like it is.

556
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:08,040
Jared did not mean he is always truthful.

557
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,170
What he meant was he talks like me
by shaking things up, Jerry men,

558
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,060
we have to do something because the system
as it stands is not in my interests.

559
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,010
It's not in my interests economically
because it seems to favor China over the

560
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:27,900
United States, Mexicans,
overt, native born Americans,

561
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,700
the rich 1% over me, the median
household. But he's also,

562
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:37,980
it's also about this cultural reaction
against the multiculturalism that has

563
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,560
become the orthodoxy of the liberal left.

564
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,250
So for all my reservations about Trump,

565
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,520
I completely got why people voted for him.

566
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,820
And I think their reaction had
he lost would have been toxic.

567
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,720
I don't think they would have
accepted the legitimacy of the result.

568
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,490
I think they would have bought the story.

569
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:01,470
Trump would have told them that
the election had been rigged,

570
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,370
and I think we would've had a poisoned
body politic from day one of a Clinton

571
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:09,390
presidency. If it all ends, oddly
though we're having that right now,

572
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:11,430
just in the reverse, right.
It would have been worse,

573
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,790
but we're having a left that's not
accepting the legitimacy of the election,

574
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,960
and I think it would have been worse.
Yeah, I think it would've been worse.

575
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,480
Uh,
and I think,

576
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:28,090
and this is another part of the story
that for Jerian his and his many,

577
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,430
many fellow Americans who voted Trump,

578
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,930
this has always been a gamble and they've
always had a sense that it could go

579
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,990
wrong. You know, when you shake
things up, sometimes they break.

580
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,730
And I s I sense that if
it all ends in fiasco,

581
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:48,570
which I guess that the vast majority
of public intellectuals expect,

582
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,270
and some combination of
Watergate and other scandals,

583
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,530
I think Jerry and his and his fellow
American Trump supporters will say, well,

584
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:59,550
we gave it a try. Give it
a try. And I think that's,

585
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,410
that's one possible scenario.

586
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:06,411
The other reason that I am ambivalent
about Trump is that for all his flaws,

587
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:09,640
in some ways he's doing a better job,
uh,

588
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:12,830
on foreign policy than
his predecessor did. Uh,

589
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,680
because Trump has this superpower that
most intellectuals can't understand,

590
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,330
he has an unerring instinct for the
weakness of the counterparty that it's a

591
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,280
kind of,
almost animal instinct.

592
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,550
But some are Donald Trump can
tell when the other side is weak.

593
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,360
You could see it in Jeb Bush,
she could see it in Marco Rubio,

594
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,780
could see it in Hillary Clinton. And
now I think he sees it in the Europeans.

595
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,420
He sees in Angola Merkel,
you don't pay enough for your defense.

596
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,820
What if I walk out on NATO?
Yeah,

597
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
well there's a season interview Kim
Jong than he sees it in Xi Jinping.

598
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,680
He sees it in the, uh, in
the supreme leader in Neuron.

599
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,780
So my ambivalence is partly by
sympathy for Trump supporters.

600
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,250
My fundamental sense of
why they voted for him.

601
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,440
But it's also that in some ways,

602
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:04,441
this disruption has its plus side in the
way that it's repositioning the United

603
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,500
States. I mean, I, to me,

604
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:09,760
it's given oxygen to everything that
we've talked about here. And that doesn't,

605
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:14,290
that doesn't discount all of the
legitimate concerns that you look.

606
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,690
The big concern for me,
as I mentioned before,

607
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:19,720
is that the pendulum swings the other way.
If this all ends in tears,

608
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,760
all of those who defended it,
even if they defended it half hearted,

609
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:29,740
they like me, will be discredited.
And the damage will be irreparable,

610
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,280
uh,
for conservatives and populists alike.

611
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:39,450
The left we empowered and they will spend
the rest of our lives telling us that

612
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:44,200
we were apologists for the
worst president. And that's,

613
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,230
that's not a scenario that you
can discount likely for a time.

614
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,460
I think it was exhilarating,
are freely admit that for me,

615
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,840
one of the most satisfying aspects of
Trump's victory was that all the people I

616
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,730
most dislike in this contract,

617
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,950
we're in a state of hysteria and shock
for weeks. And I remember things that are,

618
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,813
you know,

619
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,040
it can't be all bad if the people I
really can't stand or in this state,

620
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,640
but you have to,
I think with history in mind,

621
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:20,140
be conscious of the dangers of the fact
that this could end so badly that it

622
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,920
does irreparable damage.
And,

623
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,950
and the worst damage of all will be if
it propels the left of the Democratic

624
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,820
Party into power. And that, that
you can't rule out, you call.

625
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,300
The worst thing about studying history
is that it makes you aware of how under

626
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:38,860
terministic their historical processes,

627
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,480
that there is always more than one future.
There's the future of triumph.

628
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,690
There's the future of tragedy.

629
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,460
And there's this kind of
other future in the middle,

630
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:46,480
which is a little bit of both.

631
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,290
And that's really one of the historical
moment is bad for restful sleep on wakes

632
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:55,294
up in the morning.

633
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,930
And I'm sure you have the same feeling
wondering what alert will be on your

634
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:04,810
phone and what message
will be on your phone.

635
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,980
Will the alerts say war has broken out?

636
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,370
Will the alerts say are palace
coup and will the message say,

637
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,120
uh, you'll reputation has just been, uh,

638
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,320
been destroyed by some
accusation or other.

639
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,410
So one wakes up in a state of
anxiety in the United States of,

640
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,630
of 2018.
And that is a,

641
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:33,980
is a reality for that I think is inherent.
Both

642
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,610
the culture war that we've spoken
about and the Trump presidency,

643
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:41,450
which is in some measure a backlash
against that, that culture war.

644
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,750
We're going to leave it at that, but I
am going to demand that you come back.

645
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:50,190
I don't think I've ever demanded that.
I guess come back and ask,

646
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,120
but I'm legitimately
demanding that you come back.

647
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:54,980
Because next time I want to do,

648
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,960
I want to just do all history and we
can even break even out even barely jump

649
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:04,550
into, I want him to even some
prior stuff and Churchill and okay,

650
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,780
I'm demanding it. Will you accept
my demand? Except all right,

651
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,540
it took a long time to get here but,

652
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,670
but considering we're both two guys
just off planes today and you're like 87

653
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:19,490
hours out of whack and jet lag and all
those things we said we'll be taken out

654
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,530
of context on Twitter.

655
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,710
Well high gusts sincerely hope everything
because that's how you know the whole

656
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,040
thing goes.
This has truly,

657
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,670
truly been an absolute pleasure and thank
you for doing this and send my best of

658
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,970
course, Diane. Sure will.
And uh, for more on Neil,

659
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,620
you can follow him on the Twitter,

660
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,170
although you don't fight with people
that much on Twitter, which means,

661
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,090
which means you have
strong moral character.

662
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,930
I decided the jungle warfare
was not the way to go.

663
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,750
He's a wise man. And it's at n f e R G. U.

664
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:51,290
S.
