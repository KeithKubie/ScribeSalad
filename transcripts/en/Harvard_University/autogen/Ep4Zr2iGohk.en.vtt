in yield okay so you have a strong

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990
in yield okay so you have a strong
 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.660

have often done is to take the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680
have often done is to take the
 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.859

does this sort of analysis and say okay

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
does this sort of analysis and say okay
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.950
does this sort of analysis and say okay
well when we go into the future we have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
well when we go into the future we have
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990
well when we go into the future we have
a long-term warming how much loss of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
a long-term warming how much loss of
 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.820
a long-term warming how much loss of
yield are we going to have and that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830
yield are we going to have and that
 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.170

makes some sense but it doesn't account

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180
makes some sense but it doesn't account
 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.000
makes some sense but it doesn't account
for the fact that we can adapt through

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010
for the fact that we can adapt through
 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.830

time and so if we want a more resolved

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840
time and so if we want a more resolved
 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.410

view of how changes in temperature might

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
view of how changes in temperature might
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.510

influence food production we'd also want

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
influence food production we'd also want
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.719
influence food production we'd also want
some sort of measure of adaptation and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729
some sort of measure of adaptation and
 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.789
some sort of measure of adaptation and
here in this more resolved plot is one

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799
here in this more resolved plot is one
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.469

way of getting at that what I'm showing

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
way of getting at that what I'm showing
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.370

calling them killing degree days and you

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849
calling them killing degree days and you
 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.429
calling them killing degree days and you
can see there's a gradient going here

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439
can see there's a gradient going here
 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.349

where you have lower sensitivities

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750
where you have lower sensitivities
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.729
where you have lower sensitivities
now the contours are showing the

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739

we're growing in these various places
 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.270
we're growing in these various places
and how we're doing it and you can use

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280
and how we're doing it and you can use
 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.399
and how we're doing it and you can use
this as a proxy then for the amount of

four percent decline now I want to take
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.039
four percent decline now I want to take
these numbers seriously but I would take

these numbers seriously but I would take
 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.959
these numbers seriously but I would take
the fact that adaptation plays a big

role in the damages that you might
expect something that's quite robust and

expect something that's quite robust and
 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.449
expect something that's quite robust and
something that should be accounted for

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459
something that should be accounted for
 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.399
something that should be accounted for
in any type of assessment of what's

company's high temperatures and it so

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350
company's high temperatures and it so
 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.140
company's high temperatures and it so
happens that when we have heat waves in

when a heat wave occurs what we can see
 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.550
when a heat wave occurs what we can see
is that these pressure anomalies exist

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560
is that these pressure anomalies exist
 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.750
is that these pressure anomalies exist
across this entire strip here where we

pattern in the mid-latitude Pacific we
 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.649
pattern in the mid-latitude Pacific we
can have odds of a heat wave that are

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:01.659
can have odds of a heat wave that are
 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:03.899
can have odds of a heat wave that are
greater than twice climatology or if we

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909
greater than twice climatology or if we
 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.879
greater than twice climatology or if we
have the negative phase of this pattern

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889
have the negative phase of this pattern
 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.159
have the negative phase of this pattern
in the Pacific less than half of what is

maybe we can extend it even further such

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449
maybe we can extend it even further such
