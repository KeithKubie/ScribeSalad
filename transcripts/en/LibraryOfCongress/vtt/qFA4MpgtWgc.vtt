00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.740
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
Morning everybody, welcome,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.650
it's a great day in this city.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.290
First of all, this enormous
celebration of literature and just

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.230
across the Mall that
brand new museum opening

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.510
for African-American history.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.500
I live here so I'm warning you
don't try to go over there today.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.840
It will be so jammed and
impenetrable you'll never make it

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.900
but maybe tomorrow or the day after
that's what I'm going to try to do.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.230
We need to thank some people before
we start talking Sharon and I,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.360
first of all of course the Library
of Congress, David Rubenstein

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.580
of the Carlyle Foundation,
Carlyle Group.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.550
He's co-chairman of this festival
and of course all the volunteers,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.180
the people, organization who
have supported this festival

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.480
over the years.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.810
Some housekeeping we have to do.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.290
Cell phones, you know I forgot
to turn mine off [laughter]

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.690
but I'm waiting for
George Clooney to call

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.390
so you'll understand won't you
Sharon if we stop in the middle.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well [laughter].

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.620
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Well [laughter],
you know how long I've been waiting

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.350
for this and before that
it was Robert Redford.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.610
Anyway, cell phones off please,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.220
we'll have some questions
at the end.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.630
There are microphones around and
you'll need to step up to them

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.800
and when you do stand up
straight because they're going

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.580
to be filming us so
it's for eternity

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.480
or anyway the library's archives.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.100
You want to look good.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.400
I think we're done.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.700
There will be a book signing.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.100
Sharon will sign books
at 11:30 somewhere

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.160
in this vast spectrum
of chairs and tables.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.950
But let's get to the
main event already.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.160
That's Sharon Robinson
and the name of her book

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.460
"The Hero Two Doors Down".

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.610 position:56%
Sharon has written a number of books
for young readers and she's created,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.380
this is so interesting to me,
a baseball-themed curriculum

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.690
for young people for
really self-image right,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.990
a [multiple speakers]?

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.290
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: No,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.590
it's actually character
development and good morning.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.890
Thank you all for coming out.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.190
I really appreciate you being here.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.180
[ Applause ]

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.070
Yeah, Breaking Barriers: In Sports,
In Life, we're in our 20th year

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.730
and it's all about
character education

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.180
and helping kids understand
that they.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.370
He told me this was going to go.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.350
My scarf is very fluid and it
doesn't do well with a mic.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.330
Can you hear me?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.630
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: You're okay.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.950
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Okay, good.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.670
It teaches kids that obstacles
or barriers are a part of life

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.980
and we give them values I
associate with my dad's success on

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.480
and off the field, the strategies
and ultimately they write an essay

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.770
for a contest where they talk about
a barrier they've had to overcome

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.070
and how they used the values.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.430
And we get about 17,000 essays
from kids all over the country.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.730
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Wow.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.110
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: And
then I go out and visit them

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.640
and in their schools and
ultimately we bring the top winners

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.070
to the All-Star game
and to the World Series.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.280
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh my gosh, 22
million children, young children?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.580
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Actually yes, it's actually,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.880
we're up to 20 [inaudible].

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.180
Isn't it amazing?

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.480
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: It's amazing.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.780
That is quite an accomplishment,
congratulations.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.080
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
It's a great work.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.700
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah,
you need to bear with me

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.590
because I'm a New Yorker.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.620
I'm also old and I
stopped following baseball

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.820
when the Dodgers moved
to Los Angeles.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.220
I was so.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.600
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
She's not a true fan.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.900
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: I was true.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.260
I was. It broke my heart.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.170
That was the end of everything.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.720 position:56%
But this book gives me back so much.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.020
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Oh good [laughter].

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.110
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Of what the
Dodgers meant and what the city was

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.840
like when they had just
arrived and what their future

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.410
and the difficulties
especially for your father.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.020
Can you do just a really
quick synopsis of the plot,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.930
that little boy, that young man.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.970
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Yes, so "The
Hero Two Doors Down" is a story.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.840
It's Steve Satlow's story,
1948 Brooklyn, Flatbush area.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.020 position:56%
Steve is a big Brooklyn Dodger fan
and my parents moved two doors down.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.760
And so Steve has this, you
know, can't wait to meet Jackie,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.840
can't wait to meet Jackie, all
these missed opportunities,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.140
finally meets him.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.020
But what's interesting is it's
told through Steve's perspective

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.960 position:56%
and what I've loved from my story,
my letters that kids have written me

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.310
because Steve is not a perfect kid.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.600
He's like, well, gets
in trouble quite a bit

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.650
and so the kids kind of like that.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.730
And what became of Steve and
I said Steve became a surgeon

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.840
like he had planned on it but he
did push his 2nd grade teacher

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.110
over a hedge when she was
trying to visit his parents.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.520
It's a true story.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.290
So, Steve is alive and we're
good friends and you know,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.800 position:56%
he just couldn't help but share some

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.910
of his very interesting
childhood stories with me.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.420
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: It's
an extraordinary story

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.610
because he's a little Jewish
kid, Flatbush in those days

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.170
and maybe today still is, was
primarily a Jewish neighborhood

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.220
so it interested me why
your parents moved there.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.720
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Well, it was actually my,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.340
a black woman purchased the
home in the neighborhood.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.770
My parents just rented the,
one of the flats from her

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.570
so it was just coincidence,
it wasn't purposeful.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.240
And they, my parents had never
been around Jewish families either

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.660
or the Jewish culture or religion

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.640
and so there was some
mishaps particularly

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.940
around Christmas and Hanukkah.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.050
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: I think that's
a story that needs to be told.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.490
Will you tell it?

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.790
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh yes, okay.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.090
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
The Christmas tree.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.390
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well yes,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.690
well the first Christmas
Steve was over our house.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.300
Now Steve and Jackie had
become friends and Steve is

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.990
over at my parent's house
helping my dad decorate the tree.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.890
And at his home they were
preparing for Hanukkah

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.590
and neither family conveyed that.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.330
They were preparing
for different holidays.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.410
They were, one was on Saturday
and, Christmas was on Saturday

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.990
and Hanukkah was on Sunday,
the first day of Hanukkah.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.730
So Steve just thinks they're.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.520
This is a very cool tree and isn't
it beautiful and then he leaves

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.880
and while he's there he asks.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.580
My father asks him
is your tree up yet?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.230
Steve said, well we don't have
one and my father is going well,

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.420
why doesn't he have a tree?

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.500
It's Christmas Eve, my father after
Steve leaves literally went out

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.930
and purchased a Christmas tree,
brought it to Steve's home,

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.090
meets Steve's mother for the
first time who is horrified

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.470
that she can't tell Jackie Robinson
that she can't accept the tree.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.640
So and then it got even funnier

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.810
because like my parents literally
then showed up a little while later

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.620
with the ornaments and lights and
to help them decorate the tree.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.780
So needless to say our families
remained lifelong friends.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.800
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, yeah but
I love this story, as you do too,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.580
just for what it reveals about
the characters on both sides

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.490
and why this friendship began
when Steve was such a young boy

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.650 position:56%
and lasted into today because it's
a kind of caring and thoughtfulness,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.950
a kind of elegance and generosity

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.280
and smoothing things
over and going on.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.530
And these were the lessons
that Jackie Robinson brought

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.480
to that little boy every
time, every time he say.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.670
You said he was a little bit
naughty, I call it spunky.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.850
I don't know what they
would call it today but.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.260
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Teachers call it angry.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.970
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, okay,
angry and he was picked on a lot

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.760
and there were bullies but your
father helped him with that too.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.440
He gave him some wonderful advice.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.090
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Absolutely,
there's one particular scene

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.110
in the book where Steve has
gotten into a little trouble

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.290
on the softball field and he tried
to take on some of the older boys

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.200
and he comes home,
you know not wanting

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.860
to tell his mother
what had happened,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.990 position:56%
that he'd gotten into another fight.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.790 position:56%
And then he sees Jackie and Jackie
goes in the house and comes back out

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.860
and now he's gotten the
information from Steve's mother.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.240
You know how the neighborhood
works and so Jackie takes Steve

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.540
for a little walk and he says.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.280
And Steve said, well
where are we going?

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.680
And Jackie says, we're going
to, I want to see your school.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.280
And Steve knows the boys are still
there so he's a little nervous

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.260
but on the way he learns
that he can tell Jackie.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.380
He can be honest about
what happened and you know,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.680
he didn't have to take on.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.780
There's other ways to
work through a conflict.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.600
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: But yes, and
again to me the major lesson,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.630
and such a wonderful one,
was don't get your back up,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.320 position:56%
especially he was a little kid and
especially with kids who are bigger,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.830
older than you and tougher.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.480
But this is a man, imagine what he
had to go through during his life

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.170
and to suppress the true anger

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.560
and the real emotions
that he must have felt.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.580
He tells the little boy go up
and say the right thing to them

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.020
or say something that reaches a
hand out to them rather than going

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.140
like this with your dukes up.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.440
That was.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: And you know,
what my dad learned very early on is

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.990
that there are other ways you can
release that anger and so some

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.230
of the great playing you saw
on the field was his, you know,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.690
staying focused, you know
yes holding back that anger

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.060
but releasing it as he you know
slammed the ball or stole a base.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.950
In fact my favorite kind of
visual memory of my dad is

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:31.030
when he knows he's got it
and he's going to steal home

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.980
and there's just this great
picture of him clapping his hands

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.390
and jumping in the air and
taking off and he steals home

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.460
and it's like I got this.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.480
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, yeah, they
have many lessons for one another.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.670 position:56%
Steve teaches your father something.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.410
They're in a city after all and
there are brownstones and buildings

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:55.210
with stoops and stuff and Steve
is out there playing stoop ball

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.840
and Jackie Robinson says
to him, what's that?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.150
Because why would he know,
right, he didn't grow

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.450
up any place with stoops.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:03.750
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: He
didn't grow up, right.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.160
No, it is a great and you
know it's even funny, Susan,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.130
I had and all of you, you
know I read my reviews

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.920
and so I'm reading this review

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.700
and it's only a piece
of the review and I go.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.570
And I love it, it's a
great review and I go,

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.040
oh I've got to read the whole
review and I go to the whole review

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.700
and the reviewer says,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.100
that stickball scene should
have been three pages.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.480 position:56%
And I go, he's absolutely right, why
didn't we think of that [laughter]?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.350
So I take them very seriously.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.650
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: These
are the [multiple speakers].

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.000
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: It reminds
me to slow down you know.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.380
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.680
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Do it right.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.980
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Right.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.440 position:56%
But Steve says later that he noticed
how competitive your father was.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.740
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh yes, yes.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.360
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Learning,
even learning this new sport,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.660
something he didn't know.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.820
Of course he could do it in
his sleep but he saw that.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.440
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well that
was important for me to say

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.130
because that was part of my
father's character so even at home

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.700
if we were playing a family
game of cards after dinner,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.460
I mean my father, it's not like
he held back you know we had

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.960
to all compete and you learn
a lot of lessons from that.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.740
So yes, competition was
keen in my dad's home life

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.690
and in his professional life.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.570
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: So you wouldn't
take on checkers or Monopoly

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.270
and he wouldn't let you just win?

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.790
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: No,
absolutely not, we spent many,

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.780
a very long day playing Monopoly
and no, he did not let us win.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.080
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.380
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Because that's not like.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.680
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.980
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: That's

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.280
when we started the Breaking
Barriers program, kids,

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.580
people used to ask me,
did my dad put the values

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.600
up on the refrigerator and I go no.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.510
I learned them just by
watching him and he didn't.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.390
He wasn't a preachy
kind of guy so you sort

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.440 position:56%
of just watched the behavior whether
it's the tough times in our lives

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.530
or the joyous moments so.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:55.860
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: I liked

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.740
so much how the two mothers
became very good friends.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.320
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Yes, very good friends.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.220
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: And had a
real affinity to one another.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.130
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Absolutely, yes Steven's,

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.660
my mother Rachel [assumed spelling]
who I had hoped to be here today

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.420
but she wasn't able to make it.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.890
She's 94 now, an incredible
94-year-old.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.750 position:56%
And also you know I have to just
say you know I'm a Scholastic author

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.330
and our president of
Scholastic, Ellie Berger, is here

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.470
and so thank you Ellie because
it's, you know it's like having.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.480
I'm so lucky to have my Scholastic
family, my baseball family

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.780
and my Robinson family [inaudible].

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.290
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
Wow, yes, yes you are.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.890
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Great
families, great connections.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: But you were
talking about playing games and all.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.430
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Yes.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.730
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
He was away a lot.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.030
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Yes.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.330
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: He was away
a lot and the family had to deal

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.120
with that and I love a passage.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.420
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Okay.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.720
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Do you
mind reading a little bit?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.020
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: No.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: From
your book, I marked it

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.930
but you can go on if you like.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.230
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Alright.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.070
Start with 'Mom'?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.370
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yes.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.670
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: "Mom
said that her husband needed

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.660
to take some romance
lessons from Jackie".

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.960
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: No, no
start over [multiple speakers].

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.260
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: It's
Steve's mom, oh, I'm sorry.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.560
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh yeah.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.860
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: She's sorry.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.000
It's like well geez.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.320
Did I write that?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.280 position:56%
"[Inaudible] I overheard Rachel tell
mom that when Jackie was playing

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.510 position:56%
out of town he wrote her long
letters and sent flowers on Fridays.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.170
Mom said that her husband needed

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.140
to take some romance
lessons from Jackie.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.680
The two mothers laughed a
long time over that one.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.220 position:56%
I told my father about the
conversation between mom and Rachel.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.360
Dad reminded me that since he
worked in Manhattan he didn't need

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.490
to write his wife love letters.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.080
I had to agree.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.960
My father worked long hours
but he came home every night.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.720
I counted myself lucky."

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.020
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.850
That little boy is the
narrator of the book.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.150
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Yes.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.450
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: What was
that like for you as a writer?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.750
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well it was.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.230
I thought it was going to be a very
big challenge and I said, okay,

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.820 position:56%
now I'm an eight-year-old Jewish boy

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.870
from 1948 Brooklyn,
you know but Steve.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.170
So I went to Steve.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.470
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:01.860
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: And we
just, we were still good friends

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.290
and we just spent time together
and then I would call him.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.100
I'd go yeah I'm working on a scene.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.410
And he goes, oh let
me tell you something.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.140
Did I ever tell you this story?

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.690
So his voice, he's just.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.990
That year was so important
to him that his voice comes,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.020
his eight-year-old, nine-year-old
voice just comes out really strong

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.000
and so it helped me tell his story.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.540
So of course I immediately
sent the manuscript to Steve

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.840
and his wife Izzy [phonetic].

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.140
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.440
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: And to
Sarah [assumed spelling],

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.330
Sarah is now 97 and.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.830
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
Oh, that's his mother?

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.130
Oh.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.260
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Yeah, yeah so
they called me back and they go.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.880
They loved it so it
made me feel wonderful.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:45.140
It was a great challenge but
it was also fun to do 1948

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.600
because when I first started this
book I thought well what happened

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.260
in 1948 you know?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.560
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Everything.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.860
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: The Dodgers
didn't have a great year.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.160
I was trying to think what was
I going to pull out of that?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.460
And then when you start
doing your research

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.880
and you see all these
amazing things.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.280
Women going back, going into the
workforce, more into the workforce.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.190
You know just a change in Brooklyn.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:08.400
I mean it was all very fascinating
but I came to the part about,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.260
of wanting to do a mitzvah.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.280
I wanted my character
to do a mitzvah so.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.580
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: A good deed.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.880
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: A good deed.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.180
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: A good act.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.480
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
So I was asking Steve.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.780
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: I love that
she's speaking Yiddish [laughter].

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.080
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Yeah, well I asked Steve

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.380
because you know Steve
is very honest.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.680
Okay Steve, did you [inaudible]?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.770
No. I said, well in
the book you did.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.950
Your character did.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.990
So 1948, it's like okay the
Arab-Israeli War started.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.410
I was like okay.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.850
You've got to have that
in there and so it was.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.020
I had to find an organization
that supported children,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.090
Arab and Israeli children.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.460
It turned out that in 1948 was
when UNICEF was [multiple speakers]

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.450
so it was all very fun to put
them together and then to,

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.270
so there were creative parts
even though Steve told me many,

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.570
many stories.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh yeah but
also, not just creative but lessons.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.030
I loved the way you moved
history in and out of this story.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.330
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: It's
important to me yeah.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.630
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
About the little boy.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.500
And you talk about civil rights.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.800
You move all of that in.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.490
You talk about New
York education then,

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.780
what all of, what life
was like then.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.080
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
May I read one quick.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.380
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh
I'd love it, please.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Passage that
I'd like to read because when I work

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.200 position:56%
with kids on this book I do a lot
about voice, finding your voice just

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.100
for the same reason
we just talked about.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.390
How did I find Steve's voice
and you know and the importance

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.120
of having a strong voice.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.270
So there's this scene that I like
to read to them because right now,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.990
I mean many of the issues that are

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.980
in this book are contemporary
issues as well.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.310
So, it's before Steve and Jackie
have met and become friends

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.800
and Steve's just sort of learning

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.040
that this is going
to be his neighbor.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.850
So it's, so his best friend's
name is Seena [phonetic].

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.150
They're going out to play.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.530 position:56%
"An hour later Seena and I are armed
with sticks and a Spalding ball,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.870
rode our bikes to the school yard.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.490
The courts were filled
with other boys and girls.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.100
We joined a bunch of kids from
our school and started up a game.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.650
It felt good to be outside
playing with friends.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.340
We didn't mind the cold air.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.330
Actually it felt good
to run around in it."

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.600
"I proudly batted with
my toes pointed inward

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.230
like my pigeon-toed
hero, Jackie Robinson.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.630
I wasn't the best hitter
and I didn't run very fast

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.510
so the other kids held out
little hope that I'd score.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.860
Still, I swung the
wooden stick so hard

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.460
that it grazed the
ball and I got on base.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.980
The rest was easier.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.330
When I got a chance to run I'd
race around bases mustering

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:40.580
in a body warmth to keep me going.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.220
I was all heart."

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.260
"Afterward when we were riding our
bikes home Seena told me she had

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.460
heard a black family planned

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:54.830
on buying the two-family
house at 5224 Tilden Avenue.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.710
Big deal I told her.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.080
My mom said only Jews should live
in our neighborhood Seena insisted.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.090
Why is that I asked?

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.930
Maybe so we can all go to the
same temple she suggested,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.680
or so the neighborhood stays
the way it already is."

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.790
"I slammed on the brakes and stared
back at my friend in disbelief.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.100
I'm going home.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.140
What's the matter with
you Seena asked?

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.780
The whole talk makes me mad
I yelled as I sped away.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.000
What about a quick game of
stoop ball Seena called?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.610
Not today I yelled back at her.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.210
I didn't understand my sudden
anger but I knew it had to do

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.610
with what my friend had said."

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.700
"All I could think of was how hard
Jackie had fought his first season

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.720
with the Dodgers just
because his skin was black.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.490
Players and fans tried
to make Jackie quit

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.220
so they could keep
baseball a white man's game.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.340 position:56%
Jackie fought back with a well-timed
base steal and a mighty swing."

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.180
"I reached home hot and frustrated.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.130
I stomped through the kitchen and
grabbed a quick snack on my way

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.930
to my room, trying to
make sense of my feelings.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.990
I pulled out the tin can that held
my most precious baseball cards.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.040
I separated them so the
Dodger lineup was on top.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.640
Jackie was in the mix.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.330
Could Brooklyn win the
World Series without him?

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.040
Could they even get back there if
he wasn't on the team I wondered?"

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.340
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: That's terrific.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.080
That's terrific [applause].

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.970
It's so vivid.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.270
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Oh oh, we'd better.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.570
Are you going to let
them ask questions?

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.870
We're down to ten minutes.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.360
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, okay.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.660
Prepare yourself.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.960
Stand up straight.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.260
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Thank
you, timekeeper [laughter].

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.850
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Thank you,
stand up straight and come on up

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.150
to the microphone [laughter].

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.140
But I have more.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.590
Why did you write this book?

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.060
Come on up.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.550
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: You know I had
told the book as a part of a story,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.220
that little piece about
the Christmas tree.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.520
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yes.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.920
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: In a picture
book and Scholastic wanted to do it

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.610
as a middle-grade reader
and I thought.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.650
What I learned in preparing

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.030
that Fisher [phonetic] book was
this story had a depth to it

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.300
that would be fun to explore for
older kids, that's why, that's why.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.190
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: But I feel that
it has such resonance for today.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.490
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Today.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.170
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: This morning,
you know this last week our lives.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.470
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Absolutely.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.150
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg:
Because [inaudible] we are

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.990
in a tribalistic civilization
these days.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.740
It feels like so many groups are
batting up against one another

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.750
and they need lessons like
this from a man like that.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.820
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: But also
it helps people understand

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.590
that history is cyclic.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.890
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.190
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
We've been there before

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.490
and we've had these
battles amongst groups.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.640
We need to fight it
through and get beyond it

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.210
and you know someday maybe
we can break this cycle.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.240
It looks like we have
a young Dodger's fan.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.320
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh good, hello.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.590
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 1: What is
it like to be an author and writing

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.130
about one of the greatest
baseball players of all time?

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.430
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well, you know.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.730
What is your name?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.030
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 1 Joey.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.330
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Joey,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.630
I have these huge lights
so I barely see you.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.930
Okay, now I see you.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.600
Joey, I love being a
children's book author.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.340
I think that's what
I should start with.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.280
I've written a couple of adult
books but I really love speaking

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.520
to children and I love going
into the schools and going

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.510 position:56%
and having children ask me questions
and us having a discussion.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:21.750
Now I also have a, my father was
a very special person in my life

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.590
and he did teach me lots of
lessons and I just think I learned.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.550
We had so many family stories
that I wanted to share.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.430
So, I have enjoyed
writing family stories.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.070
So I either write about my dad
or I've written about my mother

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.590
or I've written purely
fictional books

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.620
that have something
to do with my son.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.040
You know, so it's just sort of
fun for me to tell family stories.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.340
&gt;&gt; Joey: Thank you.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.640
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Thank you.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.940
Do you like to write?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.240
&gt;&gt; Joey: Ah yeah.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.540
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
And you read as well?

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.840
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.140
Good for you, keep it up.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.440
[ Applause ]

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.740
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Here's somebody.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.040
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
2: Do you play any sports?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.340
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Did you hear?

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.880
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh, again a
light, now the light's over here.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.850
Yeah, you know what I
was an all-around athlete

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.790
when I was a child all the
way through high school.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:13.850
My favorites were swimming, ice
skating and horseback riding.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.010
I was a very good horseback
rider and I had a horse.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.020
Baseball was never my best
sport because I wear glasses.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.100
But back then I didn't
like to wear my glasses

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.260
so I had a very difficult time
seeing that ball coming close

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.460
to me, until it got too close.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.420
So, I would put my
glasses on when it got dark

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.720
and then I could hit the ball.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.420
Do you play sports?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.270
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
2: Yes, I do gymnastics.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.570
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh fantastic.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.650
Did you see the Olympics?

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.950
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 3: Say yes.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.250
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 2: Yes.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.460
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh well
we had some great young women

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.320
that did incredible gymnastics
that won gold medals didn't we?

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.300
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
2: I'm a Level III team.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.600
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh yeah.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.900
Alright, keep it up.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.580
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Keep it up.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.950
[ Applause ]

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.380
Yes?

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.690
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 4: How long
did it take you to write the book?

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.990
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Great question,

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.370
how long did it take
to write the book?

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.390
It took. We were on a
fast-track as they call it.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.910
So usually what happens is, you
get a contract from your publisher

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.140
and I told you I'm
a Scholastic author.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.750
So, they usually give you a
year to 18 months to write

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.800
and then they get a year to produce
the book so it's really a two

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.320
to two and a half year process.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.620
Some books take longer.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.920
Some books are shorter.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.110
This one, we wrote it in a year

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.320
and it was produced
within the two years so.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.730
It takes a full year though.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:45.380
And you also, I write a
first draft and do my edits.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.380
I may do a thousand edits on my
first draft and then I send it

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.240
to my editor and he
sends back comments.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.850
So then I do another draft and then
send it back to him and then we,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:59.350
you get less comments and then you
finally agree that we're there.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.090
Well we missed that
scene about the stoop.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.110
See we should have made that a much
longer scene so you always learn

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.600
and that's what I love
about writing is, you know,

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.230
you get better the more you do it.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.970
So when you finish one book and you
learn some of the mistakes you made

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.000
in that book you try not to
repeat them the next time.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.100
And that's, you know, same
thing with you in school I hope.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.020
When you get your teacher's
comments, learn from them

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.960
because they really help
you become a better writer

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.350
and then you can get be
better the next time.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.650
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 4: Thanks.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.220
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Thank you.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.520
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yes, over here.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:48.040
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 5: He
wants to know when you're going

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.960
to write your next children's.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:58.050
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Ellie, when am
I writing my next children's book?

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.830
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
6: When are you going

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.830
to write your children's book?

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.190
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
I'm going to write,

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.650
I have already started
working on it.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.760
I can't, you know you're
not allowed to tell a lot

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.520
about what it is especially
as I don't have a contract

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:26.770
yet with Scholastic but it will
have something to do with Cuba

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.580
and the fact that my mother
and I and we're great.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.910
My mother and I are great
travelling partners.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.780
We've been all over
the world together.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:43.650
But we had a trip that was
just extraordinary, President

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:49.900
and the First Lady,
President Barack Obama

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:57.090 position:56%
and the First Lady invited my mother
and I to go with them to Cuba.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.390
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Oh my gosh.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: So I really
want to write, share that experience

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:09.970
and also introduce children to a
change in relationship between Cuba

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.760
and America and a very
fascinating country.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.190
So, that's, you should hopefully
see that in a couple of years.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.490
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: That's great.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.790
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson:
Thanks for the question.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.090
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
6: Thank you.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.390
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Okay, bye.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.690
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: I
think we can do one more.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.530
Yes young man?

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.350
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 7:
Good morning to you both.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.650
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Good morning.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.590
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 7: My
name is Herb Cowells [phonetic]

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:39.690
and I grew up in New York City and
as a young man my father worked

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:44.770
in Greenpoint, Brooklyn so I
spent many nights at Ebbets Field.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:53.590
And I also saw your father
play in the 1949 All-Star game

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.970
and I will never forget that.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:01.450
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Wow
that was his best year.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.750
&gt;&gt; Herb Cowells: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.400
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: That's the
year he got the Most Valuable

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.980
Player award.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.280
Go ahead.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.580
&gt;&gt; Herb Cowells: Yeah.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.110
I want to hear you speak a
little bit about what it was

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.990
like when you went to
see your father play.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.200
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Well, you
know what, I was so young that.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:24.150
I was seven when my father retired
from baseball so I really grew

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.060
up with him more as an activist

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.360
and his baseball career
was something I knew about

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.780
and eventually, I didn't.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.150
I really learned more about it

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.850
as I started writing
about it for children.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:41.130
So I remember going
to spring training,

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.310
that's what my childhood
memories are and that was

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.600
because spring training lasts
for a month and we would go

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.900
from Connecticut where
it was cold and snowy

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.820
to Florida where I could swim.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.860
So you know as a child you
know what's important to them

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:01.580
but what I also know is that
as a child baseball meant

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:09.900 position:56%
that he'd be away a lot and so I was
very happy when baseball was over

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.520
and we had dad home
at night for dinner.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.820
&gt;&gt; Herb Cowells: Yes, yeah.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.120
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: So it,
so really but I've loved

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.740
over the years hearing incredible
stories from men, women who were,

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:25.830
you know, where that was
their Sunday picnic day

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.050
or you know they would go to Ebbets
Field or people like you, you know,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:32.610
that have these wonderful memories
so that is as strong in my head

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.080
as the visuals that I've seen
from the [multiple speakers].

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.630
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Thank you
so much for the question.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.500
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: We have
to let this little boy, I.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.800
&gt;&gt; Susan Stamberg: Yeah, one more,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.990
we'll go a little long,
just last question.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.290
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: One question.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.590
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 8:

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.140
Did you know that you were
going to be an author?

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.440
&gt;&gt; Sharon Robinson: Oh my
goodness, great question.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.000
I had no idea.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.620
I wanted to be a nurse
when I was a little girl

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.590
and that's all my grandmother
said I should ever be in life.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:10.560
And I became a nurse, midwife and
spent 20 years delivering babies

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:20.490
and teaching women, mostly women, a
couple of men, how to be a midwife.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.600
But in that process
I had to write books

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.310 position:56%
and help students write their theses
because it was Master's level.

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.610
It's a long story.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.910
You should never ask a
storyteller [inaudible].

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.210
Anyway I always loved to read
so that's what I remember

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.510
from my connection to
books was loving to read

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.810
and in my house we literally
had a room we called the library

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.110
and that's where our
books were kept.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.410
So, books are very
comfortable, books.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.710
I love to write.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.010
I love to read.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.310
And it just, when I started
having to publish as a faculty,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.610
because I was on faculty,
then I started working

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.910
for Major League Baseball
and doing a program for kids

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.210
and I loved writing curriculum for
kids and I just became a. I said

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.510
to Scholastic, well I should
just write a book for kids.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:44.810
And then once I wrote one book
I wanted to write another one.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.110
And every time I go, oh I'm going
to write an adult book and I go

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.410
but I won't be able to see the kids

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.710
and so I keep writing
books for children.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.010
Have you ever read any of them?

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.310
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.610
Have you read any of my books?

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.910
Unidentified Speaker 8: Not yet.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.210
