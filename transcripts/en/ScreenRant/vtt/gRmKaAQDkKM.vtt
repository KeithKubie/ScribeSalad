00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.090
When you think of Disney movies, you immediately
associate them with a predominantly young

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.090
audience.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.090
Of course, anyone can enjoy Disney offerings,
but it's only natural to assume that the people

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.090
behind them gear the content of Disney stories
solely towards children.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.660
With that in mind, you don't tend to typically
associate Disney movies with adult jokes - but

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.219
they're actually teaming with them!

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.030
Writers know that, in order for young kids
to visit the theatre, they have to be accompanied

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.740
by their parents, so they love to slip a little
something in to keep mom and dad entertained

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.740
as well.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.760
In this video, we'll run you through just
a few examples of that.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.000
These are ten disturbing Disney jokes that
are hard for kids to understand.

from these emojis?

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
stay tuned for the answer at the end of our
video and be sure to keep watching for fun

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.440
trivia questions and fun facts along the way.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
1.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.949
Wreck-It Ralph
In 2012's Wreck-It Ralph, the characters from

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.429
the video game in which Ralph is the villain
- Fix-It Felix, Jr. - have a party to celebrate

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.250
the game's 30th anniversary, but Ralph isn't
invited.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.350
When he learns of the snub, he reacts angrily
and, upon seeing that Pac-Man was invited,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.470
he calls him a "cherry-chasing dot-muncher."

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.109
Kids will have assumed "cherry-chasing" was
exactly what it sounded like, but adults knew

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.380
it was a reference to men who seek to take
away a girl's innocence!

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.490
2.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.439
Bambi
Bambi is arguably the most quintessentially-Disney

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.930
movie ever made, so surely the 1942 classic
couldn't have any dirty jokes in it?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.930
Right?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.930
RIGHT?!

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.619
Well we're afraid you're about to have your
childhood ruined, because it absolutely does!

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.719
Bambi's skunk friend Flower finds himself
a girlfriend in the woods and, when the pair

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.329
accidentally kiss, Flower turns bright red
before his entire body becomes... well...

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.329
hard.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.479
This was clearly a metaphor for male arousal,
but young kids would never understand that.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.990
Trivia time: Bambi and Thumper have which
of the following named after them?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.479
a) Two asteroids.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.060
b) Two species of deer and rabbit.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.850
c) Two taekwondo moves.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.929
Find out the answer at the end of the video.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.929
3.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.140
Toy Story 2
The erection jokes just keep on coming!

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.140
(That wasn't meant to be one of them, by the
way) And this time it's in 1999's classic

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.260
Pixar sequel Toy Story 2.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.750
When Buzz Lightyear first meets the cowgirl
Jessie, he is clearly attracted to her and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.260
struggles to speak coherently as a result.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.480
The attraction becomes even more obvious when
she spectacularly uses a toy car like a skateboard,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.610
which makes his wings stand upright - yet
another clear metaphor for male arousal.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.610
4.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.040
Cars
Lightning McQueen - brilliantly voiced by

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.800
Owen Wilson - is the main character in the
Cars franchise.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.500
He's an anthropomorphic stock car whose popularity
soars to legendary status as the movies progress.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.200
In the first movie from 2006, he's the hot
new rookie, having his first experiences of

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.970
stardom - an example of which comes in the
form of having fans.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.909
One such example sees two twins - Mia and
Tia - flashing their headlights at him, before

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.810
being led away by security.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.880
When you think about what "flashing" means
in human terms, you get what was actually

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.150
going on there!

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.150
5.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.180
Beauty and the Beast
In spite of the fact that he's undoubtedly

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
an enormous douchebag, it's impossible to
deny that Gaston from 1991's Beauty and the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.900
Beast is the epitome of manliness.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.969
He's muscular, he can fight and hunt, he drinks
a lot of beer and, in his own words, "every

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.849
last inch" of him is covered in hair.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.299
The fact that he winks at the very same moment
that he uses the word "inch" would suggest

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.709
that he's describing himself in some extremely
intimate detail with those words - detail

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.410
that's only meant to be noticed by adults,
as a matter of fact.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.410
6.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.760
Aladdin and the King of Thieves
Aladdin and the King of Thieves was the second

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.709
direct-to-video sequel to the Disney classic
Aladdin.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.700
The 1996 offering was nowhere near as good
as the original, but it still had the Genie,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.440
and it still had his trademark humour and
wit as a result.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.930
One such example came in the form of an adult
joke in the middle of Aladdin and Jasmine's

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.930
wedding.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.659
A stampeding elephant causes a small tremor,
which results in Genie saying "I thought the

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.099
earth wasn't supposed to move until the honeymoon",
referencing the fact that a man and his wife

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.099
shouldn't...

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.060
cavort... until after they were officially
wed.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.980
Trivia time: True or False - Pierce Brosnan
was originally cast in the role of Cassim

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.080
in this movie?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.960
All will be revealed at the end of this video.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960
7.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.080
Hocus Pocus
1993's Disney Halloween fantasy-comedy horror

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.600
- that's a mouthful - Hocus Pocus followed
three witches who sought to regain their youth

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.390
by sucking the souls out of the children of
Salem.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.270
Upon their resurrection in modern times, therefore,
they told a bus driver that they "desired

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.270
children".

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.130
Mistakenly thinking they meant they wanted
him to father their children, the driver responded

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.650
by saying "it may take me a couple of tries,
but I donâ€™t think there'll be a problem!"

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.650
8.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.040
101 Dalmatians
Okay, we'll get right to it - the 1996 live

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.770
action adaptation of 101 Dalmatians had a
bestiality joke.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.040
Glenn Close's Cruella de Vil delivered it
when Roger Dearly spoke about how he and his

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.430
wife were expecting a baby and their pet was
expecting some puppies.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.180
De Vil responded by saying "you have been
a busy boy", suggesting that Roger was responsible

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.420
for the conception of both the baby and the
puppies.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.210
Thank goodness that one went over the heads
of the movie's younger audiences members.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.210
Yuck.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.210
9.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.030
The Avengers
The Avengers was the first movie in the Marvel

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.460
Cinematic Universe to be distributed by Disney,
so we can definitely include it on this list.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.590
The 2012 offering saw the titular team coming
together to face Loki - and it's an interaction

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.650
between him and Tony Stark that we're referring
to here.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.650
When Loki failed to mind-control Stark with
his scepter, thanks to Stark's arc reactor

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.760
blocking its effects, Loki said "this usually
works".

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.710
Stark then makes fun of Loki, citing "performance
issues", which definitely isn't meant for

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.810
kids' ears, as it jokingly refers to men having
problems performing in the bedroom.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.610
Trivia time: Complete this quote from the
movie - "Doth mother know you weareth her

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.610
?what?"

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.050
We'll give you the answer at the end.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.050
10.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.960
Frozen
2013's Frozen - the highest-grossing animated

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.950
movie of all time - is something of a love
story, but it has no problem calling out silly

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.990
stereotypes in other classic tales of romance.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.440
When Anna reveals that she planned to marry
Hans after only knowing him for one day, both

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.130
Elsa and Kristoff question her sanity.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.620
Kristoff goes as far as suggesting that Anna
knows nothing about Hans and starts asking

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.570
questions about him - including his foot size.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.560
Anna responds by saying "foot size doesn't
matter" which, to adult audiences, was obviously

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.500
a humorous play on the notion that the size
of a man's... package... doesn't matter either.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.500
The answers to the trivia questions were:
There are two asteroids named after Bambi

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500
and Thumper.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.500
Pierce Brosnan wasn't in fact original cast
as Cassim, but another James Bond actor was

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.500
- none other than Sean Connery.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500
And the missing word was "drapes".

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.500
Thanks for watching our video about ten disturbing
Disney jokes that are hard for kids to understand.
