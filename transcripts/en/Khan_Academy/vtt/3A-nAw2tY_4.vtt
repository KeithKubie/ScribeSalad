00:00:00.681 --> 00:00:04.802
In the last two videos, we
explored situations where
the aggregate demand curve

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:06.143
shifted to the right

00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:08.345
and that caused inflation.
That's actually called

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:10.342
demand-pull inflation.

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:14.270
What I want to do in this video is study
a situation where the short-run aggregate

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.939
supply curve shifts to the
left and that causes inflation.

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:27.543
And that's called cost-push inflation.

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:32.071
So let's just start off
with our standard graph.

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:34.511
So this is aggregate prices.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:37.429
This is real aggregate
productivity. Real GDP right here.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.862
I'm going to focus
things on the short run.

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:44.472
Aggregate demand right over here.

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.809
That is our aggregate demand curve.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.677
Aggregate supply in the short-run.

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:53.842
This is what we're going to focus
on, might look something like that.

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:57.869
So this is aggregate
supply in the short-run.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.340
And this is our current level of prices.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.763
And the reason why I draw aggregate supply
in the short-run as this curve that keeps

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:08.200
getting steeper and steeper.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.940
Or if you think in algebraic terms, the
slope keeps getting larger and larger

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.269
as you go to the right, one
way to think about it is:

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:17.001
if the real GDP is down here and
maybe performing well below potential,

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.003
there is a lot of excess
capacity in the economy:

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.873
excess labor capacity,
excess factory capacity.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:27.677
So if you want more productivity
out of that economy, people
aren't going to demand much more.

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:29.403
Prices won't have to go up more.
There's a lot of slack in the economy.

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:34.937
While as GDP gets higher and higher,
maybe even going beyond its potential,

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:39.098
starts to get overheated and
in order for people to get very
high levels of utilization,

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:45.346
essentially get more people to
enter the labor market, work
longer hours, work overtime,

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:47.873
the prices are going to
essentially have to go up.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:52.536
So over here, for some increment in
GDP, prices don't have to go up so much.

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.600
So you have a lower slope than over here.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.543
For that same increment in GDP,
prices have to go up dramatically.

00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:02.428
With that out of the way, let's
think about what would happen
if the aggregate supply curve

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:03.927
were to shift to the left.

00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:06.209
We can also think about "Why
would it shift to the left?"

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.539
So let's just shift it to the left.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.543
It might look something like that.

00:02:12.543 --> 00:02:14.431
At any given point, I try
to shift it to the left.

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:19.204
You see a new equilibrium
price and equilibrium GDP.

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:23.878
This is the old equilibrium price
and the old equilibrium GDP.

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:29.604
This is the new equilibrium price
and the new equilibrium GDP.

00:02:29.604 --> 00:02:31.536
You see, you definitely had inflation.

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:35.936
Price went up, but this is worse,
depending on how you view things.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:39.067
But generally, this is worse
than demand-pull inflation.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:44.009
Because at least with demand-pull
inflation, you had inflation happening,

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.604
but real GDP increased

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.266
more as things get overheated.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:56.133
Prices went up, but your
GDP actually contracts.

00:02:56.133 --> 00:03:00.745
This is a situation where
you might have heard the word
before: this is stagflation.

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:03.182
Inflation with stagnation.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:07.209
So this is stagflation.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.768
There's two very notable examples
of this in recent US history.

00:03:11.768 --> 00:03:16.269
In 1973, you had the Arab oil embargo.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.763
It was apparently due in
response to the US support of
Israel in the Yom Kippur War.

00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:27.804
So you had the 1973 oil embargo.

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:32.599
In 1979, you have your revolution in Iran.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.513
Iran was a major oil producer then.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:38.003
It continues to be, but it
was particularly so in 1979.

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:44.092
So, during all the chaos, during
the revolution, Iran's oil
productivity dropped dramatically.

00:03:44.092 --> 00:03:47.139
So you had an oil crisis.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.761
The reason why oil crises would
shift the curve to the left...

00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.602
In both of these situations, the
supply of oil drops dramatically.

00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:03.202
So if the supply of oil, and this
is kind of a micro-phenomenon,

00:04:03.202 --> 00:04:09.206
if the supply of something drops
dramatically, the price of that
thing is going to go up dramatically.

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:13.868
And in the 70's, oil was an even bigger
part of the economy than it is now.

00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:15.938
You probably remember if
you were around in the 70's.

00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:19.199
Very very large cars that
had very bad gas mileage.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.810
Other uses of oil were also much
less efficient in the 1970s.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.004
So it was a big input into the US economy.

00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:34.735
If all of a sudden, a major input's
price becomes much more expensive,

00:04:34.735 --> 00:04:36.718
you could view it as one of two ways:

00:04:36.718 --> 00:04:42.220
For a given level of productivity,
suppliers will want to charge more.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.300
If you want me to deliver to your
house, if you want me to run a truck,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.005
so for a given level of productivity,
suppliers will charge more.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:57.067
Or you could view that at a
given level of price, suppliers
will want to produce less.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:04.137
So at a given price, say this
price over here, a supplier
will want to produce less.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.468
Because they are not
getting as much real profit.

00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:09.134
So you could view it
as a shift to the left.

00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:12.390
Or you could even view it at
a given level of productivity,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.529
if you want to produce at that level,
you're going to have to pay me more
so I can offset my price increases.

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.258
So you can also view it as a shift up.

00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:19.223
Either one.

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:22.386
But we'll think of it as a
shift left in this context.

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:28.123
So you see, this does describe
what happened during these
two oil crises in the 1970's.

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:30.992
Because of this increase
in the price of oil,

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:34.449
at any given price, suppliers
were willing to supply less.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.285
Aggregate short-run
supply shifts to the left.

00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.725
You have the inflation, and
you also have the stagnation.

00:05:40.725 --> 23:59:59.999
Real GDP goes down.
