Speaker 1:          00:00          At the end of the day, everybody wants comradery and love and friendship. That's why like what's the worst shit that can happen today? You get canceled, everybody wants to cancel people. You're out. Get out of here. You're done. Pits over. There's a weird strange, it's also like I want you to not be able to make money but it's signed. I want you to starve or go home, be homeless. I don't really understand. Is that specific? It's not specific in terms of like they don't want you to be able to make an income. They want to hurt you. That's what it is because they're scared of someone doing it to them. This is the a big part of why people pull the trigger on that stuff. Whether I just, people are calling for people to get canceled for like nothing, like little tiny things. Never again. It's because they're scared of it actually happening.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So this is like, you have this ultimate power to just like get upset at someone for virtually anything. Pick it, pick a cause, whatever it is you can get. Also, it's sort of intoxicating and it's fun and most people don't have real opinions on anything. And then you have this, this, you know, on on Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media platform, you have an immediate gratification of like, I just got 20 likes on a thought of mine. Yeah, that's addictive as fuck. It's super addictive. You know that that right there would, you know, I understand why people continue to come back and nobody really cares. As soon as you put your computer down at your phone down, nobody gives a fuck about any of these issues at the supermarket or at the bowling alley or in the library. But that's not what's important. What's important is the Internet is essentially, the whole world is a big window and everyone has a rock and people just look at it, throw rocks.

Speaker 1:          01:39          And if you find a thing to throw a rock about, whether it's throw rock about politics or, or gender or race or social justice or you know what, fill in the blank. The environment, the saving, the animals, everyone's thrown rocks, you know? And very few people are actually communicating. It's a strange time for you would think that you would want, in an ideal world, you would want people that have differing ideas to come together, sit down, have an honest conversation. Yes. And Go, awesome dude. Go live your life. I'll live my life. I learned a little bit just now. Yeah. And then you go off and you go, yeah. That's how you learn from different cultures. That's how we ultimately got to a place. You know, I think I, I, I think it's a great country. I, in a weird way, I think it's, I'm proud to be an American, you know, I'm proud.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Um, you know, I don't think all the things that people think they're are awful about this country or necessarily awful. Um, you know, I think the opportunity to make money. I did grow up on wealth and I grew up poor and, you know, you know, I'm, you know, for all intents and purposes, I'm living my dream right now and I get to kind of do what I want to do. Um, and I look at that and I say yes because I live in a place where that Opportunity's there. Of course, look, America is amazing. It doesn't mean it's perfect. No, certainly it gives you more opportunity than anywhere that I've ever heard of. And it's a fun place, man. I like it here. Yeah. Fucking country is fun.
