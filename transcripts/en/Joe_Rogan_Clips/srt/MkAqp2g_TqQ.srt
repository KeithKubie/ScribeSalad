1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,490
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,680
How did Sanchez figure out how to do
Moitai different than anybody? Ah, man,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,580
he's so interesting. What is quick
switches of the feet and like,

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,230
even the way he throws kicks is yet
Skyler like a little different flavor.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,730
Everything. He don't think he can
help it. You know what I mean?

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:21,270
There's just something about the
guy's character. A just like his,

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,290
his fighting is him. Right. You know,
like he's just, he's kind of outgoing,

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:29,400
like just a weird funky guy and it
makes sense that he fights like that.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,090
You know what I mean? It's not like
he's just like seriously stern guy,

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,770
but then goes out there
and fights all crazy.

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,390
Like he seems like his fighting is
definitely an expression of himself.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,840
He's so good, man. Yeah, he's so good. I,

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,650
I like watching him just warm up sneakers
on outside sweat and throwing elbows

14
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,610
and knees and Sherry think he's a bad
motherfucker man. And he's, you know,

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,150
he's not young now. I think he's in
his forties is he? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,000
Can we look, help hold sanitize
38 38 Oh, he's getting there.

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,751
It's getting there.

18
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:04,260
But meanwhile I was in his prime still
find people up all the times a month,

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,760
multiple times a month. Have fight. Good
luck. Yeah. Shows this and like dynamite.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,160
It's Instagram was awesome man and he's
got these great videos of him warming up

21
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,070
and you watch him, him, his movement
man. It's like wow, that guy's,

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,300
he's something special.

23
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,600
It takes a lot of fucking energy to
move around the way he does too. Yeah,

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,700
I'm sure he still shows up to
the gym every single day too.

25
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,860
I'm sure like holding pads for
foreigners and all that stuff.

26
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:29,120
I stopped by Y'all cow Jim.
He wasn't there but I hear like there is,

27
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,080
I look at that again.
Mother fucking man right there.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,990
He just posted a video the
other day where this crazy wig

29
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,780
go to CP. If I have video of him. There
it is right there. Look at this guy.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,673
Okay.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,330
Even how he throw this cake. It's
different. It's so different. Yeah.

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,610
Like he doesn't really like turn all of
his upper body like a lot of the ones

33
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,490
I've seen, right. He's, he's a volume guy,

34
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,900
but he knocks guys out with one shot to
catch it. It, yeah. It just instinctual,

35
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,000
you know, like he didn't even
think about it. Didn't even flinch.

36
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,730
He's so jacked up swipe.

37
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,620
It's interesting when you think of how
many different people are doing it and

38
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:15,540
that this one guy stands out.
I love outliers man.

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,980
So that's one thing that I learned
compared to like watching boy tie in the

40
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,640
states and then going there at the amount
of kicks and knees at their throwing.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,250
Mm. I'm looking at fighting like, okay,

42
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,900
like what does the next
punch going to happen?

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,890
These guys throwing kick after
kick after kick for five rounds.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,020
I was like, okay, I'm, I'm definitely not
kicking enough so I got to start kicking.

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,540
Mm.
So I,

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,570
they like being in Thailand definitely
helped me to learn the importance of KCI.

47
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,850
So we were talking about the shoot
box style Hotville Cordero who is obs?

48
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,030
Absolutely one of the best
striking coaches on the planet.

49
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,980
It's funny that he's such a nice guy
and he trained the most murderous crew.

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,750
Angry, Brasilia ambulation.
Pharaoh could not be nicer. Good.

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,030
They had Anderson Silva,
they,

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,550
ed Vandelay and Vandelay Shogun
digitally look at that photo and, okay,

53
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,170
I'll fail. Show. Good.
Yeah, dude, that's a,

54
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,230
that's a fucking teams have another one.
It's got like Pele. Everybody. Yeah,

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,270
that's right. I said pay like too. They
were so the guy who taught more time,

56
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,790
Michael Costa, he was, he was
from that same, that same group.

57
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,650
I really am to this day, do not understand
why more ties. Not more popular.

58
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,610
I've never understood it.
