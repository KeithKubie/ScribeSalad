00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is it only helps us if we know something else about K.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The reason for this is if K is uniformly distributed,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we're XORing it with these other values,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
whatever patterns that M and S have are lost when they get XORed with K.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is the whole point of the one-time pad that we can

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
XOR a random key with a message and hide all the statistical properties in the message.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is not the case that it helps us by itself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If this was all we knew this is a potentially interesting property,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but we need to know something more in order to use this to help break the cipher.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Knowing something more about M would be great.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's the message we're trying to decrypt, but that's separate from being able to use

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
this property in a useful way.

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What we really need to do is know something more about K.
