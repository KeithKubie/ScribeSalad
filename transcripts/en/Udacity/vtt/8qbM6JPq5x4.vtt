00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the mode is a useful statistic

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
if your distribution of data is what is called multimodal.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In multimodal distributions, you have a curve that has multiple bumps.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This one is called bimodal

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because it has exactly 2 bumps.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The mode is the highest value of the largest bump,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which now occurs here with the value of 4.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So in a situation like this, the mean is usually irrelevant,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It falls just between the data.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
as we showed with our house prices example.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The median may be in the middle or flipped from left to right

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and really doesn't say much either.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The mode, too, can flip from left to right.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
At the very least, it corresponds to something that is very frequent in the data.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So for bimodal data, or for multimodal data,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is data with even more than two bumps,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the mode is something you should really calculate.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So let's practice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So let me give you a list of numbers: 5, 9, 100, 9, 97, 6, 9, 98, and 9.

00:01:09.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Compute for me the three Ms: mean, median, and mode.
