00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.850
MICHAEL PICCUIRRO: We chose
Google Cloud platform because

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.960
it is a great tool that allows
us to build solutions very

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.460
quickly and deploy them
somewhere that can scale to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.270
whatever we need.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.600
STEFAN HAUK: When we release a
new game, it usually becomes

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.120
immediately very popular.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.130
We have 263 million monthly
players at the end of last

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.720
year who are already
playing our games.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.110
And when we tell them that
there's a new game, they all

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.220
come to it and try to play it.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.670
So we need a lot of computer
power from the start.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.580
KARS VELING: And App Engine
allows us to create new

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.250
things, focus on the new things,
and only need 1% or so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060
to focus on maintenance because
App Engine takes care

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.520
of a lot of stuff.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.740
I think basically it's a
worry-free platform for us.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.160
CHANDRA KRINTZ: My favorite
feature of Google Cloud

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.940
Platform is the App Engine Data
Store, because it makes

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.990
it really easy to
do large-scale

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.590
data analytics across.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.380
ROBERT KLUIN: So for example,
if we're developing on App

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.690
Engine and we have services
such as Memcache readily

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.830
available to us without needing
to do a tremendous

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.120
amount of configuration
or work.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.320
ALAGAPPAN ALS: We chose Google
App Engine because we wanted

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.910
to focus on developing features
that are facing

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.670
millions of users rather than
having to focus on hardware,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.130
service scaling, and dealing
with hardware failure and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.990
other such stuff.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.480
MOMCHIL KYURKCHIEV: We're
a young company,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.410
less than a year old.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.950
And so for us, building
a minimum viable

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.970
product is very important.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.470
So we start with something
small, and then we upgrade it.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.430
And I think App Engine
is designed exactly

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.230
for this use case.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.570
So you start with something
small, you get it working.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.120
And then as you need more
complex infrastructure, more

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.600
hardware, you can add it on,
more features, of course.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.470
But that's ideal for
our use case.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.320
DEREK STEVENSON: We chose Google
Cloud Platform in large

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.470
part for our analytic needs.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.410
So we looked at a variety of
options and settled on a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.710
BigQuery as a key enabler for
some of our analytic projects.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.140
MATT MCCLURE: With Google
Cloud Platform's network

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.660
performance, we're able to
provide really low-latency

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.415
live streams, which is really
important to our customers

00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:58.820
that are using our
live service.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.460
MICHAEL PICCUIRRO: Things that
would have taken years to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.780
build are going to take
weeks or months.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.120
And we'll be able to produce
these richer experiences,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.530
these more effective experiences
for our clients

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.210
than we were able
to do before.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.310
STEFAN HAUK: My advice would be
that you should try to keep

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.880
your team small, focus on what
you can do best, and leave the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.560
operational aspects to the
people who know how to do

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.590
that, in that case, the Google
Cloud Platform team.
