00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
&gt;&gt; One of the major problems that we have
is that as global citizens,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:13.400
we have the wrong values.
As global citizens, we have the wrong systems.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.290
And we have the wrong -- or rather inappropriate
institutions.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.590
And as our core business and our agenda for
the next ten years should

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.230
be about rethinking our values, should be
about redesigning our

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.660
systems, should be about rebuilding our institutions.
And if we are successful, one very innovative

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.190
product, one very
innovative development is if we can come up

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.920
with a new global
governance system, where there's total buy-in

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.300
and ownership by all the
countries of the world, and this new global

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.640
governing system cannot be
business as usual.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.730
It mean we need to rethink, redesign, and
rebuild the United Nations.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.680
We need to rethink, redesign, and rebuild
the IMF, the World Bank-type

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.880
institutions, to do away with those institutions
and to craft new ones.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.220
You can not solve new problems by using old
solutions.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.310
Or rather you cannot solve a problem by using
the tools or instruments

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.490
that led to the creation of those problems.
So hence, in the next ten years our target

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.670
should be to say how do we
accept that global challenges are interdependent.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.270
Now do we accept that global challenges are
interconnected and nations

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.650
today are more interdependent than than independent.
How do we come up with the position that says

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.860
you can resolve the
challenges of climate change in America or

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.040
Europe without addressing
them in Africa?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.910
You can't address HIV and AIDS, poverty in
Africa without making sure

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.710
there is involvement and participation by
all global players.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.750
In other words, all global challenges must
be addressed in a global

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.640
manner, meaning global solutions for global
problems.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.590
And also, we must make sure in this global
governance system, Africans

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.410
become players.
Africans are sick and tired of being consumers

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.040
of knowledge.
Africans are sick and tired of being at the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.690
receiving end of ideas.
We must make sure Africans and those from

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.010
poor countries are
participants in the crafting of the solutions.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.370
For example, as we address the global financial
crisis, where is the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.860
African input?
Where is the additional of Asia? Of India?

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.720
We must make sure that we don't resort back
to economic nationalism

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.750
where America is looking after America where
Europe is doing the same.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.330
We must sit down as global citizens and be
able to craft truly global

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.240
governance system where there's buy-in and
ownership by the generality

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.019
of the global community.
And this should be a major innovation if we

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.460
achieve it, in the next ten
years.
