Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So the last video I uploaded was

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
about helping an orphanage and trying to motivate you to help me build

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
this orphanage, but it's pretty clear that I messed that up.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.090
So, I've flown over to England, I'm meeting with a friend of mine, and I'm hoping that his

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.110
personal appeal to you will get you over that hump, and help you help me.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.160
- Hi everyone. I hope some of you have seen Destin's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.190
video in which he was helping out those orphans in Peru, building their septic

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.200
tank, helping out with the orphanage, it's really amazing. Destin's always been a great help

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.220
to me, in fact he recently helped me gild the windows here on my

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.250
house.
[laughs]

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.290
Destin, it took him days, only a few days, and I think he did a great job, just like

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.320
he did for those people in Peru. Now you probably saw the video he put up a day or two

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.350
ago where he's asking for help, he's wanting you to help give to those people in Peru.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.360
Just like he gave to me when he helped do up my house. A lot of people didn't

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.400
respond to Destin's original video. I guess it probably wasn't clear exactly what he

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.420
did and how awesome it was. He really wants your help, so read the video description

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.450
below, if you want to help out with a real good cause, not just gilding my windows,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.510
but a really good cause in Peru, go and have a look at what he's done, read a bit about

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.550
it and vote, because he really needs your help, and it really is, seriously, I mean we joke around

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.560
I mean.. He didn't really gild my windows I did most of that myself but..
[laugh]

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
We're joking around a lot here, but seriously he's done an amazing thing, and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.590
I think it'd be really great to help him out so, so check it out.
 - So, to be more clear

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.610
this is what I need. First of all, there's something called the Project for Awesome, I need you to vote

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.620
for the Operation Leverage video for Project for Awesome.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.670
If it gets the most votes, we get more money for the orphanage. It's important. Please vote, have your

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.690
friends vote. Second of all, please consider donating because this money is going

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.690
directly to an orphanage in Peru. It's a big deal, it's important.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.720
I'm Destin, thank you very much. Here's some out-takes from what we did in Peru.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.730
Have a good one. OK this is the coolest engineering

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.750
meeting I've ever had. We are here in..

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.770
We are in Peru, and we are talking about the septic system that we are

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.800
about to build for the orphanage, and we are eating monkey.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.840
[sawing]

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.860
OK here's a perfect example of a lever in use here. We're trying to break the forms down.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.870
[Spanish]

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.920
And no matter how hard we hit these things, we can't get them loose.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.940
So we're putting a lot of force into it.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.970
and it's not working, but when we use a lever, we're able to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.010
pull them out easily. So I made fun of the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.050
concrete bag hat, but it actually works really well.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.080
He makes this fashionable. This is the captain. We call this Captain Morgan right?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.130
Very good.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.170
Alright today's fish is better than yesterday's. It's called losaya

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.210
dosaya? don saya.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.250
Looks like some kind of shovel nosed catfish. OK so the whole

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.290
point of Not Forgotten is to try to break the cycle of abandonment. It's gonna take

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.330
all of us working on this puzzle together if we're gonna fix it. Please help.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.340
[laughing]
[Spanish]

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.360
