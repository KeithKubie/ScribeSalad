the future really is one of the major

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370
the future really is one of the major
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.730
the future really is one of the major
solutions for our future water challenge

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
solutions for our future water challenge
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.459
solutions for our future water challenge
is going to be reuse of water and you

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
is going to be reuse of water and you
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.900
is going to be reuse of water and you
know there's often a negative

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
know there's often a negative
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180
know there's often a negative
connotation to that people think Oh

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
connotation to that people think Oh
 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.010
connotation to that people think Oh
toilet to tap we've heard a flush to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
toilet to tap we've heard a flush to
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.350
toilet to tap we've heard a flush to
brush shower to flower so a lot of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360
brush shower to flower so a lot of
 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.230
brush shower to flower so a lot of
different thoughts but really the beauty

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
different thoughts but really the beauty
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.090
different thoughts but really the beauty
of wastewater reuse is we can actually

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
of wastewater reuse is we can actually
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.910
of wastewater reuse is we can actually
purify that wastewater way beyond the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
purify that wastewater way beyond the
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160
purify that wastewater way beyond the
quality needed for for drinking water in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
quality needed for for drinking water in
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.230
quality needed for for drinking water in
fact it's a nice consistent high quality

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
fact it's a nice consistent high quality
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.509
fact it's a nice consistent high quality
water no people don't have much issue

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519
water no people don't have much issue
 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.160
water no people don't have much issue
with desalination to be able to take

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
with desalination to be able to take
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.689
with desalination to be able to take
seawater and make drinking water and

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699
seawater and make drinking water and
 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.460
seawater and make drinking water and
actually waste water is much easier to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470
actually waste water is much easier to
 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.430
actually waste water is much easier to
treat and then seawater but independent

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
treat and then seawater but independent
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.579
treat and then seawater but independent
of that that negative reaction to

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589
of that that negative reaction to
 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.500
of that that negative reaction to
wastewater reuse if you think about it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
wastewater reuse if you think about it
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180
wastewater reuse if you think about it
ninety percent of the world's water is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
ninety percent of the world's water is
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310
ninety percent of the world's water is
not used for human consumption or for

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
not used for human consumption or for
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.020
not used for human consumption or for
domestic use so we've got a great

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030
domestic use so we've got a great
 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.030
domestic use so we've got a great
opportunity to treat and reuse our

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040
opportunity to treat and reuse our
 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.149
opportunity to treat and reuse our
wastewater for agricultural irrigation

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159
wastewater for agricultural irrigation
 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.759
wastewater for agricultural irrigation
for industrial uses for a lot of other

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769
for industrial uses for a lot of other
 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.350
for industrial uses for a lot of other
uses before we ever get to the point

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360
uses before we ever get to the point
 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.060
uses before we ever get to the point
where we have to use it for you know

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
where we have to use it for you know
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000
where we have to use it for you know
direct potable water reuse so today we

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
direct potable water reuse so today we
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130
direct potable water reuse so today we
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950
see a lot of adaptation of reuse water
to take the load off of streams and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
to take the load off of streams and
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.959
to take the load off of streams and
rivers and freshwater supplies to be

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969
rivers and freshwater supplies to be
 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.210
rivers and freshwater supplies to be
used in industrial plants

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070
related to water reuse is this idea of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
related to water reuse is this idea of
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780
related to water reuse is this idea of
waste to value how you take a waste

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
waste to value how you take a waste
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.430
waste to value how you take a waste
stream don't look at that as a as a

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440
stream don't look at that as a as a
 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.170
stream don't look at that as a as a
liability anymore there's a lot of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
liability anymore there's a lot of
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850
liability anymore there's a lot of
goodies in your in waste water for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
goodies in your in waste water for
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830
goodies in your in waste water for
instance in a municipal wastewater

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
instance in a municipal wastewater
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780
instance in a municipal wastewater
system tremendous amount of carbon

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
system tremendous amount of carbon
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490
system tremendous amount of carbon
content which you can convert to energy

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
content which you can convert to energy
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170
content which you can convert to energy
so this idea of having a wastewater

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
so this idea of having a wastewater
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420
so this idea of having a wastewater
plant that is that is carbon neutral or

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
plant that is that is carbon neutral or
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700
plant that is that is carbon neutral or
actually generates you know more power

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
actually generates you know more power
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530
actually generates you know more power
than it consumes of tremendous

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
than it consumes of tremendous
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.380
than it consumes of tremendous
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.660
opportunity phosphorus is a dwindling
resource globally yet there's a lot of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
resource globally yet there's a lot of
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310
resource globally yet there's a lot of
phosphorus and waste streams so there's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
phosphorus and waste streams so there's
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.750
phosphorus and waste streams so there's
some cool technologies coming out

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760
some cool technologies coming out
 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.070
some cool technologies coming out
they're going to be able to selectively

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080
they're going to be able to selectively
 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.530
they're going to be able to selectively
remove things like phosphate or metals

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
remove things like phosphate or metals
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.810
remove things like phosphate or metals
like copper from a waste stream and be

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
like copper from a waste stream and be
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.640
like copper from a waste stream and be
able to process those into a finished

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650
able to process those into a finished
 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.740
able to process those into a finished
product so we need to stop thinking

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
product so we need to stop thinking
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.170
product so we need to stop thinking
about a wastewater stream as as pure

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
about a wastewater stream as as pure
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.420
about a wastewater stream as as pure
waste and look at that as a as an asset

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
waste and look at that as a as an asset
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219
waste and look at that as a as an asset
not unlike we've been looking at you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
not unlike we've been looking at you
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.570
not unlike we've been looking at you
know if you think about recycled

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
know if you think about recycled
 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.310
know if you think about recycled
aluminum and plastic and all that used

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
aluminum and plastic and all that used
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350
aluminum and plastic and all that used
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690
to be a pure waste stream that's now raw
material for for other processes so

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
material for for other processes so
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.210
material for for other processes so
wastewater in the future will be a raw

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
wastewater in the future will be a raw
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.750
wastewater in the future will be a raw
material for many processes
