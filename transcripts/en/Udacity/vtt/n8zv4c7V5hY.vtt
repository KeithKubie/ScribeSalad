I think we've covered most of the big things. Is there anything that you guys kind of working on now?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have this queue system still and a lot of the actions, like doing a vote,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
when you actually hit the APIN point, all it does is insert an item into the queue

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and doesn't do any work on it and that happens in the background.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If one of the database is going slow and it's taking too long to write, it doesn't affect the user.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we use that for a lot of stuff now, and we're trying to move more towards that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The queuing architecture is nice. &gt;&gt;Yes. &gt;&gt;And you're using AMQP? &gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And, we're using RabbitMQ when I left.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I remember just as I was leaving, I remember going this is a really nice architecture.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They should do more of this, so I'm glad to see that that's working out.
