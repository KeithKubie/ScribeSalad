00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.130
 In the previous video on Nefron we talked about the 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.690
 The different parts of the nephron and how (as I think) the molecules 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.750
 Re-absorbed in the body and different parts 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.890
 In (as you remember) the nearby winding pipes 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.250
 We also talked about glucose, amino acids and sodium 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.230
 Re-absorbed 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.500
 We talked about the rising part of Henle 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.110
 We talked about salts such as sodium, potassium, chloride and chlorine 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.460
 Which are re-absorbed 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 In the far-flung tubes 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.220
 Including calcium and other molecules 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.860
 But at least in my mind when I first studied it, I wondered 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.580
 How does that happen? 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.760
 How we actively pump those particles out, especially 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.370
 Against their concentration? 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.170
 What I want to do in this video is to dig deeper 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.770
 In what exactly happens on the boundaries 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 Those tubes allow those ions to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.520
 It is selectively moved outside the cavity or inside 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.760
 Those pipes or 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.410
 Recycled from leachate 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.570
 This technique (logically) is similar in 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 The different parts of the Nefron but to take a look 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.930
 On each part separately because each part absorbs 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.170
 Different types of molecules 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.790
 I will not classify all the molecules but only 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.890
 I will give you a brief about it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.320
 Let's start with the nearby anibles here 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 Let us, for example, enlarge that part 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.260
 So let me draw the inner part of the nephron 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.780
 The inner part of the nephron can 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.370
 That sounds like this 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.460
 If this part is internal 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.400
 This is the liquid leachate here specifically 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 In fact, let me paint it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.890
 A little different from that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.105
 If the inner part, I will draw it so because 

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.840
 The nearby anipoles have those small adhesive parts 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.340
 Sometimes it is called brush border 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.300
 If here is the inner part this is the cavity 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.090
 Here is where the liquid is leachate 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.400
 The glomerular leachate comes in this direction 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.810
 So, you can imagine the inner part of the Nephron 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.280
 And then the wall of the built-in anode 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.330
 Pack of cells 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.790
 So there can be a cell here and this is another cell here 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.750
 That is another cell 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.866
 To illustrate, this is a cross-section 

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.160
 It will actually be cylindrical 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.410
 It will look like this somehow 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.870
 This is only to illustrate the idea 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.410
 Here is another cell 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 The base part may be precisely here 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 When we say basal we can imagine it 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 Represents the cell rule 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.910
 Those are good words to know words 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.960
 If the cellular part is facing the cavity or 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.930
 Facing the inner part of the nape is called b 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.180
 The holy side 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.420
 Thus this segment usually refers to the lateral basal segment 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
 Or this membrane that I referred to as a membrane 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.450
 The basal membrane will be lateral 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.800
 This is true regardless of which part of the nephrons we are 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.030
 Either in the nearby anibilis or in the Henle class 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.020
 Or even in remote anibodies 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.040
 What we have here, and the other aspects of these cells 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.900
 Here we have bristles surrounding the tubes 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.850
 This is also a distinctive word 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.630
 If the capillaries around the tubules look something like this 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.230
 In fact cells are also 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.020
 Instead of drawing the cells I will draw them only 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.350
 And as a kind of pipe I will paint it like this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.940
 They are full of pores 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.740
 There is blood flowing from here 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.915
 There is blood here 

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:44.290
 this too 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.870
 I will not explain too much detail to cells 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.930
 Capillaries 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.790
 I really want to explain how molecules move 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.400
 Outside the cavity and how it is reclaimed 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.650
 Selectively 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.450
 So here we find the capillaries around Annibiba 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.980
 Again the word is distinct but peri means 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.460
 About like a perimeter 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.940
 If the pipes are surrounded 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.480
 These filaments surround the tubes 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.430
 If we focus on this picture we will find 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.140
 The capillaries surround all the tubes 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.810
 So when the material is excreted or re-absorbed outside 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.089
 Nephrons, they flow with blood inside those capillaries 

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.630
 If this membrane is encapsulated tubules 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.970
 Which is close here 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.540
 Let's example see what happens to glucose 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.750
 What really happens here is because of the sodium and potassium pumps 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.520
 On the lateral basal portion of those cells 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.040
 This sodium and potassium pump 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.370
 I will draw one here specifically 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.730
 You can watch your private video 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.600
 With sodium and potassium pumps 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.250
 I have a complete video to explain how it works 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.890
 But the idea here is that sodium can be painted here 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.810
 As positive particles that will join the inner part 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.240
 Here specifically, the ATP molecules will come 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.150
 When ATP molecules enter the right part of the protein 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.880
 The shape and shape of the protein will change 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.310
 The protein will close this side here and open that side 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.680
 In this form and form can not manage sodium 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.010
 Of a longer period of protein-related bonding and separation 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.090
 Outside or passing through the lateral basal membrane 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.140
 And finally goes to the blood 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.360
 And then on the other side a sodium and potassium pump 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.810
 When they are somewhat open I will draw them here 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.780
 I also have a full video on this point 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.320
 Where potassium tends to bind 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.080
 So potassium tends to bind to it 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.710
 Linked to it in this area, for example 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.580
 This is just a simple and general explanation 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.000
 What happens makes the protein change its formation 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.600
 ATP consumption is not required at this point, and then returns 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.620
 For this formation, and therefore will not be able to potassium 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.870
 Of protein-related resistance is released due to 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.860
 Change the shape of the protein 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.860
 If the general idea here: sodium is related 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.090
 The ATP molecules are linked 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.490
 The phosphate group is separated 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.830
 This causes the protein to change 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.910
 Now sodium needs to be released and potassium is to be released 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.870
 To link 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.380
 When the potassium is linked we return to the original state 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.310
 The final result is that our sodium has been 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.580
 We pump it out of the cell and we also have potassium 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.100
 Pump it into the cell and this is called active transport 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.200
 Why Transport (active)? 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.160
 Because ATP has been consumed to transport sodium opposite 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.990
 Concentrate to keep sodium out of the cell 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.030
 And then the potassium moves to enter the cell you can almost 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.920
 imagine that 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.950
 No ATP consumption is required 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.850
 This is why the pump is usually called the sodium and potassium pump ATPase 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.630
 The enzyme ATPase is a protein or enzyme responsible 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.520
 About ATP cracking 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.080
 ATP breaks and uses the resulting energy to change 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.320
 The pump is pumped into the sodium and the potassium inside 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.520
 Well, for all, it's all a review of what we learned 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.560
 In previous videos, but how can this help us? for example 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.020
 To remove the glucose from the cavity 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.370
 Well, what we have here is a bunch of other proteins 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.250
 We will take only the example of glucose 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.760
 Let's say we have a protein here 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.280
 There is a general term for that protein 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.620
 A co transporter or a symporter 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.110
 This means that the protein transmits two types of molecules 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.790
 same direction 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.580
 co transporter means that one of the particles tends to move 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.850
 Because of gradient difference in focus while segment 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.710
 The other somewhat moves in its 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.270
 So you can imagine, that the sodium was pumped out 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.460
 So here we pump sodium out on the part 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.890
 Basal lateralization, a decrease in concentration will occur 

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.140
 Sodium is here 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.925
 The greater the pumping out, the lower the concentration 

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:58.490
 Finally, sodium concentration will decrease 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.130
 For its concentration in the cavity 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.150
 If the gradient in the concentration of sodium in the absence 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.950
 Membrane here, sodium will need to pass through it 

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.600
 To compensate for the lack of sodium concentration here 

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.190
 The sodium will pass through it if there is no barrier 

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.990
 These cells exploit the need for sodium 

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.430
 To move in the direction of gradient in its concentration 

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.990
 (Which resulted from the active transport here) but is exploited 

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.930
 The energy resulting from the transition of sodium to the direction of low concentration 

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:30.560
 To move some particles 

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.140
 Glucose in this case, for example 

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.059
 So if you imagine that you can imagine a protein 

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.160
 On the membrane here 

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.250
 They may bleed so 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.780
 This helps you to imagine 

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.090
 You may have more sodium on this side than there is 

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.350
 On that side, so sodium tends to link here 

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.130
 Glucose may be linked here 

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.950
 This is just a simplification, but when linked 

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:05.220
 This protein changes its shape to be more like 

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.200
 So when they are connected, now sodium becomes 

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.620
 Here and glucose becomes here 

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.685
 Now we are inside the cell, and 

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:18.190
 In this morphology, do not tend to link strongly 

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.990
 Amino acids or anything else in the protein and then 

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.020
 They are free 

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.360
 When released, the protein will change 

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.190
 It will revert to what it was here and we can repeat this cycle 

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.970
 Again and so on 

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.940
 But all this is conditioned by the principle of higher concentration 

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.250
 Sodium is here to be pumped to this point until it is allowed to 

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.190
 Interaction occurs 

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.260
 So sodium moves in the direction of gradient concentration 

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.670
 It takes glucose in its 

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.020
 Of course, glucose concentration will increase 

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.500
 Here, and then can glucose 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.310
 The passage through the follicles will finally move the glucose 

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.250
 (If it rises sufficiently) will move in a direction 

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.000
 Graduation in the concentration in the direction of blood 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.520
 The same process completely occurs or maybe not quite 

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.240
 With glucose but through all nephrons 

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.390
 If we go to the Henle class to the rising part specifically 

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.180
 Here, where we try to get the salts out of 

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.875
 Picture, we will find the same idea 

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.660
 Let's assume that the cavity is located here 

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:22.510
 This is a cell which is a cavity construction unit 

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.500
 We are now inside the Henle class and you have 

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.330
 Sodium and Potassium Pump Here 

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.230
 You have sodium that is pumped out 

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.120
 Potassium was pumped into the inside but in fact 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.900
 Potassium channels are few, so sometimes potassium can be low 

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.560
 To return in the other direction 

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.840
 So what happens to 

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.390
 Potassium is not important 

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.730
 But since sodium concentration is less here 

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:51.520
 So we have here sympators as we had in case 

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.210
 Glucose, but in this case sodium needs to enter 

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.240
 It was also in the case of glucose but here we try 

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.950
 Transfer of chlorine and potassium ions 

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.680
 So here's what will happen 

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.520
 Where sodium will be used 

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.790
 In the direction of its concentration 

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:08.240
 It will become our potassium and we will become 

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.670
 Chlorine ions 

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.930
 So the symporter here is called 

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.160
 sodium-potassium-chlorine co transporter 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.020
 This is the second diversity found in 

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.250
 The ascending part of Henle 

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.380
 So the US will end up with lots of chlorine ions 

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.270
 Here, in fact (potassium enters from both directions) but 

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.410
 As long as this is porous for chlorine, then this 

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.300
 The concentration has risen sufficiently to turn the chlorine 

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.590
 To exit and help to form the area of ​​the spinal cord 

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.460
 The higher the sodium salts 

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.240
 The same thing in the far-flung tubules 

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440
 Where calcium is found 

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.750
 It's a bit different 

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.320
 So if we were in the far-flung annealed tubes, that kind 

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.690
 Of the villi, those adhesives are only found in 

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.590
 Close bends 

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.250
 But there, as you know that idea where we were 

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.910
 We use the gradient in concentration (resulting from 

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.120
 Some types of active transport) in the transfer of other materials 

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.220
 This is called secondary active transport 

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.190
 It's good to know 

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.870
 Let's end up in the far-flung tubes 

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.560
 If this is the cavity 

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.130
 Suppose that the cavity here is specifically so we have 

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.860
 Cells on both sides 

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.340
 I think you understand the general idea 

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.330
 This remote part is a bit different so let's say 

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.570
 This is a cell, let's assume that this is a bloody ritual surrounding 

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.400
 By the tube here 

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.430
 This is blood 

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.070
 What we have here is again 

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:38.400
 Sodium has been pumped out 

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.920
 Sodium and potassium pump 

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.860
 I have a whole video talking about it and if potassium is pumped inside 

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.880
 So you end up with a lot of sodium here 

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.650
 Membrane membrane facing cavity 

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.880
 Porous for calcium 

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.340
 Whatever the concentration of calcium here 

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.590
 Will be here 

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.910
 So you may have calcium 

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.040
 These calcium ions are scattered in the ocean 

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.020
 Here specifically, there is Antiporter 

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.640
 If sodium concentration in the blood will become 

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.150
 Higher due to continued pumping out 

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.390
 The sodium will therefore move towards its concentration 

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.070
 He goes back inside 

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.490
 Here you may have some sodium moving towards its low concentration 

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.830
 So he will come back inside again and so 

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.120
 You can most likely imagine it as a genre 

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.540
 From the rotary doors, the calcium is pushed out 

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.760
 You can visualize how your protein can be 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.250
 To do so 

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.700
 I can imagine it as a rotten kebab 

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.400
 Sodium makes the door spin 

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.960
 And calcium p the other part of the door 

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.330
 To drive him out 

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.110
 If this is called an antiporter it is transmitted 

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.850
 In different directions but again he moved active 

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.400
 Secondary, because the only way this interaction occurs 

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.360
 Conditioned by the presence of an active transport that consumes ATP resulting from the release of sodium 

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.660
 Outside the lateral basal membrane in each of these cases 

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.590
 Whatever, I hope it is useful 

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.370
 It contains a lot of unusual detail 

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.990
 Nephrons normally pump material out of the cavity 

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.940
 In the direction of the capillaries around the tubes but for me, so make 

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.020
 Things are more specific 

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.950
 He really helped me to understand 

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.200
 What are the Nephrons in particular
