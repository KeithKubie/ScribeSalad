00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.920
Are you experiencing a sudden numbness or
weakness on one side of your face, arm, or

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
leg?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.090
How about sudden and inexplicable trouble
walking, talking, or understanding speech?

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.970
You may be having a stroke.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.800
Hello everyone!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.960
Crystal here for DNews ready to talk about
one of the medical emergencies that scares

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.099
me the most.

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.099
Stroke.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.109
A “stroke” can occur at anytime to anyone,
and there are two types that can happen.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.130
The most common is when a clot in your blood
vessels blocks the flow of blood to the brain,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.600
but strokes can also happen when internal
bleeding in or around the brain creates swelling

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.340
and pressure, compressing and damaging brain
tissue..

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.460
Strokes often result in permanent impairments
such as paralysis, loss of sensory function,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.540
problems thinking, speaking, or even regulating
emotions, and they are a leading cause of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.180
long term disability.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.930
According to the CDC, almost 130,000 people
in the US die each year from strokes.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.030
Besides muscle weakness and trouble walking,
talking and understanding speech, other symptoms

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.750
can include loss of balance, disorientation,
and difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.490
So what should you do if you or someone near
you is experiencing the symptoms?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.649
Call 911 and get medical attention immediately.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.500
Studies show that receiving treatment within
3 hours can significantly reduce the severity

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.240
of damage and disability.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.799
The longer the brain is starved of oxygen
and nutrients, though, the greater the damage

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.020
that occurs.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.340
Currently treatments used by medical professionals
can prevent additional damage from occurring,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.369
but they can’t heal the brain.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.670
Brain injury is a difficult problem for scientists
because unlike damage to the skin or other

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.759
organs, the brain does not simply regenerate.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.990
Most neuronal cell damage is permanent and
that’s what makes conditions like concussion

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.590
and strokes so scary.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.100
But researchers say there may be a little
hope -- from stem cells.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.740
Stem cells are a type of cell that have the
ability to “differentiate”, or change,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.009
into a specialized set of cells that belong
to specific tissue like skin, bone, or brain.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.619
In a recent paper published in the journal
Nature Medicine, scientists from University

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.490
of Southern California took a look at a specific
protein in the blood, called activated protein

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.509
C. They found that a special type of the protein
tells human neuronal stem cells to change

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.619
into functional neurons.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.130
To determine if this could regenerate lost
brain function in stroke patients, researchers

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.140
tested mice that had suffered stroke.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.290
They wanted to see if the mice could recover
lost function when treated with human stem

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.210
cells and this special signaling protein.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.340
And the cool thing is, it worked.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.310
Not only did the protein help with survival
and growth of the neuronal stem cells, but

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.000
the new cells helped the mice better perform
diagnostic motor and sensory motor tasks like

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.770
walking on a beam and removing an annoying
piece of tape from the bottom of their foot.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.480
Even cooler, the mice weren’t treated until
seven whole days after their strokes -- which,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.660
if you remember, is significantly longer than
the three hours we currently think of as the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.560
critical window for treatment.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.620
Now you can argue that healing mice isn’t
necessarily the medical breakthrough we need

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.030
for human brain injury, but it's a meaningful
step.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.280
And this therapy is currently in clinical
trials, so it may be that soon we will be

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.620
able to offer stroke patients improvements
to lost function after days or weeks.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.310
I think we will all agree that the best case
scenario for strokes is to not have one.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.720
Strokes are linked to heart disease and diabetes,
so the best thing we can all do to avoid a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.590
stroke of bad luck is continue the healthy
behaviors we know we should be doing anyway:

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.290
stop smoking, eat healthful, nutrient rich
foods, avoid high sugar and high fat in your

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
diet, and exercise.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.950
That’s easy, you’re all totally doing
that anyway, you’ve got nothing to worry

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.080
about, you’ll be fine.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.690
If you’re really into health issues and
have tips for staying healthy, why not set

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570
up a website to talk about them.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.850
