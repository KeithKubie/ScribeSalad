SERGIO CUCINELLA:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.830
My name is Sergio
Cucinella, and I'm

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.550
a software engineer at the
Android team at Truecaller.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.340
Today I'll talk about
how to build applications

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.710
for the fast growing markets.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.650
But before that, allow me to
give you a brief introduction

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.990
about Truecaller.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.760
It is a Swedish start-up
headquartered in Stockholm.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.650
And we have three main products.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.480
Truecaller-- it's
an application that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.790
allows you to discover in
real time who is calling you,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.230
even if you don't have the
number in your phone book.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.710
It blocks calls from the
top spammers of your region,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.520
and it allows you to
always have access

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.689
to the right information,
people, and businesses

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.140
when you need them.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.670
Truedialer-- it's a
phone application.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.700
It enriches your call history
with pictures and names

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.854
when they are missing.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.270
And it also allows
you to discover

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.260
who you are going to
call before performing

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.792
the call itself in case the
number is not in your phone

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:47.600
book.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.532
And finally, Truemessenger--
it is a messaging application

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.365
that allows you to
discover in real time who

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.010
is sending you messages.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.350
And it automatically
blocks and filters spam

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.050
so that your inbox is
always safe and clean.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.000
But back to the
topic-- I'm going

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.989
to give you a brief introduction
about the emerging markets,

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.350
and then how to create
great experiences for them,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.234
and finally, how the
definition of "free"

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:11.150
can be a little bit
different in those places.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.470
So when companies
and entrepreneurs

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.310
want to launch new
products, they usually

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.260
think about the west markets,
so North America and the Western

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.060
Europe.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.590
And those have a fairly big
amount of potential users.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800
In fact, at the
end of 2014, there

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.650
were 163 million smartphone
users in the United States

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.310
and 197 million in
the Western Europe.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.970
And this amount of
users is growing,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.480
but in sort of a moderate way.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.760
What we tend to underestimate
is the potential

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.890
that all of the other
markets, actually,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.010
can have on our distribution.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.270
As we can see here, in
China, at the end of 2014,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.260
there were a 522 million
smartphone users,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.550
in India 270 million, and in
the MENA region 122 million.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.400
And we also need to remember
that the next billion

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.729
internet users are coming
from those regions.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.860
So they are definitely going to
keep experiencing a huge growth

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.450
in terms of users.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030
It is extremely easy
to build great products

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.520
with our brand-new,
high-end devices that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.050
have almost unlimited data
plans on very fast LTE networks.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.830
And we tend to forget
sometimes what's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.980
the norm in emerging markets.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.390
So when it comes to devices,
they are usually dual SIM.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.560
The screens are not very big.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.710
The resolutions
are not very high.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.650
And even the new devices are CPU
and memory constrained-- well,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590
relatively constrained.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.110
And not everyone can afford
new smartphones, of course.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.860
So there are many
users that actually

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.216
buy secondhand devices that are
even more CPU memory and GPU

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:00.716
constrained.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.710
And most likely,
they are not running

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.350
the latest version of Android.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.160
And maybe they are not even
going to get any update.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.750
When it comes to data, they
usually have prepaid plans.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.990
They are not very cheap.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.320
So the users use the
connectivity only

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.560
when it's extremely needed.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.330
And if we think that
the smartphone might

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.580
be the only entry
point to internet,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.360
then it's obvious that they
really care about data usage.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.880
And finally, networks--
they are slow.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.710
3Gs now a norm.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.620
And they are congested.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.090
Even Wi-Fi is slow, because
it's based on slow landline

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.850
connections.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.230
And it's not always available.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.250
So how do we build great
experience for those markets?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.200
Well as I said, we cannot
rely on an always on internet

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.050
connectivity.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.610
And this means that
we need to enable

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.050
the users to open and
at least partially

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.720
use the application
when they're offline.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.060
This means that we have to build
some sort or caching layer.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.460
But as I said, the devices
are memory constrained.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.170
So when we do
that, we definitely

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.190
need to keep in mind
that the cache should

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.470
be proportionate to the
amount of memory that

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.680
is available on the device.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.260
It is a good idea to bundle
mdpi and ldpi resources.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.750
Maybe xxx-hdpi are not
fundamental for those markets.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.780
We definitely need to keep in
mind the image download size.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.050
Because that dominates the
data usage of an application.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.290
So we should try to download
the thumbnail and the preview

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.570
images and to postpone
as much as possible

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.500
the download of a
full-sized image.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.060
And when we do that,
we actually need

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.130
to ensure that the
full-sized image is

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.690
displayable on the device.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.000
Because it might
be simply too big.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.450
And of course,
prescaling-- it is cheaper

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.820
to do it on the server side.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.140
So let's not do
it on the devices,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.085
especially when they're
CPU and GPU constrained.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.255
And on top of that, so since
they are not really powerful,

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:15.430
the devices, we
should definitely

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.464
consider the animation
and the transition

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:19.880
that really makes
sense and that's

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.170
important for the product.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.200
Because in the end,
it's better to provide

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.770
a simple but smooth
interface rather

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.380
than a pretty but laggy one.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.010
And finally, localization--
we definitely

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.470
should strive to provide
a native experience.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.500
So invest in localization
and in translations.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.430
And now the
definition of "free"--

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.090
if we look at these
three applications,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.050
we can see that there are all
freely downloadable on the Play

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.570
Store.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.290
But what users from the
emerging markets also look at

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.880
is the application size.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.300
So as an example,
a user in India,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.640
by looking at this
application, he

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.180
would recognize that
downloading through Caller

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.440
costs roughly 2 euro
cents, while downloading

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.820
LinkedIn costs almost
four times more that.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.150
And as I said, the users
have prepaid data plans.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.430
So the size is
extremely important.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.360
So size matters.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.830
We should do anything
possible for making sure

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.310
that the application size
is as tiny as possible.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.260
Localizations are
great for experience.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.570
But at the same time, they
require quite some space.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.130
And this means that we should
bundle only the localization

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.490
that's really critical
for our business

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.590
and to make sure that all the
unsupported localization are

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.170
removed.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.050
Because they might be bundling
libraries that we are using.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.220
Definitely also we should
remove all the unused resources.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.950
There are some tools
that can help us

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.430
with that, like string
resources, and also lint.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.960
We should take advantage
of tinting and color

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.630
filtering so that
we can reuse icons.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.070
And we definitely need to
optimise our images and maybe

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.810
experiment with
other image formats.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.900
Use ProGuard for
compressing the application

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.000
as much as possible.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.730
And finally, third party
libraries-- they are great.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.320
Because they allow
us not to reinvent

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.970
the wheel every single time.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.160
But at the same time, they
might take some space.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.790
Therefore, we should
keep an eye on them.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.240
And also it's good to remember
that Google Play services can

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.490
be imported modularly.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.080
So we should definitely
take advantage of that.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.160
I hope that this
presentation gave you

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.930
a general idea on
how to optimize

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.570
your products for
emerging markets,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.310
and that if you are
not already doing it,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.927
you will start considering it.

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:55.760
Thank you very much.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.560
