I think plants present an opportunity
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.650
I think plants present an opportunity
for people to look closely at something

for people to look closely at something
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.109
for people to look closely at something
and get invested in something that's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
and get invested in something that's
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.590
and get invested in something that's
truly very much outside of themselves

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600
 
 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.230
 
plants are not like us and the more you

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
plants are not like us and the more you
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.310
plants are not like us and the more you
study plants the more different and deep

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
study plants the more different and deep
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.740

ways you see that they are not like us
all the important things that we do from

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520
all the important things that we do from
 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.150
all the important things that we do from
how we move around to how we reproduce

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
how we move around to how we reproduce
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.619
how we move around to how we reproduce
to how we react to the Sun any human

activity you could point to you're gonna

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
activity you could point to you're gonna
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.150
activity you could point to you're gonna
see something very different in plants

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
see something very different in plants
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.060
see something very different in plants
and the more you know about how plants

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
and the more you know about how plants
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590
and the more you know about how plants
function and the more you watch them

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
function and the more you watch them
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.469
function and the more you watch them
function and test their functioning the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
function and test their functioning the
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.170
function and test their functioning the
more deeply you understand how different

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
more deeply you understand how different
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.950
more deeply you understand how different
they are

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
they are

I think that's useful because I think
people have a need to transcend

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
people have a need to transcend
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.399
people have a need to transcend
themselves and I know that when I get

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
themselves and I know that when I get
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.929
themselves and I know that when I get

conflicts between men and women and
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.240
conflicts between men and women and
money problems and science and all this

money problems and science and all this
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450
money problems and science and all this
kind of thing that I can take some

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
kind of thing that I can take some
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.260
kind of thing that I can take some

seemed like very small-scale human noise
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.350
seemed like very small-scale human noise
and look at the differences in a life

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
and look at the differences in a life
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.230
and look at the differences in a life

the planet for four hundred million
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.410
the planet for four hundred million
years so quite frankly I get a lot of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
years so quite frankly I get a lot of
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.010
years so quite frankly I get a lot of
joy and comfort and happiness from

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
joy and comfort and happiness from
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139
joy and comfort and happiness from
considering these things I mean I think

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
considering these things I mean I think
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.420
considering these things I mean I think
that's the main reason to do science is

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
that's the main reason to do science is
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.170
that's the main reason to do science is
that it feeds the soul I think that and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
that it feeds the soul I think that and
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290
that it feeds the soul I think that and
I see this in students year after year

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
I see this in students year after year
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.750
I see this in students year after year
that the more you know about the world

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
that the more you know about the world
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.880
that the more you know about the world
the more you feel like you're part

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
the more you feel like you're part
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.140
the more you feel like you're part
and it's it's like nothing else

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
and it's it's like nothing else
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.620
and it's it's like nothing else
you know you teach somebody not to just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
you know you teach somebody not to just
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.570
you know you teach somebody not to just
walk by a tree but to look up at it and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
walk by a tree but to look up at it and
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.550
walk by a tree but to look up at it and
say yep that one's deciduous and that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
say yep that one's deciduous and that
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.150
say yep that one's deciduous and that
one's evergreen and that one is gonna

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
one's evergreen and that one is gonna
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.360
one's evergreen and that one is gonna
lose its leaves this fall but that one's

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
lose its leaves this fall but that one's
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.020
lose its leaves this fall but that one's
going to stay green just very basic

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
going to stay green just very basic
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.060
going to stay green just very basic
things like that and you see people

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070
things like that and you see people
 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.420
things like that and you see people
sense of self and self esteem rise and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
sense of self and self esteem rise and
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.390
sense of self and self esteem rise and
all of a sudden they know something

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
all of a sudden they know something
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.980
all of a sudden they know something
about the world that they journey

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990
about the world that they journey
 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.990
about the world that they journey
through and it makes them a little bit

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
through and it makes them a little bit
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.890
through and it makes them a little bit
bigger as a person and that's really a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900
bigger as a person and that's really a
 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.170
bigger as a person and that's really a
wonderful thing to watch in students and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
wonderful thing to watch in students and
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.590
wonderful thing to watch in students and
to be able to facilitate so I think we

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
to be able to facilitate so I think we
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.410
to be able to facilitate so I think we
should plant trees not to save trees I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
should plant trees not to save trees I
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.930
should plant trees not to save trees I
think planning a tree is not unlikely to

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
think planning a tree is not unlikely to
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.240
think planning a tree is not unlikely to
be a method you use to save yourself and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
be a method you use to save yourself and
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.340
be a method you use to save yourself and
to find a meaning in something that will

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350
to find a meaning in something that will
 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.910
to find a meaning in something that will
be with you and grow with you and be

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
be with you and grow with you and be
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.470
be with you and grow with you and be
something you can come back to and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480
something you can come back to and
 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.750
something you can come back to and
contrast your own life with I'm very

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
contrast your own life with I'm very
 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.290
contrast your own life with I'm very
influenced by some research that came

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300
influenced by some research that came
 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.130
influenced by some research that came
out I think in the 80s that compared

retention during learning and I remember

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870
retention during learning and I remember
 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990
retention during learning and I remember
very strongly that the main result of

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
very strongly that the main result of
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.390
very strongly that the main result of
that was the the larger the number of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
that was the the larger the number of
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.750
that was the the larger the number of
senses that you invoked if you were

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760
senses that you invoked if you were
 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.160
senses that you invoked if you were
touching something if you were writing

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
touching something if you were writing
 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.449
touching something if you were writing
and listening and watching and even

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
and listening and watching and even
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.240
and listening and watching and even
smelling something or tasty you know the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
smelling something or tasty you know the
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460
smelling something or tasty you know the
more senses that you could engage during

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470
more senses that you could engage during
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.009
more senses that you could engage during
learning the more effectively that

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019
learning the more effectively that
 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.140
learning the more effectively that
information was integrated into the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
information was integrated into the
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.740
information was integrated into the
person and learned I think with digital

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
person and learned I think with digital
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.990
person and learned I think with digital
media were very very strongly going

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
media were very very strongly going
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.880
media were very very strongly going
towards a medium that is visual only I

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890
towards a medium that is visual only I
 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.219

mean you do hear the message etc but I

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229
mean you do hear the message etc but I
 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.650
mean you do hear the message etc but I
worry that it's a

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660
worry that it's a
 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.050
worry that it's a
massive stance just in terms of using

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060
massive stance just in terms of using
 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.950
massive stance just in terms of using
the five senses and that you can't learn

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960
the five senses and that you can't learn
 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.890
the five senses and that you can't learn
passively I think the best learning is

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900
passively I think the best learning is
 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.810
passively I think the best learning is
done with active manipulation and we

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820
done with active manipulation and we
 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.670
done with active manipulation and we
need to be able to work with our hands

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680
need to be able to work with our hands
 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.760
need to be able to work with our hands
you know it's not just about using our

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770
you know it's not just about using our
 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.110
you know it's not just about using our
brains I mean eventually we have to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120
brains I mean eventually we have to
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.060
brains I mean eventually we have to
manipulate the world with our hands in

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070
manipulate the world with our hands in
 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.070
manipulate the world with our hands in
order to make tangible change right and

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080
order to make tangible change right and
 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.390
order to make tangible change right and
students need practice with that kids

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400
students need practice with that kids
 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.160
students need practice with that kids
need practice with that we need to do

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170
need practice with that we need to do
 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.330
need practice with that we need to do
that in life and for better or worse you

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340
that in life and for better or worse you
 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.280
that in life and for better or worse you
know our screen experiences will never

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290
know our screen experiences will never
 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.880
know our screen experiences will never
never give us that it's very important

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890
never give us that it's very important
 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.830
never give us that it's very important
to put children in a environment where
