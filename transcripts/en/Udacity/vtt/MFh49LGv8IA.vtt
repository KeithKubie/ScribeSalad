00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now for the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What we need is an input in which quotes are contained within the tag.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For instance, this could be an input like less than,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
double quote, double quote, and greater than.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we go through the program, we would see that tag would be set,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
then quote would be set, then quote would be unset,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then tag would be unset.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The output would be empty, and therefore would not contain any HTML markup.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Note, though, that this line would be executed

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and therefore also appear in the coverage.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And then we can simply say that execution of this line

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
directly is related to passing or failing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So when given an arbitrary program, it is unlikely

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that we will find lines that are only executed when the program fails.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And anyway, such lines would be found by the 1st test that executes them.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And we are pretty good at testing, aren't we?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What we want to look for are lines that statistically correlate with failure.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That is, they may occasionally pass,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but by and large, they more frequently fail than pass.
