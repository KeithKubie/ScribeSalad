JORDAN METZL: Thank you, and
good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:07.820
It's a pleasure to be back.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.820
This is actually
my third time down,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.200
and today's talk
is about running,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.966
and so this is kind
of a stacked audience.

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.840
Last time I was here,
I talked about the book

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.390
before this one, which was
on the medicine of exercise

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.170
called "The Exercise Cure."

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.740
And in that talk, we had
plenty of people of all stripes

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.650
that worked down here.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.250
This new book is
all about running,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.034
and so I'm guessing--
raise your hand if you run.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:36.950
That's what I thought.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.450
All right.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.800
Love to see it.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.630
So today I'm going to talk to
you really from three vantage

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.350
points, and when I see
patients in my office,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.290
when I do anything in
terms of education,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.530
when I teach my fitness classes,
and when I do things myself,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.810
I'm really always operating
from three vantage points

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.185
simultaneously,
and I think those

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:59.766
are very helpful for me in what
I do in all aspects of this.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.640
So my three vantage
points are, first of all,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.890
as a sports medicine doctor.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.730
So as a sports
medicine doctor, I'm

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.290
actively involved in
taking care of patients

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.514
and hopefully getting them
better and getting them active

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:12.930
and getting them
out there moving.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.290
And in my office, any
time, it could be anybody

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.270
from like an
eight-year-old gymnast to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.134
and 82-year-old lady who's
going to the marathon.

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:23.550
And the commonality between
everybody that comes to see me

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.540
is they all want to
move and be active,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.870
and my job is to help
them be active and move.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.380
And through so much of
what you guys do down here,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.180
I've been able to use
technology, I think hopefully,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.870
to make their lives better in
terms of thinking about getting

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.890
my message out not in the
one-on-one doctor-patient way,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.900
but in the kind
of mass use, which

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.910
I'll talk about at the
end in some of the newer

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.330
stuff I've been doing.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.830
So number two perspective
is as an athlete.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.755
This year I did my 33rd
marathon up in Boston,

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:56.130
and I'm training
for the Iron Man

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.950
up in Lake Placid this
year, which I do every year,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.560
but this will be
number 13 of those.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880
And I say that, because I
think everybody in this room

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.970
needs a fitness goal.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.720
Now hopefully it's not
doing the Iron Man,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.680
which is kind of a bit
of an extreme type deal.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.150
Anybody ever done
an Iron Man in here?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.730
Oh, good.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.930
Good job, man.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.880
So it's a 2.4 mile swim, a
112 mile bike ride, and then

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.600
a marathon which
is a little cray,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.060
but the nice thing about
that is that it really

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.290
is a great goal every
year, and it keeps you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.810
from probably doing other
stuff you shouldn't be doing.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.680
So it's great to give a
goal, and as an athlete,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.100
I love the idea of giving
myself a goal that's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.990
a little bit outside my
comfort zone every single year,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.649
and that's the Iron Man for me.

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:40.690
And then number three is
as a fitness instructor.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.276
So about four years ago, you'll
see at the end of this talk,

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:45.650
I started a fitness series
called Iron Strength, which is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.440
free, community-based fitness.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.990
I started with about 25 people.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.327
This is now a class of
not only many thousands

00:02:52.327 --> 00:02:54.410
locally here that come do
these different classes,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.140
but we did a whole series
of runnersworld.com online,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900
and so my workout's
been done now

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.860
by about 10 million
people around the world.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.640
And it's been great to
kind of teach runners

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.450
how to make their body stronger
so they don't get hurt.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.900
And so that's the
last perspective

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.500
is as a fitness instructor,
I'm actively involved now.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.700
I'm going to send out after
this lecture, and on my website

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.100
here, you can see under the Iron
Strength calendar, the workouts

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.650
that I do.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.608
The next one is actually
just around the corner

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:25.460
on Tuesday evening.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.090
It's a big free workout at 6:30
down on Pier 25 literally right

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.590
out the door near here.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.160
With the beautiful
weather, there's

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.750
nothing better than doing some
sunset burpees on the Hudson

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.960
River while I kick your butt
in a very meaningful way,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.110
so I hope you guys can come
out and check that out.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.640
I'll send around the
flier as well afterwards.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.360
So it's with those three
perspectives as a doctor,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.285
as an athlete, and as
a fitness instructor,

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:49.910
I really approach
all the things that I

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.860
do in terms of trying
to educate athletes

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.980
about how to take better
care of their bodies,

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.540
how to be injury
free when possible,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.780
and how to basically
stay out of my office

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.610
and stay off doing
what they're doing.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.290
And so with all that, I'm going
to talk about running strong,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.790
and in the end,
I'll talk about some

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.840
of the new tech features, which
were really exciting to me.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.250
And I've had a bunch
of you guys come up

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.800
as patients at different
times, and as I've

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.500
been working through this,
and I showed some of you guys

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.930
this in the infancy
before it came out

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.300
and then when it was published.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.380
And it always makes
me so happy when

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.290
I see a Googler who comes
up, and I show them this,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.460
and they're like, wow.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.020
That's cool.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020
That makes me feel like
I'm onto something here,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.210
because if you guys think it's
cool, then I know it's cool.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.040
So we're going to
talk this morning

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.050
about how you're going to become
the best runner you can be.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.090
And guys in the back, there's
some videos we'll play,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.410
and I'll kind of call
those out as we go forth.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.180
So first of all, let's
talk about what's

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.302
going to make you the
healthiest runner you can be.

00:04:50.302 --> 00:04:51.760
And for those
sitting on the sides,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.480
if you guys want
to-- I just don't

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.270
want you to come in with a
twisted neck in my office.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.150
It may be tough to see
the screen that way.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.460
So when you want
to run, my thought

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.810
is from my doctor perspective,
how do we-- that's a good idea.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.500
Way to turn your chair.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.930
So how do we think about
keeping you as a healthy runner?

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.710
And so first of
all, I think part

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.510
of that is identifying what
kind of runner you are.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.590
Number two is I want
to talk then about some

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.465
of the different injury
patterns we're seeing

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.450
and some of the different
uses of a kind of injury

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.870
mechanical screening and
biomechanical analysis

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.430
we're doing down
at the hospital.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.880
And then lastly, talk about
preventive strategies as we

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.990
go forth thinking about the keys
to becoming a healthy runner,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.640
because from my
perspective, whether or not

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.010
you win the New York City
Marathon, which chances are

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.990
nobody in this room is actually
going to win the marathon,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.800
but maybe you are,
but I doubt it.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.300
But from my
perspective, the key is

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.840
I want you running because
as a sports medicine doctor,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.970
and as a doctor in
general, I deeply

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.959
believe that the
best medicine we have

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.250
is the medicine of exercising,
getting people out there

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.600
to take every day
is so important,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.340
and I'm really dedicated
to getting people

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.964
to do that and have really
been actively involved

00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:05.130
in getting that message out.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.160
We just started at Cornell this
year a second year med student

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.030
curriculum on teaching exercise
as medicine to the second year

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.640
med students, because
unfortunately, most health care

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.450
professionals have no idea
how to prescribe exercise,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.300
yet this is the most readily
available drug we have,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.910
which is not only fully
efficacious and safe,

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.010
but anybody can take it at
any age, and it always works.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.507
And that's a pretty great
drug, and it's free.

00:06:28.507 --> 00:06:30.340
So teaching people how
to take that medicine

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.810
and think about
it in those terms

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.655
is a lot about what I've
been interested in doing.

00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:36.780
And then finally, we'll
talk about off to the races

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.324
and what you can do to basically
build your own training plans,

00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:41.990
and I'll talk through
some of the things

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.170
in "Running Strong," the new
book with Runner's World.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.410
So basically thinking about
running is nothing new,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.590
and this is pretty much
the oldest sport we have.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.750
And so for those of
you in need of a run,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.890
you're part of a long
lineage of runners

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.470
from many, many hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.730
We've been running since we've
been walking, essentially,

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.310
and it's a big piece
of what has been

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.387
depicted throughout history.

00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:07.970
Now there have been
different attempts

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.610
to look at what makes the
healthiest and most efficacious

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.400
way to run.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.130
And people have tried
throughout history

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.210
to figure out what's the
most anatomically perfect,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.290
what's the fastest, what's
the most injury free,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.300
and this is nothing really new.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.970
I think the thing I'm
really excited about is

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.372
the interface between the
world that you guys live in

00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:30.830
and the world that
I live in, and I

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.204
think that's great
for everything

00:07:32.204 --> 00:07:34.230
from how much activity
somebody's doing

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.700
per day to what kind of
activity they're doing per day.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.202
And you guys are giving us
tools to evaluate what people

00:07:40.202 --> 00:07:42.410
are doing in a very different
way than we used to do,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.620
which is, I think, terrific.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.590
When we look at today's
running culture, more than 35

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.090
million runners.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.670
10 million run more
than 100 days per year.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.160
There were 137 people in the
first New York City Marathon

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.830
back in 1970.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.990
There were 47,000,
more than, in 2014.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.952
Who here has run the
New York Marathon?

00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:03.460
Good, so almost half the room.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.340
And great event, great thing
to think about one time

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.460
in your life, at least once in
your life as something to just

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.840
do as a bucket list.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.680
So sports medicine,
and as we have

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.484
dealt with this concept
of what running is

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:18.900
and what prevention looks like
has really evolved as well.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:23.310
So the first textbook on
running was back in 1975.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.270
And we've hopefully
come a long way

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.984
in terms of educating people
about how to do this healthily.

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:30.150
So let's kind of go through
some of these questions.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.929
First of all, what
kind of runner are you?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.020
And the answer is if I
look around this room,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.720
or this is actually last
year's class on Pier 25,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.960
so this is where
we're going to be.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.280
This is where we're going
to be on Tuesday night,

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.290
and if you look at this
picture here on the screen,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.760
you'll see people who are
running for different reasons.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.330
So down there on the
lower left hand corner,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.530
you'll see some people
in the neon green shirts.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.570
They are guides for a
couple of the runners

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.086
down in the corner who
are Achilles runners.

00:09:01.086 --> 00:09:02.960
So the two people, the
guy with the headband,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.520
and the woman just in
back of him in the white

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.350
are both blind runners who are
part of the Achilles program

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.657
who have guides, and Achilles
is a great organization

00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:13.490
which gets people with
physical disabilities

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.339
and gets them out and moving
and active and running

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:17.130
among other things.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.505
And so these people are
runners, because they

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:21.880
want to feel like they're part
of a community when it may

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.660
be tougher for them to do that.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.150
On the right hand side of
the lower part of the picture

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.119
are women from a great
organization that I'm

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:29.660
involved with called
Black Girls Run,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.780
and Black Girls Run
is an organization

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.340
which has really used
running to target members

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.640
of the African
American community, who

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.287
tend to want to be active
and don't have a ton of ways

00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:42.620
to do that or to think about
it and have really targeted

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.860
African American women.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.130
And so their organization
is all about getting women

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.800
out running in their community,
and they're great role models,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.039
and they bring tons of their
friends to our classes,

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.580
and they're running
because they want

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.965
to promote health and wellness.

00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:55.340
In the middle of
the picture, you

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.750
might see somebody who might be
a kind of a 235 or 240 marathon

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.496
who wants to get stronger,
so they can break their time.

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:03.620
And those people are running
because they're elite,

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.280
and they want to be super elite.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.390
And then in the
middle, you see people

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.990
who are kind of in their 60s
and 70s who may have arthritis,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.923
and they want to strength
train so their knees don't hurt

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:13.120
and they can keep moving.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.300
And so the answer is
that in this room,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.550
people are running for health.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.750
People are running
for weight loss.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.120
People are running for socials.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.660
People are running because
it makes them feel good.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.930
People are running because it
makes their brain work better.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.350
People are running
because they had

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.680
a parent who had heart
disease, and they don't

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.380
want to have heart disease.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.170
People are running for any
number of reasons in this room,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.490
and the answer is
they're all great.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.360
But the problem is
that when you come

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.240
to see me as a 255 runner
who wants to break 250

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.491
like our patient
here or so, or when

00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.990
you come to see me
as somebody who's

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.210
got arthritis in
your knees, and you

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.810
want to keep running when you're
70, the way we think about

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:47.550
you is different.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.200
And so there's not
a one size fits

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.930
all in terms of running
programs, training programs,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.430
running mechanics,
running, frequency.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.545
You really have to think about
the differences in your body

00:10:57.545 --> 00:10:59.420
when you make yourself
the healthiest runner,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.980
because everybody runs because
it makes them feel good,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.050
but I want you to keep running
for decades, for centuries.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.850
Now part of this discussion
begins with the body type

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.300
that you have, and everybody
has a different body.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.890
And so part of that in my
office is the endomorph,

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.650
who tends to basically
have a heavier body type,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.250
and no matter what they do,
they have a heavier body type.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.960
Now that person,
it's tougher for them

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.570
to run tons and tons of miles.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.819
Does that mean they can't?

00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:30.110
Absolutely not, but it means
we train them differently.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.440
They need much more strength
training, less high mileage

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.846
running, and really they
need to work actively

00:11:35.846 --> 00:11:37.470
on their short stride
high cadenced run

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.150
as I'll talk about in a second.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.180
The mesomorphs
have the best deal

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.810
in that they have bodies which
are applicable to anything.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.750
They can do any sport, and
they tend to build muscle.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.430
They tend to build
strength relatively easily.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.489
The ectomorphs tend not to build
muscle and strength no matter

00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:54.030
what they do.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.396
Those are the long, lanky people
who tend, whatever they do,

00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:59.770
they tend to get problems of
bone injuries, particularly.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.860
They tend to get a lot
of stress fractures.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.930
For those guys, much
like our endomorphs,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.980
we need to really
emphasize the strength.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.850
We need to diminish
the run volume,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.894
but knowing your run
body makes a difference,

00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:11.560
and it makes a
difference for any sport.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.280
When I see people in my office
of-- I have a number of people

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.580
I see that want to be dancers
at the School of American

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.150
Ballet, kids who don't have
proper turnout in their hips,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.070
or they don't have
great ballet feet,

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.797
or they don't have great laxity
to become great swimmers.

00:12:23.797 --> 00:12:24.630
Here's a great test.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.080
Everybody take your wrist.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.370
Bend your wrist
down just like I am.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.550
Take your thumb, and
push your thumb back

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.230
towards your radius bone.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.960
If anybody's thumb is
touching their radius bone

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.940
when they push, hold your
arm straight up in the air.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.255
So hold your arm if you're--
right there, there's one.

00:12:42.255 --> 00:12:44.130
Are you guys touching
in the back back there?

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.197
I can't see.

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:46.030
Don't hurt yourself.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.440
That's fine.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.890
So this guy's
definitely touching.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.980
Who else is touching?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.790
You in the front.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.854
What do you say?

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.520
Yeah, hold your arm
up there in the red.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.070
Is that touching?

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:53.694
No, you're not.

00:12:53.694 --> 00:12:54.285
Forget it.

00:12:54.285 --> 00:12:55.660
This guy, are you
touching, dude?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.711
Yeah, he is.

00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:57.210
Who else?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.100
Anybody else?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.340
Just one and two.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.300
These two guys and you two.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.700
Hold your arm up nice and tall.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.480
See, the middle section's
got it going on.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.430
Sorry, guys.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.830
So what these three
guys are is they

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.410
have the best body
type for swimming.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.020
Now you may be a bad swimmer.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.040
You may hate swimming.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.880
I can't control that, but
if you have good technique,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.597
and if you're
interested in swimming,

00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.180
you would naturally
be a good swimmer.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.680
Why?

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.821
Because every swimmer
does best when

00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:26.070
they streamline when they
get their arm all the way up

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:26.861
and all the way up.

00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:29.300
When you have
ligamentous laxity there,

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.090
it means you have generalized
ligamentous laxity.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.730
It means that you can streamline
much better than your friends,

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.112
and what that ends up meaning
is you're like a sardine.

00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:40.070
You can just go zipping
straight down the pool.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.250
So when we do kind of screening
tests of the US Olympic

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.840
swimming team, they all
have ligamentous laxity

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.512
as part of their body profile.

00:13:47.512 --> 00:13:49.720
So does that mean you're
going to be a great swimmer?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.094
No, maybe you hate swimming
and have no idea how to swim.

00:13:52.094 --> 00:13:54.840
But if you know how to
swim, if you love swimming,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.240
and if you put a lot of time
into swimming, the body type

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.810
you have favors
swimming, for example.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.420
And that's true with
any sport that I see.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.200
I see the biggest problems
when people try and say,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.070
listen, my person working
next to me here at Google,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.000
she runs 60, 70 miles a week.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.370
Why can't I run 70 miles a week?

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.578
And the answer is you may
have a very different body.

00:14:16.578 --> 00:14:18.540
And so what works for
her may not work for you,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.920
and when that happens, then
we start to see injuries.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.275
So picking the right body
for the right activity

00:14:23.275 --> 00:14:25.350
is important, and
this guy taught

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.660
us a lot about different
characteristics that

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.020
are favored by
whatever it is you do.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.410
So in any animal
species we see, there

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.620
are characteristics that
are favored for and favored

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.119
against.

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:38.720
And so certainly, there
are different pressures.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.660
But in general, I
always think about that,

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.770
and to me, the best
depiction of this

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.430
is in Japan, where every
year for some freaky reason,

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.974
they take their sumo wrestlers
and on national TV-- and guys

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:51.640
this is a video.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.473
You can just hit down
in the lower left hand

00:14:53.473 --> 00:14:55.530
corner of my screen
and get that started.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:01.149
There is-- is
somebody over there?

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:02.940
So just kind of move
the cursor over there,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.231
and you'll find a little video.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.230
Right there, yep.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.960
Just click on that.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.590
Back up one.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.270
There you go.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.870
So every year-- we'll
have a few of these,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.540
so just keep coming up.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.126
So every year, they
take their sumos,

00:15:21.126 --> 00:15:22.500
and they run them
down the middle

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.190
of the street on national TV,
and the reason this is helpful

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.900
is this guy is actually
one of the champion sumos.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.060
He's exceptionally
well-built for sumo.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.440
He's not exceptionally
well-built for sprinting.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.120
And so this kind of
graphic illustration

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.500
really helps kind of think
about body type for sport

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.250
now does that mean I couldn't
train him to run a marathon?

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.070
Absolutely not.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.444
He could run a
marathon probably,

00:15:47.444 --> 00:15:49.000
but it'd be a very
different training

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.520
program than somebody else.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.710
And so thinking about
that and thinking

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.220
that there's not a one size fits
all I think is very important.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.369
Now the truth is if you want
to do a marathon, you can.

00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:01.910
You look at some
celebrities, and you

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.450
think Oprah ran a marathon,
Will Farrell ran a marathon.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:07.950
You could definitely
run a marathon.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.560
It's just the way
we think about doing

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.540
that is very different
person to person.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.930
So how can I find out
what kind of runner I am,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.700
because I want you
running forever.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.380
And the answer is, how
often am I running?

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.430
How intense am I running?

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.226
Am I running super
intense, five days a week,

00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:24.850
Am I just going to
couple times a week?

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.750
Am I doing this, a
little bit, a lot bit?

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.890
If I had any injuries
before, that always plays in.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.389
Am I somebody who tore my ACL
when I was playing high school

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:34.840
soccer, and now I have
arthritis in my knee or my hip,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.440
and that changes how much
I can do and how I train.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.200
What are my running goals?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.930
There's a lot to
think about when

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.430
we think about picking the right
runner for the right sport.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.270
Now people interface with
me often when they're hurt.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.670
So they come in to see me,
and so what I'm trying to do

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.584
is trying to back up this
discussion before people

00:16:53.584 --> 00:16:55.750
get hurt, because unfortunately,
they always come in

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.590
to see me with their
injury, and then we

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.280
think about why it happened,
how we could prevent it,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.420
and I'm super into that.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.590
But on a bigger scale,
on the educational side,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.380
I'm more into keeping
people well rather

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.770
than waiting until they break.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.869
So when we think about
running injuries,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:13.494
there's a couple
things to think about.

00:17:13.494 --> 00:17:16.550
About a third of runners will
get hurt every year running.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.230
That's a pretty high number.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.270
Injury sites are
basically mostly

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.770
everything from the waist down.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.270
These are some of
the common things,

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.849
and you probably recognize
some of your friends

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.640
up there when I put
that list up there.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.973
Who here's had a running injury?

00:17:27.973 --> 00:17:29.615
Just let's see a show of hands.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.240
So that's at least
a third of the room.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.122
Looks like more
than half the room,

00:17:33.122 --> 00:17:35.340
and I guess that's
why you're here.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.100
And then knees are some of the
people, so the first timers who

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.770
tend not to have
as much knowledge,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.645
and they tend not to be
as strong tend to get

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.710
hurt much more frequently.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.470
Now walkers versus
runners, and the answer

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.890
is that when you walk, you put
70% to 80% of your body weight

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.890
across your skeleton,
so your back

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.520
your hips, your
knees, your ankles.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.400
When you run, you put about
300% of your body weight

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.990
across your backs, your knees,
your hips, and your ankles.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.320
So the exponential loading
for us, people are like, well,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.440
I've been walking forever,
and I never had shin splints.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.232
Now I'm running, and
I've got shin splints.

00:18:05.232 --> 00:18:05.731
Why?

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:07.690
The answer is when you're
putting three times

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.700
relative more body
weight across your shins,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.080
your ankles, your hips,
your knees, et cetera,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.970
so the ground reactive force--
the force between the ground

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.790
and your body--
increases exponentially,

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.160
and that puts much more load.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.750
So if your foot pronates
or rolls in a lot,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.070
and you're applying x amount
of force per gate cycle,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.810
and then you start running, and
you make that x times 3 or 4,

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.340
much more loading force.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.994
Hence bone is like, this sucks.

00:18:32.994 --> 00:18:33.910
It starts to get sore.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.730
You get a stress injury.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.271
You get a stress
fracture, and that's

00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:38.980
why those injuries
tend to happen.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.730
Now the key here is that
running is basically

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.691
a series of jumps from one
foot to the next in a series

00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.190
that we call
plyometric-based jumps.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.740
If you come to my
class on Tuesday,

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.180
you're going to be like,
dude, you're killing me.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.210
And I hate these plyometrics,
and the answer is great,

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.600
because running is a plyometric
from one leg to the next,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.380
and if you don't train
a plyometric activity

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.180
with plyometrics, you
end up getting hurt.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.850
So just running alone is not
going to get you strong enough

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.480
to run injury free.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.424
That's why I called the
book "Running Strong,"

00:19:10.424 --> 00:19:12.340
because I want people
to be stronger when they

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.790
run so they don't get hurt.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.930
So why do people get hurt?

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.850
And the answers are basically
a whole host of factors.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.810
And when I think about these,
and somebody comes to see me,

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.380
I think about these as the
intrinsic, meaning changes

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.244
happening outside the body.

00:19:28.244 --> 00:19:30.160
Extrinsic, changes
happening outside the body,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.030
and the intrinsic changes
from inside your body.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.800
And both these together,
these lists together

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.510
combine to create injury.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.070
Now everybody has a
different piece on this list,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.550
and these things can include
your training plan, what kind

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.920
of shoes you pick,
nutrition plays

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.850
a role on the extrinsic factor.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.960
What about inside your body?

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.610
What kind of body
type you have-- we

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.880
talked about that already.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.860
What kind of injuries
you've had in the past.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.850
Your stride is a huge piece,
stride mechanics, stride

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.920
cadence, stride frequency.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.160
We call vertical displacement,
which all relates

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.300
to ground reactive force.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.350
I'll show you what
that means in a second.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.510
Your brain, which is part
of your intrinsic thing.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.260
Are you like somebody
that's like running,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.885
and you keep a good
balance, or are you

00:20:11.885 --> 00:20:14.260
like, I must run 10 miles,
I must run 10 miles.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.890
Those people get hurt a lot.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.940
Does about kinetic chain issues?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.990
Are you taking good care
of your kinetic chain?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.489
Are you working on
your flexibility?

00:20:21.489 --> 00:20:24.530
Who here owns a foam roller?

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.680
All right, could see
some more hands there.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.030
And who hear does strength
training pretty regularly?

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.430
I can see some more hands there.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.060
So we've got all
runners in here,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.290
and again, these are some
of the things I think about.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.219
So all of these things
make a difference

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:39.260
when we think about this.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.150
So kinetic chain is a
combination of your strength

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.450
and flexibility.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.366
So I'll talk about all
these things for a sec.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.720
So extrinsic factors, things
happening outside your body--

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.200
so the typical person
that comes to see me

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.239
may be somebody who's doing
this a lot of the day, and then

00:20:54.239 --> 00:20:55.030
is like, all right.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.860
The New York Marathon
is in November.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.250
I got a number.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.616
Come September, October,
I'd better get training.

00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:02.240
I better start.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.115
I'm going to do this.

00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:04.420
And I can't tell you.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.950
Now I know my sample population
is biased, because they come

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.326
see me when they're
hurt, but dude, people

00:21:10.326 --> 00:21:12.450
come in to see me all the
training for the marathon

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.660
like two months ago.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.830
And it takes awhile,
especially if you're just

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:16.840
starting out to do this.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.710
And so I called this a violation
of the rules of toos, which

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.530
is kind of too much, too fast.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.786
And you end up ramping up your
training very, very quickly.

00:21:24.786 --> 00:21:26.160
Actually, the back
of the book, I

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.110
have a whole series of training
plans for every distance race

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.360
that go out about four months.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.401
And so if you're going to
train for the marathon,

00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:33.480
the time to start is now.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.950
This is the time to start
base building for the marathon

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.325
if you're not
doing that already.

00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:39.990
Slow and steady build,
and everybody's different.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.490
If you were a college
soccer player,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.450
and you're two years
out of college,

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.705
you're coming into this
with a much different base

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:48.994
than if you had three
kids, and you're like 45,

00:21:48.994 --> 00:21:51.160
and now you want to start
getting back into fitness.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.150
That's a different person,
and so you both can do it,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.730
but you've got to train
very differently to do it.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.260
There's not a one size fits
all, and certainly based fitness

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.440
is part of this discussion.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.510
So in the top here is a
choice which is probably

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.030
important in your life.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.460
But as a runner, dude,
the bottom choice

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.520
is probably, that's
probably more important.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.103
Like getting the
right pair of running

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:19.990
shoes is like a hugely
important choice in your life.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.480
So you want to make sure
that when you walk down

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.630
the aisle with
your running shoes,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.250
you make a good decision.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.150
Now what are some of the things
I see that people do wrong?

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.930
And the answer is
I like these ones.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.330
I like the color.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.460
I read about these.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.410
I read "Born to Run."

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.600
I want to be a
minimalist runner.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.740
Famous runners wear these shoes.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.250
These are some of
the common things

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.960
that you would be surprised
how often these factors lead

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.470
to decision making.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.960
And so the answer is that I
think that part of the issue

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.050
is that people feel
somewhat, have been made to

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.820
and feel somewhat insecure when
they walk into a running shoe

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.620
store.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.690
And so they're
looking to be led,

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.760
and they can be led by
somebody who's like,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.717
run on this treadmill,
and let's see what you do.

00:23:10.717 --> 00:23:12.550
The truth of the matter
is a different shoe,

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.620
different companies
carry different shoes,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.070
they have an interest in
promoting different shoes.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.480
And you can be very
easily swayed, I think,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.837
in that circumstance.

00:23:21.837 --> 00:23:23.670
So what I'm going to
tell you is that you've

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.810
got to trust yourself
when you go in there.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:27.930
If it feels supportive
and comfortable,

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.290
it's supportive and comfortable.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.420
If it feels not supportive
and not comfortable,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.169
it's not supportive,
it's not comfortable.

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:35.020
And running shoes
should be comfortable,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.370
and they should be
supportive, and I'll

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.052
talk about foot
mechanic in a second.

00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:40.760
But I want you to be
confident in saying,

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.010
I like how this feels, or I
don't like how this feels.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.310
And if you can try and take
out the top part of this,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.330
I mean, if they're
hideous, all right.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.730
Hideous you get a
pass on hideous.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:54.860
But otherwise, I think that
if you guys can try and think

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.000
about, listen, I'm here.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.100
I know it feels good.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.558
I want you to be confident in
that decision making process.

00:23:59.558 --> 00:24:01.050
I think it makes
a big difference.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.800
So how do I choose the
right running shoe?

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.760
Well, there's
different categories.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.700
There's racing flats.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.800
There's the typical
high mileage shoe.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.266
There are running spikes
if you're doing track,

00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:10.390
and there's a neutral shoe.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:13.380
There's a motion control, which
prevents you from rolling in.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.650
There's a minimalist shoe,
which anybody here running

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.990
in minimalist type shoes,
the very light, and that

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.625
encourages a high cadence
short stride run, which I love.

00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:23.250
I will make the
comment that you do not

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.292
need a minimalist shoe
to get the benefit

00:24:25.292 --> 00:24:26.250
from that cadence type.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.340
You can also do
that cadence type

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.430
and learn with short
mileage on a minimalist

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.280
and then transition
over, or I'm sure I'll

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.649
hear during the Q&amp;A, stories
of how people started.

00:24:34.649 --> 00:24:36.690
Maybe they got hurt, or
they loved it right away.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.190
It's always kind of interesting
to see how people got there.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.050
But the point is that
this is a process,

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.760
and as you kind of pick
the right pair of shoes,

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.420
I want you to be
confident in doing that.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.720
Now I'm going to show
you two videos here.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.270
If we can just play the
video on the lower left,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.946
and I want you to show
this person running,

00:24:54.946 --> 00:24:56.320
and I want you
look at these feet

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.486
when they hit the treadmill.

00:24:57.486 --> 00:25:00.160
Everybody see how this person
hits and rolls into the middle.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.170
Let's play that one more
time on the left, and that's

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.530
called late pronation.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.907
Hit, roll in, hit,
roll in, hit, roll in.

00:25:07.907 --> 00:25:08.990
Everybody see that person?

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.880
Now that may be
somebody that comes in

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.360
to see me with really bad
shin splints or very bad pain

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360
in the front of their
knee called runner's knee.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.460
And it all starts with
the feet, and so that

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.790
may be something that
we think about in terms

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.215
of correct their shoe.

00:25:23.215 --> 00:25:24.590
It may be somebody
where we think

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.548
about correcting something
with an arch support

00:25:26.548 --> 00:25:28.770
inside their shoe, maybe both.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.202
What I hope for is let's play
this person on the right.

00:25:31.202 --> 00:25:32.660
The person on the
right is somebody

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.316
who hits and pushes
pretty much straight off.

00:25:36.316 --> 00:25:38.440
Everybody see the difference
how that foot does not

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.550
roll in it all.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.470
And so that's a much more evenly
distributed force mechanic,

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.230
so people that get shin
splints when they run a lot,

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.450
tend to be rolling too much
like the person on the left.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.875
And so we want you to look
like the person on the right.

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:52.930
Ah, thanks, good artistic
license back there.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.610
I support that.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.690
And so you can see the person
on the left is rolling.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.980
The person on the right
is pretty much neutral,

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.020
and I want you to be close
to neutral if you can.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.732
Now there are a lot
of ways to get there,

00:26:03.732 --> 00:26:05.690
and there's not a one
size fits all Some people

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.100
like doing at their shoes
that have motion control.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.610
They prevent you from rolling.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.526
There are some people
who get an arch support,

00:26:11.526 --> 00:26:14.260
and I'm a big believer of
the $45-- on my website,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.020
and I left cards at
the back with my site.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.910
I've got links to
pretty much everything.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.790
The site I like
for arch supports

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.020
is the link called Sole.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.019
And these are basically
you order some orthotics

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:24.780
from Canada for like $45.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.930
You put them in the oven.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:27.410
You heat them, and
then you step in them,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.740
and they harden and mold to
your feet, and they work great.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.698
I have all of my patients
pretty much get those

00:26:31.698 --> 00:26:32.800
if they're rolling.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.912
And so I may put them in a
neutral shoe with an orthotic.

00:26:35.912 --> 00:26:37.620
If they need like the
whole heavy hitter,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.890
I put them in a motion
control shoe with an orthotic.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.080
Not everybody needs that.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.390
That's a lot of motion control.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.220
The point is I want
you to look closer

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.511
to the runner on the right
than the runner on the left,

00:26:46.511 --> 00:26:48.670
if possible.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.220
Now lastly on the
extrinsic nutrition,

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.729
now this is a whole
talk in and of itself.

00:26:53.729 --> 00:26:56.020
What are some of the common
things that we think about?

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.280
Well, there's certainly
nutrition during training.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.950
You may have seen a very
interesting blog post yesterday

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.030
on the New York Times site
asking the question, in order

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.380
to lose weight, is it better
to exercise or not eat as much?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.110
And the answer is basically
that it's much easier

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.800
to lose weight, if losing
weight's you're only goal,

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.670
by diet than by exercise.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.650
But the problem is that
that doesn't give you

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:18.320
the health benefits.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.778
So I'd much rather
people be mildly

00:27:19.778 --> 00:27:21.400
to moderately
overweight and active

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.900
than very skinny and inactive.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.500
The health benefits come with
activity, not with body type

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.510
at all.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.380
That being said,
how you eat and how

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.106
you trained her when
you eat, changes

00:27:31.106 --> 00:27:32.980
when you start training
for endurance events.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.927
And so certainly, when you
have a higher appetite,

00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:38.260
and when you eat-- we want
you eating within a half hour

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.430
at the end of your workout to
replenish your muscle glycogen

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.304
stores-- we think about
how to optimize nutrition,

00:27:45.304 --> 00:27:47.220
and there's certainly
nutrition during events.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.781
And we see a lot of questions
in the office about muscle

00:27:49.781 --> 00:27:50.280
cramping.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.490
I tackle some of that as well.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.380
Low sodium, which can lead
to muscle strain and muscle

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.700
injury and a lot of
cramps, and there's a lot

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.430
now on trying to prevent muscle
cramping through good sodium

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.690
pre-sodium, so pretzels
and salty foods

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.400
before you run endurance events.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.639
Some salty foods during
events make a big difference,

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:10.430
and different people
have different amounts

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.250
of sodium in their sweat.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.209
So everybody in here
sweats a different amount,

00:28:14.209 --> 00:28:16.333
and they sweat a different
concentration of sodium.

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:18.060
So if you're somebody
who tends to cramp,

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.609
most likely you're
a big salt loser,

00:28:19.609 --> 00:28:21.900
and we want you to try and
replenish your sodium stores

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.730
before and during exercise
with anything salty.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.350
My tennis players, by the
way, love dill pickle juice.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.100
It's by far the most readily
available and absorbable sodium

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.600
source.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.170
It works great for muscle
cramping and prevention.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.740
But it kind of-- dill pickle
juice, so that's the problem.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.250
All right.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.833
Let's talk about
changes in your body.

00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:44.340
So changes in your body--
we've talked about changes

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.090
outside your body.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.340
What about in your body can
make you a healthy runner?

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.400
And the answer is that there's
the mind, and there's the body.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.970
And these are some of
the things in the mind.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.780
When the body comes in,
genetics, attention to injury

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.560
form, and kinetic chain.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.320
So let's talk about the mind.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.160
Now I will tell you
that I think that if it

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.140
doesn't hurt a little bit,
you're not doing it right.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.880
It should not be fully
comfortable all the time,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.527
and I mean that both
physically and mentally.

00:29:15.527 --> 00:29:17.610
If you're not pushing
yourself-- I'm not a sadist,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.107
I don't think--
but if you're not

00:29:20.107 --> 00:29:22.440
getting a little bit of pain,
you're not getting better.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.820
And so I think the concept of
no pain, no gain is helpful.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.300
But there's healthy pain,
and there's unhealthy pain.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.677
And the answer is healthy
pain is pain, and I'm done,

00:29:32.677 --> 00:29:33.510
and it's not horrid.

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.540
Unhealthy pain is
like I'm limping down

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.790
the hall, because I did a run.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:40.510
So generally, unhealthy
pain changes your mechanic

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.010
of movement.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.940
If you're getting that, you've
got to get it checked out.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.000
But in general,
training, when you train,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.375
we want you to
train-- certainly,

00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.750
part of your training should
be mental toughness as well.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.160
And I do think it has to
be a bit uncomfortable.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.785
I think there's a whole process
of training for an event, which

00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:58.630
is kind of callousing
your mind, which

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.490
is as important as callousing
your body to some of the things

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.532
you'll run into when you
do an endurance event.

00:30:03.532 --> 00:30:05.490
And I think mental skills
training carries over

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.900
to all aspects of life, and
I think that those are all

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.169
important things.

00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:11.210
Now in the body type, I've
already made the point

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.660
that the kind of body
you have and [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.560
your body anthropomorphics,
your skeleton, your foot type,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.600
your knee-- is there
arthritis in your knee--

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.144
your hip, what your hip is built
like, how much rotation you

00:30:22.144 --> 00:30:24.310
have in your hip, how much
arthritis is in your hip,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.850
your back.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.950
Do you have a herniated disc in
your back, which means we have

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.380
to train you a bit differently.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.500
There's so many factors
that people deal with,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.460
and my hope is to make everybody
educated in how to kind of make

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.880
themselves the most efficient
and injury free runner

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.390
on their own, because you could
spend your entire life going

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.744
to physical therapy and massage
therapy, whatever, and I want

00:30:44.744 --> 00:30:46.160
you guys to be--
I want you really

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.076
learn how to do most of
this stuff on your own

00:30:48.076 --> 00:30:48.990
when possible.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.490
This is somebody
who's got arthritis

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.531
underneath their kneecap.

00:30:51.531 --> 00:30:53.360
That's a picture of a kneecap.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.770
There should be a space
underneath that kneecap.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.540
Unfortunately, on the
outside part of the picture,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.252
the kneecap is literally sitting
right against the femur bone,

00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:03.085
so that somebody's got
an arthritic knee who

00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:04.782
wants to run, and
the answer is that we

00:31:04.782 --> 00:31:06.740
do things like strengthening
and whatever else,

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.114
and we are now
trying things like

00:31:08.114 --> 00:31:11.700
these injectables synthetic
lubricant shots like WD-40

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.520
for their knee that
we put into their knee

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.230
to help them so they can move.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.300
Because again, it may
just be their knee,

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.670
but if they're not taking
the medicine and exercise,

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.170
it's affecting their
blood pressure,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.400
their psyche, their
heart, they're everything.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.620
So life gets worse when
you can't move for sure,

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.480
so I want them to
be able to move.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.870
Now the knee is the most
commonly injured body part.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.870
It's kind of trapped between
the hip and the ground,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.730
and so we want to think
about the factors that

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.200
cause knee pain, including
factors happening

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.570
from the ground up, factors
happening from the hip down,

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.240
and really address
both of those.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.790
Same thing with
things like tendons.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.609
An Achilles tendon.

00:31:44.609 --> 00:31:46.900
This is somebody coming in
to see me with a chronically

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.392
achy Achilles tendon.

00:31:48.392 --> 00:31:49.600
They had Achilles tendinitis.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.269
They didn't try and fix it,
didn't pay attention over time,

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:53.810
the tendons started
to thicken, so it

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.650
goes from what's
called tendinitis

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:56.960
to what's called tendinosis.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.290
It gets very, very thick
and chronically injured,

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.090
so on this person,
we ended up doing

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.590
after nothing else
worked, something

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.180
called a PRP, where we
took blood from their arm,

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.910
spun it down, took
their own platelets,

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.050
and injected it into the
tendon to get it to heal,

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.350
and it worked great.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.164
The idea is I want you
try and prevent this

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:14.330
from getting to that point,
but injuries can show up

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.490
in any different place.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.840
Also in bone, people who
don't pay good attention

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.890
to their injury symptoms
end up with things

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.500
like stress fractures, where
the bone on the right hand side

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.440
is starting to crack,
because they're not

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440
listening to their body.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.540
So pain that changes your
mechanic of activity,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.640
get it checked out.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.750
That's important.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.510
Now what about running mechanic?

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.990
Is there a perfect way to run?

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.220
And the answer is that everybody
runs a little bit differently,

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.750
but there are
certainly some things

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.730
which make healthier
runners, including

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.290
we know that high cadence, short
stride runners are hurt less.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.210
We know that runners
that bounce less

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.000
are hurt less, less
vertical displacement.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.592
They don't pop up
in the air as much,

00:32:50.592 --> 00:32:51.800
and those things are related.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.600
When you have a short
stride, high cadence,

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.400
you're not popping up
as much, and you have

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.524
less ground reactive voice.

00:32:56.524 --> 00:32:58.387
You're not crashing
into the ground as much.

00:32:58.387 --> 00:33:00.220
I get the question all
the time-- treadmills

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:04.580
versus outside versus
asphalt versus dirt,

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.920
and the answer is
there's no answer.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.690
Whatever is most
comfortable for you,

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.140
and we'll get you into
that mechanic that I want,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.077
I'm cool with.

00:33:13.077 --> 00:33:15.660
So what are the things that we
think about when somebody comes

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.260
in for their running stride?

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.190
And again, I want people to kind
of start reading about this,

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.630
thinking about it,
learning about it.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.130
How much height you have-- are
you popping up in the ground?

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.720
Your stride speed,
your stride length.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.280
When you think I
want to run faster,

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.880
I don't want you think I'm
going to stretch out my legs as

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.080
long as I possibly can.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.320
I want you to think I want
to increase my turnover.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.710
Your stride angle as
well as your cadence,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:46.020
which should be about 160 or
so per minute or 80 per side,

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.270
so your left foot should hit
the ground about 80 times

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:48.900
per minute.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.360
So what are some
ways to do that?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.170
You can just look at your watch
and give yourself a minute,

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.420
and see how many times your
left foot hits the ground.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.170
Or there's some great new apps.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.860
A great app I love
called Spring Moves

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.443
is an app where you
can basically pick

00:34:01.443 --> 00:34:03.140
a song that's cadence-based.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.720
So you say, I want to run 160 or
150, they'll pick music for you

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.490
in that range.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.949
Or Spotify came out a couple
weeks ago with a running app,

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.080
where on Spotify, the reason
I think this is going to be,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.010
from my perspective,
not as good,

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.350
is that if you're
like a 150 runner,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.139
it'll pick music
that's 150 for you.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.870
The problem is your
cadence isn't quick enough,

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.342
and now you're listening to
music, which is basically

00:34:26.342 --> 00:34:27.550
consistent with that cadence.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.612
And so you're just going
to run the same pace,

00:34:30.612 --> 00:34:32.070
because you're not
being encouraged

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.278
to quicken that a little bit.

00:34:33.278 --> 00:34:36.550
So I like the idea setting
cadence like a metronome to try

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.964
and basically quick
up how you move.

00:34:38.964 --> 00:34:40.630
What are the
characteristics of somebody

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.921
that's a very efficient runner?

00:34:41.921 --> 00:34:43.830
Well, they basically
have a short stride.

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.239
They tend to run without
wiggling all over the place.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.449
They have a very limited
arm swing straight ahead,

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.920
not crossing over
their body as much.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.719
They don't have as much very
smooth, relaxed upper body

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.530
motion, and they don't
pop up and down as much.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.540
They're pretty stable from--
if you're ever out looking

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.780
at the leaders of a race
like the marathon, the people

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.270
close to the front, they are
not popping up very much.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.090
They're pretty quiet
from the waist up.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:10.610
They look like
nothing's happening.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.610
All the action is happening
from the waist down,

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.380
and that's a good,
efficient runner.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.790
Now gait cycle is basically
how we measure gait,

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.040
and that's from your
right foot leaves

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.520
to your right foot comes
back to that same position,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.777
and when one foot
hits the ground

00:35:24.777 --> 00:35:26.610
to when the same foot
hits the ground again,

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.570
it's called your gait cycle.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.403
So we start to look at
some of these things,

00:35:29.403 --> 00:35:33.070
and some of the factors that
control how shock is absorbed

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.162
in your gait cycle include how
much ankle motion you have,

00:35:36.162 --> 00:35:38.120
how much flexion of your
hip and knee you have.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.119
And again, if you have
an arthritic knee or hip,

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:42.020
it can affect how
much flexion you have,

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.211
which can affect how
you absorb stress.

00:35:44.211 --> 00:35:45.710
Now that I'll talk
about in a second

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.502
is something which is
changeable somewhat,

00:35:47.502 --> 00:35:48.960
but it may not be
fully changeable.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.020
So we think about
everything we can

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.320
do to try and make you
the best version of you

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.140
you can, but at the end of
the day, you're still you.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.880
So we have to make you
the best you you can be.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.190
That's Y-O-U, not
E-W-E, by the way.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.360
So eccentric muscle force,
how strong your muscles are.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.900
Again, stronger muscles
produce less loading force

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.860
on knees and hips
and backs, and so

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.540
if somebody has like
a herniated disc,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.012
and they see me, and like,
dude, I can never run again,

00:36:14.012 --> 00:36:14.720
the answer is no.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.178
We're going to strengthen the
heck out of your core muscles

00:36:17.178 --> 00:36:19.492
that will unload that back
and allow you to do more,

00:36:19.492 --> 00:36:21.450
and hopefully, that alone
is all we have to do,

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.420
which it often is the
case for many patients

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.350
as well as cartilage.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.220
Your cartilage is also
helpful to help absorb stress

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.920
from the road.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.600
Now had a couple
minimalist runners here,

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.820
and I think a lot of this
research on minimalist running

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.130
has come historically in Africa,
where many of the great runners

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:39.940
come from.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.920
There is basically a
whole push, and there

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.555
was kind of going back
to what people did,

00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:45.680
which was barefoot running.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.350
And that's where this whole
concept of minimalist running

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:49.830
came from, which is from
whole groups of people

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:53.764
who don't wear shoes at all or
wear tire treads or nothing.

00:36:53.764 --> 00:36:55.430
So let's play this
video, and I want you

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.350
to watch where this guy lands.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.990
So this is an African runner,
and look at where he lands.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.270
He hits on the outside
part of his foot.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.789
His foot absorbs the
stress of the ground,

00:37:05.789 --> 00:37:07.330
and you'll see it
widen a little bit.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:11.950
And I want you look at the
angle between his knee, his hip,

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.140
and his body as he pushes
through that run mechanic.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.449
So he's basically running with
a relatively short stride.

00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:20.115
He's a sprinter.

00:37:20.115 --> 00:37:22.420
A relatively short
stride, but when

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.730
you look when he
hits the ground,

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.930
he's basically
lining up exactly.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.060
Good job in the back there.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.630
He's lining up exactly his
foot, his knee, and his hip.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.170
His foot is basically almost
directly underneath him

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.930
when he maximally loads that.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:40.039
Now for my minimalist
guys and gals in here,

00:37:40.039 --> 00:37:41.830
you're doing that
already, because the shoe

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.954
type you're wearing, which
is why it feels so good,

00:37:43.954 --> 00:37:47.145
is basically keeping you
in almost that exact gait

00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:48.430
mechanic pattern.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.780
Now you do not need that shoe or
no shoes to be able to do that.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.250
And who's read
"Born to Run," which

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.720
is a whole book about this?

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.150
So when "Born to Run"
came out, my office

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.790
was-- it was a book about this
whole tribe of Mexican Indians

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.890
who basically ran
with no shoes and how

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:08.740
they were hurt much less and the
whole kind of idea about that.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.120
And so when that book came
out, for the next six months,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.747
my office was overflowing
wannabe Mexican Indians who

00:38:16.747 --> 00:38:18.580
were trying to run
barefoot in Central Park,

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.420
and they had all
kinds of problems.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.750
And the answer is,
you do not need

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.240
to run barefoot or even
minimalist to get this stride,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.100
but the whole idea
is the short stride,

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.829
high cadence run mechanic.

00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:31.120
And so we don't want that
foot way out in front of you,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.880
because you come crashing down.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.250
All that force comes directly
up through the ground,

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.550
and you end up
hurting yourselves.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:39.240
How can you learn to do this?

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.500
Well, things I talked about such
as counting cadence, shortening

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.710
stride, uphill training is a
great thing to think about.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.552
My class, I do outdoors in
Central Park in the mornings.

00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:50.010
Who's been to my
class, by the way?

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.021
Anybody in here?

00:38:52.021 --> 00:38:53.020
A few of you guys, good.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.130
Hopefully, you lived
to tell about it.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.460
And the outdoor
center park classes,

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.280
we do some component
of running, and hill

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.405
running to encourage people
to shorten their stride

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.780
and quicken their cadence.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.196
Now what we're doing now, and
this is a video on the left,

00:39:05.196 --> 00:39:07.110
the lower left is
we're in the lab.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.109
We are looking at
stride mechanic,

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:11.650
so you can just play that video
on the lower left if you can.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:12.170
Good.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.920
Stride mechanic and
trying to measure out

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.878
people's angle of motion
and what it looks like

00:39:15.878 --> 00:39:19.002
and what the optimal
run mechanic is for you.

00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:21.210
Again, you don't have to
come to us to get this done.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.126
You can start just
mimicking this on your own,

00:39:23.126 --> 00:39:25.150
but it's pretty cool
to see how we are now

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.560
kind of using a
lot of the things

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.550
you guys developed to help us
in terms of this discussion.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.760
What about your body?

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760
Well, your kinetic chain
is a big piece of this,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.020
and so the kinetic
chain is a combination

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.110
of strength and flexibility.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.760
And it's important, because if
you're running like this person

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.930
here on the left,
and your left knee is

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.330
falling into the middle,
she's got very weak muscles.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.910
Her hip is kind of falling in.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.050
She's what we would call
a Trendelenburg posture,

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.820
meaning her hip is falling.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.621
So she's somebody
who's going to get hurt

00:39:52.621 --> 00:39:53.870
if she does that often enough.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.350
So her anatomy plays a role.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.530
Her ankle and foot
mechanics play a role,

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.460
but understanding how
all this works together

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.410
makes a big difference in terms
of for injury predisposition,

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.480
because what I
want you guys to do

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.550
is to push that injury
threshold out further.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.900
And the way you will do
that is a combination

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.207
of your flexibility, and so
in the back of [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:13.207 --> 00:40:15.790
I have a whole thing of the nine
things to do with your roller

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.260
every single day,
and I want to do

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.176
that to loosen up those
muscles, which I think

00:40:19.176 --> 00:40:20.990
is actually more
efficient than stretching

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.950
and yoga and strengthening.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.480
So the question is,
who can strength train?

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.020
And the answer is yes.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.750
In my classes, anybody from
like 10 to 80 have come.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.750
I have an 82-year-old
lady who came to class.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.750
Let's have a look at this
video, and let's watch

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.410
this strength trainer who
started strength training

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:37.940
at 91.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.410
Oh, let's not look
at that video.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.140
So this is a video--
just kidding--

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.640
this is a video
which kind of talked

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.470
about somebody who came
in and started a strength

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.430
program at age 91.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:53.350
And the benefits for her were
everything from not falling

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.490
is much to not
falling at all to kind

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.920
of moving without a problem.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.450
And so the idea
here is that there's

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.210
so much you can do at any
age to build strength.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.820
Now I'm going to play
you two videos here.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.270
Let's click the
video on the left.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.510
That's her stepping
down with her left foot.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.570
The right leg is on the box.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.350
Let's play the
video on the right.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.560
This is the left leg stepping
down, the right leg--

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:22.750
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.749
-Whenever you're ready,
step down nice and slow.

00:41:27.495 --> 00:41:28.150
Good job.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.550
All the way down.

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.310
All the way down.

00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.600
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600
JORDAN METZL: OK, great.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.350
Now she came in to
see me with an injury.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.150
Did she come in to see me
because her right knee was hurt

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.766
or her left knee was hurt?

00:41:39.766 --> 00:41:43.540
I'm watching her step
down off the box.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.880
Who here votes for right knee?

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.150
Who here votes for left knee?

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.090
All right.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.630
So most of you guys didn't vote.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:52.340
That's OK.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.320
Now I want you to watch
these videos one more time.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.530
When you-- well, not yet.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.870
Now when she steps down with the
right foot, as she steps down,

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:04.120
I want you to pay very--
don't be distracted.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.360
I want you to watch
her right knee,

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.656
and I want you look at the
angle between her foot,

00:42:08.656 --> 00:42:10.530
her right knee, and her
hip as she steps down

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:12.196
off the box, the knee
that's on the box.

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.619
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:15.068
-Other leg now.

00:42:20.527 --> 00:42:21.360
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.068
JORDAN METZL: OK.

00:42:22.068 --> 00:42:23.946
Now the same thing
on the other side.

00:42:23.946 --> 00:42:24.842
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.540
-OK, whenever you're ready,
step down nice and slow.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.275
Good job.

00:42:31.275 --> 00:42:32.000
All the way down.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:32.620
JORDAN METZL: All right.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:34.536
What did you guys see
side-to-side difference?

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.220
Who saw a difference?

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.970
What'd you see?

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.920
AUDIENCE: The right knee
didn't stay straight.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.240
JORDAN METZL: The right
knee did not stay straight.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.860
The right knee drifted
in towards the middle.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.960
So you remember that
girl I showed you

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.750
in the beginning whose
hip was falling in.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:51.190
So she has one of the dreaded
problems in runners called

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:56.670
WBS, or weak butt syndrome.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.680
A weak butt is a
disaster for a runner,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.280
because what ends
up happening is

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.720
when you land from
your running stride,

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.860
that knee and hip
falls into the middle.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.130
And you end up getting shin
splints, plantar fasciitis,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.870
knee pain, hip pain-- all
these problems tend to be,

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:16.765
oftentimes, not always,
because sometimes you

00:43:16.765 --> 00:43:18.280
have some of the underlying
problems I've talked about,

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.600
because you're so weak.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.617
And so she's very much
weaker on that side

00:43:22.617 --> 00:43:24.200
where she's stepping
down off the box,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.350
and that right side is
weaker than the left side.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.683
And everybody in this room
has strength differences side

00:43:28.683 --> 00:43:30.960
to side.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.800
So what I've tried
to do, let's see

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.050
if there's a video here first.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.250
There should be, hopefully.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.900
Back up one.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.840
Hold on.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.340
Let's stop.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.000
Now we got it.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.500
Good.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.944
So what I've tried to do is
to build this strength workout

00:43:49.944 --> 00:43:50.860
to get people to move.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.484
So last year, actually, the New
York Times came out last summer

00:43:53.484 --> 00:43:55.810
and visited my
class, and so this

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.377
was one of our
Central Park classes,

00:43:57.377 --> 00:43:59.710
which was a combination of
strength training and running

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:00.410
together.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.070
This kind of gives you a
story about what it's about,

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:06.214
and I'll get to you in one sec.

00:44:06.214 --> 00:44:07.880
So let's go ahead and
put the volume up,

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.705
and let's watch this video now.

00:44:10.705 --> 00:44:16.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.540
-My name is Dr. Jordan Metzl.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.660
I'm a sports medicine
physician at Hospital

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.330
for Special Surgery, and we're
in Central Park having just

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.600
done my iron strength workout.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.550
As a doctor, I really believe
that exercise is the best

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:29.054
medicine, and I
want everybody to be

00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:30.720
able to take that
medicine all the time.

00:44:33.532 --> 00:44:34.990
The first time I
did it, I thought,

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.000
I wonder if anybody's
going to come.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.458
I just emailed some
of my patients.

00:44:37.458 --> 00:44:39.560
We had about 25 people.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.310
I've now built the
listserv for this class

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.031
of about 6,000 people.

00:44:44.031 --> 00:44:46.030
This kind of workout's
great about twice a week,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.890
and the great thing
about it is it's free.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:50.140
You don't need any equipment,
and it's so effective.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.340
I think body weight
strengthening

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.715
and what's called functional
strength training is the way

00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:55.340
to go.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.050
Today we did a combination
of, first of all, some

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.120
skipping up a hill.

00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:03.550
Skipping is a great
example of what's

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.300
called a plyometric, so the
muscles basically rapidly

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.600
elongating and contracting.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.890
So even though
skipping's a lot of fun,

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.590
it's a great way to
start strengthening

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:11.840
some of those running muscles.

00:45:14.859 --> 00:45:17.400
These kind of workouts over time
push your lactate threshold,

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.230
meaning that your
fatigue level gets

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:20.450
further and further
out the more you do

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:21.700
this kind of intense training.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.104
Then I did a series
of exercises designed

00:45:27.104 --> 00:45:28.270
to strengthen their muscles.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:34.410
And so I started with what we
call plyometric jump squats,

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.620
and those are like the
best exercise you can do.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:37.290
They're awesome.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.000
You basically squat
all the way down,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.410
and then you jump up in the
air and squat all the way

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.740
back down.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.260
Then I had people
get on the ground,

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:48.050
and I did a series of rotation
planks with a push-up.

00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:54.650
And then legs down is when you
bring your legs all the way up

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:57.215
and then straight down.

00:45:57.215 --> 00:45:58.590
Again, a great
core strengthener.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.740
And then some
sit-ups, and the idea

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.360
is strengthening the whole
kinetic chain, all the muscles.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.430
We started with the
legs and the glutes.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.360
Then we went to the
core and the upper body.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.450
Following that, we did
my favorite exercise,

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:14.660
which is called the burpee.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.590
It was designed in the 1930s
to give maximum strength

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.820
and maximum effort.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.012
And then we finished with
an isometric exercise called

00:46:24.012 --> 00:46:26.470
a plank, and that's where you
hold yourself in one position

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.386
to strengthen all the
muscles around the core.

00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:33.276
And that's the thing I
love about this class is

00:46:33.276 --> 00:46:35.859
that it basically brings people
together of all different ages

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:39.070
and abilities, and it's
great, because as a group,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.608
you can work so much harder
than you can individually.

00:46:46.121 --> 00:46:46.954
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:46.954 --> 00:46:48.079
JORDAN METZL: And it's fun.

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:49.340
I hope you guys come out.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.780
So off to the races.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.305
So everybody in
here needs a goal.

00:46:53.305 --> 00:46:54.680
Following the
right training plan

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.490
I think is a way to do that.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:59.840
Mental, run, and
physiology training

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.340
all kind of training
your physiology

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.220
to be an effective runner, I
think very important as well,

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.120
and thinking about
preventive health.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.720
So are the two things
that we have here.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.594
Actually we don't have the DVD.

00:47:09.594 --> 00:47:11.510
Believe it or not, some
people still use DVDs.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:12.240
Shocking, I know.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.640
That's what I said
too, but they do.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.340
But the run book is all
about all this stuff,

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.807
trying to teach people how to
be healthy and prevent injury.

00:47:21.807 --> 00:47:22.890
Let's turn off the slides.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.515
I'm going to show
you guys a demo, what

00:47:24.515 --> 00:47:26.910
I was talking about
the tech piece of this,

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:32.240
just because my challenge-- so
I'll switch over to this, guys.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.090
My challenge with this
was to basically--

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.300
I love everything
about this company

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.360
and what you guys do here.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.070
The one problem as a doctor is
that Dr. Google is only right

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:45.695
about 30% of the time.

00:47:45.695 --> 00:47:47.320
And every single
person comes in to see

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.930
me thinks they have bone
cancer, because they've used

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:53.990
Dr. Google, or Lyme disease.

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:57.050
And so it's been
kind of frustrating,

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.192
because they all use
Dr. Google, and like

00:48:00.192 --> 00:48:02.650
if I was only right 30% percent
of the time, like you know.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.182
So anyway, Dr. Google's a
great person, great doctor,

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.890
but he doesn't have
a very high hit rate.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:11.950
So my challenge was basically
people don't only want to read.

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.110
They use Dr. Google
all the time.

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:17.610
So how to basically try and
control that information,

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.670
so it's more directed towards
what I think is more accurate.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:23.700
So what I did is I
went to Runner's World

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.070
with this, so this is
a book number three

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.010
in a series of five
I've done with them.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.115
And I said, listen, I've got
like 45, 50 of these videos

00:48:31.115 --> 00:48:33.490
I've done with you over the
years on every single thing--

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.620
shin splints and plantar
fasciitis and everything--

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.780
and I want to figure out
a way to make the book

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.070
interface with the smartphone.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.700
And they said, all right, we're
going to use this scanning app.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.320
And so we picked an
app called Blippar,

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.110
which I'm going to show you.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.410
There I am.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:50.970
So this is how it works.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.340
So basically, I'm going
to open the app, which

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:59.510
is a scanning app, and anything
I want to do, and whoop,

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.200
it just already found the cover
before I was ready for it.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.070
So any question I
have inside the book,

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:08.094
so let's say I have
Achilles tendinitis here.

00:49:08.094 --> 00:49:09.510
Can you guys see
the book as well?

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.281
On the camera, can
you move that at all?

00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:15.965
Good, so here's somebody reading
about Achilles tendinitis,

00:49:15.965 --> 00:49:17.340
and there's all
this stuff to do,

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.910
but just the reading
experience alone

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:23.860
is, I think, what
do I do exactly?

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.660
So anytime this
symbol is on the page,

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.620
the whole page is scannable.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.640
So what then people do is
they hold the phone over that.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.990
It pulls up the video
that links to that thing,

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:39.696
and then we have a video
I've done on that subject.

00:49:39.696 --> 00:49:43.112
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.660
-Achilles tendinitis,
I'm telling you,

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.694
I'm in here every single
day seeing patients.

00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:50.360
They are really
frustrated, because they

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.276
come in, and they say,
hey, listen, Dr. Metzl,

00:49:52.276 --> 00:49:52.884
I want to run.

00:49:52.884 --> 00:49:55.050
And I can't run, because
my Achilles tendon is sore,

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.224
and it's been sore for awhile.

00:49:57.224 --> 00:49:59.390
That's the common story in
here, so let's figure out

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:00.385
Achilles tendinitis.

00:50:00.385 --> 00:50:00.700
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.116
JORDAN METZL: So
you get the idea.

00:50:02.116 --> 00:50:04.240
So it kind of goes
through a much longer way

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.120
to think about that,
which has been cool

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.110
just in terms of interfacing
information, I think.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.970
So I'm not a tech--
I mean, I love tech,

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:13.720
but I'm not a tech guy like
you guys are tech people.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.219
But that was pretty awesome just
to be able to kind of, I think,

00:50:17.219 --> 00:50:18.510
control that a little bit more.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:21.464
So we just wanted to do a demo
of that, because I was like,

00:50:21.464 --> 00:50:22.380
we're going to Google.

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.070
I've got to-- where else
am I going to show that?

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:30.720
So in conclusion, I want
you guys to run forever.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.432
I want you to please join
what I'm doing community-wise.

00:50:34.432 --> 00:50:35.640
I left some cards back there.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.950
My website's on there.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.926
Sign yourselves up for
this class or any class.

00:50:40.926 --> 00:50:43.300
And I'm happy to answer any
questions about your running,

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.364
your health, or whatever.

00:50:44.364 --> 00:50:46.530
I think we have a microphone
here for any questions,

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:47.200
or I'll just repeat them.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.283
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:52.140
JORDAN METZL: Yeah.

00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:55.860
I'll repeat it for you.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.800
Here comes the thing,
yeah, because they

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.200
were doing a webcast thing.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.033
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:59.033 --> 00:51:00.930
A few slides back, you
talked about the way

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.360
the knee kind of went
in to the other foot,

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.630
so you're saying misalignment
of your hip, knee,

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.842
and foot is bad?

00:51:06.842 --> 00:51:08.050
JORDAN METZL: It's bad, yeah.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:10.680
I want you basically
to line yourself up

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.965
as directly between hip,
knee, and foot as you can.

00:51:14.965 --> 00:51:16.590
And as I showed in
the video, sometimes

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:17.756
that's coming from the feet.

00:51:17.756 --> 00:51:20.590
So sometimes the only problem
is you may be super strong,

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.860
but your foot's rolling in
like bad feet, good feet.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.910
Sometimes you've got WBS, and
you're so weak on that side

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.640
it's happening from the hip
down, and sometimes it's both.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.200
So the answer is that the more
we can kind of figure out,

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.530
and so I really try and teach
people how to fix themselves

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.570
from the ground up
and from the hip down

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.740
or the core down, and between
those things together,

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.380
that's most people.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.010
Now some people have something
like that other dude, which

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:47.099
is their knee's arthritic.

00:51:47.099 --> 00:51:49.140
No matter what I do,
they're still going to hurt.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:50.697
So we have to think
about lube shots

00:51:50.697 --> 00:51:51.780
or whatever else for them.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.050
But in general, that's
the mechanical piece

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:58.675
is the short stride, high
cadence and lining you

00:51:58.675 --> 00:51:59.740
up as best we can.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.406
AUDIENCE: So do you
think it makes sense

00:52:01.406 --> 00:52:02.950
to come in prior
to injury to say,

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.869
hey, am I misaligned
of the foot?

00:52:04.869 --> 00:52:06.160
JORDAN METZL: I don't think so.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.260
So I have a bunch of stuff in
here about how to do the step

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.837
down test on your own,
and do a lot of stuff you

00:52:09.837 --> 00:52:12.170
can do on your own to screen
yourself and see, what am I

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.890
doing?

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.090
You can even go to
the running store,

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.300
and they can kind of
get a rough screen.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.550
They have some stuff in there.

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:18.390
If you're like, I
keep getting hurt,

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.860
then we have the ability to
do full analysis in the thing.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.799
But I want you-- I mean,
I'm happy to see you,

00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:25.090
but you don't have to come
in unless there's a problem.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.360
But I think you can do a
lot to prevent yourself

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.352
from having a problem.

00:52:28.352 --> 00:52:29.060
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:34.410
AUDIENCE: This was not
planned, I promise.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.720
I have a quick question.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:39.260
What do you think is the best
way to find a proper diagnosis

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:39.880
for knee pain?

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.970
I've had some
inconclusive MRI results,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.410
and I'm just wondering
after a couple of those,

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:47.510
what you would do next.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:49.220
JORDAN METZL: It's
a good question,

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.840
and the answer is try watching
some of these videos first,

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.640
and see if any of those resonate
with what your problem is,

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.700
where the pain is.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.090
I try and line them up by where
it's hurting on your knee.

00:52:58.090 --> 00:52:59.990
But generally, pain
happens for a reason.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.275
So whether it's me
or somebody, I just

00:53:03.275 --> 00:53:06.204
like for people that are
runners to find a doctor that

00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:08.620
does that kind of stuff or any
kind of health professional

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.180
that they're going to
use that does that.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.740
I think it just kind
of makes more sense,

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.970
because often, your only advice
will be, well, just don't run.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.280
Well, yeah, dude, whatever.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.450
Like that's not going to work.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.890
I think that's a
piece [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.200
and then try and see
somebody that is doing

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.840
the stuff I think that helps.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.763
JORDAN METZL: But pain
happens for a reason,

00:53:26.763 --> 00:53:29.319
so there's usually a reason why.

00:53:29.319 --> 00:53:29.860
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.280
OK, that's working.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.140
So I just had a quick question.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.410
I'm a type 1 diabetic,
and I've been

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.827
trying to do-- I did
the marathon last year,

00:53:39.827 --> 00:53:42.160
and I've trying to find a
training plan that'll actually

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.030
work for me, because I can't
do like glycogen loading.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.820
Do you have any
advice on what to do?

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.820
JORDAN METZL: Nutritionally
you're saying?

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.780
AUDIENCE: Nutritionally.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.488
JORDAN METZL: So that's
a tough question.

00:53:50.488 --> 00:53:53.090
So type 1 diabetes are
people who basically

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:57.070
are born without a kind of
working insulin, so they need

00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.571
insulin injections to control or
insulin to modify their stuff.

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:01.570
Is that correct for you?

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:03.720
Do you have a pump, or do
you administer yourself?

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.327
AUDIENCE: Uh, no,
I self-administer.

00:54:05.327 --> 00:54:07.660
JORDAN METZL: So meaning
there's a pump which does that.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.160
It kind of reads
your blood sugar

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.005
and will administer
insulin on its own,

00:54:11.005 --> 00:54:12.880
or some people have to
give themselves shots,

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.490
and the problem is if
you don't have a pump,

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.511
you can be doing a race,
and you can bottom out,

00:54:17.511 --> 00:54:19.760
and you don't know it during
or especially afterwards,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.135
and you could have
a big problem.

00:54:21.135 --> 00:54:23.320
So the answer is you are
somebody that really needs

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.760
to see a sport nutritionist.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.360
On my site, I have
a link to a bunch,

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.530
and I have a bunch who run.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.300
And you want to
basically figure out

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.680
with a running sport
nutritionist what's

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.320
happening along
the way with you,

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.320
and maybe even everything
from getting sample glucose

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.050
readings as you go on a
training run to see where you're

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.780
bottoming and how you can
kind of think about nutrition

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.610
strategies around that.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.779
There's a lot to do in that.

00:54:45.779 --> 00:54:47.570
But the reason why I
love you're doing that

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:51.887
is that diabetic
sugar control is

00:54:51.887 --> 00:54:53.720
a big piece of the
equation about preventing

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.430
some of the longer term
complications for type 1

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.929
diabetes.

00:54:55.929 --> 00:54:57.820
So I want you
running, and I don't

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.680
want that issue to be
prohibitive for you

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:01.490
in terms of not running.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.826
So there's a lot to do
to think about that.

00:55:03.826 --> 00:55:04.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.639
JORDAN METZL: Sure.

00:55:06.639 --> 00:55:07.680
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.805
Thanks for coming to speak.

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:09.510
I appreciate it.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:11.010
I actually just had
a quick question

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:13.700
on what your thoughts
were on rotating shoes.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.340
I myself, I like to rotate two
different brands to actually

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.380
teach my foot how to become
accustomed to longer distance

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.050
running versus the days
I'm doing workouts.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.700
So I have specific
shoes that I use

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.890
when I'm doing speed
workout and then other shoes

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:27.260
when I'm going out for
long distance runs.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.720
JORDAN METZL: So the fast
shoes and the slow shoes.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.670
That's a great question.

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:31.419
And I think the answer
is that's terrific.

00:55:31.419 --> 00:55:33.820
I like that a lot,
and I like even

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:36.390
doing shorter stuff in a
more minimalist, flatter,

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:37.320
less supportive shoe.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.340
I got no problem
with that at all.

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.860
I think it builds foot strength.

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.949
It shortens your stride.

00:55:41.949 --> 00:55:43.740
I think all the things
that you're finding,

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.740
I think it's-- I have no
problem with that at all.

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.700
Some people like that.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.760
Some people don't like that.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.095
And the answer is that if it
works for you, it works for me.

00:55:50.095 --> 00:55:50.880
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thanks.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.130
JORDAN METZL: All right, sure.

00:55:55.254 --> 00:55:56.910
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:02.430
So I wanted you to talk about
somewhat about conditioning.

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:07.030
So sometimes I go into a
sport somewhat unprepared

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.110
just after the work, so
it's already 6:30, 7:00.

00:56:10.110 --> 00:56:14.070
I will grab something and get
into a basketball match, say.

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.950
And then after that,
we realize, oh, we just

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:19.110
jumped into the basketball
game, and here's

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:20.780
what we came out of it.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.530
The next day we have
a sprain in our calf,

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.490
something in the
shoulder, our finger got

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:30.110
turned back while tackling.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.969
So what's like a
one-minute conditioning

00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:35.260
or five-minute conditioning
that you can do on the run?

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.610
JORDAN METZL: So weekend warrior
syndrome, so basically you're

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.651
kind of sitting all day,
go out, and get started.

00:56:39.651 --> 00:56:41.930
So number one,
warming up your body.

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:43.590
So in my workout, I
have a lot of stuff

00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:45.548
that's called dynamic
warmup like jumping jacks

00:56:45.548 --> 00:56:48.907
and easy squats, air
squats, and walkouts,

00:56:48.907 --> 00:56:50.990
and things to get your
body loose for four or five

00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:52.470
minutes before you
just jump right

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.906
into a high ballistic activity.

00:56:53.906 --> 00:56:55.280
I think that's
certainly helpful.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:57.550
You'll see that in
there, number one.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.094
Number two is a
preventive conditioning.

00:57:00.094 --> 00:57:01.510
No matter what
sport you're doing,

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.660
you need one to two days
of strength training

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.260
per week, minimum one full
day of strength training.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:08.530
Takes an hour.

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.760
You're going to learn
to love it eventually.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.780
That will help prevent injury,
and then sometimes stuff

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.400
happens.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.260
But in general,
those are the things

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:20.760
you can do the best is dynamic
warmup, functional training,

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.196
and then static stretching
after you're done

00:57:23.196 --> 00:57:25.820
is certainly helpful, after the
event, while you're still warm.

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.140
AUDIENCE: Oh, after the event.

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:27.530
All right.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:28.030
Thanks.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.890
AUDIENCE: So we have a
15-story building here.

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.740
What are your
thoughts on stairs?

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.050
JORDAN METZL: I love stairs.

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.106
And so last time
I was down here,

00:57:40.106 --> 00:57:41.480
I talked a lot
about the medicine

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.200
of exercise and increasing
your NEAT profile, which

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.474
is an acronym for Non-Exercise
Active Thermogenesis,

00:57:47.474 --> 00:57:49.640
so you're just burning
calories from cruising around

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.280
during the day, which leads
to much more favorable health

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.180
outcomes across the board.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.840
And things like stairs
and getting a dog

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.470
and walking to work or
taking a further subway,

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:03.550
all those things link to
better health characteristics,

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.910
and so those are
things anybody can do.

00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:08.140
If you can do the stairs,
I love it for you guys.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.866
And I think that's the reason
I like this workplace is

00:58:09.866 --> 00:58:11.545
that it's very
ergonomically-- aside

00:58:11.545 --> 00:58:13.694
from the fact it's cool--
it's very ergonomically

00:58:13.694 --> 00:58:15.860
efficient in terms of getting
people to move around.

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.700
AUDIENCE: And then what
about as part of a workout?

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.966
Like how would you
incorporate stairs as--

00:58:20.966 --> 00:58:22.840
JORDAN METZL: I think
stairs are plyometrics.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.029
And so that's plyometric
based training.

00:58:25.029 --> 00:58:27.320
I have no problem with that
at all once or twice a week

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.030
to build strength.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:33.514
I have no problem
with stairs at all.

00:58:33.514 --> 00:58:34.930
I'm happy to sign
anybody's books.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:35.990
Thanks so much for
having me down.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.620
I'll see you soon.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.220
Bye.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.085
[APPLAUSE]
