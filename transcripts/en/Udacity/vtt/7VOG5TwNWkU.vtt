00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.100
Did you get an error? If you did, don't worry.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.960
That's what I would have expected. The thing is that

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.620
you created a new query and you deployed it straight

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.190
to app spot without the index. So, since the index

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.140
doesn't exist, the app really can't serve the query, so

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.050
you will get an error. Or did everything work just

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.310
fine. Hm. It's hard to say that's wrong if it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.290
did, but it's not what I would have expected. You were

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.940
trying to execute a query for which an index doesn't exist. So, unless you

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.860
ran it on local host first, I really wouldn't have expected the query to work.
