00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:03.410
DAN: I met Fred
a couple of years

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.130
ago, at the SF Green Festival.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
Amid the organic food and
soaps and different ways

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.430
of using plastic, Fred
had something different,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.170
something which could
improve the lives of millions

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.740
of poor people around the world.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.510
And I wanted to let Fred share
that idea with you today.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.550
Fred Colgan is the co-founder
of InStove, a nonprofit which

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.920
is designing, building, and
distributing large, highly

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.450
efficient cook stoves
in developing countries.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.790
He's joined by Assitan
Sylla Traore, Africa project

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.460
coordinator at InStove.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130
She is a Fulbright
scholar from Mali,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.410
with 18 years of
experience working

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.430
with senior political and
diplomatic leaders in Mali.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.244
Please join me in
welcoming Fred and Assitan.

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:43.285
FRED COLGAN: Thanks, Dan.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.520
Well, hi.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.270
I'm Fred Colgan.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.570
I'm the executive director
and co-founder of InStove.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.890
Our full name is
Institutional Stove Solutions.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.720
We're a 501(c)3
non-profit organization,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
and the manufacturer of clean
and efficient cook stoves

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.492
and allied technologies
for the developing world.

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:09.200
Now, when you think
of clean cook stoves,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.390
you may think of some gleaming
new electric or gas range.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.320
And when you think of
institutional kitchens,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.200
you may think of the
fantastic workplaces

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.590
you see on celebrity
chef programs.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.310
But the reality in
the developing world

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.400
is more like this.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.900
Chances are, your
last meal wasn't

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.170
prepared over an open fire.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.470
But for about one out of
three people on Earth, it was.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.970
The cost of this is
staggering, globally.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.500
It leads to deforestation,
climate change, illness,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.450
gender-based violence,
and even death.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300
And the social costs
fall especially

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.570
hard on the shoulders of
women and young girls,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450
who do the cooking
and fuel gathering.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.610
2.7 billion people use
open fires to cook.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.630
Today, in sub-Saharan Africa,
which is our principle market,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.420
over 657 million people
use biomass fuels--

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.090
like wood, charcoal, or
dung-- as a primary source

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.680
of household energy.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.000
While much of the planet is
moving away from this model,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.770
in Africa, there are
multiple barriers-- political

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.560
instability, corruption,
regional conflicts,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.660
all preventing many
from gaining access

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.850
to electricity or
to modern fuels.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.390
The reality is that the
infrastructure simply

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.650
is not enough to deliver
electricity and modern fuels.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.760
It's not growing fast
enough to meet demands,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.510
either current or projected.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.430
Every few years, the
International Energy Agency

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.350
does an assessment of
energy use worldwide.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.670
They collect their
findings and analyses

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.960
in a report called "The
World Energy Outlook."

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.110
I want to share one finding of
the IEA in their 2011 report.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.050
"While Africa's share
of the global population

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.350
increases from 15% in 2009
to 20% percent in 2035,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.380
its share of global
energy demand

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.950
declines fractionally to 5.4%
over the same time frame.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.700
Furthermore, 1/3 of the total
energy demand in Africa by 2035

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.640
takes the form of
traditional biomass use."

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.560
In that same report,
the IEA projects

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.310
that the number of people
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.030
who will use biomass as
their primary source of fuel

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.830
will be over 900
million people in 2035.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.610
That means, in
Africa, two decades

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.940
from now, the number of
people burning wood to cook

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.910
will have grown by almost 50%.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.340
The environmental damage
from this is two-fold.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.320
First, the open-fire
cooking produces a long list

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.990
of noxious chemicals,
like benzene, and methane,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.520
and toluene.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.340
But the black carbon
and particulate matter

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.850
is especially impactful
on climate change.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.600
It's estimated that open-fire
cooking in the world

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.130
produces more climate
change emissions

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.530
than the one billion
cars on the planet.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.600
Second, the unsustainable
harvesting of firewood

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.080
destroys the very
forests that help

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.520
to mitigate climate change.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.980
On average, throughout
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.920
the level of deforestation
is between 3% to 4%

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.470
of existing forest each year.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.360
And in some regions,
like in northern Nigeria,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.870
that deforestation rate
climbs to over 11% per year.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.110
Deforestation brings
with it a cascade

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.720
of environmental
and social problems

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.690
that include acceleration
of desertification.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.830
And the loss of watersheds,
the loss of habitat.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.220
And the loss of livelihoods the
depend on forest ecosystems.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.680
But the costs of
open-fire cooking

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.460
have a human dimension as well.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.370
The most recent global
burden of disease study,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.240
published he asked last
year in "The Lancet,"

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.280
found that 4.3 million people
die each year from illnesses

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.750
caused by exposure to
indoor air pollution.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.040
By way of comparison,
more people

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.390
die each year from cook smoke
than from HIV, AIDS, malaria,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.440
and tuberculosis combined.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.540
And this statistic does
not include those who die

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.120
or become disfigured by burns
sustained while cooking.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.830
This statistic does not include
the eye diseases-- including

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.000
cataracts and macular
degeneration-- that

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.840
come from exposure to
indoor air pollution, which

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.030
often lead to blindness.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.060
And this statistic
does not include

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.010
the gender-based
violence suffered

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.740
by women and young girls
who cook outdoors, and trek

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.460
long distances-- often through
dangerous territory-- in search

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.250
of firewood together.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.450
These women and
girls must continue

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.550
to go out because
gathering firewood is not

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.860
only necessary for
their family's survival.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.180
It's often the only
income-generating activity

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.030
available to them,
especially in refugee camps

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.100
and internally
displaced persons camps.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.570
When I went to Nyala
in Darfur in 2011,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.080
I was fortunate enough to
work with a large group

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.590
of African women who were cooks
in the schools in the camp.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.560
And after I gave a
demonstration at one camp,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.210
a focus group of cooks
told me that they

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.710
have to travel outside the
camp to gather firewood.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.310
And one out of every
three times they go out,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.435
they're sexually assaulted.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.550
These problems are enormous.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.800
But at their root is a
solvable engineering problem.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.330
How do you design
a stove to make

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.400
biomass cooking
more efficient, one

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.460
that uses minimal
amounts of fuel,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.410
while producing minimal
amounts of emissions,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.080
and being safe for users?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.590
In 2005, I wasn't
aware of most of this,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.180
though I had some
developing world experience.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.480
I was 60 years old.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.520
And my wife and
I moved to Oregon

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.110
to retire to a little place
on the bank of the Willamette

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.290
River in Oregon.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.190
I had planned to re-read
my science fiction

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.110
library in my retirement years.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.130
But that plan
wasn't meant to be.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.230
The property we bought
had an abandoned

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.750
slaughterhouse and
meat-packing plant on it.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.360
So I restored this building.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.110
And our first tenant was
Aprovecho Research Center.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.550
This is a nonprofit
research group

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.080
that's been working for 30 years
on the design and development

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.650
of clean-biomass cook stoves,
including the iconic rocket

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.340
stove.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.040
And almost immediately at
Aprovecho, I met Damon Ogle.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.270
Damon was a retired
mechanical engineer

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.530
who had spent many years with a
successful independent business

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.280
with portable
rock-crushing mills,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.929
providing rock crushing to
government and mining clients

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.789
throughout the Western US.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.600
Damon took an early retirement.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.650
And he began looking for
ways to put his engineering

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.039
experience to humanitarian use.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.400
Eventually, his interest in
water and sanitation systems

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.210
in the developing world
led him to Aprovecho,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.410
who were
world-recognized leaders

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:56.070
in appropriate technology,
and within driving distance

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.500
for Damon.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.910
He joined Aprovecho
as a volunteer.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.780
And he began devoting the
second half of his life

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.660
to using his engineering talents
to give back to humanity.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.420
After spending several years
of designing household stoves

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.600
and implementing stove projects
throughout the developing

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.290
world, Damon began
focusing on building larger

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.810
institutional rocket
stoves in places

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.620
like refugee camps, and
schools, and hospitals,

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.930
and rural clinics.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.950
Households stoves are simply
not sufficient to meet the need.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.530
These are institutions where
large quantities of food

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.170
are prepared quickly.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.980
This kind of cooking presents
different design challenges.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.490
But because of the
high level of fuel use

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.620
and the high level of
resulting emissions,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.510
Damon saw that when
you placed one improved

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.390
institutional stove, the
impact is an order of magnitude

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:58.350
higher than placing
a household stove.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.380
At Aprovecho, Damon learned
about the ten rocket stove

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.280
principles from their creator,
and our friend, Doctor Larry

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.700
Winiarski.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.295
These ten principles
are as follows.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.110
First, insulate around the fire
with a low-mass, heat-resistant

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.300
material.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.610
The objective of this is to
create a refractive combustion

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.560
chamber.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.170
The goal is not to heat the
stove, but to heat the pot.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:32.830
Number two, use an insulated,
upright, internal chimney

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.350
immediately above the fire, to
promote mixing of the gases--

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.025
the pyrolated gases-- and
to complete the combustion.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.020
Number three, design
a stove to heat

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.420
and burn only the
tips of the sticks

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.590
as they enter the
combustion chamber.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.820
This is analogous to avoiding
burning too lean or too rich

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.480
in a gasoline engine.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.940
Number five, design the stove
to maintain high-air velocity

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.770
through the system.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.880
And number five, do not
allow too much or too little

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.520
air to enter the
combustion chamber.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.950
Strive to have a stoichiometric,
or a chemically ideal,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.210
combustion.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.870
This can best be achieved
by not jamming the fuel

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.230
slot with wood.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.320
Too much fuel blocks air flow.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.500
And it causes
incomplete combustion.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.190
And it produces smoke.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.930
Number six, maintain
constant cross-sectional area

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.245
throughout the stove to
eliminate bottlenecks.

00:11:34.245 --> 00:11:37.290
And number seven,
elevate the fuel.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.150
And distribute air
flow around the fuel.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.330
The stove works best
when the fuel added

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:47.570
is separated by a shelf
that allows this air flow.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.570
Number eight, use a grate under
the stove, under the fuel,

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.260
so that the air flows
through the coals.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.910
Traditional stoves--
open fires that

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.450
have fuel resting on
the ground-- experience

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.720
difficulty achieving the
correct mix of air and fuel.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.150
Number nine, insulate
the heat-flow path

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.680
to and around the
cooking surfaces.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.110
As you can see, in this and in
most household rocket stoves,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.470
this is only partially achieved.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.300
The heat-flow path to
the pot is insulated,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.160
but not beyond the bottom
of the cooking surface.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.550
And finally, number
ten, optimize

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.130
the gaps around the
cooking surfaces

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.700
to maximize heat transfer
without slowing down the draft.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.790
The supports that
elevate the pot

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.540
above the stove in this
kind of rocket stove

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.380
create the most critical
gap, where the heat transfer

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.060
is reduced if the
gap is too small.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.950
If it's too large,
and a choke point

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.250
is created if the
gap is too small.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.234
And it makes a smoky fire.

00:12:53.234 --> 00:12:55.600
Now, Damon took these
principles and applied them

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.930
to designing an
institutional cook stove.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.910
And what he ended up with was
a stove that looks like this.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.300
Now, this stove's
been designed to best

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.000
run on small amounts
of small wood--

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.970
little sticks that can
be sustainably harvested.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.140
In contrast, open-fire
cooking for institutions

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.240
tends to require large
amounts of large wood

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.970
to generate enough heat energy
for the large pots they use.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.020
Most of this energy is wasted.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.860
A really efficient
three-stone fire

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.220
is, at best, only about
15% thermally efficient.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.140
That means 85% of the heat
energy never reaches the pot.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.380
Our stove, from the moment
heat energy is generated,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.780
forces heated air to flow
up through the stove,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.340
following a path that
provides maximum opportunity

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.850
for heat exchange with
the cooking surfaces

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.760
to the bottom of the pot, and
then along its sides as well.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.060
Additional heat is retained
in the stove in this chamber

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.620
by the metal skirt,
or the pot surround.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.980
As gases descend into
another insulated space,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.510
we improve efficiency
with retained heat.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:15.200
Then those gases exit the stove
through the external chimney.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.770
This design creates
an optimum draft,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.670
which pulls the heat
at a constant velocity

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.270
through the system.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:28.190
With this stove, we have
reached 50% thermal efficiency.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.270
By way of contrast, the average
internal combustion engine

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.970
is about 20% percent efficient.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:40.120
And the Prius we drove down here
today is about 40% efficient.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.000
With this stove, we get
more work out of wood

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.755
than modern combustion
engines get out of gasoline.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.280
In 2007, when Damon
first began designing

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.330
what he was calling
a barrel stove,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.110
Dr. Winiarski, the
father of rocket stoves,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.440
was also working at Aprovecho.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.180
And Larry had a
drawing of a design

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.120
for an institutional stove that
didn't have a metal combustion

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.480
chamber.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.340
At the time, the
conventional wisdom

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.290
was, you can't use metal to
build rocket stove combustion

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.750
chambers.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.410
But Damon was stubborn,
as engineers who are right

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.710
sometimes can be.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.000
And he said, everyone thought
ceramic was the way to go.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.770
But my experiments keep showing
that the best results came out

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.430
of a metal combustion chamber.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.080
So Damon designed his
metal combustion chamber,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.350
and wanted to build and
test his barrel stoves

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.100
in the field, where the
experiment would do some good.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.680
So he soon found a place
that needed some stoves.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.530
At the time, our
friend Ken Goyer

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.220
had just started Aid Africa, a
nonprofit in northern Uganda,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.860
where the Lord's Resistance
Army, led by Joseph Kony,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.660
was terrorizing the region.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.280
Damon traveled there in 2007.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.720
And he brought with him
through customs a dozen

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.590
different combustion
chambers, each

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.460
made from different
high-temperature alloys not

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.080
available in African markets.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.700
And Damon trained a
team of local workers

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.420
to build this first 12 prototype
stoves using local pots,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.334
and local parts.

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:28.000
But used the combustion
chambers that he

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
had brought to make a variety
of field-testing prototypes.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.180
He placed the stoves in
several institutions,

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.100
including the Laroo School
for War-Affected Children.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.300
And a year later, he
came back to measure

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.530
how the different combustion
chambers had worked, and held

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.270
up when put through
rigorous daily use.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.960
When he returned to
Oregon after this,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.680
to design the first
60-liter stoves,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.440
that's when I met up with him.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.450
Now, Damon and I hit
it off pretty quick,

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.700
and realized we shared
a passion to serve,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.230
and a vision of realistic
approaches to the development

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.020
and the proliferation
of technology

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.560
to serve the world's
poorest people.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.890
We continue our
close collaboration.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.300
And Damon today still directs
our research and development

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.109
department.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:23.569
And I head up the day-to-day
operations of our organization.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.970
In 2008 and 2009, we continued
testing and tinkering

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.295
and improving Damon's model.

00:17:30.295 --> 00:17:32.380
And our first
break came in 2010,

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.730
when the German international
cooperation and aid

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.330
agency called GIZ
asked us to do a pilot

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.150
project with 60-liter stoves
in a girls' school in Bita,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.095
in northern Nigeria.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.370
The Bita Girls Secondary
School is an amazing place,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:55.800
a school with 1,600
female students, divided

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.040
between Muslim and
Christians, where

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.960
there are no
religious conflicts.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.630
And I traveled there in 2010,
and installed three stoves,

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.410
which reduced the school's
fuel costs by 75%.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.460
The stoves were so
efficient that they

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.480
paid for the installation
in seven months.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480
Four years later,
these three stoves

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.580
are still providing the
food for the 1,600 students.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.280
And the head cook,
Hajia Ishmael,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.460
the woman who brought
her infant son with her

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.290
to work on her back every
day, shared this with me.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.550
"With the new stoves,
my eyes don't water.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.170
My chest doesn't hurt.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.960
My back doesn't ache.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.770
And the baby on my back
has stopped crying."

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.700
This project was so successful,
we soon had an order in hand

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.610
from a UN agency for
200 stoves for Darfur.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.760
Since 2010, we've placed over
1,000 stoves in 25 countries,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.880
including 15 countries
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.150
Damon and I agreed
early on that bringing

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.940
not just the technology,
but the production of stoves

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.610
to a country-- just like
he had done in Uganda--

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.660
was the ultimate goal.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.290
So we developed a
stove production method

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.680
to be replicable,
and created a method

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.100
we call Stove Factory in a Box.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.820
Now, in this model, we put
all the materials and tools

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.450
necessary to build our stoves
into a shipping container.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.500
We ship this container
to an in-country partner.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.230
And then, following the
arrival of the container,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.110
we send a team of
InStove's stove builders

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.510
to teach local workers
how to replicate

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.780
our manufacturing process.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.450
What we found in our research
and development of the stove

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.540
was that the difference
of the few millimeters

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.540
could cost 15% or 20%
percent in efficiency.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.470
Our stoves require
precision manufacturing.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.670
So we designed our
system to force precision

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.910
through the use of custom jigs
and very exacting standards.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:09.900
Our factory runs
on minimal energy,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.480
and can easily be powered
by the few tasks that

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.920
require electricity
with a small generator.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.520
By transferring our
tools and know-how,

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.520
we can train in-country
workers to build stoves

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.040
to our precise
one-millimeter tolerances.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.090
And with Stove
Factory in a Box, we

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.530
can bring production
anywhere in the world.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.260
Our goal for each country
where we are needed

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.850
is to begin with
small pilot projects,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.350
and then bring a larger number
of stoves for market testing.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.440
And then, if there's
sufficient demand,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.420
we explore partnerships
and pursue funding

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.080
to open a factory in-country.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.840
By opening these
local factories,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.070
we create living-wage jobs.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.660
We increase local
economic independence.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.150
And we make our stove
initiative truly sustainable.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.870
By now, you may be
wondering, well,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.590
how good are our stoves, really?

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:09.310
From the beginning,
and for seven years,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.410
we've continued to improve our
design, testing it in the lab

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.840
and in the field.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.650
And now, our stoves
are independently

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:20.410
verified by third-party
testing labs

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.400
and by hundreds of
users in the field

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.720
to consistently accomplish
the following results.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.760
They reduce carbon monoxide and
particulate matter emissions

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.120
by 90%.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.320
They cut fuel use by 75%-90%.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.580
And they reduce cooking
time by 50% or more.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.160
The International
Standards Organization

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.150
has an International
Workshop Agreement, or IWA,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.870
that's measuring clean cook
stoves in 11 categories,

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.170
or indicators, that are ranked
on a scale from one to four,

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.860
with four being the
highest ranking.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.410
In nine out of
these 11 indicators,

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.270
our stoves are ranked four.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.770
These indicators primarily
measure emissions-- including

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.210
carbon monoxide and
particulate matter-- produced

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.000
at both high and low powers.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.280
In the world of
stoves, high power

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.150
means the power you need to
bring a pot of food to a boil,

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.550
or a pot of water to
a boil in the lab.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.320
And low power means
the amount you

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.370
need to keep it
simmering as you cook.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.850
In our stove, the temperatures
within the combustion chamber

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.990
reach up to 1,150
degrees Celsius.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.320
That's over 2,000
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.620
And our stove is burning so
hot that it literally burns up

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.740
the smoke.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.650
But how does this
compare to other stoves?

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.760
This chart, completed
by researchers

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.000
across the bay at the
Berkeley Air Monitoring Group,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.560
compare particular matter
and carbon monoxide produced

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.750
at high power in
different kinds of stoves,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.070
including charcoal
stoves and pellet

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.220
stoves, fan-driven stoves that
require electricity, chimney

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.360
stoves, and griddle stoves, and,
finally, liquid or gas stoves.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.290
And our institutional
rocket stove tests here.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.080
This puts our stove
two categories

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.710
above household rocket stoves.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.810
And it puts it nearly on a level
as clean burning as liquid fuel

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.410
or gas stoves.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.840
The only way to
improve our performance

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.360
would be to change the fuel.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.450
And until natural gas
or LPG grows on trees,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.010
it probably isn't a
viable alternative.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.400
As to cost
effectiveness, our stoves

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.890
are so efficient
that in fuel savings,

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.980
they pay for themselves, in
most cases, in just over a year

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.630
of use.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.210
Here, you can see
our stove being

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.750
used alongside some really
rudimentary improved stoves

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.300
in Senegal.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.550
When we set up our
stove to cook here,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.980
we couldn't find any
small wood prepared,

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.470
because they use large wood to
heat their large pots of food.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.440
So we had to find--
the smallest stick

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.530
we could find was this one you
see jammed into the fuel slot.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.190
Our stoves run best on
small amounts of small wood

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.620
that can be
sustainably harvested

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.390
without destroying whole trees.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.170
But our stoves do
more than cook.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.140
Institutional stoves
produce much more firepower

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.340
than other stoves.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.000
And this energy can be harnessed
for additional applications.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.720
Our 100-liter stove works with a
gravity-fed, flow-through water

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.120
pasteurizer of our own design.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.220
And this pasteurizer
can produce over

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.490
200 gallons of potable
water per hour,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.690
using just a pencil's
weight of wood--

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.660
about five grams for
each liter produced.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.080
We field-tested this
pasteurizer in the Zambia

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.540
in October of 2013.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.130
And in the field,
just as in the lab,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:14.060
the pasteurizer eliminates
100% of water-borne pathogens.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.270
With the support of
the Geisse Foundation,

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.390
we're now in the research phase
of creating a high-flow sand

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.670
filter that will allow us to
address the issue of turbidity,

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.350
of particulate
matter in the water.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.280
With this upstream
filter, we'll be

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.360
able to filter out
solids, and make

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.860
water look as clean and
safe as it really is.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.430
We're exploring partnerships
to implement this technology

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.300
as part of rural
micro utilities that

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.860
can provide clean water
and sanitation and hygiene

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.900
trainings.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.130
And we're looking
at this pasteurizer

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:53.010
as the basis of
a micro business,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.060
providing clean water.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.330
Our 60-liter stove
is also paired

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.990
with an autoclave that can
sterilize medical equipment,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.820
making use of supplies
like bandages, dressings,

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.190
and scalpels.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.010
It's OK, Assitan.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.560
Yeah, you want to do that?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.530
OK.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:18.120
Bandages, dressings,
scalpels, needles

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.430
can be safe for reuse or
for hygienic disposal,

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.666
in accordance with
international medical standards.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:32.480
This ensemble is already saving
lives in Kenya, and Chad,

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.900
and Zambia, and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.780
Thank you.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.930
And we just completed a
pilot project in Kathmandu

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.250
that will introduce our
autoclave to rural clinics

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.730
across Nepal and help
remote centers there arrive

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:54.190
at international standards in
their waste-disposal practices.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:58.780
This pilot project also
represents our first entry

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.180
into Asian markets.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.810
Because all of our
technologies have

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.120
been designed to
work off the grid,

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.360
they're ideal for use in
settings where electricity

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.240
and modern fuels are scarce,
or unavailable-- places

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.430
like rural hospitals and
clinics, or refugee camps,

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.825
or in disaster-relief
situations.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.820
We have a long list
of R&amp;D projects,

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.370
intending to use the stove
for additional applications.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:36.050
On our list are a bread oven,
a water pump, a refrigeration

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.590
system, and a
cell-phone charging

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.880
station, all powered
by the InStove.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.000
We're a nonprofit organization.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.680
And we raise funds from
philanthropic donors,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.640
and sell stoves to
support our mission.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.550
With the importance of
the problems we solve,

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.230
and the effectiveness
with which we do it,

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.090
it might at first
seem hard to believe

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:04.570
that funding and clients
are difficult to both find

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.770
and maintain.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:10.710
But the markets for stoves
face many challenges, not least

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.280
of which is the volatility
of funding cycles.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.580
Our strategy for growth is to
build strategic partnerships

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:24.530
with agencies small and
large throughout the world.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.360
Getting life-changing
technology to the world's poor

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.570
is why we exist.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:35.650
Our mission is to improve
health, to enhance safety,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.120
and to reduce harm
to the environment

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.210
through the design, the
manufacture, and the delivery

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:47.350
of highly efficient stoves
and allied technologies

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.925
to the most vulnerable
populations worldwide.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:57.150
We joined the larger unified
fight against indoor pollution

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.090
as members of the Global
Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.910
It's a public-private
partnership,

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.040
led by the United
Nations Foundation.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.050
The Global Alliance
was born in 2010,

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.880
when then-Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton and a range

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.050
of leading international
public and private figures

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:21.180
launched it, with the ambitious
mission of transforming

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.380
the global market
for clean cook stoves

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.090
and fuels with a
specific goal of spurring

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.350
the adoption of clean cook
stoves and fuels in 100

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.710
million households by 2020.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.720
The Global Alliance
is leading the way

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.570
in raising consciousness
around this issue.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.960
And I think they said it best.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.510
"While some may think that the
poor cannot afford to adopt

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:50.160
clean cooking technologies, the
opposite is, in fact, the case.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.340
The poor pay heavily
for their lack of access

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:58.580
to clean cook stoves and fuels."

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.780
As we grow, our
priorities are to open

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.080
strategic foreign
production units

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.920
to bring production in-country
to the countries that need

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.410
our stoves the most.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.400
To improve our
value-chain management.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.310
To increase our
capacity-- including

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.180
creating several
new staff positions.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.390
To hire African
staff, especially

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.210
in the area of marketing
and last-mile distribution.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.140
And to expand into new markets.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.820
It's with these last
two priorities in mind

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.150
that I'd like to introduce
you to Assitan Sylla

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.380
Traore, the newest
member of InStove's team.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.050
Thank you.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.240
ASSITAN SYLLA TRAORE:
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.840
Hi, everybody.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.480
Thank you all for
being here today.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.770
We really appreciate it.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.240
I'm here today to
put a human face

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.060
on the work InStove
does around the world

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.500
to protect women
and save the planet.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.620
My name is Assitan.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.380
I'm InStove Africa's
project coordinator.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:25.070
I come from Mali, West Africa,
from an extended family.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.540
I have nine siblings.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:35.180
However, my mom cooked
to feed over 20 people.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.010
She raised over 20 children.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.990
I have four children.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.044
And, like my mom, I've
been cooking alone

00:31:43.044 --> 00:31:43.835
to feed the family.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.060
Before coming to
the United States,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.810
I went to school in
Russia, and graduated

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.280
from Moscow
Linguistic University,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.600
with a master's
degree in linguistics.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.430
I returned back home
to Mali, and worked

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.650
for 18 years in
diplomacy and government

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.840
and in the nonprofit sector.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.160
I worked as special assistant
to eight ambassadors of Nigeria

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.995
to Mali.

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:14.870
I also worked as special
assistant with Mali government

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.230
and in the prime
minister office.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.890
I've been always interested
in gender issues,

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.630
and intrigued by the disparity
between women and men

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.280
in our society.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.220
So this motivated me
to create a nonprofit

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.620
called Assa in Mali
to address issues

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.920
like girls' education and
women financial independence.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.010
However, after 18
years of experience,

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.600
I felt that I needed
to learn more,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.150
and realized that I
needed to learn more,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.790
to address better the issues
women are facing in my country.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.670
I therefore applied for--
and was granted-- a Fulbright

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.520
scholarship to study at
the University of Oregon

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.435
in gender, environment, and
environmental issues and women

00:33:06.435 --> 00:33:06.935
issues.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.890
So I first met InStove
during a stove demonstration

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.140
at the University of Oregon.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.280
I immediately saw the
importance of the work

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.270
on women, children,
and the planet.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:26.150
So, when I graduated
in the fall of 2013,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.840
and they offered to hire me
as Africa project coordinator,

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.060
I immediately
accepted the offer.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.700
Unlike in the United States and
in most developed countries,

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.500
the most common ways of cooking
in most African countries, even

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.540
today, is cooking the food
over a three-stone fire,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.790
exactly as you see
in this picture,

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:54.010
and as it's shown here.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.510
All generations
in my family have

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.500
cooked the food over
a three-stone fire,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.510
including myself.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.770
One of my cousins
was severely burned

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.540
when he was an infant, while my
aunt was holding him on her lap

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.739
and stirring food from a pot.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.719
The [INAUDIBLE] pot
accidentally fell on him,

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.300
and burned him badly.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.469
So he was disfigured.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:26.389
And he could no longer use his
left hand as a normal person.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:30.000
He's an adult now,
married with children.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.170
But he still has to
bear the consequences

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.320
of the open-fire cooking method.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.100
Growing up, I've
seen my mom cook

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.159
the food over a
three-stone fire.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.440
The walls of our kitchen back
home are all black from smoke.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.920
Traditionally,
being able to stand

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.610
smoke while using
a three-stone fire

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:58.960
is a rite of passage
for all girls.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.230
I remember once asking
my elder daughter,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.480
[? Fattouh, ?] to start
fire, because I needed

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.880
to fix breakfast for the family.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.400
So she tried for hours.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.560
The fire wouldn't start.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.210
And her eyes were red.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.620
She was coughing.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.550
And our entire kitchen
was filled with smoke.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.810
And she kept telling me,
Mama, I can't start the fire.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.900
And I kept telling her that
she needed to try harder,

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.890
because I thought she was just
being lazy, as all teenagers.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.720
So when I came to the
United States years later,

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.120
I started taking classes
and learning new things that

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.170
challenged the belief I
was told while growing up

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.000
that all girls
needed to learn how

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.720
to start a fire, no matter what.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.050
I realized that I was
too hard on my daughter.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.570
And I picked up
the phone one day.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.820
I called her to apologize
for being so hard on her.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.670
But I was trying-- I
was simply trying--

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.730
to prepare her to
become a better woman,

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.760
as I was taught
when I was a child.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.540
So cooking with a
three-stone fire method

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.970
has a lot of
consequences on women,

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.290
on people, and the environment.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:26.920
It leads to deforestation,
because the need is increasing,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.980
the demand is increasing.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.880
It also leads to
gender-based violence,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.290
because women have
to walk father

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:37.605
in the bush to collect wood
for the needs of the family.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:44.300
So open-fire cooking
also contributes

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.330
to lots of diseases, like
eyes, lungs, and heart disease.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.270
I have two of my
daughters who have

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.930
been diagnosed with
asthma, from smoke.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.270
Open-fire cooking
contributes also to burns,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.900
as was the case with my
little cousin, Mamadou,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.790
when he was an infant.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.030
It's also a big loss
of time for families.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.050
Because it takes hours
to just set the fire.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.080
And because it's not efficient.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.770
Most fire does not go directly
to the pot, because it's open.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.630
And it takes a lot of time.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.410
And women could use
this time to carry out

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.057
other income-generating
activities

00:37:25.057 --> 00:37:26.140
to support their families.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.890
So today, as an African
woman, and a mom

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.970
who has lived all these
things InStove has been trying

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:46.220
to address, I think that
it is unacceptable today,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.720
in this age of
high-technology development,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.920
for women and girls
to continue to suffer,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.602
to expose their lives to
danger, and harm their health,

00:37:56.602 --> 00:37:58.435
just because they want
to feed their family.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.170
But it does not have
to be like that.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.220
Because there is an alternative
to the three-stone cooking

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.770
fire method.

00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.480
InStove cook stove is here.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.220
It's safe, very fast,
efficient, because it does not

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.550
use a lot of the wood.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.040
And they do not
produce any smoke.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.190
So, in this picture, you can
see the quantity of wood needed

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:37.950
to cook the same
amount of food--

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.240
the small one using
an InStove cook stove,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.910
and a big one using a
three-stone, open-fire cooking

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.660
method.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.340
So I was curious.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.390
So I tried one day to
experiment by myself

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.800
cooking with an InStove, because
I have experience already

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.810
cooking with a three-stone
fire back home,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.110
and I really wanted to
cook with an InStove

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:01.380
to see how efficient it was.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.080
And it was so easy,
I thought to myself.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.595
And it was very easy to start.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.570
So as you can see
in this picture,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.680
you also have a relaxed posture.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.630
When you are using a three-stone
fire, you have to all the time

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.070
bend down.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.320
And you cannot even use
your nice clothes to cook,

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.470
because they will
be dark with smoke.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.950
And after you finish cooking,
your clothes will stink.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:29.900
You cannot even serve the food
without taking a shower before.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.990
So I was relaxed.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:38.080
And I could cook with dignity,
even in my nice clothes,

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.730
using an InStove--
which is not possible

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.442
with a three-stone
cooking fire method.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.480
So it was very fast.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:53.050
And I could put this stove
anywhere in the house,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.760
without worrying about
my walls being dark,

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.840
or smoke being around the house.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.410
So it was a great experience.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.260
And it's a really
efficient stove.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.630
So how can all of us together
address these issues?

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.230
So I really believe
in the mission

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.990
InStove is doing around the
world to save the environment

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.840
and protect women.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.180
Because I have lived
all these issues

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.960
InStove is trying to solve.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.970
And I have experience
about all these things

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.860
it's trying to address.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.800
So I hope that all
of you here today

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.100
will join me to support InStove,
to bring this life-saving stove

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:46.290
to people who need it the
most around the world.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.930
So you can be involved by
trying to learn more about us

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:55.180
on our website, by
typing www.instove.org.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.010
We have a good
volunteer program.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.020
You can volunteer with us
in Cottage Grove, Oregon.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.200
And also, you can help
us with new ideas,

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.800
because there is always
room for improvement.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.860
And also, you can
support our mission.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.980
We're a small nonprofit.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.227
And our work is being
made possible by donations

00:41:15.227 --> 00:41:16.060
from our supporters.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.280
So on this note, I
would like to thank

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.480
you very much for
your attention.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.630
And if you have any
questions, Fred and I

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:28.040
would be happy to
answer your questions.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:28.780
Thank you.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.630
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering how much

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.810
it costs to install an
InStove, like, generally.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.070
FRED COLGAN: OK, the
pricing is-- this stove,

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:46.970
this 60-liter stove,
costs $950 US.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.760
That's our humanitarian price.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.910
We have a stove nearly twice as
big, which is a 100-liter pot.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.440
And that's $1,300 US.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.400
So we're priced for
institutional cooking.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.120
And where these are
placed, primarily,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.380
are organizations that have some
sense of cost-benefit analysis.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.630
So they can see very
early-- very quickly

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.380
that the stove pays for
itself very quickly, just

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.550
with fuel costs alone.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:15.500
Yeah.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.260
AUDIENCE: I was
curious, just like,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.120
if you were to do like a
big fundraising effort.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.310
You know, sometimes
for people, it's

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.270
better to see, like, oh, you're
buying x amount of stoves--

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.540
just try to set fundraising
goals and stuff.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.290
FRED COLGAN: Yeah.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.862
We partner with a lot of NGOs.

00:42:30.862 --> 00:42:32.820
So a lot of groups come
to us and say, well, we

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.870
want to get two stoves for our
project and the orphanage we

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.820
support in Kenya.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.240
So they raise the money
for a couple of stoves.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.810
And bingo, there they are.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.837
And that's how we got to many of
our countries around the world.

00:42:49.837 --> 00:42:51.920
ASSITAN SYLLA TRAORE: And
what I would like to add

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.770
is that our stoves are designed
for use in institutions,

00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.000
like school feeding programs,
orphanages, hospitals,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.850
where people cook large
quantities of food

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.150
to feed many people at a time.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.670
So they are not
meant for family.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.850
This is the institutional size.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.300
FRED COLGAN: But there are
also commercial applications.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.870
So commercial cooks
could use this stove

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.620
and save money and protect
their health at the same time.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.516
Yeah.

00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.860
Yeah.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.500
As I said, I'm from Ivory Coast.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.480
And my childhood had
been similar to yours.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.450
I was lucky enough to
more from the village

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:34.470
at an early age
to go to the city.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.900
So I saved my eyes
a little bit, but.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:46.200
[LAUGHS] And thank you for
this great innovation, really.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:52.050
I mean, I know that you think
of bigger institutions, and kind

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.020
of bigger cooking.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:00.040
And I can see it's really
good to be able to do that.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.070
But have you thought also
in terms of family, kind of?

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:07.430
Because in some parts of
Africa nowadays-- I mean,

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:12.080
where there's relative peace,
their bigger concern remains

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.099
in terms of feeding their
family in a small kind of--

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:16.140
have you thought of that?

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.570
And also, when you go to
African big institutions, what

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.550
are the challenges you face?

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.084
Have you--

00:44:25.084 --> 00:44:25.750
FRED COLGAN: Ok.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.060
Well, OK.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.600
Several questions there.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.750
First, household stoves--
we decided early on

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:37.590
to address this one niche
to build institutional cook

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.980
stoves for institutional
situations.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.890
That's about 10% of
all the cooking that

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.570
takes place,
particularly in Africa.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.480
Household cooking-- there
are a lot of players

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.870
now in the global markets.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.900
The Global Alliance is
promoting the development

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.990
of household stoves, primarily.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.960
It's much more complicated
than institutional cooking.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:08.020
Household stoves need to be
designed for very low prices

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.630
to accomplish a lot.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.990
And then they need to
be adopted by women,

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.370
whose primary interest
is that the food tastes

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.740
like their grandma's
food tasted.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.660
And that's very tricky to
do, to change technologies.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.080
So it's been-- it's
an ongoing challenge

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.860
to convince women to change
their cooking habits to adopt

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.550
more modern stoves.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.120
And also, to come up with
the money to pay for them.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.300
It's-- at $10 or $15 or $20,
that's a very expensive stove

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.540
in African markets.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.620
And it's very hard to
deliver an industrial product

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.440
for those kind of prices.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.510
So, like I said, there
are many players.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:56.170
We're focused on institutions.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.640
And we're going to let
our colleagues address

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.110
the household cooking issue.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.770
We may get drawn into
that at some point.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.980
But for the moment, we're
going to stay focused.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:13.530
The challenges are huge--
logistical challenges.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:19.560
To get stoves from Oregon
to anywhere in Africa,

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.430
there are all kinds of
issues that come up.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:26.690
Just the raw logistics of
getting shipments into country

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.150
through customs,
past corruption,

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:35.110
and into the hands of
users is very challenging.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.620
Finding funding sources,
finding agencies

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.820
who can afford
the stoves and can

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.260
afford to participate in
development is very tricky.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.260
There are a host of
problems-- host of challenges,

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.420
I would say.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.590
We're still overcoming them.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.180
We're learning to overcome them.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.900
We have a container of stoves
arriving this week in Kampala,

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.080
in Uganda, for a
wider distribution.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.350
So that's the second tier
of our development strategy.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:06.310
We're learning.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.970
We're a small organization.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:12.750
Some of my team are absolutely
fantastic at logistics--

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:20.110
and now, increasingly, at
developing markets in Africa.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:23.690
AUDIENCE: What is the
lifetime for a stove?

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:26.600
FRED COLGAN: Well, when we
started, we weren't sure.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.330
We've had stoves in the
field now for four years,

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.240
with almost zero failure rate.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.630
So we're waiting for
that first failure point.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.250
We think somewhere in
year five, year six,

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.850
we're going to see some
deterioration of some

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.000
of the parts.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.470
But these are
interchangeable parts.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.740
So with maintenance, we're
confident a ten-year lifespan

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.830
is possible, and maybe longer.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:59.250
The only stoves that have failed
have been left out in the rain.

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:02.520
So we're looking at a
very, very long livelihood

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.500
for these stoves.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.140
I want to thank you for coming.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.950
And I want to thank you, Dan,
for hosting us, and making

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.187
this possible.

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:12.020
DAN: Thank you for
coming, Fred and Assitan.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:12.853
FRED COLGAN: Thanks.

00:48:12.853 --> 00:48:17.500
And please don't
hesitate to contact us.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.800
And please, spread
the word about us.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.460
We only survive by
the partnerships

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.340
and the collaborations
that we make.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.300
Thank you very much.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.091
ASSITAN SYLLA TRAORE:
Thank you for coming.

00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:32.230
