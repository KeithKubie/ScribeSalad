HONEST TRAILER: STAR TREK

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.960
VOICE
From JJ Abrams, the visionary

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.590
behind Star Wars episode 7, and
Felicity...comes a reboot impossible not to

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.349
enjoy. Unless you're William
Shatner.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.710
VOICE (CONT'D)
Star Trek.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.619
VOICE (CONT'D)
The cool new franchise that used

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.390
time travel gobbledygook to throw away 50 years of canon.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.489
But who cares! Star Trek is
awesome again.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.800
VOICE (CONT'D)
Meet Nero. A Romulan out for

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.890
vengeance after his home planet is
destroyed.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.500
He'll be given a second chance to
save his species when a black hole

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.310
sends him back in time. But instead
of warning the Romulans about their

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.620
impending doom, he'll drift around
waiting in space for 25 years.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.240
Come on, they don't have phones in
space?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.829
VOICE (CONT'D)
But there's one man who can stop

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.070
him...Captain Pike...who's quickly
captured.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.020
VOICE (CONT'D)
Leaving only one other

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.270
man...Commander Spock...who quits
after an emotional breakdown.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.390
VOICE (CONT'D)
Leaving only one other other man

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.310
who can stop him...

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.750
VOICE (CONT'D)

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.330
Captain James T. Kirk, an angry

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.710
drunk who is accepted into

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.150
Starfleet without any paperwork,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.890
background checks or medical

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.420
evaluations.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.810
VOICE (CONT'D)
Come aboard, as Kirk commands the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.250
USS Enterprise. The federation's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.799
heavily armed Apple store, full of

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.070
Mac Geniuses who rise through the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.080
ranks, not because of service or

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.350
aptitude, but because of things

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.610
like...

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.740
VOICE (CONT'D)
...the flu

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.340
VOICE (CONT'D)
Death.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.409
Gross incompetence.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.240
VOICE (CONTï¿½D)
And sheer proximity to a clean uniform.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.619
VOICE (CONT'D)
Experience a film that made nerds

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.049
cry...

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.330
VOICE (CONT'D)
Nerds cheer...

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.479
VOICE (CONT'D)
And nerds go...whuh?

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.659
VOICE (CONT'D)
Explore a brand new Star Trek

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.480
universe that takes all the Star
Trek aliens you know and love...and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.819
doesn't show any of them. Instead
witness:

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.939
VOICE (CONT'D)
Big eyes!

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.079
VOICE (CONT'D)
Long Face!

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.519
VOICE (CONT'D)
Tic-Tac Eyes!

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.499
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Tan Mom!

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.219
VOICE (CONT'D)
Prepare to be blown away by what

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.060
was essentially JJ Abram's Star
Wars demo reel.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.060
VOICE (CONT'D)
It's a saga that asks all the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.379
important questions, like: why does
Chris Pine make this same stupid

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.900
face every time he gets punched?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.480
VOICE (CONT'D)
And oh, Winona Ryder's still working?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.730
VOICE (CONT'D)
And oh, Winona Ryder's still working?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.689
VOICE (CONT'D)
So blast off into a new era of

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.340
actually watchable Star Trek films,
filled with action, excitement,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.129
and...lens flares.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.180
VOICE (CONT'D)
And even more flares!

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:27.469
VOICE (CONT'D)
Seriously, how can anyone even see on this ship?

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.419
VOICE (CONT'D)
Man that was cool. So how long til

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.879
