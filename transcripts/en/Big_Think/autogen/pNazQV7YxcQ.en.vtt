00:11:59.420 --> 00:11:59.430
cognitive science from developmental
 

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.980
cognitive science from developmental
psychology etc and look at where there

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:03.990
psychology etc and look at where there
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.170
psychology etc and look at where there
were longitudinal studies what had

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180
were longitudinal studies what had
 

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.320
were longitudinal studies what had
happened in that child's life to help

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.330
happened in that child's life to help
 

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.880
happened in that child's life to help
that child throg now and in the future

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:10.890
that child throg now and in the future
 

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.940
that child throg now and in the future
and that's how the seven skills actually

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:13.950
and that's how the seven skills actually
 

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.160
and that's how the seven skills actually
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.170
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is
 

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.300
emerged in a sense the seventh skill is
kind of cumulative which is

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.310
kind of cumulative which is
 

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.370
kind of cumulative which is
self-directed engaged learning it kind

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380
self-directed engaged learning it kind
 

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.650
self-directed engaged learning it kind
of pulls them all together and focus in

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660
of pulls them all together and focus in
 

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.840
of pulls them all together and focus in
self-control the first skill is is a

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:23.850
self-control the first skill is is a
 

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.810
self-control the first skill is is a
baseline in a sense because if you can't

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820
baseline in a sense because if you can't
 

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.730
baseline in a sense because if you can't
pay attention you can't really learn the

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740
pay attention you can't really learn the
 

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.290
pay attention you can't really learn the
other skills if you don't have a

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300
other skills if you don't have a
 

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.270
other skills if you don't have a
self-control to not go on automatic then

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.280
self-control to not go on automatic then
 

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.280
self-control to not go on automatic then
you can't really learn to listen to what

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:34.290
you can't really learn to listen to what
 

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.900
you can't really learn to listen to what
someone else says for example what's

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:35.910
someone else says for example what's
 

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.970
someone else says for example what's
perspective-taking but you know the

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
perspective-taking but you know the
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.580
perspective-taking but you know the
response to mine in the making has been

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:43.590
response to mine in the making has been
 

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.280
response to mine in the making has been
so much more than I ever expected

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:45.290
so much more than I ever expected
 

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.140
so much more than I ever expected
because these are obvious but they're

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.150
because these are obvious but they're
 

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.030
because these are obvious but they're
hidden in plain sight but they're so

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040
hidden in plain sight but they're so
 

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.620
hidden in plain sight but they're so
simple to do something about I mean we

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:51.630
simple to do something about I mean we
 

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.840
simple to do something about I mean we
can teach these two adults we can teach

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:53.850
can teach these two adults we can teach
 

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.370
can teach these two adults we can teach
them to children we can promote them in

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380
them to children we can promote them in
 

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.860
them to children we can promote them in
ourselves and it can make a big

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:57.870
ourselves and it can make a big
 

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.700
ourselves and it can make a big
difference in our lives if I can

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:01.710
difference in our lives if I can
 

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.670
difference in our lives if I can
interject before we take it over to

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680
interject before we take it over to
 

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.020
interject before we take it over to
Patrick again you know one of the things

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.030
Patrick again you know one of the things
 

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.740
Patrick again you know one of the things
Ellen that I like most about what you're

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:09.750
Ellen that I like most about what you're
 

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.750
Ellen that I like most about what you're
saying in the book and in the mentor

workshop is that the seven essential

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880
workshop is that the seven essential
 

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.070
workshop is that the seven essential
life skills basically you know which are

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:18.080
life skills basically you know which are
 

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.269
life skills basically you know which are
the skills that we need to

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279
the skills that we need to
 

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.699
the skills that we need to
be fully functional successful human

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:22.709
be fully functional successful human
 

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:26.269
be fully functional successful human
beings basically come down to learning

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279
beings basically come down to learning
 

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:28.670
beings basically come down to learning
as a life like a lifelong orientation

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680
as a life like a lifelong orientation
 

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.189
as a life like a lifelong orientation
toward learning they enable us to learn

00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199
toward learning they enable us to learn
 

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:33.470
toward learning they enable us to learn
they they you know they make us

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480
they they you know they make us
 

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.749
they they you know they make us
effective learners and and it sort of

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:35.759
effective learners and and it sort of
 

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.360
effective learners and and it sort of
represents human beings as learning

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:38.370
represents human beings as learning
 

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.519
represents human beings as learning
being throughout the lifespan which is

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:40.529
being throughout the lifespan which is
 

00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:44.210
being throughout the lifespan which is
something that I mean on there you know

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220
something that I mean on there you know
 

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.889
something that I mean on there you know
two things one is we tend to think of

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899
two things one is we tend to think of
 

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:47.809
two things one is we tend to think of
learning as something that stops when

00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:47.819
learning as something that stops when
 

00:13:47.819 --> 00:13:50.389
learning as something that stops when
you graduate from graduate school I mean

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399
you graduate from graduate school I mean
 

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.879
you graduate from graduate school I mean
not not you know in some ways no but in

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:52.889
not not you know in some ways no but in
 

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.009
not not you know in some ways no but in
some ways yes like I'm done my learning

00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019
some ways yes like I'm done my learning
 

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:57.769
some ways yes like I'm done my learning
and now i'm doing my life um you know

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779
and now i'm doing my life um you know
 

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:01.369
and now i'm doing my life um you know
and and and and so the idea of that that

00:14:01.369 --> 00:14:01.379
and and and and so the idea of that that
 

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:02.569
and and and and so the idea of that that
you're learning throughout your life is

00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:02.579
you're learning throughout your life is
 

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:03.679
you're learning throughout your life is
not something that people necessarily

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:03.689
not something that people necessarily
 

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.860
not something that people necessarily
actively engage in you know um past

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:06.870
actively engage in you know um past
 

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.889
actively engage in you know um past
school and then you know secondly we

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899
school and then you know secondly we
 

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:11.900
school and then you know secondly we
always have this back and forth where on

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:11.910
always have this back and forth where on
 

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.249
always have this back and forth where on
the one hand we understand that it's

00:14:13.249 --> 00:14:13.259
the one hand we understand that it's
 

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:14.929
the one hand we understand that it's
good for children to be curious and that

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:14.939
good for children to be curious and that
 

00:14:14.939 --> 00:14:17.150
good for children to be curious and that
we want them to be active learners you

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160
we want them to be active learners you
 

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.619
we want them to be active learners you
know in education and designing

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:18.629
know in education and designing
 

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:20.449
know in education and designing
curriculum and so forth and on the other

00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459
curriculum and so forth and on the other
 

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:24.470
curriculum and so forth and on the other
hand we have these exigencies of skills

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480
hand we have these exigencies of skills
 

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.150
hand we have these exigencies of skills
and so forth that we feel we have to

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160
and so forth that we feel we have to
 

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.249
and so forth that we feel we have to
teach children concrete things so that

00:14:28.249 --> 00:14:28.259
teach children concrete things so that
 

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:30.110
teach children concrete things so that
they can remain competitive and so forth

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120
they can remain competitive and so forth
 

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.319
they can remain competitive and so forth
and so on that often you know create

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:33.329
and so on that often you know create
 

00:14:33.329 --> 00:14:35.119
and so on that often you know create
curriculums and school systems that do

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:35.129
curriculums and school systems that do
 

00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:37.249
curriculums and school systems that do
the exact opposite that as you say put

00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:37.259
the exact opposite that as you say put
 

00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:39.949
the exact opposite that as you say put
out the fire and no children sighs yeah

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959
out the fire and no children sighs yeah
 

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:43.610
out the fire and no children sighs yeah
so I mean um you know I wonder kind of

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620
so I mean um you know I wonder kind of
 

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.530
so I mean um you know I wonder kind of
what it would take for the orientation

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540
what it would take for the orientation
 

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.189
what it would take for the orientation
of whole educational systems to shift in

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199
of whole educational systems to shift in
 

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.740
of whole educational systems to shift in
such a way that we are focusing on these

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:51.750
such a way that we are focusing on these
 

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.689
such a way that we are focusing on these
kind of meta skills that make for better

00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699
kind of meta skills that make for better
 

00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:56.079
kind of meta skills that make for better
learners you know not only in

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:56.089
learners you know not only in
 

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:59.090
learners you know not only in
progressive schools but also you know

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100
progressive schools but also you know
 

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.730
progressive schools but also you know
everywhere more than we are on concrete

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740
everywhere more than we are on concrete
 

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.999
everywhere more than we are on concrete
right no that is such a great question i

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:05.009
right no that is such a great question i
 

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:08.240
right no that is such a great question i
just love that so much because and all

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.250
just love that so much because and all
 

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.919
just love that so much because and all
of these are great questions and the

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:09.929
of these are great questions and the
 

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:11.660
of these are great questions and the
reason that i love it so much is that

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:11.670
reason that i love it so much is that
 

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.230
reason that i love it so much is that
it's it's like the notion of

is a very industrial era notion now I

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:39.270
is a very industrial era notion now I
 

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.240

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.790
information that is very hard to know
what's what's real I mean you can watch

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:31.800
what's what's real I mean you can watch
 

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.380
what's what's real I mean you can watch
the same news story on two different

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.390
the same news story on two different
 

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.350
the same news story on two different
channels and to get to totally same

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360
channels and to get to totally same
 

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.860
channels and to get to totally same
event presumably and you get two totally

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:39.870
event presumably and you get two totally
 

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.020
event presumably and you get two totally
different interpretations depending on

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.030
different interpretations depending on
 

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.500
different interpretations depending on
the point of view of the commentator and

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:45.510
the point of view of the commentator and
 

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.450
the point of view of the commentator and
the channels that you've happen to turn

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460
the channels that you've happen to turn
 

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.390
the channels that you've happen to turn
into a radio the same or newspapers the

into a radio the same or newspapers the
 

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.010
into a radio the same or newspapers the
same anyway that we get information

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020
same anyway that we get information
 

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.540
same anyway that we get information
about the world that we don't directly

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:53.550
about the world that we don't directly
 

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.620
about the world that we don't directly
experience and how do we know how to

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:57.630
experience and how do we know how to
 

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.840
experience and how do we know how to
make decisions because our decisions who

00:19:59.840 --> 00:19:59.850
make decisions because our decisions who
 

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.539
make decisions because our decisions who
we vote for

00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:01.549
we vote for
 

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:04.289
we vote for
how we live our lives depend on how we

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:04.299
how we live our lives depend on how we
 

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:06.999
how we live our lives depend on how we
see this experience that where we don't

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:07.009
see this experience that where we don't
 

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:09.460
see this experience that where we don't
have direct knowledge of it I mean we

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.470
have direct knowledge of it I mean we
 

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.729
have direct knowledge of it I mean we
can't you know maybe in in a very pre

00:20:12.729 --> 00:20:12.739
can't you know maybe in in a very pre
 

00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:15.129
can't you know maybe in in a very pre
industrial agricultural world we could

00:20:15.129 --> 00:20:15.139
industrial agricultural world we could
 

00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:17.560
industrial agricultural world we could
have direct experience with everything

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:17.570
have direct experience with everything
 

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.210
have direct experience with everything
that we needed to know about we can't do

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:19.220
that we needed to know about we can't do
 

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.529
that we needed to know about we can't do
that anymore we have we have to

00:20:20.529 --> 00:20:20.539
that anymore we have we have to
 

00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:23.249
that anymore we have we have to
outsource our knowledge so I think that

00:20:23.249 --> 00:20:23.259
outsource our knowledge so I think that
 

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:25.840
outsource our knowledge so I think that
by and large critical thinking is an

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:25.850
by and large critical thinking is an
 

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.629
by and large critical thinking is an
important skill because it's the ongoing

00:20:28.629 --> 00:20:28.639
important skill because it's the ongoing
 

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:31.509
important skill because it's the ongoing
searching the word ongoings is critical

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:31.519
searching the word ongoings is critical
 

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:34.060
searching the word ongoings is critical
here the ongoing search for ballot and

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.070
here the ongoing search for ballot and
 

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.180
here the ongoing search for ballot and
reliable information so you have to

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.190
reliable information so you have to
 

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:41.470
reliable information so you have to
understand when information is not

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480
understand when information is not
 

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.899
understand when information is not
accurate when it's what researchers

00:20:43.899 --> 00:20:43.909
accurate when it's what researchers
 

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.090
accurate when it's what researchers
would call confounded because you can't

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.100
would call confounded because you can't
 

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.930
would call confounded because you can't
say that a always leads to be you you

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:49.940
say that a always leads to be you you
 

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.460
say that a always leads to be you you
know it's just it's more complicated

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:51.470
know it's just it's more complicated
 

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.999
know it's just it's more complicated
than that and other things get in there

00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:55.009
than that and other things get in there
 

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:59.049
than that and other things get in there
and so I think teaching children not

00:20:59.049 --> 00:20:59.059
and so I think teaching children not
 

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:02.289
and so I think teaching children not
just let's say science but how

00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:02.299
just let's say science but how
 

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:05.830
just let's say science but how
scientific thinking takes place has been

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840
scientific thinking takes place has been
 

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.789
scientific thinking takes place has been
found to improve them in all sorts of

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799
found to improve them in all sorts of
 

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:11.409
found to improve them in all sorts of
other areas i'm thinking of the research

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:11.419
other areas i'm thinking of the research
 

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:14.289
other areas i'm thinking of the research
that's going on at carnegie mellon by

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:14.299
that's going on at carnegie mellon by
 

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:16.960
that's going on at carnegie mellon by
David Clarke for example he found that

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:16.970
David Clarke for example he found that
 

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.720
David Clarke for example he found that
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:19.730
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade
 

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.090
kids in the seventh grade eighth grade
etc were never thought how to conduct a

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:22.100
etc were never thought how to conduct a
 

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.099
etc were never thought how to conduct a
good experiment they were always told

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:24.109
good experiment they were always told
 

00:21:24.109 --> 00:21:25.629
good experiment they were always told
here's the experiment and here's what it

00:21:25.629 --> 00:21:25.639
here's the experiment and here's what it
 

00:21:25.639 --> 00:21:27.789
here's the experiment and here's what it
learned but not how do you know whether

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799
learned but not how do you know whether
 

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:29.379
learned but not how do you know whether
it's a really good experiment and when

00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:29.389
it's a really good experiment and when
 

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:32.200
it's a really good experiment and when
he actually taught kids how what a good

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.210
he actually taught kids how what a good
 

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.820
he actually taught kids how what a good
experiment was and how would how would

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:33.830
experiment was and how would how would
 

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.310
experiment was and how would how would
you know what you've learned from this

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320
you know what you've learned from this
 

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.759
you know what you've learned from this
experiment it made a big difference in

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:38.769
experiment it made a big difference in
 

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:42.940
experiment it made a big difference in
in the kids lives and performance so I

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:42.950
in the kids lives and performance so I
 

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.529
in the kids lives and performance so I
think by and large it's mostly a

00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:44.539
think by and large it's mostly a
 

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:48.190
think by and large it's mostly a
positive result but of course you know

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200
positive result but of course you know
 

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.710
positive result but of course you know
we get lots of knowledge that it's hard

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720
we get lots of knowledge that it's hard
 

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.479
we get lots of knowledge that it's hard
to figure out whether it is reliable and

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:52.489
to figure out whether it is reliable and
 

00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:54.669
to figure out whether it is reliable and
accurate and I guess that's the bad side

00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679
accurate and I guess that's the bad side
 

00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:56.229
accurate and I guess that's the bad side
of it how do we know with you know the

00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:56.239
of it how do we know with you know the
 

00:21:56.239 --> 00:21:58.479
of it how do we know with you know the
thousands of Twitter fees we get every

00:21:58.479 --> 00:21:58.489
thousands of Twitter fees we get every
 

00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:01.080
thousands of Twitter fees we get every
day what's real and what's not real

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.090
day what's real and what's not real
 

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.129
day what's real and what's not real
definitely and I think that's what kind

00:22:03.129 --> 00:22:03.139
definitely and I think that's what kind
 

00:22:03.139 --> 00:22:06.249
definitely and I think that's what kind
of Drew me too big think is um why not

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:06.259
of Drew me too big think is um why not
 

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:08.680
of Drew me too big think is um why not
independently learned myself I go I'll

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:08.690
independently learned myself I go I'll
 

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.480
independently learned myself I go I'll
use like databases through school and

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.490
use like databases through school and
 

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.609
use like databases through school and
like go after research-based articles

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:12.619
like go after research-based articles
 

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:14.560
like go after research-based articles
and there's a bunch information you know

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:14.570
and there's a bunch information you know
 

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.670
and there's a bunch information you know
bunch of different article

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:15.680
bunch of different article
 

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.080
bunch of different article
bunch of and places to draw this

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.090
bunch of and places to draw this
 

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.120
bunch of and places to draw this
information from and I'm not saying it

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.130
information from and I'm not saying it
 

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.480
information from and I'm not saying it
was a bad way to do it but um I like how

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:22.490
was a bad way to do it but um I like how
 

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.400
was a bad way to do it but um I like how
big thing takes it into a different

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:24.410
big thing takes it into a different
 

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.930
big thing takes it into a different
perspective and like kind of breaks it

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:25.940
perspective and like kind of breaks it
 

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.910
perspective and like kind of breaks it
down for you and helps you understand it

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:27.920
down for you and helps you understand it
 

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.590
down for you and helps you understand it
in in terms of your own life and what

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600
in in terms of your own life and what
 

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.930
in in terms of your own life and what
you're doing so thank you for that well

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:31.940
you're doing so thank you for that well
 

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.970
you're doing so thank you for that well
I'm a total fan of big think when when

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:33.980
I'm a total fan of big think when when
 

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.830
I'm a total fan of big think when when
we decided to work together I was like I

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840
we decided to work together I was like I
 

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.720
we decided to work together I was like I
couldn't have been more wildly excited

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:37.730
couldn't have been more wildly excited

as Jason knows because he got my
euphoric email us back to him when we

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.250
euphoric email us back to him when we
 

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.490
euphoric email us back to him when we
started this conversation I think that

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:45.500
started this conversation I think that
 

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.480
started this conversation I think that
it brings people together in a way that

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:49.490
it brings people together in a way that
 

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.240
it brings people together in a way that
we can now with technology I mean we can

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.250
we can now with technology I mean we can
 

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.240
we can now with technology I mean we can
have this conversation and you know you

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:55.250
have this conversation and you know you
 

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.190
have this conversation and you know you
can push back at me and I love that and

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200
can push back at me and I love that and
 

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.230
can push back at me and I love that and
I can hopefully push back at you and I

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240
I can hopefully push back at you and I
 

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.480
I can hopefully push back at you and I
love that too we can have we can do the

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:01.490
love that too we can have we can do the
 

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.030
love that too we can have we can do the
big thinking that we need to do to be

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.040
big thinking that we need to do to be
 

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.730
big thinking that we need to do to be
able to live our lives in the way that

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:06.740
able to live our lives in the way that
 

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.780
able to live our lives in the way that
we want to yeah i mean we're um not to
