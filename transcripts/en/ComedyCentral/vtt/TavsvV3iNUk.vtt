Looks like the Senate Democrats
are going to Liz War!

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.206
During the debate over
Keebler elf Jeff Sessions,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.208
-who was just confirmed...
-(laughter)

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.877
Same guy.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.478
-Prove me wrong.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.115
...was just confirmed
as attorney general today.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.285
America's Aunt Elizabeth Warren
read a 30-year-old letter

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.120
by Coretta Scott King
denouncing Sessions.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.122
-But apparently,
that historic... -MAN: Great!

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.757
Yeah, apparently,
that historical...

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.492
I know. Like, two people,

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.495
-and the rest of them
are like, "Aah." -(laughter)

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.832
-"I mean, I could
do this, but..." -(laughter)

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.935
Apparently, that historical burn
was too hot for the Senate.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.237
Republicans claimed she was
"impugning another Senator"

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.605
and silenced her.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.440
People like Betsy DeVos
chimed in with,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.877
-"What does 'impugn' mean?"
-(laughter and groaning)

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:47.080
-So... Warren...
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.916
-Yeah!
-HARDWICK: Yeah.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.951
-Take 'em down!
-Yeah.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.453
So, Warren went outside,
read the letter live

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:56.056
on Facebook Live,
right between a live feed of

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.491
a dude's trip to the DMV

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.060
and probably a video of a
chinchilla licking its balls.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.762
-(laughter)
-Twitter immediately

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.597
exploded with the hashtags
#ShePersisted,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.433
#LetLizSpeak and #LetLizTalk,
because they support

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.835
a woman's right
to choose everything

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.503
-except for one hashtag.
-(laughter)

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.139
By the way, I don't know
how they missed the hashtag

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.141
#LizLemonParty.
That would of been great.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:18.111
-(laughter) -But you know why?
'Cause she's... -Yeah!

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.147
-Yeah! -Because it's a...
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.415
You have to look
at what's happened.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.650
She's interrupting
a room full of old white guys

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.019
jerking each other off.
I mean, it fits so perfectly.

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:27.487
-(laughter)
-JEN KIRKMAN: Ah.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:28.755
And thanks to all the publicity,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.891
her Facebook Live
got over seven million views,

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:34.862
instead of the seven
it would have gotten on C-SPAN.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.964
-(laughter) -Including
her three grandkids. Now,

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.398
all this started
because Elizabeth Warren

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.767
was supposedly mean to Sessions,
but, comedians...

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.337
(whining):
She was all mean to Sessions!

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.373
But we're not bound
by decorum here on <i>@midnight.</i>

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:49.510
We're not on the Senate floor,
so go ahead, impugn

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.512
-a politician! Anyone?
-Yeah.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:52.813
-Jen Kirkman.
-Okay.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.181
Donald Trump is so dumb

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.083
that he called
a retired lieutenant

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.818
at 3:00 in the morning
'cause he didn't know

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:59.753
if the dollar was strong,
and then, when the guy was like,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.855
"That's not my area,"
he got mad and hung up.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.190
-Um...
-(laughter)

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:05.092
-Points.
-But he actually did that!

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.728
-(applause)
-That's not a joke. -Yeah.

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.296
-He actually did that.
-HARDWICK: Want to know if I...

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.631
-(applause and cheering)
-Is it still okay to give you

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.466
points, 'cause that...
you didn't make that up?

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.903
Nick Swardson.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:19.173
Bernie Sanders went as a scrotum
for Halloween and no makeup.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.008
-(laughter and groaning)
-HARDWICK: Points.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.911
-Points.
-(applause)

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:24.011
-Paul Feig.
-Mike Pence is gay.
