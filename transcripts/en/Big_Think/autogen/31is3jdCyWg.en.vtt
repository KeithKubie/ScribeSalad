one reason for this is control we feel

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820
one reason for this is control we feel
 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.750
one reason for this is control we feel
we have control over our own destiny we

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
we have control over our own destiny we
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.640
we have control over our own destiny we
feel we can steer the wheel in the right

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650
feel we can steer the wheel in the right
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710
feel we can steer the wheel in the right
direction and so we're optimistic about

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
direction and so we're optimistic about
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.950
direction and so we're optimistic about
our own future but we don't feel we have

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960
our own future but we don't feel we have
 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.650
our own future but we don't feel we have
control over where our country is going

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660
control over where our country is going
 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.750
control over where our country is going
or where our leaders are taking us and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
or where our leaders are taking us and
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.210
or where our leaders are taking us and
so we're less optimistic about those

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
so we're less optimistic about those
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.990
so we're less optimistic about those
issues if you take small business owners

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
issues if you take small business owners
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.110
issues if you take small business owners
for example in the u.s. out of every

small business will remain standing in
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.680
small business will remain standing in
five years so that's 33% but when you

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640
is optimistic but on average we find
 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.360
is optimistic but on average we find
this in about 80% of the population and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
this in about 80% of the population and
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.420
this in about 80% of the population and
we find it in females we find it in

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
we find it in females we find it in
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.400
we find it in females we find it in
males we find it in different

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
males we find it in different
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.410
males we find it in different
countries around the world in Western

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420
countries around the world in Western
 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.080
countries around the world in Western
countries in non-western countries so

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
countries in non-western countries so
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.130
countries in non-western countries so
it's quite a global phenomena usually

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140
it's quite a global phenomena usually
 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.200
it's quite a global phenomena usually
when people hear about this the first

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210
when people hear about this the first
 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.240
when people hear about this the first
question that they ask is well this is a

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250
question that they ask is well this is a
 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.180
question that they ask is well this is a
good thing or is it a bad thing and the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190
good thing or is it a bad thing and the
 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.150
good thing or is it a bad thing and the
answer is yes so on the positive side if

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160
answer is yes so on the positive side if
 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.520
answer is yes so on the positive side if
we have we're optimistic we have

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530
we have we're optimistic we have
 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.980
we have we're optimistic we have
positive expectations of the future that

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990
positive expectations of the future that
 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.650
positive expectations of the future that
reduces stress and anxiety which is good

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
reduces stress and anxiety which is good
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.330
reduces stress and anxiety which is good
for our physical health and it's also

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340
for our physical health and it's also
 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.150
for our physical health and it's also
good for our mental health what we find

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160
good for our mental health what we find
 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.630
good for our mental health what we find
is that the 20% that don't have the

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640
is that the 20% that don't have the
 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.690
is that the 20% that don't have the
optimism bias about half of them tend to

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700
optimism bias about half of them tend to
 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.960
optimism bias about half of them tend to
have depression where people with mild

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
have depression where people with mild
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.570
have depression where people with mild
depression actually do not have a bias

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580
depression actually do not have a bias
 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.550
depression actually do not have a bias
that doesn't mean that they're more

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560
that doesn't mean that they're more
 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.560
that doesn't mean that they're more
accurate in predicting the future it

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570
accurate in predicting the future it
 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.540
accurate in predicting the future it
just means that sometimes they're err on

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550
just means that sometimes they're err on
 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.760
just means that sometimes they're err on
the side of optimism and sometimes the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770
the side of optimism and sometimes the
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.920
the side of optimism and sometimes the
err on the side of pessimism so they

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930
err on the side of pessimism so they
 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.110
err on the side of pessimism so they
don't have a systematic bias the other

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120
don't have a systematic bias the other
 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.530
don't have a systematic bias the other
10% tend to not have an optimism bias

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540
10% tend to not have an optimism bias
 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.400
10% tend to not have an optimism bias
but are not depressed and the other

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410
but are not depressed and the other
 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.100
but are not depressed and the other
advantage of optimism is that if we have

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110
advantage of optimism is that if we have
 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.260
advantage of optimism is that if we have
positive expectation it enhances

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270
positive expectation it enhances
 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.930
positive expectation it enhances
motivation right if I think my company

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940
motivation right if I think my company
 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.210
motivation right if I think my company
is going to succeed then I try harder

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220
is going to succeed then I try harder
 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.470
is going to succeed then I try harder
and it becomes a self-fulfilling

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480
and it becomes a self-fulfilling
 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.690
and it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy if I think well it's not going

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700
prophecy if I think well it's not going
 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.940

to work out I'm not going to get that

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950
to work out I'm not going to get that
 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.040
to work out I'm not going to get that
promotion whether I don't try and I'm

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050
promotion whether I don't try and I'm
 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.620
promotion whether I don't try and I'm
more likely to fail so those are the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630
more likely to fail so those are the
 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.230
more likely to fail so those are the
positive aspects but there are also

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240
positive aspects but there are also
 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.110
positive aspects but there are also
negative aspects because if we

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120
negative aspects because if we
 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.390
negative aspects because if we
underestimate our risks we might not

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
underestimate our risks we might not
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.000
underestimate our risks we might not
take precautionary action we might not

take precautionary action we might not
 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.159
take precautionary action we might not
wear a helmet when we bike we might not

wear a helmet when we bike we might not

buy insurance when it's a good idea we

might not go to medical screenings but I

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
might not go to medical screenings but I
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.460
might not go to medical screenings but I
think that over evolution humans have

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470
think that over evolution humans have
 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.370
think that over evolution humans have
evolved to be optimistic because on

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380
evolved to be optimistic because on
 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.100
evolved to be optimistic because on
average the positive outweighs the

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110
average the positive outweighs the
 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.590
average the positive outweighs the
negative and if you think back to our

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600
negative and if you think back to our
 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.780
negative and if you think back to our

hunt they have to imagine that there's
something out there for them to find and

something out there for them to find and

that may be better than what they

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.950
aware of how to framework or the fact
that they have an optimism bias a lot of

that they have an optimism bias a lot of

times people would come into my lab and

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460
times people would come into my lab and
 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.060
times people would come into my lab and
say no no I'm a realist I'm a pessimist

this is especially true in the UK but

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130
this is especially true in the UK but
 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.770
this is especially true in the UK but
then when you test their expectations

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780
then when you test their expectations
 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.450
then when you test their expectations
and look at the outcome you find the

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460
and look at the outcome you find the
 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.630
and look at the outcome you find the
optimism bias but becoming aware of this

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640
optimism bias but becoming aware of this
 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.090
optimism bias but becoming aware of this
can really help us for example to be

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100
can really help us for example to be
 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.830
can really help us for example to be
more effective in communicating because

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840
more effective in communicating because

more effective in communicating because
we understand how other people's brains

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370
we understand how other people's brains
 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.670
we understand how other people's brains
work to restore our motivation when

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680
work to restore our motivation when
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.470
work to restore our motivation when
needed by for example creating

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480
needed by for example creating
 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.500
needed by for example creating
anticipatory events and by protecting

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510
anticipatory events and by protecting
 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.840
anticipatory events and by protecting
ourselves from the negative consequences

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850
ourselves from the negative consequences
 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.670
ourselves from the negative consequences
of over-optimism

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680
of over-optimism
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.380
of over-optimism
to protect ourselves we can't make the

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390
to protect ourselves we can't make the
 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.600
to protect ourselves we can't make the
bias go away the illusion will not just

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
bias go away the illusion will not just
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.630
bias go away the illusion will not just
go away by knowing about it and to

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:26.640
go away by knowing about it and to
 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.430
go away by knowing about it and to
really kind of get that message across

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440
really kind of get that message across
 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.460
really kind of get that message across
I'm going to end with this example which

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470
I'm going to end with this example which
 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.670
I'm going to end with this example which
is an example from vision illusions so

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680
is an example from vision illusions so
 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.240
is an example from vision illusions so
if you look at this what do you see it

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250
if you look at this what do you see it
 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.460
if you look at this what do you see it
looks like an upside down photo of a

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.470
looks like an upside down photo of a
 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.060
looks like an upside down photo of a
smiling girl right okay let's test it so

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.070
smiling girl right okay let's test it so
 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.010
smiling girl right okay let's test it so
when you look at it like this it's quite

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020
when you look at it like this it's quite
 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.160
when you look at it like this it's quite
clear that something is wrong right it's

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.170
clear that something is wrong right it's
 

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.960
clear that something is wrong right it's
called the patcher illusion because it

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:50.970
called the patcher illusion because it
 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.850
called the patcher illusion because it

her smile and the reason that it works

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:57.510
her smile and the reason that it works
 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.930
her smile and the reason that it works
is that we're very very good at

00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940
is that we're very very good at
 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.240
is that we're very very good at
perceiving upright faces we do it all

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.250
perceiving upright faces we do it all
 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.010
