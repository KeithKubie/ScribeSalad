00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.720
- Let's delve into the world of mitochondria

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.250
which are probably my favorite organelle.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.090
So let's just have a little review of what mitochondria are

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.450
and then we can delve a little bit deeper

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.390
into their structure.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.990
So let's just think about a cell

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.490
and not just any cell, but a eukaryotic cell.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.120
So that's the cellular membrane

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.650
and when people say a eukaryote or a eukaryotic cell

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.290
they most typically say, "Oh! That must have its nuclear DNA

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.020
"in a membrane-bound nucleus." and that would be true,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.690
so let's draw our membrane-bound nucleus.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.220
That's our nuclear membrane.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.090
You have your DNA in here,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.990
so let's draw some DNA.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.190
But when we talk about eukaryotic cells,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.990
we're not just talking about a membrane-bound nucleus,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.720
we're also talking about other membrane-bound organelles

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.180
and in a close second place for a membrane-bound structure

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.720
that is very important to the cell

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.550
would be the mitochondria.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.890
So let's draw some mitochondria right over here.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.120
So I'll talk a little bit more about

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.020
what these little squiggly lines that I'm drawing

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.120
inside of the mitochondria are

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.290
and this is actually a little bit more

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.920
of a textbook visualization, as we'll learn

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.450
in a few minutes or seconds that we now have more

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.050
sophisticated visualizations of what's actually going on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.690
inside of a mitochondria, but we haven't actually

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.250
answered all of our questions,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.150
but you might have already learned that,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.090
so let me make it clear, these are mitochondria.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.020
That's the plural.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.050
If we're just talking about one of them,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.220
we're talking about a mitochondrion.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.120
That's the singular of mitochondria.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.720
But you might have already learned,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.190
some time in your past or in another Khan Academy video,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.960
that these are viewed as the ATP factories for cells.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.750
So let me right it this way.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.990
So ATP factories.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.720
A-T-P factories and if you watched the videos on ATP

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050
or cellular respiration or other videos,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.720
I'd repeatedly talk about how ATP is really the currency

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.090
for energy in the cell that when it's in its ATP form

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150
you have adenosine triphosphate.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
If you pop one of the phosphate groups off,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.920
you pop one of the P's off, it release energy

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.320
and that's what your body uses to do all sort of things

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.420
from movement to thinking to all sorts of things

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.450
that actually go on in your bodies,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.850
so you can imagine mitochondria are really important

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.450
for energy, for when the cell has to do things.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.760
And that's why you'll find more mitochondria

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.210
in things like muscle cells, things that have to use

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.950
a lot of energy.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.990
Now before I get into the structure of mitochondria,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590
I wanna talk a little bit about its fascinating past

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.550
because we think of cells as the most basic unit of life

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.850
and that is true, that comes straight out of cell theory,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.450
but it turns out the most prevalent theory

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.620
of how mitochondria got into our cells

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.390
is that at one time the predecessors,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.220
the ancestors to our mitochondria,

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.790
were free, independent organisms, microorganisms.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.320
So they're descendent from bacterial-like microorganisms

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.550
that might have been living on their own

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.650
and they were maybe really good at processing energy

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.290
or maybe they were even good at other things,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190
but at some point in the evolutionary past,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.050
they got ingested by what the ancestors of our cells

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.510
and instead of just being engulfed and being torn to shreds

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.450
and kind of being digested and eaten,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.250
it was like, "Hey, wait, if these things stick around,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.120
"those cells are more likely to survive

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.850
"because they're able to help process glucose

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.550
"or help generate more energy out of things."

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.920
And so the cells that were able to kind of live

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.320
in symbiosis have them kind of give a place

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.190
for the mitochondria to live or the pre-mitochondria,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.490
the ancestor mitochondria, those survived

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.990
and then through kind of the processes of natural selection,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.350
this is what we now associate,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.290
we now associate eukaryotic cells

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.890
as having mitochondria,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.820
so I find this whole idea of one organism being inside

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.090
of another organism in symbiosis even at the cellular level,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.350
that's kind of mind-boggling, but anyway,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590
I'll stop talking about that and now let's just talk

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.850
about the present, let's talk about

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.220
what the actual structure of mitochondria are.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.120
And I'll first draw kind of a simplified drawing

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.050
of a mitochondion and I'll draw a cross section.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.120
So, I'm gonna draw a cross section.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.590
So if we were to kind of cut it in half.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.990
So what I've drawn right over here

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.720
this would be its outer membrane.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.190
This is the outer membrane right over here

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.520
and we label that.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.390
Outer membrane.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.588
And all of these membranes that I'm gonna draw,

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:34.250
they're all going to be phospholipid bilayers.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.550
So if I were to zoom in right over here,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.420
so let me, if I were to zoom in,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.390
we would see a bilayer of phospholipids.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.350
So you have your

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.490
hydrophilic heads facing outwards,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.390
hydrophilic heads facing outwards

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.050
and your hydrophobic tails facing inwards.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.200
So.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.250
You see something just like that,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.880
so they're all phospholipid bilayers.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.890
But they aren't just phospholipids.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.220
All of these membranes have all sorts of proteins imbedded,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.250
I mean cells are incredibly complex structures,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.890
but even organelles like mitochondria have a fascinating,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.690
I guess you would say sub-structure to them.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.120
They themselves have all sorts of interesting proteins,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.150
enzymes imbedded in their membranes

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.450
and are able to help regulate what's going on

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.490
inside and outside of these organelles.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.760
And one of the proteins that you have in the outer membrane

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.612
of mitochondria, they're called porins

00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:40.390
and porins aren't found only in mitochondria,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.590
but they're kind of tunnel proteins,

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.450
they're structured so they kind of form a hole

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.550
in the outer membrane.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.350
So I'm drawing them the best that I can.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.080
These are porins

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.320
and what's interesting about porins is they don't allow

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.120
large molecules to pass through passively,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.050
but small molecules like sugars or ions can pass passively

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.090
through the porins.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.120
And so, because of that, your ion concentration

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.450
and well, I should actually say,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.085
your small molecule concentrations tend

00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:12.555
to be similar on either side of this membrane,

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:15.085
on either side of this outer membrane.

00:06:15.085 --> 00:06:17.125
But that's not the only membrane involved

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.845
in a mitochondrion.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.685
We also have a inner membrane.

00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:22.605
I'll do that in yellow.

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.155
We also have a inner membrane

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:27.285
and I'm gonna draw it with a textbook model first

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:28.545
and then we'll talk a little bit about,

00:06:28.545 --> 00:06:32.885
since we think this model is not quite right,

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:36.685
but in this, so we have this inner membrane,

00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:41.625
inner membrane,

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:45.525
and this inner membrane has these folds in it

00:06:45.525 --> 00:06:46.985
to increase their surface area

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.555
and the surface area is really important

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:50.485
for the inner membrane because that's

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:53.355
where the processes of the electron transport chain

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:55.955
occur across, essentially, these membranes.

00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:57.385
So you want this extra surface area

00:06:57.385 --> 00:07:00.685
so you can essentially have more of that going on.

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:02.585
And these folds have a name.

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.225
So if you're talking about one of them,

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:05.725
if you're talking about one of these folds,

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:10.005
you're talking about a crista,

00:07:10.005 --> 00:07:14.485
but if you're talking about more than one of them,

00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:18.555
you would call that a cristae, cristae.

00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:20.085
Sometimes I've seen the pronunciation of this

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:24.525
as cristae, cristae or cristae, that's plural for crista.

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.925
These are just folds in the inner membrane

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.125
and once again the inner membrane is also

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:33.655
a phospholipid bilayer.

00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.085
Now inside of the inner membranes,

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:40.085
so between the outer membrane and the inner membrane

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.985
you could imagine what this is gonna be called.

00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:46.485
That space is called the intermembrane space,

00:07:46.485 --> 00:07:51.885
not too creative of a name, intermembrane space

00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:53.885
and because of the porins,

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:56.545
the small molecule concentration

00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:58.985
of the intermembrane space and then outside

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:02.685
of the mitochondria,

00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:03.855
out in the cytosol,

00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:05.825
those concentrations are gonna be similar,

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:08.585
but then the inner membrane does not have the porins

00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:11.425
in it and so you can actually have a different concentration

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.655
on either side and that is essential

00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:14.625
for the electron transport chain.

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.555
The electron transport chain really culminates

00:08:16.555 --> 00:08:19.055
with hydrogen, a hydrogen ion gradient

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:20.785
being built between the two sides

00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:24.085
and then they flow down that gradient through a protein

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:28.125
called ATP synthase which helps us synthesize ATP,

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.925
but we'll talk more about that maybe in this video

00:08:29.925 --> 00:08:31.255
or in a future video,

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:33.255
but let's finish talking about the different parts

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:36.555
of a mitochondrion.

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:40.125
So inside the inner membrane you have

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.855
this area right over here is called the matrix.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.685
It's called, let me use this in a different color,

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:47.875
this is

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:49.385
the matrix

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.955
and it's called the matrix 'cause it actually has

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:53.225
a much higher protein concentration,

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:58.085
it's actually more viscous than the cytosol

00:08:58.085 --> 00:09:02.185
that would be outside of the

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:05.385
mitochondria.

00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:07.525
So this right over here is the matrix.

00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:09.815
When we we talk about cellular respiration,

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.925
cellular respiration has many phases in it.

00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:13.345
We talk about glycolysis.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.955
Glycolysis is actually occurring in the cytosol.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:20.315
So glycolysis can occur in the cytosol.

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:22.855
Glycolysis.

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:26.025
But the other major phases of cellular respiration.

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:28.055
Remember we talk about the citric acid cycle

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:29.855
also known as the Krebs cycle,

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:32.585
that is occuring in the matrix.

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:35.825
So Krebs cycle

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.225
is occuring in the matrix

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:40.525
and then I said the electron transport chain

00:09:40.525 --> 00:09:42.155
which is really what's responsible for producing

00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:46.185
the bulk of the ATP, that is happening through proteins

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.255
that are straddling the inner membrane

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:55.125
or straddling the cristae right over here.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.855
Now we're just done.

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:59.085
Probably one of the most fascinating parts of mitochondria,

00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:01.985
we said that we think that they are descendent

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:04.725
from these ancient independent lifeforms

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.825
and in order to be an ancient independent life form,

00:10:06.825 --> 00:10:09.055
they'd would have to have some information,

00:10:09.055 --> 00:10:13.655
some way to actually transmit their genetic information

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.185
and, it turns out, mitochondria actually have

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:18.085
their own genetic information.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.785
They have mitochondrial DNA

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.785
and they often don't just even have one copy of it,

00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:23.415
they have multiple copies of it

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:28.225
and they're in loops very similar to bacterial DNA.

00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:29.585
In fact, they have a lot in common

00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:30.855
with bacterial DNA and that's why we think

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:34.385
that the ancestor to mitochondria that live independently

00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:38.655
was probably a form of bacteria or related to bacteria

00:10:38.655 --> 00:10:39.985
in some way.

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:41.485
So this is, this right over there,

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:43.885
that is the loop of mitochondrial DNA.

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:46.555
So all the DNA that's inside of you, the bulk of it,

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:50.385
yes, it is in your nuclear DNA, but you still have

00:10:50.385 --> 00:10:52.625
a little bit of DNA in your mitochondria

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:55.615
and what's interesting is your mitochondrial DNA,

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:59.455
your mitochondria, are inherited, essentially,

00:10:59.455 --> 00:11:03.275
from your mother's side, because when a egg is fertilized,

00:11:05.545 --> 00:11:08.825
a human egg has tons of mitochondria in it

00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:11.785
and I'm obviously not drawing all of the things

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:12.825
in the human egg.

00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:14.285
It obviously has a nucleus and all of that.

00:11:14.285 --> 00:11:16.355
The sperm has some mitochondria in it,

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:20.467
you could imagine it needs to be able

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:22.325
to win that very competitive fight

00:11:22.325 --> 00:11:24.125
to get to fertilize the egg,

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.355
but the current theory is all or most of that

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:30.085
gets digested or dissolved once it actually gets

00:11:30.085 --> 00:11:31.525
into the egg.

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.485
And anyway, the egg itself has way more mitochondria,

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.755
so the DNA in your mitochondria is

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:42.085
from your mother or is essentially from your mother's side

00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:43.655
and that's actually used, mitochondrial DNA,

00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:45.585
when people talk about kind of an ancient Eve

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.425
or tracing back to having kind

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:48.625
of one common mother,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:52.885
people are looking at the mitochondrial DNA,

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:56.785
so it is actually quite, quite fascinating.

00:11:56.785 --> 00:11:58.725
Now I said a little bit earlier,

00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:00.855
and you know, obviously, it has its own DNA

00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:02.345
and then because it has its own DNA

00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:04.455
it's able to synthesize some of its own RNA,

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:07.555
its own ribosomes, so it also has ribosomes here.

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:10.455
But it doesn't synthesize all of the proteins

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:11.725
that are sitting in mitochondria.

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.385
A lot of those are still synthesized by

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:17.455
or encoded for by your nuclear DNA

00:12:17.455 --> 00:12:19.955
and are actually synthesized outside of the mitochondria

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:22.885
and then make their way into the mitochondria,

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.855
but mitochondria are these fascinating, fascinating things.

00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:29.455
They're these little creatures living in symbiosis

00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:32.355
in our cells and they're able to replicate themselves

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.685
and I don't know, I find all of this mind boggling.

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:35.385
But anyway.

00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:37.785
I said that this was the textbook model

00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:39.725
because it turns out, when you look

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:43.685
at a micrograph, a picture of mitochondria,

00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:45.485
it seems to back up this textbook model

00:12:45.485 --> 00:12:49.125
of these folds, these cristae just kind of folding in,

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:51.755
but when we've been able to have more sophisticated

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:53.645
visualizations it actually turns out

00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:55.985
that it's not just these simple folds

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:59.055
that the inner membrane essentially hooks

00:12:59.055 --> 00:13:02.255
into the matrix and it turns out it has

00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:05.085
these little tunnels that connect the space

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:10.525
inside of the cristae to the intermembrane space.

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:12.825
So I like to think about this because it makes you realize,

00:13:12.825 --> 00:13:14.825
you know, we look in textbooks and we take these things

00:13:14.825 --> 00:13:17.325
like mitochondria for granted, like, "Oh yeah, of course.

00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.875
"That's where ATP factories are,"

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:21.685
but it's still an area for visualization research

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:24.455
to fully understand exactly how they work

00:13:24.455 --> 00:13:25.855
and even how they are structured

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.655
that this Baffle Model where you see these cristae

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:31.225
kind of just coming in and out of the different sides.

00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:33.885
This is actually no longer the accepted model

00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:36.745
for the actual visualization, the structure of mitochondria.

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:39.485
Something more like this, something more where

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.315
you have this cristae junction model

00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:46.615
where you have, if I were to draw a cross section

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:50.025
where this is the,

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:52.255
I drew the outer membrane and the inner membrane,

00:13:52.255 --> 00:13:54.655
I'll just draw has these little tunnels

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:59.535
to the actual space inside of the cristae.

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:03.455
This is actually now the more accepted visualization,

00:14:03.455 --> 00:14:04.725
so I want you to appreciate

00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:06.885
that when in Biology, you read something in a textbook

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:08.225
you kind of say, "Oh, people have figured all

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:10.285
"of this stuff out," but people are still think about,

00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:11.625
"Well, how does this structure work?

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:12.785
"What is the actual structure?" and then,

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.825
"How does it actually let this organelle,

00:14:14.825 --> 00:14:16.755
"this fascinating organelle do all of the things

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.805
"that it needs to do?"
