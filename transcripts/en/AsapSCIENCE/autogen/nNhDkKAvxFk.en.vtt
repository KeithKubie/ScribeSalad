00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 What if you do not sleep at all? 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.479
 Ah! Sleep. There can never be enough satisfaction 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.785
 Actually. it often seems like we do not sleep enough 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.280
 But what if we stopped sleeping? 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.180
 Strangely, science understands little about sleep or how it has evolved since its inception. 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.650
 First of all, stretching without feeling sleeping for hours, 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.030
 at a time when someone looks at you, it seems difficult to look good or smart. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380
 But we have discovered some correlations, for example: 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.980
 Adults sleeping between 6-8 hours have the premise to live longer 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.680
 Overuse can result in health problems such as: Cardiovascular Diseases and Diabetes. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 Similarly, sleep deprivation is associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and even brain damage. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 But what if you stop sleeping at this moment? 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.460
 After the first sleepless night, the metabolic system is stimulated and dopamine is rampant. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 And this actually brings a lot of energy, positivity and sex. 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.100
 Sounds delightful, but it's like a falling slope. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.520
 Your brain slowly begins to "exclude" the areas responsible for planning and evaluating decisions, 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.900
 which implied impulsive behavior. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 As soon as the waste begins, your reaction time begins to decrease 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.560
 and perceptive and cognitive functions are reduced. 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.680
 After one day or two without sleep the body loses its ability to 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.100
 switched glucose and the immune system stops working properly 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.080
 In some cases, 3 sleepless days lead to hallucinations. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 You care how you look? 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.460
 Studies have shown a fair correlation between deprivation of sleep and beauty of the person. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.900
 Let's say, deprived sleepers look less healthier 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.600
 and less attractive than when they have been as quiet as they should. 

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:40.055
 The most long-lasting case of scientifically documented sleep is 246 hours or 11 days 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.860
 And they show problems with concentration, perception, and readability. 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.920
 The surprising truth is that they are not suffering from serious and long-term health effects. 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.200
 In fact, none of the persons in these documented conditions did not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 health, psychological, neurological or psychiatric problems. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 But there are limited studies and this does not mean that permanent injuries can not be caused in more time. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.300
 Experiments with sleep deprivation in mice, for example, have led to their death after 2 weeks of no sleep 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.680
 But scientists are not very sure if they have died of lack of sleep. 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.080
 or by the stress caused by persistent awakening. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 Maybe we should see FFI, a genetic brain disease 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.000
 which causes progressively insomnia or insomnia 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.880
 which leads to hallucinations, dementia and death. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.860
 This illness has affected only 100 people all over the world. 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.480
 but the average life span was 18 months. 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.380
 Over time, lack of sleep becomes worse and body organs begin to quench. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.360
 But lack of sleep does not kill fast, 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.940
 persistent deprivation has nevimative effects on your body. 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.620
 Sweet Dreams! 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.900
 But not too much!
