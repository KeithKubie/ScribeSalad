Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.320
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn:
-- and others.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.720
It is a great pleasure to
welcome here Lilia Schwarcz

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.060
and Bryan McCann and [inaudible]
study Guzman-Gonzalez,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.410
who will introduce the speakers.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.210
Thank you.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:44.440
[ Applause ]

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.740
&gt;&gt;Talia Guzman-Gonzalez:
Thank you, Georgette.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.840
And thank you to my colleagues
in the Hispanic division

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.370
for helping me organize and
putting this together for today.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.240
It is my great pleasure to
welcome you all to this event

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.960
about one of Brazil's
most relevant authors

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.540
of the 20th century and
probably still today.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.750
Alfonso Henriques
de Lima Barreto.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.570
I can only imagine what Lima
would say about the fact

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.230
that we have all his books in
the largest library in the world

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.230
or that we're here
today talking about him,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.760
talking about how important
he is and having Lilia

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.620
and Bryan here with us to engage

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.400
in a conversation
about his work.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.080
Bryan McCann teaches Brazilian
history at Georgetown.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.610
He's close by and he
has written widely

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.400
about Brazilian social
and cultural history.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.530
He's the author of numerous
articles and books, including,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.100
"Hard Times in the Marvelous
City, From Dictatorship

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.340
to Democracy in the Favelas
of Rio de Janeiro," published

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.930
in 2013, "The Throws of
Democracy, Brazil since 1989,"

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.800
published in 2008, and "Hello,
Hello, Brazil, Popular Music

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
in the Making of Modern
Brazil," from 2004.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.740
He recently wrote
the introduction

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
for a new English translation
of Vida Vertiginosa,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.050
Vertiginous Life,
by Joao do Rio,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.720
who is a contemporary
of Lima Barreto.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.640
And foe probably.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.340
The book was published this
year by New London Librarian

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.950
and the translation
by Ana Lessa-Schmidt.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.150
And thank you for calling
our attention to that

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.190
and we're getting on
it and all those books.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.270
I'm very excited to have
Lilia Moritz Schwarcz here

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.570
in the library.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.870
For me it's a great honor.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.350
As a grad student both Bryan
and Lilia were both references,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.170
so for me it's truly amazing
to have them here today.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.520
She wears many hats
in her different roles

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.470
as an intellectual,
writer, publisher,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.760
mentor and overall
force of nature.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.060
She's a full professor

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.120
in the Faculdade de Filosofia
Letras e Ciencias Humanas

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.680
at the University of
Sao Paulo in Brazil.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.650
Where she also received her
PhD in social anthropology.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.520
Her main areas of research
are history of slaves,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.960
racial theories, history of the
Brazilian empire, academic art

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.430
and history of anthropology.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.490
She's the author, co-author
or editor of over 50 titles.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.790
We have them here.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.940
I search for them.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.850
Some of them are
outside you can see them.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.450
And they include Retrato
em branco e negro,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.200
Portrait in White
and Black, from 1987,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
A Longa Viagem da
Bibilioteca dos Reis from 2002,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880
The Long Journey of the King's
Library, O Sol do Brazil,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.090
from 2008, The Son of
Brazil and the book

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.500
that brings us here
today, Triste Visionario,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.530
Lima Barreto from 2017.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.170
Three of her books are available
in English, so those of you

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.080
who cannot yet read
in Portuguese,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.620
I welcome you to look them up.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.100
Spectacle of Racist, Science
Institutions and Racial Theories

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.090
in Brazil at the end of the 19th
Century, The Emperor's Beard,

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.560
Pedros II, A Tropical
King, from 2004.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.140
And Brazil, A Biography
is coming

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.450
out next year I just learned,
so, that's very exciting.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.790
Lilia has also been the curator

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.030
of several important
exhibits throughout Brazil

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.220
on topics ranging from the
French Painter, Nicolas Taunay,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.410
to Brazilian photography
and childhood histories.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.760
She's currently curating
an exhibit

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.200
at the [speaking
foreign language] title,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.500
[speaking foreign
language], which consists

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.480
of a yearlong programs of
exhibits, workshops and lectures

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320
on the [speaking
foreign language],

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.580
I tried look up a translation.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.510
I think, ebbs and flows.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.820
Between Africa, the Americas,
the Caribbean and Europe.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.320
We look forward to that in 2018,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.550
if we can all go
to Brazil for that.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.560
As you can imagine, all this
work has been recognized

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.060
with some of the most
important national

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.570
and international
prizes and fellowships,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.460
including five Jabuti Prizes,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.520
which is Brazil's
leading literary prize.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.810
And the Brazilian
Academy of Letters Prize.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.990
She also holds a
Guggenheim fellowship

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.400
from the Guggenheim Foundation

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.790
and the John Carter Brown
Library University fellowship

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.090
as well.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.970
She's been a visitor at
Oxford, Leiden, Princeton

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.410
and Brown Universities, a Tinker
Professor at Columbia University

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.920
and since 2011 she
is Global Professor

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.480
at Princeton University.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.890
She writes regularly for
the Brazilian newspapers,

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.240
Folha de S Paulo, Estado
de S. Paulo and Nexo.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.360
And since 2015 she's a
co-curator for history

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.490
for the Museum of
Art in Sao Paulo.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.990
Today she'll be here
talking about Lima Barreto.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.190
After her talk we'll have a
conversation with Bryan McCann

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.660
and the audience, so
please stay for that.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.510
Please join me in welcoming
Lilia to the Library.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:15.890
&gt;&gt; Lilia Moritz Schwarcz:
Well, good afternoon.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.880
Thank you so much.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.420
Thank you, Talia, for this
beautiful introduction

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.410
to my biography.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.040
Don't pay attention to her.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.920
It's not true.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.780
I just want to start thanking
this very honorable invitation

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.480
from the Hispanic Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.940
I want to mention Talia
Guzman-Gonzales [assumed

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.340
spelling] that took care
of really everything,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.950
including my research today.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.600
And also my colleague, Bryan
McCann, for the kindness

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.280
of being here to
discuss my presentation.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.440
I agreed with Talia that I
would talk about my last book,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.040
Lima Barreto, Sad
Vision, [inaudible].

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.840
I thought it would
be good to start

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.250
with the title, "Sad Visionary."

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.700
I wanted to put a
balance in the title.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.400
For example, if you think
about sad, sad is a word

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.070
that Lima Barreto uses a lot.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.620
Sad is the title of
his most famous novel,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.010
"Triste Fim de Policaropo
Quaresma," the Sad End

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.980
of Policaropo Quaresma."

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.340
But sad in popular Brazil, it
means a person that is stubborn.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.900
It's persistent.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.300
That insists.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.580
So you can see that you have
an ambivalence in one word.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.740
Visionary, visionary
because, again,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.070
Lima Barreto used
it a lot, this word.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.370
Visionary.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.500
Again, in Sad End of
Policaropo Quaresma,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.390
there is a particular moment
when Floriano Peixoto,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.640
our former president and a
character, evil character

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.860
of Lima Barreto, says
to Policaropo Quaresma,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.240
"Policaropo, you
are a visionary.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.790
I can't trust you,
it's not a compliment."

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.690
He's trying to say, so,
visionary can be a person

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.710
that sees the future, but a
visionary can also be a person

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.210
that is a fool, kind of lunatic.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.560
So, you can see what kind of
problems I had in my book.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.050
No, a biography is an
exercise of ambiguity.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.730
No? It's another exercise of
being affected, to be distant,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.990
to be very very closed
at the same time.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.150
Lima Barreto [inaudible]
said, "It's not" --

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.760
it's a very well known
author in brazil,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.100
a very well known writer,
and it was very well said it.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.590
So, what I tried to do and
I tried to explain to you

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:06.410
in this afternoon, I tried
to come up with new questions

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.360
for the same character.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.200
Questions that I think it's a
kind of thing of my generation,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.270
my generation that we are
dealing with civil rights,

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.720
problems of civil rights.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.530
So I asked Lima Barreto
about race, gender,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.880
region and generation.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.810
All social markers of difference
that I tried to put together

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.790
in a kind of intersection.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.480
Let's see if I will succeed, no?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.410
So, let me start
quoting Lima Barreto.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.100
So, this is Lima
Barreto, "The republic

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.900
of Brazil was the
regime of corruption.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.630
Nobody wants to debate,
nobody wants to stir up ideas.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.380
Nobody wants to put any
real feeling into it.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.880
Everybody wants a
slice of the action.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.020
The jurists want their slice,

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.840
the philosophers
want their slice,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.170
the doctor want their slice,
the novelists want their slice,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.440
the engineerings
want their slice,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.510
the journalists want their
slice, Brazil is one big apple.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.100
All brazil, [speaking
foreign language]."

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.510
Let me try just a test on you.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.610
The body and the style
are very present day,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.580
in Brazil and also here.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.840
But the piece itself it's
almost a 100 years old.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.120
However current it may seem,
it was actually published --

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.570
let me just move --
published in 1918

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:53.180
in an [inaudible] magazine
called A.B.C. The title,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.370
"A Political Publicana,
The Republican Politics,"

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.010
had a very clear target and
was signed by a colonist

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.760
of Brazil First Republic.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.170
Famous for his very
critical style.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.470
We are talking about
[speaking foreign language].

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.280
Lima, to his friends,
[speaking foreign language]

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.790
to his readers, but
also, Jonathan, Aaron,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.270
[speaking foreign language],
that one, and [inaudible]

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:29.400
that barely conceal the
author's true identity.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.950
They were his nick names.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.230
Pick names, as he liked to joke.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.530
Or [speaking foreign language].

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.860
Black by argent size,
and literature,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.030
Lima Barreto brought black
antagonist into the foreground.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:55.690
He felt the same thing that
was his own subjectivity

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.540
and was able to describe them
in color, sensitive terms.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.940
I'm going to quote
Lima Barreto once more.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:10.750
"They were simple seamen, low
ranking officers, white, blacks,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.850
mulattos, [speaking
foreign language],

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.590
people of every color
and disposition.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:21.130
Folks who had gotten themselves
mixed up in their adventure

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.900
out of the nasty habit of
doing what they are told.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.820
This is comes from
[speaking foreign language].

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:38.210
In [inaudible] context, Lima
was a near solitary combatant

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.540
against racism in Brazil.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.030
Against race [inaudible], that
was a big fashion in Brazil.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.870
I quote him once more.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.950
"A white man intellectual,"
he would say,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.740
"is measured [inaudible],
a black man, [inaudible]."

00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:03.490
In his novels, chronicles,
short stories, diaries,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.400
Lima Barreto denounced the
discrimination he suffered,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.030
that's of racist he
endured, great or small

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.720
and in the sense his
literature was solidary,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.060
as he would say, militant.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.110
Freedom was a concept dear to
Lima Barreto, who from a line

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.050
of slaves on both sides.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.540
His grandfather,

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.210
Manuel Feliciano [speaking
foreign language] had actually

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.670
owned his grandmother and never
recognized the relationship,

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.780
as it was all too common
in Brazilian history

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:52.080
of which we only know one
side, the maternal side.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.670
His father, [speaking foreign
language] was a type setter

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.510
during the Brazilian empire
and the proud inventor

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.820
of a special phones
created especially

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.660
for the printing
of the layout in.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.120
The golden law.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.210
The empire's most popular
and indeed less law.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:20.710
As the republic we'll begin in
1989 and the layout was in 1888.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.620
Lima's mother, -- oh,
this is the golden law.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.320
Lima's mother, Dona Amalia,
was a granddaughter of slaves.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.100
She trained as a teacher
and became head mistress

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.960
of the Sintahoza
[phonetic spelling] school

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.230
for girls in Laranjeiras.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.210
The Barretos therefore belonged

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.830
to those African Brazilian
families who believed

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.740
that true freedom would
come to education,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.790
not with a cold letter
of the law.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.980
On the fridge of the system
there was no room for such forms

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.170
of social mobility, even
if they steal the pendant

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.970
on a certain kind of patronage.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.540
And that was what happened

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.690
in the two sides of
Barreto's family.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.070
Both having perfections
and social alliance

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.840
with powerful families

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.670
of [inaudible] Province
and later state.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.860
Laranjeiras, as you can
see is the neighborhood

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.450
where the Barretos would live.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.270
And it was then a highly
diversified neighborhood,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.600
socially speaking, as can be
seen from the architecture

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.430
and the people in this photo.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.160
However, fate would not
be kind to the family.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.850
Dona Amalia died from
tuberculosis in 1887,

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.900
leaving her widower,
Joao Henriques

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.200
to raise the three kids alone.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.970
Even so, Joao Henriques
didn't neglect his

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.450
children's education.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.270
On the day of the golden law,
there he was with his son

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:04.210
at his side, turned out to
watch the pomp and the ceremony.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:09.500
It was an event that Lima would
rewrite on many occasions.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:15.880
On one of these he recalled
how Miss Theresa, his teacher,

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.040
came into the class and declared

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.120
that there were no
more slaves in Brazil.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.250
Still only a boy, Lima got
the wrong end of the stick.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:33.540
He arrived home and informed
his father that from that day

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.210
on he could no longer
ground him.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.080
[speaking foreign language].

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.880
The future would not be rosy
for Lima and his family.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.370
[speaking foreign language]
the godson of Ouro Preto,

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.550
the cabinet chief of the
last imperial government,

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.290
fell along with his
protector, becoming one

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:04.820
of the first unemployed
of the second Reich.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.710
Even so, he managed to
find an administrative post

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.620
at a mad house on
Ilna do Governador.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.550
That's the house.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.400
That's the house nowadays.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.990
Madness, real and social,
social and real, became a fixer

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.570
to Lima Barreto's life
from that point on.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.320
And he would never shrink

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.400
from criticizing the mad house
system was, as he often claimed,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.480
a micro cause of wider society.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.810
Shot through with the
same social, political

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.130
and racial differences.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.130
At asylum he would say often,

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.220
"Black was always the
harshest culture."

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:56.710
"The asylum," he wrote, "was
a place for invisibility."

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.110
Black invisibility.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:05.400
Lima Barreto studied in
good schools from this --

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.360
as this one in Niteroi.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.990
Fulfilled his father's dream, he
was accepted in the Politecnica.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.720
The engineering program.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.530
Where he claimed
where he suffered

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.570
for the first time
discrimination.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.830
This is Politecnica.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:29.390
This is a very rare photography
of the Lima Barreto group.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.380
Lima Barreto is there
on the right side

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.960
and you can see him here.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.290
Yeah. In this time torn photo
we see Lima wearing a large tie

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.050
and a borrowed jacket
looking into the future.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.010
He who claimed not to belong
to this select chick group,

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:56.770
with this European style elite
that refused to accept him.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.050
Unfortunately, Lima would have
no time to finish the course.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.090
In 1902 having failed
to balance the books

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.930
on [speaking foreign language],
Joao Henriques, Lima's father,

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.730
was forced into retirement.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:19.050
The boy left the Politecnica and
entered public life as a clerk.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.800
With a war -- he was a
clerk in the war office,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.010
a place he always hated.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:32.130
What he really wanted was to
make a living from literature.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.680
He wrote in his diary,
he wrote in his diary,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.760
"I will marry literature."

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.730
The civil service struck
him as a waste of time.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.850
Marry a bread and butter job.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.650
I'm going to quote once
more, "We are all born

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:55.220
to the civil service, that
[inaudible], no conflict

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.290
or violent [inaudible],

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:04.330
five hours of plain sailing
every day, [inaudible] for life.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.550
All of that sits perfectly well

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.370
with our expectations
and temperament.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:16.410
In a day's work for the state
there is no unpredictability

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.160
and replies, no extra
effort to get

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.770
up to [inaudible] to tomorrow.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.920
Everything precedes calmly and
smoothly, with no collisions,

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.900
no surprise, as one goes
about drafting the same papers

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.610
and memorandums,
the same decrees

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.330
in the very same
fashion all year long.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.440
Save for bank holidays,
holidays and optional holidays,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.580
clearly one of the best
inventions of our republic."

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.440
So, he set about
reinventing himself.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.580
He moves to Todos os
Santos, literally all saints,

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:03.070
though he claimed the saints had
long since abandoned the place.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.670
At the same time from that
day on he was used to take --

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.610
to take the central
station train every day.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.010
That was an extended
huge generator

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.830
that includes the suburb.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:25.270
In fact, Lima Barreto started to
write a literature in transit.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.580
In -- and he used to
-- but this is a line

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.050
of the Central do Brazil
and you see Rio de Janeiro,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.470
that is the zero mark and then
Todos os Santos in the middle

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.500
and then this is a second
class car that he used to say,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:49.480
"the second class car in the
morning is black, all black."

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.330
Lima Barreto became
also a secretary

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:59.940
with a very fashionable
magazine called Fon Fon.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.570
Then promptly he resigned.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.180
He used to say that he didn't'

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.500
like having his copies
constantly being.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.910
But his real work, his real
challenge was literature.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:21.600
And in 1909 he had
already written two novels.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.100
But he decided to start
with the "Recollections

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.660
of the Clerk, Isaias Caminha."

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.660
That he found more aggressive.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:39.410
Lima had this kind of capacity
to make noise, a lot of noise.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.010
"Isaias Caminha" is the story
of a boy, the son of a priest

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.670
and the slave mother,
who goes to the big city

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.690
to make something of himself.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.460
And runs up against prejudice.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.780
Skin changes, he wrote.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.310
In the second part of
the book he picks a fight

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.320
with the journalist,
[inaudible],

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.770
when normally sitting,
Oh Global, the newspaper,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.290
Oh Global, he attacks the
newspaper he wrote it for

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.560
and the colleagues
he worked with.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.860
Including John [inaudible].

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.750
He was immediately
blacklisted and had the doors

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:25.130
of the big press
slammed to his face.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:29.900
But he, in his way, was
a stubborn person and set

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.490
up a magazine of
his own, Floreal.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.480
Which lasted only four issues,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.660
and Lima thanked the
35 loyal subscribers

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.270
who had stayed the course.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:51.320
Lima fell in with a group
of friends who used to hang

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.780
out around the bars downtown.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.660
And together they went by the
name of Confedia [inaudible].

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.600
Con fraternity of clerks.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.030
The group of drinking
buddies used to come together

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.140
to exchange the user to say
useless theories and ideas.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.340
They used it to be seen in
a particular bar called,

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.510
"Bi Papagaiyou [assumed
spelling], the Parrots Bar.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.780
Lima often mentioned that
even the Papagaiyou, the bird,

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.100
liked to drink a
lot and in this kind

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.800
of situation the parrot used
it to blame against republic.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.560
I do not know if this is true
or this is Lima, but he's trying

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.150
to fictionalize his own life.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:44.250
But the thing is the
group like very much --

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:49.930
the group was a kind of creating
a new kind of modernist,

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:56.650
a new kind of way of seeing
Brazil, to transporting Brazil.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:04.610
But Lima Barreto he wrote,
"Nume e a Nympha" in 1911

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.820
and attacked the politicians.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.720
And he wrote "Dr.
Bogoloff" in 1912,

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.530
when he attacked the Brazilians

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.800
and called the Brazilians
Botherrists.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.130
He used to say that the
resilience loved just

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.640
to import ideas and theories.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.860
In 1914 Lima could
not hold out no longer

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.630
and was committed
for the first time.

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:36.840
He was found drunk and
his brother decided

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.790
to put him in the hospital.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.030
There admittance office,
perhaps as a curtsey

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.480
for one civil servant
to another,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.870
registered him as white.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:57.370
And that adds that Lima had
presented himself as a writer.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.200
He says he's a writer.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.040
That he wrote.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.700
But Lima was not a loser at all.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:13.420
And then in 1911 he started
publishing Policarpo Quaresma

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.720
[speaking foreign language].

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:19.760
And then in 17 he published
this book, this as a book.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.210
The book is a story of a sort

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.510
of Brazilian [speaking
foreign language].

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:28.980
A critic of what he
called sheep [inaudible].

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.470
In the book was well received,

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.670
but not as well as
Lima had expected.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.200
So he wrote in his diary,
"Policarpo Quaresma,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.940
the idea that kills the
deception with pessimism."

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.310
By these days his life was
more than jumbled with those

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.720
of his character --
of his characters.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.500
He was as Isaias Caminha

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.440
and he was Gonzaga
Desa [assumed spelling]

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.530
and the opposite was
nonetheless true.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.300
But the experience in the
hospital was really profound.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.790
He was a critical voice
against racial theories,

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:14.830
like the ones right
-- that was written

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.570
by Nina Rodriguez
[assumed spelling],

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.800
that Nina Rodriguez
is a professor

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.310
of the faculty of
the [inaudible].

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:31.890
That the defendant in Brazil,
was creates that generation.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.090
He also was -- this
is the magazine

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.860
of Nina Rodriguez called
Brazil Madico Magazine.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:45.590
And here you can see images
of some of the colleagues

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.240
of Lima Barreto in the hospital.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:55.750
Lima wrote a special diary about
his experience in the hospital

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.440
and he used it to describe
the colleagues he had

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.270
in the hospital, saying, "In
the hospital all I can see

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.570
is brown."

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:12.100
And eventually he wrote,
"Constitution is not for us."

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.740
By the state of his life he
was really mixing everything.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.950
But life went on and Lima
kept looking to find a niche

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.530
for himself in this
Republic of Letters.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:29.570
In 1917 he was already
an anarchist

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:34.330
and was emotionally caught
of the stripes of 17.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.600
He wrote article defending
the worker's class,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.610
the worker's right and
also defended a kind

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:45.780
of military leader, very much
influenced by the context.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.500
He declares himself
with Dostoyevsky,

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.480
Balzac, Flobare, [inaudible].

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.970
Lima defended as social
leader to very much connected

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.330
with the problems of his time.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.050
One has to recognize that Lima
Barreto was becoming really a

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.970
public face of the republic.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:15.280
Then in 1919 another collapse.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.680
And there he was again
committed or "kidnapped"

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.410
as he put it, once again.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:29.250
He was still a critic of racial
theories, but he was shaken

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:34.120
to the point to recognize
certain signs of irratity.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.140
As an anarchist with a
[inaudible] for a mother

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:44.240
and a madman for a father,
he admitted, just once,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.020
that he had signs of
degeneration to machination.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.960
In this moment he wrote,
"Sometimes I'm afraid

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.310
that my body is betraying me."

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.060
At this time he looked
really tired.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.380
There is one interesting point
that I want to stress to you.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:12.960
In 1914 he was described
as a white person.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.320
In 1919, four years and a
half later, he was admitted

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.520
as a pardo [assumed spelling].

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.200
Pardo, this kind of color,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.330
that is almost impossible
to translate.

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.380
It's a kind of etc.
of the senses.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.290
It's a kind of the none of
the others of the senses.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.830
Social color is the
term we use to talk

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:44.620
about this way the Brazilians
negotiate with color.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:51.350
In a positive or sometimes
in a very negative agency.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:59.010
In his diary he often
wrote the names

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.530
of his characters,
instead of his own.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.280
And in his novella his
own name, instead of those

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.010
of his character, only
to scratch it out again.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.910
You can see in this document,

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.530
you can see this is the
Cemittery of the Living.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:21.280
The last book Lima Barreto was
writing that he couldn't finish.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.280
And I don't know if you
can see, he puts his name,

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.920
it's a long one, he puts his
name there, Lima Barreto,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.490
and then he puts -- an opposite
thing is also true in his diary.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.020
Sometimes he puts the names

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.020
of the fictional characters
instead of his own name.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.310
The thing is Lima Barreto was
really really fictionalizing

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.830
his life.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:52.330
We are now in 1922 and in this
year so important and symbolic

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.440
to Brazil, Lima met
his own [inaudible].

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.340
He finished Clara dos Anjos.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:05.100
Which would be his most
suburban and feminist novel.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.060
Lima was working on this novel

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:13.530
since he started
writing his diary, in 19.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.990
At this time eventually
he started the diary,

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.320
with a beautiful sentence.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.510
He wrote, "When I started
writing this diary a

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:26.100
hope landed."

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:33.900
Lima Barreto was a
writer with such a strong

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.940
and powerful [inaudible]
but never married.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:43.060
Though he often dreamed of his
grandmother and his mother.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.050
As for Clara dos Anjos, there
was many versions of this novel.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.870
The less of which they
had sprung to 1922

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:57.060
and sees the dreamy
mulatto Clara dos Anjos,

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:03.450
that we look pregnant,
alone, sad, very sad.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:10.460
In 1921 Lima Barreto had already
retired from the war office

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.730
and was working as a writer.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.830
He counted the days, the hours,

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.830
the minutes he lost
as a public servant.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.250
The last time he was seen

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.460
in the [speaking foreign
language] de Janeiro he was

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.970
covered in the celebrations

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.920
around the Brazilian
Centenary of 1922.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.890
Of which, of course,
he disapproved.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:36.680
He found it an example
of fake patriotism,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.450
mixed with a nationalist
sentimentalist most Brazilians

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.610
had from being [inaudible].

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.880
The same year he
come into contact

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:50.430
with the publicists modernist.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:55.460
Whose magazine Klaxon he
received from the hands

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.840
of [speaking foreign language].

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.970
The future very well,

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.320
non-Brazilian historian,
and literary critic.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.350
He didn't like it at all.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.020
He thought it was
named after a horn,

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:15.540
and a horn we call him a
car, which meant [inaudible]

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:21.130
and the code to the foreign.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.490
He [inaudible] it and
in return took a beating

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:25.790
in the [inaudible] Klaxon.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:31.040
This was the beginning of a
difficult future reception,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.650
that consigned Lima Barreto
to the [inaudible] modernist.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.090
Which was pretty
much no place at all.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:44.630
Something that never
was and never would be.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.930
To make matters worse
he was lumped

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:49.990
into this category,
along with writers.

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:55.780
He did not identify with them,
such as [inaudible] and worst

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.080
of all [speaking
foreign language].

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:04.800
But this kind of reception
would take its time.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.470
We are now in November
22 and Lima Barreto,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.690
who was always worried
he wouldn't be able

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:14.230
to cover the cost of
his father's funeral,

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.900
died a day in a half
before his old man.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.890
With a copy of [speaking
foreign language], two words,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.270
magazine, on his hands.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:29.980
Fitting enough for someone
who lived between two worlds.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.970
And so in neither at all.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:37.470
When he was in the suburbs
he missed the [inaudible].

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.520
He disagreed with the Brazilian
Academy of Letter and tried

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.110
to enter the institution
three times, and failed.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.450
Lima crafted the
characters of his books

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.570
with an immense tenderness.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.430
They were rather different to
the ones the public was used to.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:03.750
There even religions mixed with
the prevailing catholisist.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:08.610
They were very skin toned,
and black and they lived

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.870
on the outskirts of the
city, which resonated

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.320
with the African [inaudible].

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.080
And the short story called,
[speaking foreign language],

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.720
the Boy, for example,

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.790
Lima tenderly describes the
lands of his own neighbors.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.090
[inaudible].

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.790
Not far from there you
had the voodoo shacks

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.660
and deposits of ancestral
beliefs.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:36.130
They go and mixing African
religions with spirits.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:39.740
They spread like wildfire.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.180
The Catholic Church does not
satisfy our humble people.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.180
the priest fought most of our
people can't really communicate

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:53.110
with the divine, but the medium,
the warlock, the witch doctor,

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:56.490
if they don't deceive
divinity in their trances they

00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.100
at least receive spirits and
souls, which being no longer

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:07.100
of this world are closer to god
and therefore partake a little

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.920
of his eternal and
immense wisdom.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.110
He also liked to see
himself as a rebel.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.180
On principle for fun

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.750
and to irritate [speaking
foreign language].

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:29.210
Oh, this is the --
this is the retake

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.510
of [speaking foreign language].

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.600
He was against pompous
politicians,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.430
against the new aristocracy and
against cosmetic journalist,

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:41.670
against [inaudible] literature,
against [inaudible] and so,

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:47.410
he suddenly railed against
metropolis [speaking foreign

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.710
language] and [inaudible].

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:52.310
He denounced the abuse of
society committed against women,

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:58.040
but accused feminism of being
a sheep importation in Brazil.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.090
He defended simple habits,

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:04.900
but disliked soccer,
Zumba and Carnival.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.540
He detests civil servants,
yet learned his living

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.840
as a war office [inaudible].

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.100
Despised his deplorable
handwriting,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.070
he had a terrible
handwriting for a clerk.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.420
In fact, in [speaking foreign
language] the life and death

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.380
of [speaking foreign language]
published in 1918 on the pretext

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.870
of summarize the works of
his department, Lima embarked

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:38.240
on a hilarious reflection on the
job he did for so many years.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.140
On my first day at the war
office I realized very clearly

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:46.450
that we are all born
for the civil service.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:52.740
So, same as less was my adaption
that I felt as though I had come

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.390
into this world for
no other reason

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.840
than to put my limited
grammar and office [inaudible]

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.210
to the service of the
state and its mission

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.390
to regulate the march
of the nation.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.080
Basically that was Lima
Barreto in a nutshell.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:16.310
For a full of contradiction,
full of his own subjectivities,

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:23.090
but with very firm notions,
theories, thesis, idiosyncrasies

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.500
and pains and dreams
and products.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.010
Lima didn't' experience
slavery at very close quarters,

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.390
not like his two grandmothers.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.330
It was at asylum that he learned

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.190
from his fellow inmates
the importance

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.100
of understanding what
he called his origins.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.390
[speaking foreign
language] who used

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:50.350
to call Lima [speaking foreign
language] had made some money

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.600
selling his master's
groceries at the market.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.000
And when the time was
right he uses his savings

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.080
to buy his freedom.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.790
Sometime later he fell in
love with Maria Pollina

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:05.200
and bought her freedom too.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.430
They moved in together and
all was going swimmingly

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.750
until she left him.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.620
Then came his [inaudible].

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:20.690
That was the state [inaudible]
was in when he met the author.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:25.950
As Lima tell us, [inaudible] was
quite a figure and he writes,

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:29.920
"Many other facts of this
kind pass between us,

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.420
and now that this pair
besets me, I can recall --

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.030
I can't recall that unique
black fellow without thinking

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.860
that what gives life
its charm more

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.180
than anything else is
the candle of the simple

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.630
and the resignation
of the hammer."

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.250
In his self-styled militant
autobiographical literature Lima

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.700
ended becoming and living
out his own characters.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.110
He was each of them in turn
and all of them at once.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.210
And also none of them at all.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.100
Lima was in a hurry.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.580
His literature, he
was in a hurry.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.600
Of course, he had no way of
knowing that he would die

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:18.220
at the age of 41 from an
alcoholic induced heart attack.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.580
Life was short.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.820
His literature will live longer.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.840
He was an author who, as
the critic used it to say,

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.410
confessed the whole time.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.100
But he did much more than that.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.550
He was a man of his time,
the sort that becomes

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:39.780
at once a witness to an activist
of the period in which he lived.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.500
A writer who wrote with
feeling and with soul.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.010
Feeling the creative
sense of perfect.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.180
It's impossible to read Lima
Barreto without being affected

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.020
by him, without being swept
up on his own magical carpet.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:00.730
Blurring the most of his borders
between fiction and non-fiction,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.780
Lima Barreto showed us
another visual or another side

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.420
to the one we know very well.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.380
The Brazil of the big hearted

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.050
as Manuel [speaking
foreign language].

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:16.550
Sharing on its shoulders a
word of pain, but which refuses

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.920
to take it lying down.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.920
On the contrary, of Brazil,
let's stand up and fight.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.120
T he republic he watch less
was not the one he dreamt

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.440
and -- sorry, dreamt of.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:37.470
It became in its own
way [inaudible] racist,

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:42.220
all toward looking in,
above all, deeply unjust.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.090
[speaking foreign
language] once wrote

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.310
that the best witnesses
are those

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.680
who stay behind to
tell the tale.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.710
More specifically those
who bring the past

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.230
into the present and vice versa.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:58.940
In the case of Lima Barreto
all similarity is not

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.110
mere coincidence.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.630
But before I finish
this presentation,

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.380
let me also conclude how
Lima Barreto continued

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:15.270
to be very contemporary,
even after almost 100 year.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:21.580
Brazil -- in fact, Brazil
cannot blame it all on the past,

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:27.240
but Brazil is still a sample
[inaudible] social inequality

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.470
and practice of structural
racism.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.600
Poor people, especially
in Tibet, black poor,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.340
are far more likely to be
condemned in the courts

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.680
than to die younger,
have more limited access

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.110
to public higher education,
and are far less likely

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.910
to hold executive positions.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.640
I don't want to bother
you with numbers,

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.200
but let me introduce
a few of them.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.620
A few examples.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.200
Why there has been a general
uptake in life expectancy

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.960
in Brazilian population,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.480
the increase has not been
equal across the board.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.180
High mortality rates
caused by urban violence,

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.110
among the male population,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.910
particularly the young
black population,

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.270
and precarious access
to medical treatment

00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:24.340
and healthcare have
both taken their too.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:30.050
In general, 92% of the
victims of [inaudible] violence

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.160
in Brazil were young and male.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.680
Moreover, if you take the
population as a whole,

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.850
the black youth is by
far the most likely

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.870
to die a violent death.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:48.560
While in 2012 the murder rate
among the white youth was 29%

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.540
per 1000 inhabitants.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.650
Practically same as
to the population.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:45:00.270
The figure for black
youth was 82%.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.570
It's not just a matter

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.880
of comparing per
capita death rates.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.500
There is a very giant gulf
between these two groups

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.960
when it comes to assessing
the risk of murder.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:18.170
Today a young black man in
Brazil is 2.5 times more likely

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.300
to be killed than
a young white man.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.540
In the northeast of the
country, where murder rates tend

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.570
to be higher, the
difference is doubled.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.880
A young black man
in the northeast

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.210
of Brazil is 5 times more likely
to be murdered than a white man

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.200
of the same age in
the same state.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.260
Translated into absolute
figures,

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:48.220
what we see over 56,000
murders per year in Brazil.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.500
30,000 of those kids
are youth ages

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.200
between 15 and 29 years old.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.950
And 75% of those are black.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:03.300
So we have a very
specific color and age bias

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.670
in annual murders rates.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.570
And it's sadly in line with the
nation historical inequality.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.930
The data also leaves no
doubt as to the vulnerability

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:21.390
and limited access to rise among
this part of the population.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.450
Let me move on -- if I
would move to literacies,

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.850
I could give other data.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:33.000
If I would go to racial
inequality in schools,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.590
I will prove you
that race is a plus.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.360
If we talk about what we
consider extremely poor

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.580
in Brazil, once again
inequality is considerable here.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.050
7.2 of the black
population classifies

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:56.380
as extremely poor,
against 3% of whites.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.510
What we see here is one of
many examples of continuity

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.180
between the slave owned past,

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:07.510
then post-evolution
period and the present.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.450
I could talk about access to
public and private healthcare,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.760
pencil and benefit systems,
position in job markets,

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.310
formal and informal
employment, domestic labor.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.970
Inequality is too
real in Brazil.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:34.390
In sum, in work,
birth, death, health,

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.480
race is always a kind of plus.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.730
Data goes above --
underlies the reality

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.010
of discrimination
and racism in Brazil.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.880
It points to urgent
demands for policies

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.150
to promote greater racial
equality as [inaudible],

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:57.400
use it to ask for in the
beginning of the 20th century.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:02.450
A country more inclusive,
plural, a real democracy,

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:08.280
and not a republic, as Lima
Barreto used to ask for in 1922.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.080
Thank you very much.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.500
[ Applause ]

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.170
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: Thank
you so much, Lilia,

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:26.470
that was really wonderful.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.550
And thank you to
Lilia for inviting me.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.120
It's a huge honor and
a privilege to be here

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.660
with Lilia Schwarcz,
it's really one

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.940
of the most esteemed historians
and authors in Brazil.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.120
This is an extraordinary
pleasure for me.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.510
Thank you so much.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.810
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Thank you.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:43.110
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann:
And congratulations

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.410
on this amazing new biography.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:48.260
I really love your description
of asking new questions

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.820
of the same character,
because I think

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.880
that perfectly describes
this challenge

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:59.470
of how can we say something
new about one of the best loved

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.520
and best known authors
in Brazil.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.270
And I think you've really
brought that out today

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.770
by showing us a Lima Barreto
who really is very current

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:14.460
and who has so much to say
about racial injustice in Brazil

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.480
and inequality in Brazil.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.300
And we've known this, of course,
this has been acknowledged

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.990
about Lima Barreto before,
but I think you're bringing it

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.480
out in a different way.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.560
So, I'd like to ask a
few questions about that.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.760
Before getting into that
though, my first question is

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:34.970
about this categorization of
Lima Barreto as pre-modernist.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.180
Which seems strange
based on this talk,

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.120
because you're showing us all of
these things about Lima Barreto

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.400
that are so current
and so cutting edge.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.730
So, why did people describe
him as pre-modernist?

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.650
Where did that come from?

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.760
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Thank
you so much, Bryan.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:58.910
I tried to explain the problem
Lima Barreto faced in 22,

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.680
22 was not a good
year for Lima Barreto.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.820
And Lima Barreto was a very
well known literary critic

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.100
in the First Republic of Brazil.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.890
That's why [inaudible] I wanted
to give him the magazine,

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:17.510
because they wanted
him to write a review

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.540
and to publicize the
Klaxon, and huge genre.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.520
Reality between [inaudible]
was too much different

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.820
at the moment.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:30.920
It was far away and it was the
dialogue it was very rarified.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.140
It was not vivid
as it is nowadays.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.590
So, [inaudible] the intention
of [inaudible] the intention

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.670
of the modernist
is the publicists,

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.370
coming from the publicist
modernist was

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.920
to create this kind -- to
have Lima Barreto writing

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:50.250
about this new magazine and
the modernist in Sao Paul.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:53.500
And then what happens, Lima
Barreto had this title,

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.260
"Lima Barreto's Style."

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.580
It was always like this.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:00.460
He started saying, "Oh, this
is a beautiful occasion to talk

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:01.760
about this new magazine.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.060
Congratulations."

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.620
Then he started saying
terrible things about them.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.090
And then at the end he
says things like this, "Oh,

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:13.150
but then I have to
congratulate you again."

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:17.300
So, this was very much Lima --
now we [inaudible] wrote a --

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:21.950
organized a book about Lima
Barretos, the literary critic.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:23.940
So that is very impressive.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.240
What happens?

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.180
The modernists didn't like it.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.180
And Lima Barreto didn't
like the publicists.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.990
I am publicist, so I can't talk,

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:32.630
I can't blame the
publicists, no?

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:37.110
He used to say, for
example, he used it to call,

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.100
[speaking foreign language],
like this grass [inaudible],

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.810
the terrible writer I am.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.790
And he used it to say that
publicists were all capitalists,

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:46.590
they wanted stupid people.

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:48.120
And so on and on and on.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.430
And then when he received
the magazine he blamed

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:52.730
the publicists.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:59.060
And he received kind of answer
later on in a general part

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.140
of the newspaper,
very aggressive.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.990
Completely trying to
say who Lima Barreto is.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:10.420
And it sounded strange, because
Lima Barreto would be nobody.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.680
Right? To deliver a magazine
to him to write about it.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.210
So, there is a kind of noise.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.970
And what happened later on, the
publicists, not in this moment

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.610
in 22, but if you
think about the 30s,

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:31.040
the publicist modernists became
a kind of measure and they used

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.250
to say, "This is the modern,
all the rest are not."

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.870
So they created this
category of prayer.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:38.510
Prayer, almost.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.070
And that was very terrible,

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:43.290
because they put
the same basket.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:47.490
A lot of very different writers,
completely different writers

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:50.850
and that was very very
different for the reception

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:54.280
for Lima Barreto, because
if you think about it now,

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.950
Lima Barreto uses
the oral language.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.760
Okay, if you read Clara dos
Anjos, the last book he signed,

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.570
he used it to introduce the
slangs, the expressions.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:09.990
So very much -- very close
to the publicist moderns.

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:14.910
At the same time probably
the publicists would not

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.910
like this militant
style of Lima Barreto.

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:21.340
But even so, they
have some proximities.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.320
And when the story of reception

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.080
of Lima Barreto was
very much different.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.400
And in my opinion it started
with this particular problem.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.700
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann:
Thank you very much.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.780
Another concept I wanted to
touch on that you brought

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.820
up is this idea of
[speaking foreign language]

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.660
of social color.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.810
And you brought up a very
striking example of this,

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:45.620
the [speaking foreign
language] and the central line

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.130
from downtown Rio out to
the working class suburbs,

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:52.530
and Lima Barreto noting that
in the morning everybody

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.340
on that train is brown.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.700
So, what is this
idea of social color

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.780
and how does it differ
from race?

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.810
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Well, in
Brazil, Brazil is a country

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.420
that defines -- we define
our country using colors.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:13.320
No? We still have our senses
based on five colors, no?

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:19.710
Black, white, yellow, that
means people coming from Orient,

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.960
used to be red, now
it's [inaudible],

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.690
but red were native people,
and [speaking foreign language]

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.410
that is none of the others.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:30.770
So, it's a very rational senses,

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:34.580
because if you cannot
describe you using your color,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.170
then you describe you like
[speaking foreign language].

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.640
[speaking foreign
language] is a non-color.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.220
Exactly a non-color.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.680
And Brazil is doing a lot
of this kind of concept

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.110
of social color, social race.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:51.430
In the end of the 70s,
beginning of the 80s we had

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:56.990
in Brazil a national census that
asked Brazilians about color.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:01.410
And Brazilians came with
a 136 different colors.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:05.980
And colors around the first
classification it would be a

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.290
kind of rainbow.

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.330
So the Brazilians would describe
themselves like white, black,

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:15.220
for those who purple,
green, browns.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:19.480
And then also we had like
classifications in the middle,

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:25.040
like almost black, almost white,
white, black, white, white.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.070
Coming to white, pushing
to black, pushing to white.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.370
Unbelievable.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.260
And then classifications
like this, [inaudible]

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.560
or [speaking foreign language].

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.040
It means nothing.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:43.100
[speaking foreign language],
But it's not the translation.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:47.540
It's in the -- I'm not
going to say my color.

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:51.930
So, Brazilians change,
play with color.

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:55.810
Depending on the place
you change your color, no?

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:59.420
Because of the famous singer
said, "You can be black

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:04.100
in some situations and
in others he's white."

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.850
The villain of Lima
Barreto called [speaking

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.150
foreign language].

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.890
Lima Barreto writes in a very --

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.640
it's unbelievable that
he wrote like this.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.370
He writes Cassi was
white in the suburbs,

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.050
but when he took the train,
the central station and arrived

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:27.370
in the capital he was
black as though the suburb.

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.770
So, I'm not saying that this is
a good division, I'm not saying

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:33.370
that this is better than race.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.350
I don't think it is --
I don't think there is

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.020
such a kind of good racism.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.770
There is not.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:45.240
This is just another
kind of racist.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.230
I study soccer game in
[speaking foreign language],

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:49.160
that is the biggest
[inaudible] in South America.

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:53.260
And with different
divisions inside.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.600
And during Christmas time I'm
going back to Brazilian time

00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:00.140
to be there, they had
a soccer game called,

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.680
"Black Against White."

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.320
Formerly you had
11 white players

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.120
against 11 black players.

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.990
But depending on the year
people can change groups

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:13.250
as they change soccer.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:15.610
And it's very difficult,
it's very difficult to deal

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:19.520
with this, because
often they play with me,

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.090
they ask&lt; "Professor, can you
explain the color I have?"

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:26.150
But situations are becoming
more and more difficult,

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:28.250
because now in Brazil is now.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.010
Because it's recent, no,

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:34.440
the racial question is
becoming an affirmative action,

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.230
black movement and becoming
very strong, very important.

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:42.320
And working with us,
with the idea of faults.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.960
No? Proud that Lima
Barreto had in the beginning

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.650
of the 20th century, and
that's why he was considered

00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:52.720
in the beginning of the 20th
century a very nasty person,

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.050
because he used it to say,
this is not a good subject.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.000
Not a good point.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.300
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: Thank you.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.830
There's so many fascinating
things that come out of that.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.480
I'm glad you brought up
this nefarious figure

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.940
of Cassi Jonas [assumed
spelling].

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.820
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
Yeah, Cassi Jonas.

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.680
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann:
The evil character

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.980
of [speaking foreign language].

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.710
Why is he named Cassi Jones
and where does that come from

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:19.650
and how does that figure
into Lima Barreto's depiction

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:23.200
of not just race and
social color in Brazil,

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.920
but the local and the foreign?

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.220
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Yeah.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:31.480
That's because Lima Barreto
used to read Flaubert,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.310
[speaking foreign language] and
he used to read also Gautier,

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.240
that was a writer,
philosopher that wrote this kind

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.240
of theory, the Bovary's.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:46.020
The Bovary is a theory of the
mania we have of being daughter,

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.370
no, playing daughter, no?

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:52.970
And playing we have French,
we are North American.

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:58.590
So, Lima Barreto was very much
against this kind of mania

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.420
that he used to say took the
Brazilian's lack of fever.

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:05.990
And he said -- Cassi Jones, so
he gave this name, Cassi Jones,

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.340
because he said,
Cassi Jones mattered.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:13.850
Invented for herself a past, an
English past that she hadn't.

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.950
And, so, Cassi Jones
inherits this name and it --

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:21.800
that was a way for him to
play the white in the suburbs.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.380
So it was a very
severe critic for this.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:31.670
No? Also, he -- Cassi Jones
had this kind of cook fights.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:36.090
He loved to breath --

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.500
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: Right,
cock fights, yeah.

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.800
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: yeah.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.780
And then that was an image
of Lima Barreto of the kind

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:44.580
of game, the games of wars.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:50.270
That including -- that was the
reason he was against soccer,

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:54.450
because he used to say was
soccer would create prejudice

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:56.360
and we would create war.

00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.710
Interesting if you
think how many problems

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:04.800
with racist we have now
when you see soccer games,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.100
even in the United States.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.800
You had a big event
here around this, no?

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: Right.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.260
I'm going to limit myself
to just one more question.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.560
I could keep this going,

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.970
but I know that other
people have questions.

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.340
So, it's hard to
pick just one more.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.860
Bu there's so many interesting
potential comparisons

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.720
that come up, but one is this
haunting image of Lima Barreto

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.850
in the mental hospital.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:32.510
And thinking of a
comparison with Lima Barreto

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:33.840
and Mashado Dajasheesh
[phonetic spelling]

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.800
and Mashado Dajasheesh
very famous story

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.100
of [speaking foreign language].

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.400
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Yeah.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.700
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: where the
psychiatrist comes to town

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:45.040
and starts putting people
in a mental hospital

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.820
and eventually everybody in
town is in a mental hospital,

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.120
eventually including the --

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.420
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
The psychiatrist.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.720
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: the
psychiatrist himself.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.180
And this is a metaphor
for Brazil

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.420
and it's a very popular
used metaphor.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:00.750
How would you compare that to
Lima Barreto's own very vivid

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.420
and terrible experience
and his haunting depiction

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.240
of the mental hospital?

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.540
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Yeah.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.020
Lima Barreto had this --
it's very interesting to see,

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:13.440
even the relationship
between Lima Barreto

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.370
and [inaudible] was very
difficult to say the least, no?

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:21.530
Every time you say -- I say,
"Oh, I'm studying Lima Barreto,"

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.610
there is a person that will come
to you, "so, you are very much

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:26.590
against Mashado Dajasheesh."

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.010
No, that's not true.

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:30.310
They don't need it.

01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:32.220
But Lima Barreto he

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:36.680
in his private library he called
Le Mana [assumed spelling].

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.220
He had all Mashado
Dajasheesh books.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.410
But he did not Mashado
Dajasheesh, he would say it,

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:47.540
so I'm just quoting him, was the
way Mashado Dajasheesh answered

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.580
in this institutional life, no?

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.970
But he wanted for him too,
but he couldn't have it.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:57.870
So that's the difficulty
and the beauty

01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:00.040
of this kind of character.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:08.100
But then Lima Barreto has in his
Le Mana all the books he loved,

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.330
mainly the Russians, that
he used to read in French.

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:16.790
And he also had the books that
he did not like, did not enjoy.

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:19.570
He had all the books
of racial diverseness.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.070
That's very much impressive.

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:23.000
He wanted to study.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.660
He wanted to study in order
to understand and criticize.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.200
He had Nina Rodriguez books.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.480
Nina Rodriguez, no?

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.030
He -- in this book that I showed
the picture, the cover, he's --

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:41.300
that was the moment
that we were trying

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.130
to create a [inaudible] quote.

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:46.180
And he proposed two
panel quotes.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.120
One for the blacks and one for
the whites, because he used

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:53.820
to say, "Crime is a
thing that is very --

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.540
it's something you
have to put in relation

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.690
and you cannot have
one constitution."

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:03.880
So, every time Lima Barreto
wrote things like this,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.740
constitution, it's not for us,
he was quoting Nina Rodriguez.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.970
It's not something naïve.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:14.580
And then what Lima
Barreto experiences,

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.910
he knew very well the
racial theories that worked

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:22.410
with the ideas of stigmas, no?

01:03:22.410 --> 01:03:27.120
That you have extent of
phenomena that could show

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.400
that you -- that
you were a person

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.690
that carried the degeneration.

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:36.710
For example, anarchism was
considered a collective

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.320
that generation.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.750
You know, Barreto
was an anarchist.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.460
Second, [speaking foreign
language] was a stigma

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.100
of racial, that generation.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.450
Alienated people.

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.040
Another side of that generation.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.480
Lima Barreto's father, known for
[inaudible], he had a problem

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.800
with the accounts and
then he became that.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.580
He never came back to life.

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.670
His housing [speaking
foreign language] was called

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:12.300
by the neighbors
of the mats house.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:18.840
So, he was a person very much
against this kind of institution

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:22.940
in Brazil and he considered
this institution a kind

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.400
of symbol of Brazil.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.860
Of discrimination, of
racist, of problems of class.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:37.610
But at the same time when he was
in the hospital the second time

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:43.730
in 1919, there was a moment
that he said that he wrote,

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.590
I studied the [speaking
foreign language], the document

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:54.470
that the dialogue that Lima
Barreto had with the person

01:04:54.470 --> 01:05:01.100
that took care to -- that said,
you are black or you are white

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.400
or you are [speaking
foreign language].

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.190
And then there was a moment
that Lima Barreto says,

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:10.020
"I confess, I have stigmas."

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:13.350
This is the moment as a
biographer, as a historian

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.630
that you think, "No,
please do not confess."

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:18.370
You cannot change this.

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:21.120
But at the same time
he was carrying on,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.920
he was writing a book, "The
Cemetery of the Living,"

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.260
that would be a very very
strong critic of this system.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.450
So, the difference
between Mashado Dajasheesh,

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:34.200
he's a lot of discuss
in my book.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.260
If you compare Mashado
Dajasheesh

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.040
and Lima Barreto's life, Mashado
Dajasheesh came from a family

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.490
of -- more the structured
family that Lima Barreto.

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.490
And Mashado Dajasheesh is not
sure that he was against --

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:54.030
that he was a person that did
not -- was against slave system.

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:58.920
He was. As a public servant
he frequently used to give --

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.520
used to charge the owner
-- the slave owners.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.460
But at the same time
in this situation,

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:10.540
very very very beautiful
a person,

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.910
because one can't understand
the difference of being a critic

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.960
or experiencing this
kind of life.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.260
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: Right.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.500
&gt;&gt; &gt;Lilia Schwarcz:
The experience he had

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.970
in the hospital was
really really strong

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:30.590
and deep to Lima Barreto.

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.240
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann:
Thank you very much.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.540
Questions from the floor.

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:46.570
&gt;&gt; I would like to ask
about Clara Dos Anjos.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.330
[Inaudible] the main character,
and she's a black girl,

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:56.240
and her name, Clara, is the
opposite of black [inaudible].

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.750
And Anjos meant angel.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:03.520
So, I'd like to discuss
what is in this name?

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.820
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Oh.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.850
He -- I don't know your
name talking about this.

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.880
&gt;&gt; My name is Ileany
[assumed spelling] Ileany.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.180
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Ileany.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.690
Lima Barreto wrote about it
as Cassi Jones is Cassi Jones.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.990
It's not naïve.

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:18.420
And Clara dos Anjos is Clara
dos Anjos, not naïve.

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:24.550
So, Clara means a person
that is very -- very white.

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:28.870
No? And Clara was a mulatto.

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:31.170
He describes her as a mulatto.

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:34.080
And in Clara dos Anjos
there is one part --

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.540
two paragraphs when he
describes Clara Dos Anjos father

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.400
and Clara dos Anjos mother,

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.730
that you can see exactly how
he's playing with colors.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.270
In my opinion, Lima Barreto
writes a black literature

01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:54.860
in Brazil, because first of all,
the main characters are black

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.440
or mestizos or mulattos.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.540
He uses a lot of names.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.510
Olives, he describes
himself like black olive.

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:05.360
Something like this.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.630
And then he's also
he's a black writer,

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:11.710
because color matters for him.

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:14.970
So, if you put together
Clara dos Anjos names

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:19.670
in these two paragraphs and
he tries to describe Joaquim,

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:22.850
Clara dos Anjos father,
and then [inaudible],

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.150
Clara dos Anjos mother,

01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:30.730
it's very impressing how he
can negotiate with colors.

01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:33.630
Think about Anjos,
I just took part

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:36.440
of a [speaking foreign
language],

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.690
and the [speaking foreign
language] and the person says

01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:44.960
that black girls are
always saying that they want

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.960
to be white angels or angels.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.570
But that the teacher says

01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:55.570
that an angel is
white, cannot be black.

01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:59.230
So, you can see what
Lima Barreto was trying

01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:01.550
to say with this, no?

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.370
And the deception,
the suddenness

01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:09.060
of Clara dos Anjos
it's very impressive.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.320
One thing that touched
me a lot is

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.920
that he started writing
Clara dos Anjos

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:19.100
in the first moment he
started writing his diary.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:25.130
900. And the first
version of Clara dos Anjos,

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:27.530
she ends like a prostitute

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:34.590
and in another version
he kills Cassi Jones.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:37.780
In another version
she's pregnant.

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:43.230
This is the version we know,
because the last one he signed.

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:47.430
But this is very important for
me, because the critics use it

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:52.900
to say that Lima Barreto
was like writer in a hurry,

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.960
that he had no time
to finish his books.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:01.470
But I think that Lima Barreto
uses another very modern

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:03.990
[inaudible] of unfinished.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:09.800
Most of his stories he's
frequently rewriting

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.120
the stories.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.860
Sometimes as a short story,
sometimes as a chronicle,

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.260
sometimes as a journalist.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:24.370
So it's very impressive to
me that he kept the name.

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:27.790
This one since the beginning
of the novel, Clara dos Anjos.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.330
&gt;&gt; I read the book
many years ago,

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:32.970
and I don't remember the
descriptions of mother

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:35.250
and father or father
and [inaudible].

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:38.960
But I do remember the
last sentence of the book

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.930
and she says something
like, "We are nothing."

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:43.310
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: We are
nothing in this words.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.740
&gt;&gt; So, I'm thinking
about this, she's Clara,

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.380
she's dos Anjos, but she's not.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.680
So, she's nothing.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.980
And it's very...

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.280
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Well, she is.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.710
That's the point that
Lima wants to tell you,

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.290
because Pedro [speaking
foreign language] the professor,

01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.860
a colleague of mine in
Princeton now, and we wrote --

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:07.960
we organized together the last
edition of the roots of Brazil

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.640
and we tried to show how

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:16.040
and when [inaudible]
changed his book completely.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.900
So we had the five most
important editions.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.430
And we tried to prove
how this is Brazil,

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.990
it is a book that moves.

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:32.840
It's not the same book in
36 and the last version

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.260
that [speaking foreign
language] put in that.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.350
The same thing happens
with Clara dos Anjos.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:43.050
So, I agree and I disagree
with you, because depending

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:51.460
on the end, she is a person
that can just be a sad person

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.360
and sometimes she's
a person that fights.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.020
So, this is the category
you have unfinished.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:00.350
So, depending on the
version, you are dealing

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:04.510
with the last one, the one he
signed, but the one he signed,

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:07.720
in my opinion, it's
not the last one.

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:12.040
And that's literature, no?

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.510
That's the power of
literature, imagination.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:17.220
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann:
That's beautiful.

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.520
Yeah

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:27.600
&gt;&gt; I'm [inaudible], I'm here as
a full ride scholar at Howard,

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.970
so [inaudible], I'm a
historic [inaudible] I work

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:33.650
with films, [inaudible] a lot.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.180
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: Thank you.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:39.890
&gt;&gt; But, my question, as you
brought us numbers, sad numbers,

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:45.670
not sad as you put
[inaudible] Lima Barreto numbers

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.110
[inaudible], I was
curious to ask you

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:51.330
about the affirmative actions
and some years ago you were

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:57.380
against affirmative
actions in Brazil and I want

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.100
to know your opinion
about them now.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.560
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz: I have
to thank you for this.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.860
[speaking foreign language]
changed his mind, no?

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:06.590
Lima Barreto changed his mind.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:11.080
And I changed my mind and I
said that for a long time.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.950
I think you know I'm working
in affirmative actions

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:16.860
at [inaudible] for
more than 10 years.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:24.260
And then at that moment it was
a very problematic signing.

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.720
I didn't read the last
text, that I wrote that,

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.430
that's why I can't
say it publicly.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:38.580
And it wasn't the -- how can I
say, the text that was there,

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.300
[inaudible] and Peter Fry
[assumed spelling], they wrote.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.150
It was connected to a very
particular thing in that moment

01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:48.110
and that it transformed the
document in another thing.

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:51.030
I had a lot of problems
about this.

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:53.540
And then I said, "Now,
what I have to do,

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:56.740
I have to prove what's
my opinion."

01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.410
So, I'm working hard
in affirmative action

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:02.200
in Universe of Sao Paulo.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.780
As you know Universe

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.150
of Sao Paulo is the biggest
university in South America.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:12.810
I'm not saying that's the best,
it's the biggest in numbers, no?

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:15.770
Sometimes we are
falling down the hill.

01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:19.820
But it's a numbers, nobody
is going to believe me.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:24.960
And Universe of Sao Paulo
it's also very the last one

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.350
to have this kind of problem.

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:30.450
So, I'm very much in favor

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:34.340
of affirmative action
for various reasons.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.530
I'm going to say two of them.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:40.510
One of them I gave
you the answer today.

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:43.260
I wrote -- I'm writing
a lot of assess,

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.840
showing how Brazil is a
very unequal country and how

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.110
in this very unequal
country race is a plus.

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:53.480
It's more than equal.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:59.610
No? So, I'm for affirmative
actions because we had a past.

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.070
A present past.

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:03.790
And we have to deal
with this present past.

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:08.110
But I'm also for affirmative
actions, and that was my problem

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:12.120
in Universe of Sao Paulo
for very positive reasons.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:17.130
Because I think diversity
is always more.

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:18.870
That we need diversity.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:21.620
That we'll have a
better university

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.590
if you have more
diversity in the university.

01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:27.130
And I'm not talking
just about the students.

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:30.690
I'm talking about the
public administration,

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:33.060
I'm talking about
the professors.

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:36.470
So, if I look around
I'm always --

01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:39.670
now I'm always for
affirmative action.

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:47.180
At that moment my thought in
race as a biological catholic,

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:48.510
I use it to say things
like this.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:53.300
We do not have racist,
we have one race.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.600
So, what's wrong.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.980
But then for a long time in
working with social race,

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.150
like Bryan asked me
in a very casual way.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:04.210
So, if you think
about social race,

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:07.290
what we are saying is
we are in one race,

01:16:07.290 --> 01:16:15.940
but the social creates this very
hot difference in our society.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.200
And as an anthropologist,
because I'm a mix of a historian

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.220
and an anthropologist, I think

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:25.250
that culture is a
kind of second nature.

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:27.800
So, it's so strong as nature.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.060
So, thank you for your question.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.340
&gt;&gt; Happy to [inaudible],
because I was very sad

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.640
when I saw your name
on that list.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.940
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
Yeah, a long time ago.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:40.670
[inaudible] and I'm very
proud of changing my mind, no?

01:16:40.670 --> 01:16:43.800
&gt;&gt; thank you so much.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.790
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible] and
I want to thank the Library

01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:51.610
for being here and
coordinating your visit

01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:52.910
with the [inaudible] meeting,

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:55.290
so that's just [inaudible]
to have you here.

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.540
And, so, as a anthropologist,
my question is less literary

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:04.330
and less historic and more about
race from an import perspective.

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:09.520
So, I'm curious in your
discussion about color

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:17.090
versus race and I understand
the distinction you are making,

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:24.030
I have had lots of experiences
in my own research talking

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:28.190
to Brazilians where
they at one point back

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:39.120
when I was doing my dissertation
research, I handed out surveys

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:48.090
of a racial category and that
was a very confusing question

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:53.360
and I got answers that were sort
of boggle the American mind.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:58.670
Where people would say
to me, "Well, my race,

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:04.300
do you mean in the summer when
I have a tan or in the dark

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:10.840
or in the winter or when
there's not as much sun?"

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.970
And these are things that don't
make any sense to Americans.

01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:22.210
I give that example in my
classes on US based relations.

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:28.750
So I think these are things that
don't make sense to Americans.

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:34.010
But I'm curious in one of
the things you said here,

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:36.740
understanding those
distinction and understanding

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:40.440
that Brazil has a very
different racial history,

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.290
very different day to
day experience with race.

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:46.670
And people's understanding,
identity also

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:49.220
in terms of how they identify.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.410
I'm going to apologize for
a very targeted question,

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:55.080
but I'm curious, would you say

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.360
that their Brazil has
different form of racism?

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.600
Or do you believe that the
racism, what it's based on,

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.510
like the [inaudible] hierarchy
is the same and just sort

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:06.810
of the manifestations of
it that are different?

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:08.300
I mean, I guess I'm asking what
has been an essential question

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.600
to the field of [inaudible]
relations.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.900
So, I hate to pin you down.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:12.200
You can go anywhere you
want on the answer on this,

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.500
just want to hear your response.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.800
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
Very good questions.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.100
We have like four hours?

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.400
Thank you so much.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.700
&gt;&gt; I do.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.000
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
Thank you so much.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.300
First of all, if I understood
your beautiful question,

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.600
I think I would describe
racism is racist.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.900
There was a moment when some
of the scholars in Brazil

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.200
in the 30s and 40s used to
describe color and race --

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.500
used to oppose race and color
in a sense that race is --

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.800
color is better than race.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.100
Color is [inaudible]
and race is not.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.400
I do not agree with that.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.700
I think that color is
a very perverse system.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:37.050
Very [inaudible] naturalized,
invisible form of racist.

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:41.940
And more than this,
it's a very private form

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.060
of dealing with racist.

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:48.600
The thing is, in public's
view, we are not going to talk

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:52.930
about this, but in private, yes.

01:19:52.930 --> 01:20:01.060
And color is a -- I think
it's a very very complex way

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.050
of classification.

01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.970
It's a social marker
of difference.

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:11.330
That you put together
different marks like color,

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:15.190
class, sometimes region.

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.120
Sometimes religion also.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.990
So, it's a way of not
saying and saying.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:27.780
It's a way of [inaudible]
in a very strong language.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.930
Without saying that we do it.

01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:39.390
We -- I work in a group called
[inaudible] that we are study.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.330
The first thing I would
say to you is it depends

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.150
on the region of Brazil.

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:46.050
It's completely different.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:47.710
If you ask your question

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:51.540
in the south you will
have one kind of answer.

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.960
If you go to the [inaudible]

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.930
and ask another question you're
going to receive another answer.

01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:01.530
I guess you will not
receive your answer.

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:05.270
And then if you go to the
center of Brazil, also.

01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:10.080
So, Brazil as the United
States I think it has a form

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:16.650
of a continent, and the
reality of a continent.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:21.120
But even so, if you
go to, for example,

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.140
to a place like [speaking
foreign language],

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.440
I interviewed a [speaking
foreign language],

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.720
I know this person,
this man, [inaudible].

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.900
He wanted to talk with me,
he knew the subject I wanted

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:36.490
to talk with him and he --

01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:41.500
and eventually when I opened
the door and start talk

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:47.010
to him he said to me,
"you know, go," you know,

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:53.350
because in Brazil
you can go or no go,

01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:54.650
[speaking foreign language].

01:21:54.650 --> 01:21:58.510
The moment -- during
the moment I was back,

01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:59.840
my life was very different.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:04.080
So, you can smile all this
and can think it's a joke.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.050
It's not a joke.

01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:07.350
It's not a joke.

01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:11.190
It's the same story we are
reading here in Lima Barreto,

01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.420
that the first time he
was described as white,

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.950
because he was a writer,
because he was a public servant.

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:22.630
And the second time he was a
[speaking foreign language],

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.500
because he was [inaudible],
he was tired.

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.850
You know? So, this is the
way people use color, by --

01:22:29.850 --> 01:22:35.940
but in my opinion, I have a lot
of colleagues here that can talk

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:40.450
and agree or disagree with me,
things are changing in Brazil.

01:22:40.450 --> 01:22:46.700
Now you can talk about
having black proud.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.880
You can talk about different
origins, you can talk

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.080
about different Africans
in Brazil.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.090
So, in my opinion things
are really changing.

01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:04.100
And it's not so easy to say,
"No, we do not have this kind

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:09.160
of thing, or this kind
of thing of racist."

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.200
But at the same time when
I wrote that book, "Brazil,

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.160
a Biography," together
with Heloisa,

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.420
we said we historians
we like to say

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.380
that history is a
game of changing.

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.880
But history can be
a very stubborn way

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.850
of repeating things.

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:33.980
So, in 1988 at Universe of Sao
Paulo we finished our research

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.840
that we asked Brazilians
about racial discrimination.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.570
And it was very simple,
we asked Brazilians,

01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:46.260
the first question
was, "Do you have --

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:49.250
do you feel discrimination now?"

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:53.660
96% of the answers were no.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.990
The second question was,
"Do you know a person

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:59.860
that felt -- was discriminated?"

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:03.720
And 99% of the answers were yes.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.360
And the third, "if you said yes,

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.350
try to describe the
relationship you have."

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:12.970
And people used to say things
like this, "My neighbor,

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:17.040
my grandmother, my
brother, my boyfriend."

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.370
So, the formal conclusion was

01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:21.830
that every Brazilian thinks
he's an island of race

01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:25.420
or democracy surrounded
by races everywhere.

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.720
But the surprise is

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.580
that [inaudible] magazine
just finished a new research

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.360
and again you can see this
kind of thing, you know.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:40.060
We had this public face.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:45.430
As an anthropologist and I'm a
very much a [inaudible] person,

01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:49.780
no, I think that myth
it's not something

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:52.100
that -- it's not alive.

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:56.400
Myth, the structure of
the myths is that --

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.840
the myth tells you not
the truth, but tells you

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:04.100
about contradictions
of this society.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:08.130
So we have this very base root
myth of race of democracy.

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:14.490
The problem is, it's not
a lie, it's not a lie,

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:17.590
because it's a public
representation.

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:22.910
It's something very private
that he people want to believe.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:29.690
And why affirmative action is
so important in our quota system

01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:31.990
and it's so important
in our country,

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:35.440
because we have to
talk about this.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.370
The worse place to
live is invisibility.

01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:44.070
And in Brazil this idea of
playing with colors has a color

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:48.080
of invisibility, has the color
of [speaking foreign language].

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.160
And that's a problem.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.350
&gt;&gt; Bryan McCann: I think
that's potentially a brilliant

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.230
conclusion to the session there.

01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:00.210
Is there any further questions?

01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:02.470
I think we can't really
do any better than that.

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:03.770
That sums it up very
beautifully.

01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:05.070
Thank you so much.

01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:06.870
&gt;&gt; Lilia Schwarcz:
thank you for the class.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:10.710
[ Applause ]

01:26:10.710 --> 01:26:12.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:16.450
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
