00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.839
So what's the big picture here?

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.689
I'll highlight 2 lessons here from this discussion.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.009
The first is the importance of keeping all your threads busy.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.048
Fine grain load imbalance is a performance killer because your thread hardware is sitting idle.

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:14.646
Choosing algorithms that reduce imbalance is crucial.

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:17.387
Second, managing communication is equally important.

00:00:17.387 --> 00:00:21.126
Communicating through registers is faster than communicating through shared memory,

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:26.565
as we see here, which is in turn faster than communicating with the host.
