00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:03.107
 Well, I was thinking 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.960
 I was very flattered about the fact that my sister committed suicide in 2007 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.060
 And I had many questions from people online 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.860
 Such as "I want to kill myself, what should I do?" 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.860
 If she committed suicide 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.916
 I do not even know, I do not even know what might happen 

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:30.601
 is yours 

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:35.921
 All I know is what will happen to the people who die after they die 

00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:40.521
 I think it will be very, very harsh on your family 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.880
 To live a normal life for a long time 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 (exhalation) 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.740
 Hmm 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.220
 If she committed suicide 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.160
 People will miss you 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.380
 Much 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.520
 (inhalation) 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.916
 Damn, I do not want to cry 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.720
 Because if I cried I would not want to upload the video 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.916
 But it is a message I want to deliver 

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:17.665
 (inhalation) 

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:18.360
 Hmm 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.080
 Well, I apologize if I cried, I hate to modify things 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.200
 When I cry, you just see yourself crying and this is strange and then you 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.632
 The video is released and may take ten minutes, then you have to 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.880
 The video is uploaded to the Internet, which takes time, so there is a process 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940
 In making the whole world see 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.840
 That you cried at the moment you are watching 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.640
 If she committed suicide 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.180
 Your brother, your sister, your mother 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.680
 Your friend, your lover, your girlfriend, 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.160
 Your child. Or your child 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.400
 (exhalation) 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 All these people. . . Who really, really love you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 They will be puzzled 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.640
 For the rest of their lives. 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.460
 And they will be really angry 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.640
 And. . 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.640
 And jealousy right 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.020
 I'm jealous 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320
 Of all who has a sister. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.360
 Did you know? 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.580
 Six years have passed since her death. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.600
 It is still very difficult to talk about it 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.120
 I mean in a real way 

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:30.327
 Because I can say a sentence here or there in a video. 

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:33.227
 (Inspiration) and so. . . It's a good feeling when you talk about it 

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:36.367
 Especially when I was trying to deliver a message 

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:38.647
 But 

00:02:38.647 --> 00:02:40.927
 I mean, at the end of the day 

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.767
 As you know, there is someone. . . supposed to 

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.487
 Be in your life now. 

00:02:44.487 --> 00:02:46.547
 But he is not here 

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.076
 They will never be here 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.460
 probably. No, in fact, certainly. Because we all die. 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.680
 But... 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 Uh 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.300
 This event only forces you to ask yourself a lot of questions however 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.171
 You will not get answers, but you will feel unnecessary pain 

00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:06.411
 And a lot of depression and pain 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.180
 It's a bad feeling very bad 

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:13.367
 And unfair 

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.820
 Then you have to wrestle with these same feelings over and over again every time 

00:03:16.824 --> 00:03:17.864
 You think about it 

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.624
 So you try not to think about it, 

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.120
 But if you do not think about it 

00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:22.666
 You can not get rid of pain 

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:24.860
 But healing and getting rid of pain is a very bad process 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.489
 Because there is so much pain everywhere 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.680
 Everywhere he turned to him, he was there! 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.760
 It affects your character and who you are, there are who you were before the event and what it became after this event 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.260
 Which I did, and because of that I am a different person 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.600
 I do not know if it is for the better or for the worse 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.096
 But I hate you and I love you 

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:47.396
 (Ins and Outs) 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.420
 Just do not do it. 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.140
 (Laughter) 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.640
 (Cynical) just do not do it! 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.020
 so stupid 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.120
 Death is a stupid thing. 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.240
 I do not like it 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.540
 (exhalation) 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.860
 But yes. I think this. . . (Laughter) 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.100
 That's pretty much what. . 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.920
 It will happen after you kill yourself. 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.220
 to me . . . 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.880
 Long, long time after the decision. 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.800
 And if you have not made the decision 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.595
 Like. . . 

00:04:31.595 --> 00:04:34.775
 How many more years could you live? 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.920
 To change things 

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.942
 (deep breath) 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 Keep two monks, Gotham. 

00:04:43.748 --> 00:04:44.270
