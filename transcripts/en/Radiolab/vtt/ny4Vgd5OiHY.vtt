1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.250
This is radio lab.

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:06.270
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and our show today is about deception

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:10.650
than we thought. We're better to start then with snakes.

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.820
Oh this is where you keep all your snakes? Well it keeps us home here.

5
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.100
We have a variety of, some of the lizards are working with,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.350
this is Gordon Burkhart. He works at the University of Tennessee,

7
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.330
a paid them visit recently.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
And I have several rooms here where we keep a variety of different reptiles and

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.100
he's got this one little snake that he likes to show off. Small guy,

10
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:35.730
but I just have a pencil called the hognose snake. These are the hog,

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.210
those Nikes.

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.040
So you can see this guy who is already starting to go into the split.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.570
Gordon pops the top off the cage and then does something interesting.

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.530
But what I'll do is pink. He puts a chicken puppet,

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.780
a puppet of a chicken on his left hand,

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.900
and then with this puppet he begins to kind of attack the snake or mock attack,

17
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.410
emulate like peck near it, bird that might be attacking it.

18
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.840
What happens next is kind of shocking and you can see now how was hiding his

19
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.980
hand a little bit. It's coiling,

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.810
it fail first the snake flips over on its back there it goes upside down.

21
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.580
Then it vomits. Blood blood will even come out of the mouth.

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.610
Then it poos itself and as he knows he's starting to deprecate a little bit.

23
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.710
It's writhing and then it gets really it.

24
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.530
It'll finally stop still.

25
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.650
In fact, we'll stop breathing. It's all bluff.

26
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:38.850
All a show. It was like, wait, that is that. It's not bluffing and touching.

27
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.350
Sure, but as soon as we took a few steps back from the cage, the snake pops,

28
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.760
it set up, goes on,

29
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.761
flattens itself now close and there it was alive again and then it'll start to

30
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:51.510
breathe

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.410
<v 1>and gays around. It was lying basically. That's pretty good.</v>

32
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.750
Thank you very much. Hello. You know,

33
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.600
as the world turns was kind of an ordinary lie really. It was. Sure.

34
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.510
When was the last time you pooed yourself for a lot? Wow.

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.250
I could lie to you so beautifully. You would be on your back. Tongue out.

36
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.710
No Way. Because I would catch you back. No, you wouldn't get it. Yeah.

37
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.110
Would though. You would not. I would totally catch him.

38
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:16.780
So sorry to tell you this. That's my catch. Nope. If it were me,

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.950
no you wouldn't. So that's our,

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.450
our know people who lie and the people who catch them, that

41
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.850
<v 2>all [inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.850
<v 1>to get things started in earnest.</v>

43
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210
Let us go to every New Yorker's favorite spot.

44
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.570
John F. Kennedy Airport. Of course.

45
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.370
It's a little place I like to go to get away from it all.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.890
I ended up there with our producer Ellen, a foreign,

47
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.150
we hadn't actually met to come.

48
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.410
It's a guy that we had been interviewing in order for a lar to be portrayed by

49
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.030
demeanor. This is amber has to be, or high emotional.

50
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.930
Right in the middle of the interview, he had gotten a call. Hello? Hello.

51
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.320
Said he had to run. And we're like, crap, we have more questions.

52
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:59.710
What are we gonna do? So we decided to jump in the car with him year.

53
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
We were the relaxing presence of men with big guns.

54
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.741
Yes.

55
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.520
There's these guys that look like they're in combat uniform for Iraq and they

56
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.300
have automatic weapon in case this is Paul Ekman, Ekman, e k m. A. S. A.

57
00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:17.020
A security expert, right? Yes. What he would be called nowadays,

58
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.950
and speaking of security,

59
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.720
the reason he's here today at JFK Airport is to talk with jet blue security,

60
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.290
teach them a few things about how they might do their jobs better. Okay.

61
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.210
We have it, but they'll report it in a building that's out in a restaurant,

62
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.540
not a jump rope. Primary security kicks us out.

63
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.130
We are leaving their terminal and the only place it seems we're allowed to stand

64
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.520
about right here as on the concrete medium between two lanes of traffic where

65
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.530
Eckman finally pulls out the thing.

66
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:46.660
He'd been hoping to show the folks at jet blue. Yeah.

67
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.880
See here we have your [inaudible], your very stylish little laptop. Yeah,

68
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:52.714
just starting up.

69
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.860
It's a simple computer program that he promises about 40 minutes.

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.340
We'll teach you to peer into a person's soul.

71
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.040
[inaudible] click start. All right, click on the start button. Okay.

72
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.070
I'm stepping forward to the computer here. It's loading images.

73
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.360
Please wave about waiting for the pitch. Okay,

74
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.270
so I ain't gonna see that one again. That was so fast.

75
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.850
Whoa. What his that I'll promise I'll tell you, but let me just keep going.

76
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.990
This all right. Okay.

77
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.630
<v 0>Blaine. Paul Ekman. Studies faces the human face.</v>

78
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.000
He's probably studied the face more than anyone

79
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.660
<v 3>up until my work that was published in 78 we didn't really know how many</v>

80
00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:42.710
expressions that face could make and there was nothing like of musical notation

81
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:43.150
for the face,

82
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.150
<v 0>so about 30 years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how</v>

83
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:49.630
many muscles are in there.

84
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.560
There are roughly 50 then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure

85
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:58.060
out how many ways those muscles can combine to form a facial expression.

86
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.370
<v 3>I developed something called the facial action coding system.</v>

87
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.630
Basically a muscular scoring system that you can apply to photographs, film,

88
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.410
or real life behavior. You just did a a one two for grading.

89
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.860
You're numbering my facial expression. The one,

90
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:14.360
two is the most common thing in the world.

91
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.300
Just raising your eyebrows up is one to five.

92
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.850
It's just raising the upper eyelid. Seven is ten second or lower.

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.070
<v 0>All in all the human faces capable of 3000 different expressions.</v>

94
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:30.840
That's what he thinks and as we sat in his publisher's office in Midtown

95
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.840
Manhattan, this is about an hour before the airport incident, right? An example.

96
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.210
Yeah. He demonstrated a few. Yeah.

97
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.850
<v 3>Okay. If you fabricate anger,</v>

98
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.650
it's very unlikely you'll put in what we call the anchor reliable muscle,

99
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:45.490
which most people can't. Rolland early move and get a reliable,

100
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.070
that's what it is. Yeah. I want to see where it is

101
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.590
you're seeing you touching the red margin of my lips.

102
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.570
<v 0>Well, you just look, you look fierce when you do that instantly.</v>

103
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.600
So if you want know someone's mad, look at their lips. Conversely,

104
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.290
if you want another happy, like genuinely happy and they're not just faking it,

105
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.120
he says, look at their eyelids.

106
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.170
<v 3>The skin in between your eyebrows and your upper eyelid and the genuine</v>

107
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:15.841
spontaneous enjoyment smile that's skin moves slightly down,

108
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.380
hard to detect, but visible. If you know

109
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.140
<v 0>you just did it when you said that. Anyways.</v>

110
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:25.910
The reason that we are talking about him here an hour on lying is because with

111
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.780
all the attention that's being paid these days to finding lies by using fancy

112
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.280
brain scanners Heckman is kind of on a crusade terminus that you don't have to

113
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:34.641
do that.

114
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.850
You don't have to look in the brain because the brain is actually directly

115
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.820
connected to the face in ways that we can't.

116
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.730
<v 3>All of these muscles are activated in voluntarily.</v>

117
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.460
When an emotion occurs without your choice.

118
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.410
<v 0>Are there things happening on my face, on her face,</v>

119
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:55.320
on any face that you're only here we don't even know and I'll see about my tried

120
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.560
the naked face,

121
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.890
which brings me to my new favorite word. Leakage. Leakage.

122
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:03.850
Leakage. Yes,

123
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:07.240
it is a word you will hear again and again when you talk to anyone in the field

124
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:11.500
of like hatching. Take for example, Barry McManus, Barry El McManus,

125
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.440
mcma and u s he's a long time CIA interrogator.

126
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.060
Physiological leakage could be anywhere from sweat gland activity.

127
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:22.360
When someone knows that they're misleading you and they break out in a sweat,

128
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.900
that's because of the autonomic nervous system that you have no control over.

129
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.810
Basically telling the truth as easy. That is the crux of it.

130
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.580
According to Steve Silverman, a reporter for wired magazine,

131
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.850
the truth is kind of sitting there in your brain. Your brain knows it.

132
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:36.530
You say it, no problem,

133
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.130
but your brain has to work harder to generate the light.

134
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.930
There is an effort and with that there's always leakage even in an instantaneous

135
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:45.410
moment.

136
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.820
Sometimes you even hear it where a person's reading pattern will change or the

137
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:52.790
size that people do at what particular time did they do it?

138
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.860
If you're not trained to look at it, most people ignore it,

139
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.010
but if you've been trained and you know what to look for according to Barry

140
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.390
McManus, it will strike you right in the face. Speaking of faces,

141
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.860
usually talking about a particular brand of facial leakage that Paul Ekman

142
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.660
specializes in has to do with something that he calls [inaudible]

143
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:14.560
<v 3>micro facial expression are very fast facial expression about 25th of a second.</v>

144
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.130
<v 0>Okay. Just to just as an example, let's just let us imagine, Robert,</v>

145
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:18.964
that you're smiling.

146
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.500
<v 4>Okay.</v>

147
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.790
<v 0>Okay. Yeah, but on the inside, as those of us who know, you can attest,</v>

148
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:26.430
maybe you've got some rage, a little, a little bit, yeah, just a little bit,

149
00:08:26.431 --> 00:08:27.630
but on the outside you're smiling.

150
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.490
Now a micro expression is when for the tiniest, tiniest moment,

151
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:35.790
a little bit of that inner rage slips out onto your face.

152
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.303
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

153
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.720
<v 0>and these are just little like just fleeting expressions on.</v>

154
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:51.210
They're usually pretty extreme, but they're very fast. It happens constantly,

155
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.130
says so fast that most of us don't see it at all. Most of us don't. When

156
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 1>I say most of them, he never had 95% of us in this though.</v>

157
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.360
But once you learn that you don't miss that. Once you, according to Ackman,

158
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:07.710
you wake up to the startling possibility that ties are everywhere.

159
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.080
It's enough to make a man obsessed.

160
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.270
When my daughter was born during seven years ago,

161
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:20.271
I decided that I would take on as a life test to see whether I could leave

162
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.150
<v 3>a line for that line to see whether you could lead your life without line. Yeah,</v>

163
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.090
that sounds possible. It's very tough,

164
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.900
but I'm always looking to see whether there's a way I can solve a problem.

165
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.960
It makes it more interesting than just telling a lie is really dumb.

166
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.030
But you could argue that telling a lie is it's just what we do. No,

167
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.180
we don't just do that.

168
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.450
Most of the time we lie out of laziness or timidity.

169
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.150
I got put in a terrible situation by a friend who had invited me to a dinner

170
00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:55.150
party and the company was doll and the food was worse.

171
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.680
I sure didn't want to go again.

172
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.940
So he invites me again about two months later and I say, I'm sorry.

173
00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:04.840
I can't make it. I'm being polite. Not sure I could have made it. And he said,

174
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.460
oh, well, we enjoyed having you so much. Tell me a date when you could make it.

175
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.820
How am I going to get out of that? I'm prepared,

176
00:10:15.821 --> 00:10:16.601
I'm prepared.

177
00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:21.601
So I said to him with the truth of the matter is that at this point in my life,

178
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.020
I'm very busy and her friends I've had for decades that I don't get enough time

179
00:10:29.621 --> 00:10:32.710
to see and I really can't pursue new friendships,

180
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.160
but that sort of shows it takes a lot of work not to lie and for life or what

181
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.170
that is. This one you feel like a zen hero guide. Again,

182
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.530
I can stay truthful. I didn't take the easy path.

183
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.650
When Paul Ekman began to walk the path of the honest man,

184
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.810
he was faced with a question that has plagued other honest men for centuries,

185
00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.360
which is what exactly is a lie?

186
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.870
Like how do you define it exactly like,

187
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.550
I mean there are different kinds clearly and some are definitely more okay than

188
00:11:06.551 --> 00:11:10.390
others. Where do you draw the line? Eventually he settled on two criteria.

189
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.850
A lie is a deliberate choice,

190
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.960
a deliberate choice to mislead a target without any notification.

191
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.870
So according to that definition, an actor is not a lawyer,

192
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:23.860
although a good actor.

193
00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:27.880
I saw a good actor last night in a play and I was for time misled.

194
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.500
Or even that I even had tears because he had misled me,

195
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.030
but I was notified. So twos are canceled.

196
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.470
My a deception in a similar way, bluffing at poker,

197
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.780
it's not lying because bluffing is in the rules.

198
00:11:43.781 --> 00:11:47.440
It's understood that's part of the game. So therefore you are notified.

199
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.150
It depends. Maybe the rules of, with my wife, we're during our 28th year,

200
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.280
my wife taught me

201
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.760
<v 1>that what I'm supposed to say when she comes in with a new dress,</v>

202
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.200
I'm not supposed to say, Gee,

203
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:04.180
that's not a flattering cut or the color is wrong or that's for someone 20 years

204
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:08.620
younger, all of which might be true. [inaudible] I'm supposed to say smashing.

205
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.360
So, okay.

206
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.200
I've agreed to those rules and their rules I've agreed to is that I will not

207
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.130
tell her the truth. And since we've agreed about that, I'm not lying.

208
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.060
So is this like the poker game where you're allowed to bluff? I'm required to.

209
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.190
You're giving yourself a loophole though. Oh No. No. Cause she's notified.

210
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.000
She knows she can't count on that. That sounds like very lawyerly to me.

211
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.010
Just then his phone rings.

212
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.180
<v 5>Mom, mom. Hello.</v>

213
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.290
<v 1>Hello? Hello. Oh, that's my ride.</v>

214
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.330
We're gonna ride out to JFK with me. Yeah, absolutely.

215
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.120
<v 0>You know this goes, we pile in the car, go to the airport, get kicked out.</v>

216
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.460
<v 1>Tell reporter in a building to there.</v>

217
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:58.461
We were on the medium center strip at JFK coldish winter day and Paul Ekman

218
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.750
finally pulled the thing out of his bag.

219
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.410
It's new technology that he thinks is going to help our chances at catching

220
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:08.550
liars at the airport. Basically it is a computer game. It's loading images.

221
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:11.520
Please wait. You are shown a face on a screen.

222
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:16.521
The faces fixed in an expression like a smile at say and then waiting for the

223
00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:19.530
pinch at k. Pow.

224
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.790
Another different expression flashes for a moment. Whoa. That was so fast.

225
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:27.870
So fast. And then on the screen you're asked, what was that micro expression?

226
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.290
Oh, was it a surprise? You got it right.

227
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.460
Let's try another. Are you ready? Okay.

228
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.980
I need to see that one again. Angry, angry, angry. All right,

229
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.830
let's go and try it. Anger. Right.

230
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.220
Wow. It started out pretty strong. Okay, here we go. All right,

231
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.640
you're going to get three in a row,

232
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.640
<v 0>then it was all downhill. Oh,</v>

233
00:13:56.641 --> 00:13:59.280
I didn't even begin to catch that contempt

234
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.900
in the end. After several minutes of this try again.

235
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.180
I ended up getting more wrong than right.

236
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.940
Which put my micro expression identifying powers. Oh No. Less you.

237
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.850
One more time. Chance I could have flipped a coin and I would have done better,

238
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.140
but, but what if you were good at it?

239
00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:19.710
What if you were able to identify the particular expressions?

240
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.050
What would you know? Well, I wouldn't, I would know.

241
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.400
I guess all I really know is that they were concealing something. Some emotion.

242
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.180
That's, yeah, and that's it. Yeah. And in fact on the way over in the car,

243
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.320
Ekman said a point blank. If you are looking for some sure. Fire dead giveaway.

244
00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:35.310
Sign of lying.

245
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.700
<v 1>It's just not there because we don't have, we don't have a Pinocchio's nurse.</v>

246
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.583
Sure.

247
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.703
<v 6>Oh,</v>

248
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.040
<v 1>we don't have something that only occurs when people are lying. Really?</v>

249
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:49.290
So there is not say a muscle number,

250
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.320
a 19 that if it twitches in a certain way is a bulletproof hallmark of lying

251
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.730
that doesn't exist. That's pretty easy as nerves.

252
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.940
Is there something close to it on our faces? No.

253
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.941
There are signs of unusual cognitive load or emotional nun,

254
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.720
and that can occur for a lot of reasons and you've got to find out the reasons,

255
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.420
so you're never going to be able to have an idiot behind the machine.

256
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:15.440
In other words, nope.

257
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.000
Radio level returning them.
