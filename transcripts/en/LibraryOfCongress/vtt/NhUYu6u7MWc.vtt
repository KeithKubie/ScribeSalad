00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.760
&gt;&gt; Robert Saladini: Well good
afternoon everyone and welcome.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.340 position:56%
My name is Robert Saladini and it
my pleasure to welcome to talk today

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.300
by Annette Gordon-Reed who
is discussing her latest book

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.310
"The Hemingses of Montcicello an
American Family:" The relationship

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.650
between Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings has been the subject

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.690
of speculation for centuries.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.630
Even more so in the past
decade, perhaps as a result

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.620
of today's speaker's 1997 book
the carefully evaluated claims

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.290
and counterclaims about the
Jefferson-Hemings relationship

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.390
and when DNA testing
increased evidence

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.240
of a sexual liaison between them.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.890
In her latest book,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.530
Annette Gordon-Reed chronicles the
Hemings family from the mid1700s

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.930
when an English sea
captain fathered a child

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.740
by an enslaved woman
living near Williamsburg,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.030
Virginia to the early 19th
century story of Sally Hemings.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.690
Marie Morgan and Edmond
Morgan writing

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.580
in the most recent New York review
of books calls this book brilliant.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.390
I should also pause here and state

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.250
that Annette's earlier book
was also described as brilliant

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.720
by the New Yorker and
they continue to say

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.570 position:56%
that if marks Annette Gordon-Reed as
one of the most astute, insightful

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.170
and forthright historians
of this generation.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.810
This sentiment is echoed
by the winner

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.310
of the 2006 John W. Kluge Prize for
Lifetime Achievement in the study

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.250
of humanity and a great friend
of ours here at the Library

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.130
of Congress, Dr. John Hope Franklin
author of "From Slavery to Freedom"

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.590
who said that "This is not only a
riveting history of a slave family

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.300
on a grand scale, it is also a
rarely seen portrait of the family

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.330
in the big house with a remarkable
account of the relationship

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.790
of white and black families.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.160
This work catapults Gordon-Reed
into the very first rank

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.380
of historians of slavery."

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.210
If Dr. Franklin says
this it's got to be true.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.430
A native of Texas and the
Gordon-Reed is a professor

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.370
of law at New York Law School.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.460
In addition to her 1997 book
titled, "Thomas Jefferson

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.100
and Sally Hemings an
American Controversy",

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.020
she's written several other books

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.060
with Vernon Jordan she
wrote "Vernon Can Read!"

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.070
a memoir back in 2001 and
in 2002 "Race on Trial:

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.040
Law and Justice in
American History."

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.530
In this book she edits
12 original essays

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.260
that illustrate how race often
determined the outcome of trials

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.880
and how trials that confront issues
of racism provide a unique lens

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.160
on American cultural history.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.580
We're in for a very
special treat today.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.510
So I hope you join me in welcoming
our speaker, Annette Gordon-Reed.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:33.300
[ Applause ]

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.600
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Thank you very much

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.900 position:56%
for that very generous introduction.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.410
I'm very happy to here.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.220
This is sort of a return
visit for me.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.590
A few years back I was

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.360
on the Advisory Committee
commemorating the anniversary

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.330
of the Library of Congress,
the birth of it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.590
with Jefferson selling
his books to the library

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.870
after the British had
destroyed the capitol

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.270
and destroyed Washington during the
war of 1812, so it's always nice

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.440
to be back here and see
sort of familiar faces

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440
and familiar haunts
in this building.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.650
I thought I would talk a
little bit about the book.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.780
This is the occasion
for us getting together

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.950
to explain a little bit how I
came to this point and what it is

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.080
that I'm trying to
accomplish in the book.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.070
Robert mentioned my first
book "Thomas Jefferson

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.890
and Sally Hemings an American
Controversy" that came out in 1997.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.270
I was shooting as hard as I could
for sort of a 10 year anniversary,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.470
but you know, books
don't always work

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.090
out exactly the way you want them
to when you're working on them,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.300
so I was a year late with it.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.520
I guess I could make it the
anniversary of the paperback

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.620
of Thomas Jefferson and
Sally Hemings and sort

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.840
of satisfy myself this way, but for
people who know anything about me

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.390 position:56%
and know anything about my work know

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.630
that Jefferson has been a
longstanding interest for me.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.560
I started writing the book,
well actually I started thinking

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.690
about Jefferson when I was a
child reading a biography of him

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.910
as a third grader;
sort of a biography

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.910
that was geared to people my age.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.040
Nothing about the Hemings's
is in that story.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.400
Basically, the kind of
thing that you would expect

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.310
that would teach young people
about the great people who existed

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.610
in their country, Jefferson,
Madison, Booker T. Washington,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.210
George Washington, Carver
there was Dolly Madison,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.570
but Jefferson's biography
interested me the most

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.520
because I identified
with his love of books.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.060
There were other things
about him obviously

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.390
that were quite different than me.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.320
I'm male, I mean he's
male, I'm female.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.270
He's white and I'm black,
but this love of books,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.710
this love of learning was
something that I keyed in on

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.880
when I was reading this
biography and I continued

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.510
to be interested in
him over the years.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.750
I didn't find out about
Sally Hemings and her family

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.520
until I was a teenager and read
a copy of my parent's book "White

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.020 position:56%
over Black" that was written by
Winthrop Jordan and he has a chapter

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.570 position:56%
in there when that's called
"Thomas Jefferson's Self in Society"

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.140
and that's the first time
I read anything at all

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.130
about the Hemings's family.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.200
Then the next experience that
I had with it was writing

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.110
or actually reading Fawn
Brodie's biography of Jefferson,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.560
very controversial biography that
came out in 1974 in which she wrote

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.040
about Jefferson's life and included
the Hemings's family as sort

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.540 position:56%
of the Hemings story, the story that
Jefferson had a long-term liaison

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.750
with a slave woman sort of included
it as part of Jefferson's biography

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.690
and that caused a firestorm
of controversy obviously

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.210
if people remember that and she
was a somewhat embattled figure,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.800
but what really interested me
about that book was at the back

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.500
of it there were two
recollections of enslaved people.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.880
Madison Hemings who said that he
was the son of Thomas Jefferson

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.380
and Sally Hemings and a man named
Israel Jefferson whose real last

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.680
name was Gillette.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.410
In my book he appears
as Israel Gillette

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.350
because that was his
true family name.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.250
Jefferson was sort of appended
onto his name and he is known

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.050
as Israel Jefferson but
instead of his real name

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.530
and Israel Gillette talked
about Monticello and also talked

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.980
about a relationship between
Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.540
and I found it fascinating to
think about the possibility

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.740
or the prospect of being
owned by your father.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.440
Now, I grew up as Robert mentioned,
I grew up in Texas and Texas was,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.760
people don't think of Texas as
the South but it is the South

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.290
and East Texas is the South, any
place I say where they grew cotton

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.080
and had slaves, is
part of the South.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.870
So that kind of thing I knew even

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.510
as a young age was not a farfetched
story, it wasn't that I believed it

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.220
or disbelieved it, but I never
encountered it or perceived it

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.660
as something crazy, because I knew
that this kind of thing happened.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.500
If you go to a family reunion,
a black family reunion,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.510
the people in the family there
will be all different colors

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.880
of the rainbow and typically
it's not uncommon at all

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.070 position:56%
for the older people to be more
fair-skinned than the younger people

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.670
because people back off in those
little towns and those places back

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.660
in those time periods mixed.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.240
So as a southerner viewing this,
it never struck me as an odd story.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.360
I knew it was odd to people
because of Jefferson's prominence,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.660
what he meant to people, but that
has nothing to do with evidence.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.010
I mean it's sort of like thinking
that you're birthday matters

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.790
to the lottery; the
numbers in the lottery.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.430
It means something to you,
but it doesn't mean anything

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.660
to the way the numbers fall,
so you feel about Jefferson

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.250
or how people felt about
Jefferson even, you know,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.330
doesn't really determine what
actually happened in the past.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.330
So, I kept interested
in this subject,

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.620
decided to go to law school
instead of becoming a historian

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.550
because I thought or
was told at the time

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.180 position:56%
that there were too many historians.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.510
What they didn't tell me,

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.650
that they're not many
black historians, PhDs.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:52.050
And people have been happy for
me to not go to law school and go

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.150
into history, but a lack and
a lass I went to law school

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.040 position:56%
and you know, I'm not regretting it.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.380
It was a good choice for me
and I said, well I can continue

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.730
to indulge my love of history.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.090
If you love books, that's
the great thing about books,

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.950
you could always have books, you
know, you don't have to be part

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.080
of any formal program or anything
like that to love and to read books

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.450
and to learn from them, so I
started, I kept reading history

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.700 position:56%
and as some point started to think,
yes but I also like to write as well

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.200
and that's kind of hard to do if
you're an associate in a law firm.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.480
You're supposed to writing
what people tell you

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.780
to write, not your own stuff.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.020
And I became much more frustrated
with just reading history

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.490
and not doing the kind of thing

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.120
that I thought I was
really supposed to do.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:43.030
And one day in 1995 or actually
one month, I began to see articles

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.900
about a movie that
was going to be made,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.510 position:56%
a movie called "Jefferson in Paris."

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.560
If people have seen it, it's not
a very good movie I don't think,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.900
we could talk about that later,
but and I started seeing articles

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.910
about people being outraged at the
possibility that they were going

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.360
to treat this story as true.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.060
You know the story that
Jefferson had this liaison

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.610
and people were saying things like
"Jefferson wouldn't be involved

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.770
with a slave girl: or
"there's no evidence

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.760
that Jefferson was involved
with Sally Hemings."

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.260
Well, a slave girl that kind of
ticked me off because it sort

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.500
of implies that every
African-American woman from 1619

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.310
to 1865 was the same
woman, a slave girl

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.540 position:56%
and you know exactly what she was
like and what she was supposed to be

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.580 position:56%
and this sort of dismissal of the
idea that there were different types

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.650
of people, there's many
different personalities,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:41.060 position:56%
there's many different kinds of
sort of perspectives and experiences

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.500 position:56%
that I know existed in slavery, that
was sort of shunted to the side.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.160
I was also concerned about the
idea that there was no evidence.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.040
Now evidence is not
the same thing a proof.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.200
But I knew that Madison
Hemings's recollections

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.160
and Israel Gillette's recollections
and the oral history of the family.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.290 position:56%
Madison Hemings is not properly seen
as oral history because he lived

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.440
at the time; oral history
usually refers to things further

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.770
down the line, but those two
things to me the oral history

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.530 position:56%
and this primary history that
Madison Hemings gives about his life

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.020
at Monticello, I knew
that that was evidence.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.160
People may not be convinced
about it,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.850
but to say that there
was no evidence

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.320
to me was like say he never spoke.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.290
And I found that quite offensive.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:27.140
If you think about someone
who lived as a slave,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.230
if you think about people, any
group of people who are living

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.460 position:56%
under a system of oppression whether
they're behind the Iron Curtain,

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.830
on the Gulag or Nazi
Germany or anything,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.640
the idea that somebody could
come out that system and say,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.140
"Here's what happened to me"
and people would treat it

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.590
as if it were meaningless.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.860 position:56%
Struck me as not only intellectually
unsound, but it was immoral

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.970 position:56%
in a way, there was a moral aspect
to this that really sort of fired me

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.920
up and I sat down to write an op-ed
piece that got longer and longer

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.430
and longer and turned
into my first book.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:08.040
And as I was writing the
book, I thought at this point,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.010
I didn't tell anybody I was
writing a book, a law professor.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.790
I'm actually a professor of
history now too at Rutgers,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.880
but law professors are supposed
to be writing law review articles,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.650
so I didn't tell anybody
I was writing a book.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.860
I wrote the book and as I did so,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.270
I thought you know I could do what
I've really always wanted to do

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.080
and that is write a
biography of Jefferson

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.980
and that is the next big thing
on the table right now for me,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.950
but I also thought, you know,
there are lots of records

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.260
about the Hemings's here.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260
Jefferson as many of the
people in this room know,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.420
was an inveterate record keeper.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.420
Not only in terms of writing things

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.200
down in letters, but
in the "Farm Book."

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.610
His Memorandum Books that
were edited by James Bear

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.420
and "Cinder" Stanton, Lucia
Stanton at Monticello.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.170
I think the greatest work of
Jefferson's Scholarship in decades.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:02.240
It's the most useful thing
that has come down the pike.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.110
Those kinds of records say
a lot about the Hemings's.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.630
In this book, at one point I'm
write about Jefferson in New York

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.430
with James and Robert Hemings
and Jefferson in Philadelphia

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.430 position:56%
with James Hemings and you can
pretty much track what James Hemings

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.900
and Robert are doing every day
from Jefferson's Memorandum Books;

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.610
gave this amount of money to Robert

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.500
to go do this and that
and the other.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.380
And from the letters and
the "Memorandum Book",

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.660
you could piece together
a picture of a life

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.430
of individual enslaved people in
ways that you just can't otherwise.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.100
I mean this is, we know more
about this family than you know

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.850
about not just other enslaved
people, but white people who lived

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.110
in the 18th and 19th century,

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.780 position:56%
so as I was writing the first book I
thought, well here's an opportunity

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.430
to write about slave, enslaved
people in a different sort of way.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.670
One of the things I
say in the book is

00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.620
that for African-Americans
social history trumps biography.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.150
People see blacks and
enslaved people

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.320 position:56%
and I really do think the way
people see blacks today is very much

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.970
influenced by slavery, how
they were viewed in slavery

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.490
and it's sort of a group identity.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.480
You determine what is going on in
a black person's life by looking

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.530
at what's happening to the
majority of black people.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.250
We don't really do
that with white people,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.100 position:56%
certainly biographers don't do that.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.770
You may get the context,
the larger context

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.090
that the person is living in, but
you sort of write from the inside

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.010
out as much as you possibly can.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.160
Rather than saying,
okay what's happening

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.700
to this group of black people?

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.680
This is likely what's happening
to that one and what I wanted

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.610 position:56%
to do here was to use the
information from Jefferson's records

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.760
from the oral history
of the Hemings's family.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.080
Some of the written record
of the Hemings's family,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.110
some of the members of the
family were literate to try

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.040
to piece together, to try to
do for them what is often done

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.590 position:56%
for other whites in history and that
is to give them an individual story.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.140
I think dealing with people,
dealing with abstractions is tough

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.840
for people, it's tough to relate
to a concept enslaved black person,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.020
enslaved black woman but if
you write about Sally Hemings

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.960
or Elizabeth Hemings or James
Hemings and you see James Hemings

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.450
who starts out in the
book as a young boy

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.670
who is capturing mocking
birds for Jefferson

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.390 position:56%
when Jefferson is courting his wife.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.470 position:56%
He mentions in his "Memorandum Book,
I gave Jamie this amount of money

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.090
for capturing a mocking
bird for me."

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.840
Then you see James go to become
a teenager who is in Richmond

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.230
when Jefferson decides that
he's going to go to Paris

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.570
and Jefferson doesn't really
know where he is so he writes

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.180
to William Short and say
"if you can find James,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.340 position:56%
tell him to meet me in Philadelphia.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.370
We're going to France."

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.300
Jefferson has the idea that he's
going to turn him into a chef

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.000
which he actually does, so we
see a young boy and you see him

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.460 position:56%
as a teenager, you see him in France
as a young man learning a skill,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.000
becoming a professional chef.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.830
It's not an insignificant
thing to have happened.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:12.070
I mean, how many people in
America, how many Virginians white

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.270
or black went overseas and
lived in a francophone country

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.410
for over five years who
learned a trade in that,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.340
a profession in that place who
worked with other French people

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.640
to sort of bring that out?

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.360
So you see him sort of progress
through life to the point

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.790
where he's back in America with
Jefferson, then becomes a free man,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.060
travels around in the United
States, travels back overseas

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.690
and unfortunately ends, his life
ends tragically as a suicide.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:49.090
There's a person here, there's not
a concept of enslaved black man

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.210
that is sort of a distancing thing,

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.660
a thing that you can make
someone an object of pity,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.140
but what I want these
people to be are sort of,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.550
are the kind of people
that you empathize with.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.580
Empathy requires some degree
of connection to the person

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:08.300
and pity you can sort of
put the person over there

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.830
and it's not really like you.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.070
Empathizing with enslaved people,
I think it's just another, again,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.580
it's not the only way to do things.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.010
I never understood people who
think that it's either this

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.180
or it's either that, you're writing
the social history and only that

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.520
or you're writing the biography.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.820
It's all kinds of things.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.680
If we're really going to get a
handle on this part of our history,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.220
you have to look at all different
facets and use all different types

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.940
of methodology and what
I'm trying to do here is

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.350
to personalize the story of slavery

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.910
so that people can
get at it that way.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.050
This was driven home
to me very forcefully,

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.660
a couple of summers ago I was
sitting there a Sunday afternoon,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:54.920
this is so pathetic, typing away on
this book and coming to a section

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.730
about Mary Hemings who was
Sally Hemings's oldest sister

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:06.340
who when Jefferson goes to Paris is
leased out to man named Thomas Bell

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.190
and they began a relationship.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.910
They have two children.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.720
When Jefferson comes
back, she asks Jefferson

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.910
to sell her to Thomas Bell.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.960
This is, I mean this is
slavery and property,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.860 position:56%
think of someone being leased, the
idea of leasing a person to someone.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.160
He comes back.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.920
She asks him to sell her to Thomas
Bell which Jefferson agrees to do,

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.910
but he agrees to, but he apparently
is only amendable selling her two

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.140
youngest children; the two
children that she's had

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.850
with Thomas Bell, not
her older children.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.560
And so I'm sort of
writing there and I said,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.400
well you know the older ones,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.700
two of her children had already
been given away as wedding presents

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.200
and the next two were living with
her at Monticello before she moves

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.750
in with Bell and their names
are Joseph Fossett and,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.050
Joseph and Betsy.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.830
And I say, well you know these
two young children were left

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.130
at Monticello.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.170
They were probably looked after
by their aunts and uncles,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.710
their extended family and I
said but Betsy wasn't very old.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.810
You know, she was nine and all

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.060
of a sudden I'm sitting there
being this very detached scholar

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.860
and I started to cry, not like
tears rolling down your cheek sort

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.410
of silent crying, I
mean like really crying

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.070
because there are moment
when it hits you.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.400
I have two children and
I've had nine-year-olds

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.880 position:56%
and I know what it would be like for
them if they were separated from me,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.830
now Mary Hemings lived
not far from Monticello.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.590
She lived in Charlottesville and
so there was a lot of traffic

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.890
between Charlottesville
and the mountain,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:47.200
but lots of other people were not
so even that fortunate, you know,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.590
they never saw their parents
again when they were sold

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.520
and so there are these moments
like that when you think

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.140
of these people not just in terms
of, you know, as lives in the past

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.580
or as a I said, a generic
enslaved person.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.240
You know their names and
you know their relationships

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.790
and you know their
connections to people

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.410
and what they mean to one another.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.040
The book, at the beginning
of the book I have,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.900
it's a very big family so, the
first part of the family tree is

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.830
in the front of the book and the
next part of it is in the back

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.660
of the book and you can
see the naming patterns.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.570
They're naming each
other after one another.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.710
How do people who don't have the
legal ability to form a family,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.820
how do they keep that together?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.480
And one of the ways they kept it
together was by naming one another

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.570
after their siblings, after their
mothers, there are many Sarah's;

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.220
Sally Hemings's name was Sarah.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.780
There are many Sarah's in that
group; Mary's; Elizabeth's;

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.230
Martin's; James's all
the different generations

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.330
and that's how people kept
things together and I felt

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.920
as I was writing my first book
and as I said, looking at all

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.250
of this information that I could
try to aluminate another aspect

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.890
of slavery by coming at
it from a different way,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.140
not just the group identity
but the individual identity.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.180 position:56%
So, I sat down and started to write.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.710
I mean I typically, I mean
some people sort of jump back

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.760 position:56%
and forth I've heard in the types in
their writing the different periods

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.400 position:56%
of time, I generally start; the
first thing that I start writing is,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.580
and I just kind of go through
to the end, I don't really skip

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.470
in chronology or anything,
so I sat down and started

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.780
with the preface talking
about my looking at the,

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.750
looking at the "Farm Book",
the original "Farm Book"

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:36.320
at the Massachusetts Historical
Society and I go from there.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.940
The first section of the
book, it's very long book,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.340
but people have told
me it's readable,

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.940
a long book divided
into three parts.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.950
The first part is called "Origins"

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.140
and that really sets
up the Hemings family.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.400 position:56%
We start with Elizabeth Hemings, the
matriarch of the clan who is born

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.610
in 1735 to an English ship
captain and an African woman.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:06.380
She is owned by a prominent family
in Virginia called the Eppes's,

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.720
Francis Eppes is your owner and
Francis Eppes has a daughter,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.760
a legal daughter Martha who grows
up to marry a man named John Whales

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.800
who is Jefferson's, who will
become Jefferson's father-in-law.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.150
John Whales marries, as I
said, marries Martha Eppes,

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.090
has his own daughter Martha.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.400
Then has two other wives, and as
was often the case in those days,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.650
buried two more wives,
he had three wives.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.680
After the third time I guess
he decided he did not want

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.390
to get married again and he took
Elizabeth Hemings as a concubine,

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.470
Sally Hemings's mother and
had six children with her.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.700
The youngest of whom was Sally
born in 1773 the year he died.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.810
John Whales, a fascinating figure.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.720
I include in the Hemings family
the white men who had children

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.590
with Hemings women, so I did a
lot of research on John Whales.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.410
It gave me the excuse to go to
England and go to Lancashire

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:08.170 position:56%
and actually work with a genealogist
to trace his family line down.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.330
A fascinating story about him.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.860
In my first book I describe him
as a lawyer trained in England

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.650 position:56%
because relying on Tyler's Quarterly
or one of those old magazines,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.300
that's what they said, you
know, right so he was a lawyer.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.850
It sounded plausible to me.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.920
He actually was a servant
boy who was brought

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.480
over by a man named Phillip
Ludwell in the late 1730s who

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.740
and this man helped
raise him up, you know,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.390
gave him money, helped educate him.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.660
He was evidently a very, very smart
and creative man and I thought

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.970
that was fascinating because
it's sort of; the difference

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.890
between being for Martha
Jefferson, Jefferson's wife,

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.690
the daughter of a man who was
trained as a lawyer in England

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.640 position:56%
which would point to at least a
middle or an upper class background.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.330
I mean there were some
farmers sons who did become,

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:01.130 position:56%
who did go to the law, didn't
typically become you know barristers

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.030
or the sort of the people who
argued in court, but the difference

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.540
between that and being a former
servant boy, I think was,

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.030
is quite a bit there and it makes a
lot of the things about Jefferson;

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.260
in Jefferson's biography he
has this very famous quote,

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.370
where he sort of disparages
people who say

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:21.600
that they can trace their
ancestry back, far back in England

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.380
and Scotland and let anybody
make of that what they will

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.890
which was basically saying
I don't make anything of it.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:31.040
People typically say, well that
is really a slap at his mother

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.010
because his mother was a
member of the Randolph family

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.240
that was more prominent
than the Jefferson's

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.800
and maybe this is some sort of
tension between him and his mother.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.980
But if you know that his
father-in-law was a servant boy,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.190
he knows that his children are
one generation from a servant.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.690
So, you know, John Whales is sort
of a, I looked as much as I could

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.570
through the family records to
try to figure out who he was

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.180
but he really is pretty much
John Whales, born in Lancashire;

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.300
the day that he was born
and that's pretty much it.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.140
No tracing back his
ancestry back into England.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:11.140 position:56%
So the first part of the book start
with Elizabeth Hemings, John Whales,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.820
introduce Thomas Jefferson,
talk a little bit about blacks

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.400
and the Revolution and the
Hemings's experiences there,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.110
some of them were captured and
taken to Yorktown with a number

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.740
of other people, enslaved people
who decided to go on their own

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.620
to join the British forces.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.970
Martin Hemings who has an encounter
with the British at Monticello

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.110
after Jefferson has left Monticello

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.630
when Tarleton's troops
coming to capture him.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.480
And go from there to talk about
life at Monticello and then ends,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.470
the first section ends with
the death of Martha Jefferson

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.980
which was a, yeah, it
was a cataclysmic event

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.550
for Thomas Jefferson and really
begins the sort of change

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.140
in the Hemings family's life
because he decides at that point

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.530
that he's going to accept the
commission to go to France

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.020
which he had rejected a
couple of times before

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.690
because Martha was too ill and he
goes to Paris, takes James Hemings

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.680
with him and leaves the rest,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.190
obviously the other
Hemings stay behind.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.110
Martin and Robert sort of go off

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.790
and hire themselves
out and work for wages.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.440
Some of the Hemings women are
rented out as housekeepers,

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.010
most of them stay at Monticello.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.540
So this is the beginning
of a change for the family.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.120
Jefferson, we think of Jefferson
at Monticello all the time

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.280
but Jefferson after his
wife's death between 1783

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.780
and until the time he comes
back and retirement in 1794,

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.440
he's really not there and then he's
in retirement for a couple of years

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.170 position:56%
and then goes back into public life.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.640
He's really not a permanent
fixture at Monticello

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.700
until his retirement years.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.820
So this is the beginning of that
process and it changes the nature

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.820
of life for Hemings and so we
end that section and I take them

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.090
to France and most of that
section is about James Hemings

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.660
and Sally Hemings in Paris.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.390
Finding about their lives there,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:12.430 position:56%
they were on what would
technically be considered free soil.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.020
There was supposed to
be no slavery in France.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.500
The French didn't mind slavery so
long as it was in the colonies.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.540
They just did not want
it on French soil proper

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.940
and so they would have had to
file a petition but hundreds

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.040
of people filed petitions in
the 18th century for freedom

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.520
and every one of them was
granted and there was a big,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.720
there was a greater
number too of people,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.370
of masters who just freed
their slaves on their own

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.150
because they knew what would
happen if they actually went

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.030
to the Admiralty Court and asked
for their freedom, so James

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.350
and Sally Hemings could
have remained in France.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:49.970
They were, James Hemings was
trained as a chef as I said before.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.980
He was drawing a decent salary and
Sally Hemings was as well wages,

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.350
wages above the norm
for French servants

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.760
and Jefferson paid
everybody once a month

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.060
which they didn't do in France.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.350
In France you got pain once
a year if you were a servant

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:07.840
and it was you got paid at the
time you left your service,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.640
you did a year as a
contractor, six month contract

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.840 position:56%
and then you got paid and, you know,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.360
payment in a year is
hypothetical payment, right?

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.170
I mean, you would get paid or not
and a lot of times people weren't.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.150
He followed the American rule of
paying them every single month.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.390 position:56%
So here are two young people who are
enslaved in Virginia who get used

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.830
to getting wages and managing
money and having something

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.780
that was their own and getting
paid, as I said, above the norm

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.190 position:56%
for people who, for French servants.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.240
They're in Paris for these years.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.450
Sally Hemings at the; Madison
Hemigns recollections are,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.100
in his recollections say that there
was a conflict about coming home

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.600
that Sally Hemings didn't want
to come home and I don't want

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.760
to be sexist about this, but
I find it very hard to believe

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.660
that this was just her doing.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.320
Her brother is 24.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.540
He near the end of his stay,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.490
hired a tutor to teach
him proper French grammar

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.730
which I don't think he would have
done, I mean, this seems to be

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.720
in preparation for staying there.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.670
Jefferson persuades them
to come home which they do

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:20.790
and the scene shifts then to the
third section which is called

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.110
"On the Mountain" and then I sort
of, which is technically not right

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.610
because as I said Jefferson's
not there very much,

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:33.220
but it's about the life of
James Hemings in Philadelphia

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.860
with Jefferson and some of his
travels and so forth and then pick

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.730
up Sally Hemings and her
children and other members

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.530
of the Hemings family
who become a focus.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.100
John Hemings who was the
master artist in there.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.420
If you go to Monticello now you
can still see some of his work,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.710
furniture and floors
he laid and so forth;

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.940 position:56%
Joseph Fossett who was a blacksmith.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.510
And I followed them through
to the cataclysm at the end

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:04.320
when Jefferson dies 107,000
dollars in debt; 107,000 dollars

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:11.010
in 1826 is a lot of money,
millions of dollars and all

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.310
of the people except

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.770
for the Hemings's he frees
five people in his will.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:21.210
He frees people his family,
freed people informally as well.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.450
The rest of the Hemings as the
Hemings; Sally Hemings's sisters

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.310
and brothers end up as free people.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.610
We don't know how.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.250
There's no formal emancipation
of these people

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.260
but the Hemings-Whales children
is what I call them in the book,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:38.840
Thenia dies in 1795, but
all the rest of them end

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.520
up as free people somehow
appearing in the census

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.500
in the 1830 census as free people.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.370
Sally Hemings appears in
a special census in 1833

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.390
as a free mulatto woman who
has lived in Charlottesville

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:55.350
since 1826 the year Jefferson died
and it was a special census done

00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.770 position:56%
to go around and ask black people
if they wanted to go back to Africa.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.030
Sally Hemings who's like a quarter
black, it even made more sense

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.790 position:56%
to send her back to Surrey, England
to say, you know, do want to go back

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.690
to Africa and she says, "No, I
don't want to back to Africa."

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.420
And I follow and so
that's her story.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.250
I go along with her line, but
also the book ends with the story

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:25.960 position:56%
of Joseph Fossett who was a grandson
of Elizabeth Hemings, as I said,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.930
who was an artist and who was
the blacksmith at Monticello

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.130
who was freed in Jefferson's
will but his wife

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.440
and his children were not.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.910
And so he spent the next decades
trying to buy them all back.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.160
What he did was he asked whites in
the community to buy his children

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.410
with the promise that he would
buy them when he got the money

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.260
and he did that in a number of
occasions, but there was one man

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.440
who would not sell his
eleven-year-old son back

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.280
to him even though he had
the money to purchase him.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.390
He just refused to do it and
he hung on as long as he could

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:00.130
and finally they went
to Ohio in the 1840s

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.280
because Virginia was getting too
hard for blacks after Nat Turner

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.360 position:56%
who was a real crackdown on enslaved
people there and blacks in general.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.870
It has something of a
happy ending because later

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.500
in the other decades
Peter makes it to freedom,

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.630
makes it off to Cincinnati and
joins his father and mother

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.100
and siblings as an adult.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.000
They become very active in
the Underground Railroad

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.280
and Peter becomes a
caterer and a minister

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.730
and when he dies there are big
obituaries of him in Cincinnati

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:35.460
so it's this horrible story
of a family dispersed.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.880
I mean, you know, people talk
about Sally Hemings and they think

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.400 position:56%
about oh, you know, is this the
story of the terrible thing happened

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.050
to this woman you know being raped
for all these years by Thomas,

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.150
I mean, you know, however
people construct this,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:52.260 position:56%
but the real tragedy there are
really serious, serious stories that

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.590
and things that happened to other
members of the Hemings family

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.760
that I really think ought to
be; and the Fossett story is one

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.030
in particular that ought to be
told and to get people to focus

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.630
on in addition to talking
about Tom and Sally.

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:07.270
So that is the book in a nutshell.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.510
I really have been heartened
by the reception so far.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.470
We'll see what happens as
we go along down the road,

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.550 position:56%
but my main point as always as I
said before was to try to get people

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.220
to think about these people to
think about these people who think

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.650
about them in a different way.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.370
We are who we are today
in large measure

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.990
by what happened during these
times and I really do think

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:35.570
if you can be honest and
forthright about that and readable,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.400
you stand a chance of maybe
not solving all the problems,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.620
but at least having some
understanding of how we got

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.920
to be where we are today.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.130
The good things and the bad things
by the way are contained in all

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.690
of this, so that's the
book and I would be happy

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.340
to answer any questions you
have about my work, this book

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.430
or Mr. Jordan or anything
else that you come up with.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.510
Thank you very much.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.340
I think you've got a microphone.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.060
[ Applause ]

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.200
He has a microphone I think he's
going to dart around the room.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.690
Is that the idea?

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.040
Did I, did this go off?

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.340
Can people hear me?

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.600
Okay great I seem to be
going in and out, sorry.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.140
&gt;&gt; Hello. Thank you for your talk.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.830
My name is Louis Clavell
[assumed spelling] and I work here

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.490
at the Library of Congress.

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:25.900
I'm really interested in the
subtitles for your works,

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.690
An American Family, in
American Controversy it seems

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.810
like a great opportunity
to define American;

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:39.950
as an African-American I read in a
paper about maybe seven years ago

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:43.170
that the first African-American
had gone.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.760
Well, the first African
had traveled to outer space

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.650
and this person was
a white South African

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.490
and when white South Africans come

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:55.610
to America they are
African-Americans.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:01.190 position:56%
So when we really think about the
American experience, this experience

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:07.200
with the Hemings and what has
happened through our experience

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:14.090
as captive Africans in a peculiar
and extreme form of capitalism

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:19.320
that we easily call slavery
somehow we need to define it

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.540
in a more particular way so that
we can see that these connections

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.050
with Native Americans,
with Europeans

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:33.810
and Africans has really created
an African family, I mean,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:39.260
or an American family or an
American grouping of people

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:44.210
that by historical experience
defines us in a unique way

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.460
and through this unique historical

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.040
and migratory experience we
are actually a little more

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.160
than black Americans
or African-Americans

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.860
but almost the definition of
American and I just wanted

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.430
to have your thoughts on that.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.730
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Well it's just sort

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.030
of interesting you would say that.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.580
James Baldwin had an
interesting quote.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.190
He said that if black Americans,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.850
"if blacks aren't Americans
there are no Americans"

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.180
and that's sorely what you
sort of are driving at there.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.470
The beginning of the
book I didn't talk

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:17.200
as much about Elizabeth Hemings.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.040
Starts with Virginia in
the 1730s and one of the,

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.460
if you to Colonial Williamsburg
and you walk around, I mean,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.470
it's very hard to recreate what
it was actually like because

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.690
for obvious reasons black people
have no interest in dressing

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.670
up as slaves and walking
around Williamsburg to try

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.450
to give people the authentic
experience, you know,

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.870
I mean there's only so far
people are willing to go,

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.330
but Williamsburg the area

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.560
where Elizabeth Hemings
was born was a place

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.670
of English people and
African people.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.510
I mean with the smattering of other
ethnic, European ethnic groups

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.500
in there but we're talking
almost half and half

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.200
and the 1730s more
Africans were brought

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.590
into Virginia during the 1730s

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.810
than in any other part
in American history.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:06.540 position:56%
So and more Africans came to America
before the 1800s than whites,

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:12.340
brought over obviously as enslaved
people, so this notion of American

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.310
and whiteness, whiteness is the
sort of elemental definition

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.980
of American can't really hold just
by the numbers they don't hold.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.200
The Native Americans I
don't really get as much

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.310
into the Native American situation
in the first part of the book

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:33.560
as I do black and white because
I'm focusing in on this family,

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.600
but that's really an
essential thing to understand

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.230 position:56%
and it's very hard to conceptualize.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:42.210 position:56%
I mean if you go to Williamsburg
and you see that film that they have

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.460
"Running in a Loop" I think it
was made in the 50s or something

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.760
like that and it's a white place,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.090
but Williamsburg was
not just a white place.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.150
It was a white place and a
black place and red place,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.760
and fortunately not
much of a red place

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.630
because they were sort
of gone by then.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.300
I mean more to, you know, they
were more in the western part;

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.020
a number of them died off and
run off their land, but this is,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.640
we think of America as
a global society now

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.280
but slavery made the world
global at that time period

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.110
so there is this interesting
mixture,

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:22.530
this way of defining America that
is it has to be broadened much more

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:27.850
so than, you know, just the first
English settlers in the country

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.700
and you don't say that
these people don't count

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.000
because they were enslaved people,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.200
because they influenced
the language, the culture.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.180
I mean Europeans always say white
Americans walk like black people.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.410
Carl Jung said, "White
Americans walk like Negros."

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.220
That was his, I mean, from a
European perspective we have been,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.120
we've become something
and certainly Africans,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.960
people form the African
continent don't look

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.720
at African-Americans
as being first place.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.950
There's Africa is so diverse,

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:00.200
so how could you possibly represent
all the diversity of that country.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.410
Europeans and Africans know that we
are something different than they

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.100 position:56%
and we have made something different
here through a lot of, you know,

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.500
tragedy and struggle and turmoil.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.570
But you're right, it's
a, there's a uniqueness

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.430
about the American experience
that isn't encapsulated

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.870
in just one ethnic group.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.450
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Coreen
Mahurt [assumed spelling].

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:25.750
I work at the United
States [inaudible].

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.760
I have a two part question.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.790
I would like to know
if any of the people

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.300
on Sally Hemings's
father side, the Whales,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.790
am I pronouncing the
last name correctly?

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.570
If they acknowledge your or
accept any of the Hemings and want

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:46.570
to be a part of her heritage in
connection with the president?

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:51.230
And secondly, the property of
Monticello, do they invite you

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.720
to spread this information
about the Hemings in detail,

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.620
are they more willing
in accepting nowadays?

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.920
Thank you.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.650
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well I'll
go chronologically as you asked it.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:04.950
I don't know about the Whales.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:09.740
It will be interesting because, you
know, Lancashire is pretty far away

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.800
and I think, I don't know that
they know anything about them.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.780
I'm actually going to be doing,
I'm going to be Oxford in February

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.700
and I'm going to be
doing some events.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.520
Norton there will be
setting up events,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.010
probably some events in Lancashire.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.650
It will be interesting to see
if anybody comes out, right.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.800
Because it will be, you know, hey
we didn't know anything about this,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.970
but it's fascinating because John
Whales is clearly reproducing the

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:38.470
names of his family from
Lancashire in his family here.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.860
So it will interesting
to see what turns up.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.800
I go to Monticello all the time.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.450
I'm on the Advisory group
of the International Center

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:50.490
of Jefferson Studies and also the
African-American Advisory Group

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.690
there, so I have these two
organizations that require me

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.520
to be there for their meetings
periodically during the year

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.530
and I go there for research.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:02.700
We have technically, now you
guys are a launch as well,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.100
but technically the book launch is
supposed to be Friday at Monticello

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:12.290
so I will be speaking there
and Monticello, I mean,

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:18.330 position:56%
the Thomas Jefferson Foundation is
separate from the Family Association

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.920
which you may have read something
about in terms of the controversy

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.970
about whether or not the Hemings's
could be buried in the cemetery

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:29.050
which no Hemings as
far as I know wants to.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:33.010
This is a controversy
between the family, the legal,

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.500
Jefferson's legal white family.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.040
So the foundation is very,
very separate from it

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.390
and they're doing an amazing
job not just in terms of talking

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.010
about the Hemings story,
but talking about slavery

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.310
because it's a plantation.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.110
It's easy to forget
that when you go there.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.410
It's so beautiful, right.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:51.050
It's like a, I could
do this, you know.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.940
No. You know easily.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.430
It's a gorgeous place but a place

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.980
that he never saw it
look like, right.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.420
They keep that place, you know,
right up to snuff with everything,

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.190
but they are very committed to
the idea of talking about slavery.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.250
Not, you know, not Tom and Sally
but slavery, the this is a,

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:14.040 position:56%
this was a working plantation and
here are the people who worked there

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.760
and here's the family
that owned people,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.520
so they're melding the story there
so there hasn't been any problem

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.440
at all with me being there
and talking about this

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.430
and arguing about this or whatever.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:30.010
You can come down, well
he's going this way.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:35.190
&gt;&gt; I'm curious, you mentioned that
the movie "Jefferson in Paris"

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.240
and my recollection
is the implication is

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.140
that the spark occurred in Paris

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.060
with a fourteen-year-old
is that right?

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.360
Something like that?

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.660
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Sixteen.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.960
&gt;&gt; Sixteen.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.100
So you mentioned you did a lot of
reading of these meticulous records

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.670
and also the distinction
between evidence and proof.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.970
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Ah hum.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.900
&gt;&gt; Did you find evidence
if not proof

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.530
or did you develop any theories

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:06.570
about when this relationship might
have started timewise and where?

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.360
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Actually it
is my belief Madison Hemings said

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.590
the part that I left out
in the chronology here,

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.770
is that his mother was pregnant
when she came back from Paris

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.460
and that was one of the
things that concerned her is

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.320 position:56%
that she didn't want to have a child
who would be an enslaved person

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.890 position:56%
and he says that Jefferson promised
her that her children would be free.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.310
I talk about this in a book, in
the book, in a chapter called

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.820
"Equilibrium" and I
talk about indications

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.480
that Sally Hemings had a
baby in 1790 from letters

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:44.380
between Martha Jefferson
and Betsy Eppes, Hemings's,

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.360
would have been Hemings's
half-sister.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.100
So it's really form working from
what happened in 1790 the letters

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.180
in which he writes when Martha
says, you know "I need a new maid

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.990
and what happened to Sally?"

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:02.290
And Jefferson says, "Well,
I will give you a maid

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:07.270
and he gives her Mary Hemings's
daughter Molly at this point.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.540
So then you think well
what happened to,

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.140
Sally was your maid two months
ago what the heck happened now?

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.440
They don't really talk about it.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.710
That letter is no longer
extant by the way.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:20.070
There's, Jefferson makes
reference to it in his letter,

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:25.610 position:56%
the actual letter that Martha writes
to him is, as with of his letters,

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:28.260
I mean you know, it's amazing that
we have as many of them as we do.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.480
So there's a whole chapter
though I go through and talk

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.120
about the correspondence
between them that indicates

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.860
that something happened
that she sort of disappears

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.730
from this family after 1790.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:43.200
You write about, people
write about her sisters,

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.990
they write about her brothers,
but here was a person who was

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.350
at the heart of this family
that just sort disappears

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.730
of the radar screen after 1790.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:56.470
So there is a chapter and I layout
all of this information about 1790

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.880
and what happens with Sally
Hemings when she comes back.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:07.750
You know, I did a talk for the, for
my children's school, middle school

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.900
and they were, well they were
sixth graders and I was thinking,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.630
you know, how am I
going to talk about this

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.300
to sixth graders, right you know?

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.030
So I get there and I sit
down and they're like,

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:17.570
I don't know how anybody
calls this an affair.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.240
An affair is when you're married
to somebody and you're having sex

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.320
with somebody, I mean they
started saying all this stuff

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.900 position:56%
and I was like, I was trying to be
circumspect and they were, you know,

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.100
just sort of running
along with this.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.770
And I said, well okay and they said
well what's the problem with this?

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:36.570
I said, well you know, she was
an African-American person.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.890
She's black and he's white and
they didn't really get that.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:41.690
And I said, well you
know, he's a slave master.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.160
He has power over this
person, you know,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.360
how can you know, that's
an issue here.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.430
How do you have consent
if this person has power?

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.780
And they said, well
but if you own somebody

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:57.030
if you can make them work why, I
mean so that really didn't get them

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.190
and then they asked me the
said well how old was she?

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.690
And I said she about sixteen
and then they went oh.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.620
Because they could, you could
see them totaling up the years.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.370
Well I'm in middle school that
would mean that blah, blah, blah,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.310
blah and that was the one
that gave them real pause.

00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:16.080
And I talk in the book about,
I mean, sixteen is young

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.560
but there is a whole section in the
book and I talk about James Madison

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.460
who fall in love with a girl
whose named Kathryn Floyd

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:28.480
when she's fifteen and he wants to
marry here and Jefferson is sort

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.190
of like the matchmaker, you
know, Madison is thirty-three,

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.060
this girl is fifteen years old.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.130
He met her when she was twelve.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.300
The lived in the same rooming house
and I say, you know, out of respect

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.170
for Madison we could never know
when he first became interested

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:43.960
in her and, you know, just know

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.760
that by the time she's
fifteen he wants to marry her.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.520
I mean, there's the age
of consent in Virginia

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.340
in the 18th century was ten.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:47:01.190
It was raised to twelve in 1824 and
they were being progressive, right?

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.750
There is a different
understanding about age.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:11.610
You know, women postpone marriage
now because they go to college,

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.570 position:56%
they do all these kinds of things
but if you, women, what did women do

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.450
in those days according to men?

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.680
What were they supposed
to do but have babies?

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.980
Get married and have babies.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.590
And you don't wait to do that.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:27.800
So, no but that's a real issue for
people, the age here the question

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:32.020
of Jefferson being involved with
somebody who's sixteen but I sort

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.230
of go through the list of people in
his life who were married to his,

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.050
one of his childhood
friends Thomas Mann Randolph

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.650
at fifty marries a girl
named Gabriella Harvey

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:48.900
when she's seventeen and, you know,
it's this is a different world.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:53.720
So I do, I discuss that issue and I
talk about 1790 when they come back

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.290
and all of the kinds of indications

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:58.580
that Sally Hemings's life
changes pretty drastically

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.790
that year from what it has been.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.160
Where did the mic go?

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.610
Oh there you are, you're
stealthy I didn't even see you.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.170
Sure go ahead.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:18.150
I wonder as you've progressed in
your research if you'd comment

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:22.470
on the traditional Jefferson
Scholarship and the ways

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.230
in which the issues that
have, that you've attended

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:30.320
to have not come forth in the past
and I guess I particularly ask

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.000
about any reflections you have
on the work of Dumas Malone?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.630
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well, this
was a difficult issue, you know.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:44.800
Dumas Malone's work, I mean
if you're going to write

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.520
about Jefferson you have to go
to him because it's all there.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.260
Not, well not everything is there,

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.520
but I don't even mean
it in terms of this.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.040
I mean, there's just, the thing
about Jefferson people who work;

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.190
there are people here who
work with the papers I'm sure.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:02.100
There is so much material.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.980
He had so many varied interests.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.120
He had his hand in all
these different things.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.430
You could write a twenty-three
volume biography

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.930
of Jefferson that's why everybody
says, you know, Jefferson

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.730
and slavery; Jefferson and
agriculture; Jefferson and, I mean,

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.200
you could do that with all, I
mean, Malone said he was six

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.520
or seven men rolled up into one
and you could have all these kinds

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.140
of biographies, so there are
lots of things that are missing

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:31.390
from Malone not because he didn't,
not because he's not a good effort

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:35.020
and it's not a good book, it's
just that the man and his interests

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.800
and talents was so immense

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.480
and so many different
ways to write about him.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.750
So I use Malone quite a bit.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.700
In my first book I use him, in
this book when you're not arguing

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.150
with people, just because
you disagree; I mean,

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.610
because you disagree with
someone I would never say

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.640
that someone's work is
worthless because you disagree

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.970
with them about something.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:59.690 position:56%
There are some points that are very,
very good and there's some points

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.710
where I think they are not so good.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:07.580
You have to think that Malone
came up at a particular time.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.460
We tend to think that because
Malone chronologically was closer

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.270
to Jefferson that that
meant that that generation

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.450
of people understood
that time better.

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:17.750
I don't think that's right.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.630
I think the Civil War

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.380
and reconstruction galvanized the
white south in a particular way.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.660
It made them, they were
not like they were before.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.150
I mean the Thomas Bell
story that I'm telling you

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:34.340
about with Mary Hemings, this
man is living on Main Street

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.910
with an African-American woman
and having children with her.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:40.750
He's made a Justice of the
Peace, they have a committee

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.200
to decide whether or not they
should bring public education

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.670
to Charlottesville, he's on that.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:45.970
He's a respected figure.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:50.450
I don't believe that a white man
could live with a black woman

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:54.380
on Main Street in Charlottesville
in the early, in the 20th century,

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.330
in the 1920s and hold
those positions.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:03.830 position:56%
I mean, the Civil War changed people
because they were out of control.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.750
You know, in Jefferson's time it
was no question who was in control

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.460
of society and when you were
in control you could afford

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.790
to be magnanimous, right?

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.750
You could afford, you
get this vigilantly stuff

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.370
when people are insecure
not when people are secure.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:19.650
So Malone grew up in Georgia.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:23.070
I had, when I was working on the
book with Mr. Jordan I went down,

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.720
I interviewed lots of people who
knew him and I went down to talk

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:30.510 position:56%
to Griffin Bell who was an attorney
general under Jimmy Carter I believe

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.260
and he had said, "Oh I can't wait.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.700
You know, I've read your book.

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:35.690
I've written this article
about Jefferson

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:36.990
and Hemings would you look at it?"

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.580
And so, I looked at
it and it was great,

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.030
but what he said he said you know,
"I grew up not far from Malone

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.770
and I don't understand
why he thought this was

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.070
such a weird thing."

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.180
He said, "Because we
all knew that this kind

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.200
of stuff happened back
in that time period."

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:58.750
So I think that it was just a, we I
mean, we think as I said it's wrong

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.390
to think that because he's
nearer to Jefferson's time

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.380
that he would be better
suited to do this.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.880
I think that generation of people
were probably the exactly wrong

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.540 position:56%
group of people because he grew up
at a time; this was against the law.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:14.210
It was against the law for white
people and black people to marry

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:20.000
in Virginia until 1967 and
they just had the anniversary

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.800
of "Loving v. Virginia"
last year obviously.

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:29.290
So, I think that he was obviously
he was a good scholar but I think

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:34.370
that this was an issue that
was very, very hard for him

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:40.780
and his generation to
handle and it meant,

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:46.410
well attaching too much
significance to it, because to me,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.050
the thing that I've always wondered

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.710
and no one has really given me
a satisfactory answer to this,

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:55.880
is when I see stories about
like the Fossett's what happened

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.410
to the Fossett's?

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:01.870
There is Jefferson in
1813 negotiating the sale

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.810
of a three-year-old girl.

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:08.360
He doesn't go through with it,
but that could have been sort

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.080
of in his, a three-year-old, right?

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:17.370
I mean, the things that we accept
as normal in slavery and the things

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.710
that we; my mother used to
have this expression, you know,

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.980
gagging at a gnat and
swallowing flies, you know you,

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.360
this is something that bothers
people but all these other things

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.950
that are just really endemic to
that system that were really,

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:34.660
really horrible in comparison
that we just kind of accept it.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:39.500
The other thing for Malone I will
say, is that scholars are helped

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.900
by the works of others and
there has been a revolution

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.630
in slavery historiography
in the past forty years.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.260
It is the crown jewel
of American history,

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:53.210
really I mean the names Edmund
Morgan, Winthrop Jordan,

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:56.090
John Hope Franklin, C. Vann
Woodward all these names,

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.090
David Brion Davis we have learned
so much more about the institution

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:03.080
of slavery than Malone
would have learned

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.420
in his years as a graduate student.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:10.670
So, Phil Morgan the wonderful
book "Slave Counterpoint"

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:13.500
about the development of slavery
and the Chesapeake, you know,

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.080
I really mind that book
just great sources.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.060
So you're enriched by the work of
other people and as we go along

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.600 position:56%
and people do more scholarship
those kinds of things are available.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.610
The Civil Rights Movement
certainly changed attitudes

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.650
about the way you write
about black people.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:34.490
Black people are human
beings in scholarship now

00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:38.750
and they really weren't full
human beings in the past.

00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:41.690
They were just sort of like
the flora and fauna here

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.310
and I think there was
some embarrassment

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.450
about Jefferson's ownership
of slaves.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.780
I mean, Malone was what would
call in his own way sort

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.800
of like a southern liberal, right?

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.290
And I think that there was
discomfort with writing

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:58.630
about Jefferson in this
part of Jefferson's life

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:02.210 position:56%
that was less admirable than all the
other things, but we understand now,

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:07.300
I hope we understand now,
that you can you know,

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.640
that you can celebrate
Jefferson's accomplishments,

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.940
undoubted accomplishments.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.820
They had this television program
that was, we were supposed

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.840 position:56%
to pick the greatest American, you
know, and it was one of those things

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.780
that I shouldn't have
said yes that I would do,

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:24.100
but unfortunately Jefferson
didn't make the cut.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.780
I think Elvis and some
other people were in there.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:32.850
I think Reagan won out, but I
was on the team to go and argue

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:37.040
for Jefferson as the greatest
American and if I could do

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.390
that understanding the flaws
but understanding the importance

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.380
in the other ways; I didn't
get a chance to make my pitch,

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:49.210 position:56%
but I think we are at a time, we are
more tolerant of this time period

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:52.240
of people who have flaws and
understanding that flaws don't mean

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.540
that the person is worthless.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.370 position:56%
Like I said before about
scholarship, just because I disagree

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:59.120
with someone's scholarship
doesn't mean that I say okay now

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.960
down read Malone, or don't
read Merrill Peterson

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.260
or don't read those people.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.050
There's valuable, "The
Jefferson Image

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.690
in the American Mind"
is a great book.

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.340
I just didn't like what he said

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:10.920
about the way he treated
the Madison Hemings story.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.740
But it's something
that's useful otherwise,

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.830
so that's my view on scholarship.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.560
People do the best that
they can with what they have

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.440 position:56%
and history is the best of available
information you have at the moment

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.320
and that is, you keep that in mind
and things keep getting rewritten

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.430
and I understand that definitely,
so that's how I feel about it.

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:36.420
&gt;&gt; Did you ever find out
what happened to Martin?

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.790
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Hemings: Hemings.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:43.080
No, you know, that is something
that is puzzling to me.

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:48.410
Martin Hemings was Sally Hemings's,
well Elizabeth Hemings's oldest son

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.800
and he was the butler at
Monticello for a number of years.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.180
He's the one I said who faced
down the British when they were

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.730
at Monticello and he quarrels
with Jefferson and demands

00:56:58.730 --> 00:57:00.530
that Jefferson sell
him and Jefferson says,

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:02.090
okay I'll sell him
to whomever he wants.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:03.390
Let him find somebody.

00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:05.340
I'll take whatever
price, just you know.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:09.020
And then he just sort of
disappears of the rolls

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:13.850 position:56%
and I don't know whether it's that
he died or Jefferson just let him go

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:19.340 position:56%
because he did that with a young man
Jamie Hemings who was beaten once

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.730
and he ran away to Richmond
and Jefferson writes to the guy

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:27.340
who found him and says, have
James come back and James says,

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.940 position:56%
I'm not coming back unless you
agree to me, agree that I don't have

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.300
to be put under this guy
again, the guy who beat him.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.710
So Jefferson says, okay.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.010
Just come back.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.680 position:56%
And so James says, okay I will come
back but I want to go visit my uncle

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.290
who also lived in Richmond and
he goes and they never, you know,

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:48.260
the next time they see him he's on
a boat going up the James River.

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.560
And Jefferson basically
takes him of the roll.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.620
He comes back to Monticello
so I'm wondering if that,

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.800
something like that might
not have happened to Martin.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.310
If he died, you'd think that there
would be some reference to that?

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:03.510
I think he may have
just been let go.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:10.590
[ Inaudible Question ]

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:19.490
&gt;&gt; And with James's cousin
you talk about be tragic.

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:22.080
Do you know the tragic
story about her

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.490 position:56%
and how she never inherited property

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:24.790
from her aunt Kretta
[assumed spelling]?

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:26.630
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Aunt Kretta yeah.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.000
&gt;&gt; Is that, that's
an interesting story.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.790 position:56%
Did you talk about that in the book?

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:32.820
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Oh, what
I neglected to say or I said

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:36.980
in passing, is that this book
ends on 1831 and I'm going to pick

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.930
up with the second volume
because this got to be too long

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:42.420
and Norton said we cannot
have a thousand page book

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.740
and I didn't want a
thousand page book.

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:50.690
So I'm going to pick them up in
1831 and go forward from there.

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:53.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And you emailed me some years ago
when you started writing this book.

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:57.780 position:56%
My name is Calvin Jefferson, I'm
one of the decedents of Betty Graham

00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.830
and I had some information that
I really wanted to share with you

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.770
after this session on
the Colbert family.

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:05.340
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Okay,
I would be, well definitely be

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:06.640
in touch with me because I'm going,

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.300
as I said I've already started
right now but I really want

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.080
to follow this thing
through and then get to,

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.020
well I'm actually working
on the Jefferson biography

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:20.510
at the same time, but
definitely contact me.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:30.070
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:34.560 position:56%
The only thing, I mean he ends up
the story as the family tradition is

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.160
that he promised Sally Hemings
that her children would be free.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.790
If you think about it, it's
really interesting to think

00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:45.070
about the difference for
slavery for women and for men.

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:48.630
I mean even during that time women
had expect, women were expected

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:54.750
to care for family and so forth and
I would think it would be very hard

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:58.580
to think of for a woman to
think of leaving your mother

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.780
and your siblings and
your sisters behind.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.320
I mean, the story is that
he promised that, you know,

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.730
she would have a good life and
her children would be free.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.590
He later on agrees with James,

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:12.270
he gets James to teach his
brother Peter to be a chef

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:16.510
and then he frees James and so.

01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:19.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.550
Well James thought.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.760
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.440
I know. Well if for James the
complicating thing about James is

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.750
that Jefferson was supposed
to come back to France.

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.540
Jefferson came home
on a leave of absence

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.860
and so there was every expectation
that James was going to come back

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.050
to France again with Jefferson.

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:41.070
For Sally Hemings, it's much more
stark because Jefferson wanted

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:43.100
to get is daughters out of France.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.620
I mean he really thought, you know,

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.450
their growing up not
being an American,

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:51.350
so for Sally Hemings coming back
home was a much more drastic thing

01:00:51.350 --> 01:00:53.840
than for James who could
have expected to come back.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.690
Jefferson is asked to be Secretary
of State and so then they had

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:00.540
to come to some sort of reckoning
at that point, but for her,

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.510
I think it would be you
know they're family.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.340
I mean, she could have made,

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.360
people ask could she have made
a life for herself in France?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.200
People did.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.540 position:56%
I mean, the enslaved people who took
their freedom, they became majors

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:20.560
of hotel, actually French
people preferred African,

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.800
well slaves of African descent.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.670
She would have been, she and her
brother would have been much sought

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.570
after as employees, but you
know, to think of staying away

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:35.570
from your family may have been too
much for her or maybe she thought,

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:39.940
you know, the truth is I sort of
think of if not Thomas Jefferson

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.400
who would Sally Hemings
have ended up with?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.040
Looking at her sister's
life and her mother's life,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.460 position:56%
the odds were always great that she
would have ended up with a white guy

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:53.470
and as white men went he might
have been as good as any other.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:57.260
And so, I mean that no seriously.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.210
I mean if you think about
the choices women had

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:01.510
at that time period.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.730
I mean women at that moment
they depended upon men

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:07.600
for their livelihood and
if he made a good case

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.540
and if you're sixteen years old
and if it's a charming person

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.320
and he's rich and other people
like him, it might be easy

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.880
to convince a sixteen year
old to do something like that.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.470
I mean we sit here and
think, heck I'm not,

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.820
I mean you know I would
stay where I was.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.720
I think what, people ask me
well what should have happened?

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.000
I think the best thing that
could have happened if, you know,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.640
the best thing none of these
people would have known each other

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.480
because we wouldn't have had
slavery, but as a better matter,

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:37.340
I would have said if
Jefferson had said,

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.050
look this is a better
society for you.

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:45.650
You two stay here and work with
Mr. Short who was his secretary

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:48.140
who remained in France,
work with Mr. Short.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.040
If you want to come
to see your family,

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.790
I will let you come
to see your family.

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:56.190
In my sort of fantasy world,
that's what I wish had happened,

01:02:56.190 --> 01:03:01.500
but it didn't, so the thought
of, this was always a problem

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.530
for enslaved people;
do you run away?

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.680 position:56%
Do you stay and face whatever you're
going to face with your family?

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.390
And some people ran away and
some people thought about it

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:13.280
and just couldn't do it, so
there are lots of things.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.580
I mean I talk about this.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.850
I have a whole chapter where I
discuss this to try to figure

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:22.780 position:56%
out what is going on here with this
person, with these people who decide

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:26.740
that they will take their
chances instead of, you know,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:31.510
staying someplace where they could
have made a life for themselves.

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:34.090
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:37.890
&gt;&gt; Do they have an oral
history about what happened?

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.010
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Their oral
history is that Jefferson loved her

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:46.070
and told her that and that's
why she, she believed that

01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:49.100
and that's why she; that's
their oral family history.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.400
They do have reunions.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.760
I went to, I don't
get as much involved

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.060
with the contemporary people.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.040
I pretty much live in the
18th and the 19th century.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.460
They're interesting and fine people
but that's not really my focus,

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:05.040
but that's the oral history
of what this was about.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.710
This was, I mean, you know that
that's what he conveyed to her

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:12.520
and that's what she believed, so.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.510
Get this one behind right there.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:19.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.650
&gt;&gt; Virginia history.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:25.100
My sense of it is that just like
we have a contemporary example

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.770
of Essie Mae Washington and Strom
Thurmond that the family is sort

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:31.100
of really did know that
there was a relationship

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:37.350
and there was the paternity issue
there because to me the fact

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:40.720
that the story endured,
the oral history endured

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.330
and the Hemings themselves,
I've met some of the decedents.

01:04:45.330 --> 01:04:49.130
Visually you know that they
are a definitely mixed race,

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:53.400
had they been of a darker hue
at the time and Sally had been,

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.700
if the children had been

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.110
of a different hue one would
question whether Jefferson could

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:01.580
have been the, you know, the father
of the kids and they look very much

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.280
like him and from some
accounts that I've read.
