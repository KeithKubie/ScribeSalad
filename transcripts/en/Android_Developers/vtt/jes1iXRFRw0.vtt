[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:02.680
ROMAN: Hello there.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.970
Welcome once again to Android
Design in Action.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.960
ADAM: Hey guys.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.910
It's Adam [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.762
And over in London we have--

00:00:09.762 --> 00:00:11.460
NICK: Nick Butcher, hi.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.630
ROMAN: So today we have a
special episode dedicated

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.470
entirely to the action
bar design pattern.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.700
We unfortunately don't have
any redesigns to do today.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.070
We're not going to look
at any specific apps.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.190
But we will talk in depth
about the action bar.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.800
So with that I guess we
should jump right in.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.460
Because we have lot of content
to go through.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.880
Adam, do you want to
kick things off?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.730
ADAM: Yeah, sure.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.900
So one quick thing before
we get started, Nick may

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.590
potentially be coming through
on one audio channel only.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.870
So if you've got one earbud in,
maybe switch the other one

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.860
if you can't hear him.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.540
ROMAN: In case you can't.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.060
ADAM: In case you cant,
potentially.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.490
NICK: If you can't hear this.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.820
ADAM: So let's get started.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.270
We want to do a deep dive on the
action bar today, so the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.120
action bar.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.780
I've got a couple of quotes here
from the design guide.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.320
I'm just going quickly
read them out.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.100
The action bar is a dedicated
piece of real estate at the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.190
top of each screen that is
generally persistent

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.530
throughout the app.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.020
And second quote, which I
actually like better--

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.820
the action bar is one of the
most important design elements

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.660
you can implement and will go
a long way toward make your

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.790
app's interface consistent with
the core Android apps.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.010
So I think people ask,
why should I

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.290
implement the action bar?

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.040
I'd rather go off and do some
other design pattern.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.710
I think consistency is just
really, really important.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.550
So that when users pick up
your application, they

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.930
instantly know how to use it.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.010
Because they're so used
to the system apps.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.390
So it's just a really, really
important design pattern.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.062
If you've been listening to
show, and hopefully you've

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.170
been looking at the design
side, hopefully you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.540
already know this.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.200
ROMAN: Yeah, and the action
bar, through all of the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.240
designs that we've done
ourselves, we've always

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.140
included an action bar.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.680
There are some cases where an
action bar, it may not be,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.920
necessarily.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.640
For example, Google Now does
not actually have an action

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.190
bar at its top level screen.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.920
But if you notice, once you get
into the detail screens,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.460
once you get to the setting
screen or things that, there

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.140
is an action bar.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.330
So there's some kind of
edge cases where you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.920
may not need one.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.036
But almost certainly,
99% of the time you

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:03.460
should include one.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.370
NICK: I consider this one
of those cases of

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.540
deviate with purpose.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.240
Unless there's a really good
reason, you probably want to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.742
be using one.

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.470
ADAM: Definitely.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.220
Let's move along here.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.680
So the general organization--

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.250
again hopefully you're familiar
with this already.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.890
But we just thought we'd cover
it again, the basics.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.000
So on the left portion of the
action bar, you have your

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.520
navigational elements.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.920
And then on the right
side, the action.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.650
So it's pretty clearly split
between the two sides.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.270
I think that it's a very
important to follow, this

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.970
general layout.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.740
If you do decide to deviate in
some way, shape, or form, you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.220
should just always keep
this in mind.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.310
And try and stick to this
if you possibly can.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.750
ROMAN: And actually, one minor
comment, I think in earlier

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.350
versions of Honeycomb the search
button in some apps was

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.920
actually on the left.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280
And then we moved that over
to the right as an action.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.740
Because it was really just
a more common place.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.200
And we really wanted to
standardize as search being an

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.550
action, rather than a
navigational element.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.410
It can be portrayed--

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.560
if you think about it logically,
you can probably

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.760
argue either way for search.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.520
But certainly the platform
convention is to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.770
keep it as an action.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.320
ADAM: So we've got a bit more
detail here on the general

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.750
organization of the
action bar.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.610
A very, very important
piece, the app icon.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.880
So here you've got your
branding, your identity.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.925
And also it gives you a sense
of place, with this "up"

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:23.630
affordance that shows
when you're not at

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.290
the top level screens.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.510
So personally I think people
should always take advantage

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210
of the branding piece of this.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.690
Not only because it tells the
user which application they're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.340
in when they're using it.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.230
But also, if they love the app,
they're going to start to

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.540
identify that branding with
your application.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.330
Next time they're flicking
through their home screen, or

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.490
in their all apps list, they'll
see that icon there.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.530
And they'll be, hey, I haven't
used that app in a while.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.680
And I really, really
like that app.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.990
And they'll come back to it.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.870
So I think this it's
really important.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.030
Sometimes I see people do custom
implementations or a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.870
custom kind of action
bar, but they don't

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.970
include that branding.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.240
Personally, I feel very strongly
that it's important.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.880
NICK: One variation on that I'd
like to mention here is

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.460
that, quite commonly your
application might have a

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.330
single accent color,
which you strongly

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.930
associate with that brand.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.840
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.580
might be pink, for example,
and so forth.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.540
So there's also the opportunity
to take that

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.029
accent color as your action
bar color all together.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.019
And in that case, I think it
works really, really nicely to

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.515
have a differentiated logo
from your app icon.

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:28.510
So it's entirely plausible
absolutely encouraged to have

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.030
a different launcher icon that
you might have in the launch

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.200
tray than the icon which appears
in the top left of the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.880
action bar.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.610
So you might go for
an inverted color.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.510
Or maybe a single white
simplified version of your

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.670
icon, and then use the branding
color as the actual

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.160
background of the action bar,
rather than having it compete

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.100
with the same color.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.740
ROMAN: As long as the core icon
itself is the same, as

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770
long as the shapes and the forms
are really kind of the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.700
same thing as the launcher
icon, you can

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.550
definitely do that.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.810
ADAM: And of course, the YouTube
app does this, with

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.910
its launcher icon being
different to the action bar

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.280
app icon up there.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.850
ROMAN: And actually, I think
they use a logo, as well.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.120
So you don't necessarily have
to use an icon there if you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.550
have enough horizontal space
available where you don't need

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.500
other items, like
view controls.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.840
You can absolutely show
a wider version.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.270
For developers, that's called
the Android colon logo for the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.690
action bar.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.970
But both the icon and the
logo, those should be

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.545
sufficient to convey
the branding.

00:05:24.545 --> 00:05:25.640
NICK: And it works
really well.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.180
Say you have one natural
homepage, like a newsfeed, or

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.990
[INAUDIBLE], which is the
natural home of the content,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.880
you might want to provide
greater branding.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.770
Like say a larger logo, which
takes up more width.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.970
And then on subsequent pages,
you might want to cut that

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.350
back down to a square aspect
ratio icon, which will give

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.030
you more room to display
some title

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.730
information or view control.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.423
ADAM: Exactly, and that segues
perfectly into the second part

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.475
of the action bar, which
is the control.

00:05:49.475 --> 00:05:52.100
It can be used for navigation,
something like a spinner.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.490
But also as Nick mentioned, it
can be used for a title of the

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.740
particular screen, as well.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.440
ROMAN: The view control
also encompasses tabs.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.910
So in some cases, especially
in phones--

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.150
and we'll talk about this
in a bit-- but tabs

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.020
can go in that area.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.470
But in some cases they actually
drop into a second

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.350
lower area, below that action
bars, as a stacked version.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.080
But tabs, spinner, and title,
we consider those view

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.630
controls, things that let you
see information about the

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.540
current context, the current
screen, as well as potentially

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.180
tweak things.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.450
Like change perspective, or the
label, or something that

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.700
you're looking at.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.370
ADAM: And then, as you
mentioned, on right side

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.150
you've got your actions.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.670
So you've got your action
buttons there.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.220
In this case, there's a search
and a record video action,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.430
followed by what we call the
action overflow menu.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.520
So this is where less frequently
used actions can be

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.670
collapsed into an overflow menu
that's not always visible

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.560
on the screen.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.840
ROMAN: And very importantly for
the overflow, there are

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.880
also some platform conventions
on what things

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.350
should always go there.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.140
So if you have application
settings, as well as Help and

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.830
About, Terms of Service, things
like that should go in

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.200
the overflow.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.660
You shouldn't make those
immediately on screen, unless

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.770
something like Settings is the
number one use case for your

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.890
app, life if everybody is just
tweaking the settings.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.040
But I'd say again, 99% of the
cases overflow should contain

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.290
settings as well.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.020
ADAM: Moving along.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.675
NICK: Is it worth mentioning
about the overflow, then--

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.070
sorry, just before
you do move on.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.980
ADAM: No, go for it.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.490
NICK: If we're talking about the
case of devices which have

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.220
a physical menu button, then
the overflow button won't

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.900
necessary display.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.140
Because you're going to rely on
that physical affordance,

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.841
rather than the onscreen
affordance.

00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:38.710
ADAM: Yep, good point.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.950
And I think we have a screen
shot later on to

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.810
show how that works.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.034
NICK: Oh, jumping the gun.

00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:43.850
Sorry.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.650
ADAM: No worries.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.250
So the other nice thing about
the action bar is it's very

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.750
good at adapting to different
screen sizes, rotations,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.370
actually the width
of the screen.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.040
It's very, very good at
adapting to that.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.530
So it does a few things to help
with the variation in

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.120
screen sizes.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.870
And actually, I think it's
the next slide--

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.442
one particular thing that you
can do is engage this mode

00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:06.130
called medical split
action bar mode.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.060
And actually, from a developer
standpoint, it's a flag called

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.290
split action bar when narrow.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.750
So it says, when the screen with
gets down to a certain

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.740
point, we're going to
go into this split

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.470
action bar mode instead.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.380
So in split action bar mode,
you've got three potential

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.030
different bars that
you can have here.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.210
You've got the main action
bar at the top.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.360
You've got the top bar, which
Roman was talking about

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.670
before, is where the tabs could

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.560
potentially fall down to.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.240
And then at the bottom of the
screen you've got the bottom

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.400
bar, very creatively named here,
the bottom bar, top bar.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.820
And you'll see that in the
bottom bar you've got the

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.620
action items, which have now
moved down there, along with

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.600
trailing off into the overflow
menu, rather than being at the

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.230
top right there, in the
main action bar.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.960
ROMAN: A couple more points
on the screen.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.890
You'll notice that the concept
of navigation versus action,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.940
the separation of the two,
is still in play.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.515
Except that spatially it's
no longer horizontal.

00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:58.860
It's purely vertical.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.770
At the top you have all of your
navigational affordances

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.420
and elements.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.690
And at the very bottom you
have your actions.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.280
So that pattern is still
kept in check.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.600
The other thing I want to
mention was actually on the

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.170
previous screen.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.560
Not only is the scalability, the
stretchiness of the action

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.810
bar important on different
devices, but you'll also

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.430
notice that on tablets the
action bar is actually

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.540
slightly taller.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.450
The app icon is displayed
slightly larger.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.410
And the action bar buttons
are slightly wider.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.020
So an action bar button
on the a may be

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.300
something like 56 dps.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.710
Wide.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.430
On a tablet, I think
it's about 64 dps.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.650
And the action bar height, I
think it's something like 48.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.990
And then on tablets it's 56,
or something like that.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.260
But again, this stuff
may change.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.800
So just using the standard
action bar gives you

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.710
all this for free.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.020
ADAM: And if potentially some
huge tablet comes out in the

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.270
future, or something like that,
the action bar may have

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.160
a different size again, a
different way of formatting.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.050
But as long as you stick to
using action bar, your

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.100
application should still look
and display fine here.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.100
ROMAN: One more [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.820
ADAM: Contextual action bar,
Nick, do you want to discuss

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.080
that a little bit?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.780
NICK: Yeah, definitely.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.630
So the contextual action bar is
one of my favorite tricks.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.150
It has the ability transformer
its appearance to give you

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.910
contextual actions to whatever
is on screen.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.880
So in this screen shot here we
can see examples of selecting

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.350
text or selecting an
email message.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.360
Where the same physical space
animates and rotates around,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.000
and offers alternate actions.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.570
And the contextual action bar
really is a first class

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.070
citizen, like the standard
action bar.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.210
And you can still do things
like the split action bar.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.180
So if you have a plethora of
options that you want to have

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.260
immediately available on screen,
without having to dip

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.340
down into the overflow, you can
go into that split mode,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.370
like the mail app is there.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.970
And show those things
immediately.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.090
And if you want to know more
about contextual action bar,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.710
we actually did a deep dive on
this a couple of months back.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.630
So you can go back through the
archives into the video

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.500
messaging contextual
action bar.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.820
ADAM: And it's worth noting that
generally it's engaged by

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.610
long pressing on a particular
element of the screen.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.590
So in this example, I think
we have browser,

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.220
and Gmail or email.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.160
In some cases, though, there can
be a UI element that you

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.370
can touch upon to engage it.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.790
So in this case, in Gmail,
it's a check box.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.110
You can touch that check box.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.830
And the contextual action bar
triggers at that point.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.490
ROMAN: The other important thing
to note about contextual

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.380
actual bars is that
conceptually, and logically,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.590
they're a mode.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.220
So when you select, something
you're basically

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.140
entering into a UI mode.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.270
And that mode is, something
is selected.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.110
So what happens is, the context
of the screen, the

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.040
layout of the screen, doesn't
really change.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.630
For example in Gmail's
case, the list

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.750
items are still there.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.100
But the action bar, basically
the Chrome around the content

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.160
changes to reflect what
mode you're in.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.530
And then once you cancel out
of that mode by either

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.850
pressing the back button or
pressing the check market in

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.090
the top left, that
cancels the mode.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.060
That exits the mode.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.180
And then you're back to what
the screen normally was.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.979
So just think of it as
a UI mode, almost.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.240
ADAM: So moving on to the second
portion of the action

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.660
bar that we're talking about,
the view controls.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.140
So one possible option
to show there in the

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.800
control section are tabs.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.720
And there are two main
categories of tabs.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.750
There's fixed times and
scrollable tabs.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.540
And there's a couple examples
there on the slides

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.160
that you can see.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.500
I personally really like fixed
tabs, where they're

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.510
appropriate.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.490
Just because it's really, really
quick and easy to flip

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.860
between the different views.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.510
Obviously they're only
appropriate when you've got

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.230
maybe two, three, maybe four
different views that you want

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.820
to flip between.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.090
And obviously you should
always enable swipe to

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.940
navigate between those
different tabs.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.570
Then you've also got scrollable
tabs, where you

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.225
could potentially have any
number of different views that

00:12:49.225 --> 00:12:50.380
you're switching between.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.520
It could be a no number, a bit
larger number than, say the

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.725
three or four that fixed
tabs support.

00:12:55.725 --> 00:12:57.730
Or it could be an unknown number
that you don't know how

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.930
many are going to
trail off there.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.480
So here's an example
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.350
ROMAN: One thing to note is
that, if you're a developer

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.330
and you're trying to implement
this, it's actually called a

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.540
page or title strip.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.010
Its a misnomer.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.970
We call them scrollable tabs
on the design side, because

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.380
logically, and from a mental
model perspective, they serve

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.450
the same purpose as tabs.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.990
It's just from an interaction
standpoint

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.640
they're slightly different.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.550
So one of the key difference
is that you don't

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.450
see them all at once.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.540
And they are slightly thinner.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.000
So they're not really
a touch target.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.950
They really more an indicator.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.870
But usually they are
coupled with touch.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:38.220
So in case the user does touch
that area that indicates the

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.970
next page or the previous page,
you should still swipe

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.370
over or switch over.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.230
ADAM: In terms of how it fits
in the action bar, in that

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.970
split action bar mode these
fixed tabs will actually take

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.245
up the whole width below the
main action bar, and so will

00:13:51.245 --> 00:13:52.430
the scrollable tabs.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.960
But when there's more room,
for example in a landscape

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.010
mode or in a tablet, those fixed
tabs can actually fall

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.550
in line with the main
action bar.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.100
Whereas those scrollable tabs
really need to take up entire

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.050
width of the screen.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.790
NICK: And another option, when
we're talking about the

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.510
different bars you have, you can
have your main action bar,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.250
your top bar, and then
the bottom bar.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.470
In some cases, having a top
action bar as well as the

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.300
stacked tab bar, there's
[INAUDIBLE] that thinks it's

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.870
entirely valid to hide the top
action bar if it's not really

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.880
adding anything to your design,
and you want to free

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.490
up some more content
are of your apps.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.920
If you take a look at, for
example, of the dialer

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.860
application or contacts
applications that ship with

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.580
ICS+ devices, you can see that
they've hidden the top action

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.510
bar and just had the prefixed
tabs right at the top to free

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.680
up some room.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.500
ROMAN: Another example of that,
from the third party

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.280
space, is Pinterest.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.970
And I wouldn't say that
they exactly use tabs.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.700
They look and feel like tabs.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.850
You can swipe between them.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.580
And there are three of them.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.910
So they kind of represent
tabs.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.560
They're very similar to the
people app tabs, or such.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.690
But that's another example.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.600
So it's an example of where
the widths aren't equal.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.390
The Home tab in the Pinterest
app is default selected.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.030
So it's a slight variation.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.540
But again, it's a deviation
with a purpose.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.860
They wanted to simplify
things.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.570
I think it's a fairly
good execution.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.390
ADAM: So moving on, view
controls, you can also have

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.965
spinners and drawers.

00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:21.420
I don't think we're going to
spend too long in here,

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.440
because we know there's a lot
of discussion about drawers

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.420
still, and the pattern is still
not finalized on the

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.520
design side.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.710
But just to quickly mention it,
both of them are ways to

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.260
switch between views.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.730
A spinner is a drop down, pop
up dialogue that drops down

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.220
from the top of the action
bar, which allows you to

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.860
switch between views.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.950
The navigation drawer slides
out from the side.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:48.220
And the YouTube app is the
main example of how to

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.625
implement a navigation at
this point in time.

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:50.990
I don't know.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.560
Do you guys want to mention
anything more about this?

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.580
We could probably talk about
drawers versus spinners for

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.080
much longer than half an hour.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.150
ROMAN: At a high level,
I'd say looking at

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.540
the different options--

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.680
tabs, spinner, navigation
drawer--

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.520
when you look at these elements,
they're functionally

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.400
somewhat equivalent.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.520
There are some minor differences
in terms of when

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.230
you should use the spinner
versus navigation drawer, as

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.440
well as when it's appropriate
to use tabs versus spinner.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.600
But functionally, they're
lateral navigation elements.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.150
So they let you navigate across
sibling elements, or

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.990
sibling screens.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.230
And then it's kind of
interesting to look at the

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.450
action bar's navigational
components as both ancestral

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.370
navigation and lateral
navigation.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.800
So the Up button, which we made
brief mention of, lets

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.360
you accomplish ancestral
navigational, lets you walk up

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.630
the structure of an app.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.430
Versus tabs or spinners and
navigation drawers, they let

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.670
you navigate laterally across
the structure of your app.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.940
So when you're planning out how
do you design an app that

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.640
uses all these different
navigational elements, think

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.950
about your app in terms
of the screen map.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.720
Or think about it in terms of
the structure, a tree almost,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.970
a hierarchical structure.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.120
And see where you can introduce
elements to better

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.740
convey that structure
to your users.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.310
ADAM: One thing I will quickly
say is I very much dislike it

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.569
when a drawer has three
items in it.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.589
Because it could much, much,
much better be represented by

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.210
something like regular tabs.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.849
And it gives the user
the on screen

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.839
visuals immediately there.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.800
You can swipe int them.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.430
It's just so much easier.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.430
That's one pet peeve of mine.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.890
ROMAN: One of the other things,
since we're on the

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.710
topic of tabs--

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.390
ADAM: I knew we were going
to get stuck on this.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.940
ROMAN: Tabs are important.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.980
One of the things that's
different between Android and

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.630
other platforms is tabs
aren't persistent.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.610
So this is one thing that I
have seen some folks get

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.730
caught up with.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.400
They keep tabs visible
throughout the entire app.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.090
So the action bar is really
the one thing that should

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.790
really be present throughout
the entire app.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.380
Because it gives you access to
the Up button, as well as

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.560
things like settings,
and whatnot.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.830
But tabs are really a per
screen type thing.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.810
So if your top level screen has
tabs, once you get into a

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.050
detail screen from within one of
those tabs-- let's say you

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.360
touch a list item in tab one--

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.740
you should hide those tabs.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.200
And then to get back to those
tabs, the user should press Up

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.430
to get to the top level screen
that has those tabs.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.080
So that's one thing to make
sure that you don't do, is

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.280
have hierarchy and history
within a tab.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.230
A tab is really just a segment
of the screen, almost.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.820
ADAM: Yeah.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.020
The action bar is the anchor
of the application.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.310
It should be visible
all the time.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.000
And the other elements should
come and go as needed.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.150
Let's get on, get away from
this before we get stuck.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.000
Action buttons, Nick,
do you want to?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.960
NICK: Yeah, so action buttons
are the right hand section of

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.190
the action bar, which allow you
to perform actions which

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.180
are contextual to the
content on screen.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.580
And we use this FIT rule, which
you can see on screen

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.870
here, to determine which actions
should appear front

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.420
and center right on the action
bar, and which ones are less

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.515
important, and should
be tucked away under

00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.940
the overflow menu.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.720
So the FIT scheme, it refers
to something which is

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.640
Frequently Important
or Typical.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.170
So just some examples,
frequently in an imaging

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.250
application, like the gallery,
for example, you frequently

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.710
want to share that.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.490
So we have the Share action
button right, front and center

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.070
in the action bar.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.650
So it's very easy
to achieve that.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.650
Something which is important,
say in an email application we

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.370
have the Send button
in the action bar.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.070
Its right there at the top
of the screen as the most

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.120
important thing.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.840
And one more thing, if there
is one single, the most

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.620
important action on the screen,
try and keep it to the

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.950
leftmost action.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.655
Because that's more likely to
be shown on action bar, and

00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:40.770
not tucked away under the
overflow if there isn't

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.005
sufficient room.

00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:45.140
And last of the rules
is Typical.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.500
So something like Search, as we
touched on slightly earlier

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.100
on, you're going to always look
to the top right to look

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.060
for the search action.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.550
Because it's typically
found there.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.840
So you would want to
follow that rule.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.290
And one thing I'd just like
to clarify is [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.800
we've called it out on the
bottom, saying that items in

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.360
the action bar need to be
unambiguous as to what they're

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.290
going to apply to.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.380
So, if there's something like
an Edit action in the action

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.520
bar, but there's actually a
couple distinct groups of

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.420
content on the screen so it's
unclear, you want to put that

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.775
action in line in the
content area, so

00:20:14.775 --> 00:20:16.640
that there's no ambiguity.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.610
You want to either do that in
line, or you could perhaps use

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.850
the contextual action bar in
that instance, to enable some

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.420
modes then to perform the action
on an individual piece

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.600
of content.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.230
And the other thing we want to
call out here is to really try

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:34.170
and reuse people's mental
models, these common, very

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.230
well established actions.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.280
Something like Search or Edit
or Share has these very well

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.940
known glyphs associated
with these actions.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.150
So you want to be using the
platform default ones.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.360
So take a look at the--

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.970
there's a download on the design
side, the action bar

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.050
download pack, as well as
they'll bring in assets

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.240
studio, which will help you to
find or slightly hint these

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.390
icons to your [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.160
ROMAN: The other very minor
thing on that is that don't

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.500
feel that you're restricted
to use the styling--

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.480
holo dark or holo light
styling-- for

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.420
the action bar buttons.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.420
If you have a very, very branded
action bar, or very

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.890
branded app in general that
has its own color scheme,

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.530
maybe even some minor visual
effects here and there, as

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.430
long as you use the
core iconography--

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.270
and the core iconography you can
get with the Illustrator

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.690
files that come with
that download--

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.060
just apply your styling on top
of those Illustrator files.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.560
So that you still use the same
iconography, not necessarily

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.280
the same styling.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.600
ADAM: And one last thing I just
wanted to mention was

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.820
don't feel like you have to put
actions necessarily in the

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.270
action bar.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.510
You can put them in
line as well.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.460
That's definitely an
alternate option.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.940
If it's relevant to the content,
or it fits better

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.710
with the flow of the screen,
you could possibly put

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.230
something in line.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.390
It's definitely another
option.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.740
But if that's not what you want,
if you want to stick to

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.960
the standard pattern, put
them in the action bar.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.470
All right.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.800
NICK: So you touched on this
earlier on as well.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.620
You're not actually
saying this item

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.190
must, must, must show.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.600
I think the whole point of the
action bar is it really helps

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.100
you to build on this responsive
design technique

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.190
that we're always
talking about.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.850
Android is designed to scale.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.130
And you don't necessarily know
at design time how wide they

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.940
device is going to be which
your app is running on.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.110
Is it in landscape?

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.145
Is it in portrait?

00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:25.470
Is it a tablet sized device?

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.660
So the action bar is really
build with in its

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.240
underpinnings.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.590
And so the way you define your
actions, you actually can say

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.210
this should always show up in
action bar, and never go under

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.880
the overflow menu.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.800
Or conversely, never.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.890
So something like settings, you
would say, never show this

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.300
as a front and center action.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.755
Pop this on the overflow.

00:22:44.755 --> 00:22:46.770
And the last one, the most
interesting one you probably

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.530
want to use for most
of your actions is

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.560
just to say, if room.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.060
So what that'll say is,
if there's room,

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.840
please display this.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.520
And otherwise tuck it under.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.480
And the system will go through
in the order in which you

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.100
defined your actions, and try
and show as many as it can.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.230
And any it doesn't have
room for will get

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.530
tucked under the overflow.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.720
So you really want to be
thinking about your actions.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.330
And say, something like an email
application, Send should

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.620
always be on the screen.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.180
But these other things
are less important.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.970
And they can go underneath
the overflow if need be.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.870
And so, don't get hung up on
thinking, these two things are

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.850
always going to be
on the screen.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.560
These things are always going
to be off screen.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.280
Try and work with the if room,
and try and have this kind of

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.050
stretchable design if you can.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.730
ADAM: I really like this.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.170
Because it forces you to think
about the FIT pattern that we

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.480
were talking about before, and
just really prioritize which

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.380
actions you think are
most important.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.270
If a user has the Nexus S, and
they can only fit two items up

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.800
there, you're always going to
have the two items you think

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.550
are the most importantly
visible to the user.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.390
So I think I think it's
a good way of

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.570
decluttering your UI, almost.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.465
It forces you to tackle that
problem, rather than just say

00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:54.480
I'll throw everything on the
screen, and hope the user can

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.730
work out what's happening.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.350
All right, we better get
moving here, guys.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.930
ROMAN: So I'll just quickly
jump through

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:03.940
key styles for branding.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.890
So you've seen this through
our various designs

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.320
throughout the show.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.350
But the key things you should
think about when styling the

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.690
action bar, outside of just
picking color schemes, you can

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:18.150
obviously apply patterns, or
subtle gradients, and just

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.920
solid colors to these.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.050
You should really be thinking
about the action bar's core

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.490
background.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.760
That's the number one way
you can brand things.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.740
If you're Yahoo!, it should
probably be purple, or

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.800
something like that.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.880
For the stacked bar background,
you probably want

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.500
to use a very similar shade,
or a similar hue, but a

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.710
slightly darker or slightly
lighter version.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.020
The reason you don't want to
do something too crazy is

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.960
that, again, in landscape, your
tabs can actually stack

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.110
up into the top bar.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.700
And so the tabs may not have
enough contrast if there's a

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.700
completely different color
palette between the action bar

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.430
background and its
stack background.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.860
You could probably make
it work through some

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.520
tricks here and there.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.180
But it's generally easiest
if you just make a slight

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.630
variation to the background
for the stacked top bar.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.220
Also the selected tab strip,
that's where you can really

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.840
show your brand's accent color,
if you have a secondary

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.560
color in your palette, as well
as the press state background.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.070
So that's definitely something
to keep in mind.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:23.600
If your action bar background
is blue, the default press

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.530
state background for
the action bar is

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:27.690
also going to be blue.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.850
If you touch an icon, or if you
touch the Up button, it's

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.070
going to be blue background.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.750
So the contrast may
not be very good.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:38.290
So make sure to tweak that,
and to account for that.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.300
NICK: For developers, there's
an article on the Android

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.480
developers blog on how to
achieve these styling

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.050
techniques.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.570
ROMAN: What was it?
j.mp/customizingactionbar?

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.470
I think you just search for Nick
Butcher customizing the

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.307
action bar, you'll get that.

00:25:49.307 --> 00:25:50.557
NICK: I forget.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.180
ROMAN: Then there's the really
awesome action bar style

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.160
generator tool for developers,
that you can basically just

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.010
create all the assets you need
right from this tool.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:02.750
Really awesome tool.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.830
We use it in a lot
of our samples.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.870
ADAM: There's an additional
style, called action bar

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.310
overlay style that you can use
if, say the content is just so

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.070
important in this particular
screen, you can really make

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.220
the action bar and system
Chrome fade out

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.430
a little bit here.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.820
So there's two examples here.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.410
One is Google Maps, on
the right there.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.640
And you can see the map is,
obviously, just the most

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.140
important thing within an
application like Google Maps.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.240
And so you can see it's
transparent, allowing the map

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.150
to bleed through a
little bit there.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.780
It looks really, really nice.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.840
And then the system gallery is
another great example, which

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.520
we're using right now.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.760
And one thing you should do is
if, something like gallery,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.970
where you the user may want to
see the picture without any

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.600
other Chrome visible, touching
the screen should really make

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.540
the actual bar come on screen,
then disappear again--

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.260
ROMAN: Along with
the status bar.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.210
ADAM: And potentially the status
bar as well, and the

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.470
system controls on the bottom.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.770
That's not really possible with

00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.950
something like photo viewing.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.780
But with video viewing, you can
actually make the entire

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.450
thing go full screen.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.200
ROMAN: And for developers out
there, there's a template that

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.830
you can use with Eclipse.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.980
If you do File, New, and then
Android Object, you can choose

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.930
full screen activity.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.455
And it gives you all
this for free.

00:27:14.455 --> 00:27:14.910
ADAM: Cool.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.790
OK, we've got to move along.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.000
ROMAN: Yes, let's cut through.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.200
ADAM: Custom action views,
Nick, do you want to--?

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.520
Very quick.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.695
NICK: Yeah, sure.

00:27:21.695 --> 00:27:22.446
ADAM: You've got five words.

00:27:22.446 --> 00:27:24.920
NICK: [INAUDIBLE] don't just
have to be just buttons.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.500
They can be a little bit
more interactive and

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.620
response than that.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.180
So here's a few examples
of the stock ones.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.950
So you have a common pattern is
to transform a refresh icon

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.620
into an indeterminate
progress spinner.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.680
So you can use the same space
to indicate progress or

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.680
inaction, which is great.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.410
Another common one is the
such an action provider.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.490
So this is a way to, when you
click on a search action, have

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.690
it expand out, take over the
action bar's physical space,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.630
similar to how the contextual
action bar will, in order to

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.450
provide the search affordance,
which is a great [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.280
And the last one we've
got out here is the

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280
Share action provider.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.750
This is an excellent way of
providing a ordered list of

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.080
the way [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.530
share.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.770
So if I always go to a certain
couple of apps, they'll

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.840
actually float to the
top of the list.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.240
And in fact, the most commonly
used app to share that certain

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.800
media type will be [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.770
in action bar.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.680
So it's easy.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.780
So you have this richer behavior
from the action

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.310
buttons, not just
simple buttons.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.220
ADAM: Cool, excellent.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.440
And I think Nick was talking
about this briefly before.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.320
But some devices still have
a hard menu button.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.050
And so in that case, the
overflow menu actually doesn't

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.670
show in action bar.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.170
And instead, when you hit the
device hard menu, or legacy

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.550
menu button, the additional
overflow items will pop up

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.170
from the bottom.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.190
So you can see that here on the
Nexus S, versus the Nexus

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.420
4, where the overflow
menu still pops

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.260
up those same options.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.460
Not going to--

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.980
just keep--

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.650
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:55.950
ROMAN: Lastly--

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.696
NICK: You don't have to do
anything to get this behavior.

00:28:57.696 --> 00:29:01.300
That comes for free from the
system to use the native

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.160
action bar.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.780
ROMAN: And lastly,
Done and Discard.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.440
This is something that's
not yet documented.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.500
I think we'll probably be
documenting it in the future.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.650
But as an alternative, if you
have a really, really simple

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:16.130
screen, like for example like
just a single edit screen, or

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.980
something, and you really only
have two things you can do--

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.090
either Save or Cancel--

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.310
and you don't want to
use a dialogue.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.690
Because generally, you want
to avoid dialogues.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.550
You want to avoid the extra
burden on the user to think

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:32.180
about what else is around
the screen.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.840
You can use the done slash
discard pattern, where instead

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.580
of an action bar, instead of
the Up button, instead of a

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.080
title and overflow,
you just show two

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.350
actions, Done and Discard.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.670
And there's, again positive
button on the right, negative

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.510
but on the left.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.270
Alternatively, if discarding is
not really that common, or

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:50.530
if you have other actions you
need to show, you can just

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.230
show Done in the top left,
which takes the

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.540
place of the Up button.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.760
And that's like the same thing
as saying, if I press this I

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.440
have the added confidence that
when I go up, or when I leave

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.890
this context, I'm actually
persisting

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.460
my content, my changes.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.540
So that's just an alternative
that you can use for very

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.190
simple screens.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.090
ADAM: Cool.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.600
And then design news, we're
going to have to--

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.510
ROMAN AND ADAM: Fly
through it.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.450
ROMAN: This is from the
developer of I think it was a

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.390
carbon for Android.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:23.470
He had a bunch of thoughts on
holo, and what it means.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.130
What is the language?

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.920
As a designer, are
you using it?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.730
Or you are you elaborating
on it?

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.950
So just a couple of thoughts
here as a Google+ post.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.920
Definitely worth reading if
you're designing for Android.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.835
NICK: And lastly here is a
regular contributor, Marie

00:30:40.835 --> 00:30:41.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.010
has given a great walkthrough
of her mental processes she

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.150
goes through, the workflow she
goes through when she's

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.400
designing an application.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.960
So you don't drive straight
into your pixel

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.070
editing tool of choice.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.930
But she walk through the
concepting behind it, and

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:58.870
thinking about the information
hierarchy.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.750
And this post is really,
really great.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.612
And it's a good insight into
how other people work.

00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:04.060
ROMAN: Cool.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.020
ADAM: And we're done.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.580
ROMAN: Yeah, with that, thanks
again for joining us here on

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.180
Android Design in Action, where
we talked about the

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.060
action bar, everything
you needed to know.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.370
As always, I'm Roman Nurik.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.710
ADAM: Adam [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.520
NICK: Nick Butcher.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.860
ADAM: See you guys.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.775
ROMAN: See you next
week, or whatever.

00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:21.025
See you guys, bye.
