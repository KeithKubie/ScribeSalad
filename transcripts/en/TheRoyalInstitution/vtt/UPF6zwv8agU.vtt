00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.810
In the last article for the release of my
liberty,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.220
writes Doctor Gulliver, who was under some
trouble at the time as you may recall,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.170
the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity
of meat and drink

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.490
sufficient for the support of 1728 Lilliputians.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.600
Some time after, asking a friend at court
how they came to fix on that determinate number,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
he told me that his majestyâ€™s mathematicians,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
having taken the height of my body by the
help of a quadrant,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
and finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion
of twelve to one,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.149
they concluded from the similarity of their
bodies,

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.469
that mine must contain 1728 of theirs, and
consequently

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.440
would require as much food as was necessary
to support that number of Lilliputians.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.049
By which the reader may conceive an idea of
the ingenuity of that people,

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:56.940
as well as the prudent and exact economy of
so great a prince.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.920
The prince of Lilliput was the not the first
nor was he the last ruler

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800
to have bad advice from his scientific council.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.680
The mathematicians of Lilliput were not right.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.660
Indeed they were right in their geometry,
yes, we discussed the geometry last time,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.060
and I think all will agree that they understood
Euclid

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.619
and they understood proportionality

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.710
and they understood scaling, in respect to
geometry perfectly.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.490
It is quite true that the man mountain Gulliver,
being 12 times as high,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.399
and proportioned similarly in all parts to
a Lilliputian,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.180
would be 12 x 12 x 12 as great in volume.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.159
Or 1728 and the same amount greater in weight,

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.450
since he was made of the same material, bone
and flesh.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.330
Similar proportions in all respects.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.520
That is the assumption of the text.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.760
But where they failed of course to be quite
right was when they said -

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.140
consequently he will require 1728 times as
much food.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.820
The "consequently" is very much open to question.
Why is it consequent?

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.460
Euclid said nothing whatever about eating
and drinking of spheres or polygons.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.660
That's a physical problem. The biological
problem,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.120
a problem with energy, chemistry, the shuffling
of atoms.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.090
And we have to study that in a much more detailed
way.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.190
Now, that has been done. We shall do some
of it here today and see it ourselves.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.890
And I think we can come quickly to the conclusion
that the Lilliputians

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.990
were in error on that small point. But that's
not the interesting thing.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.590
The interesting thing is how remarkable would
be the result,

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.950
that is the real result in the real world,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.810
which I think goes far to illuminate how we
understand ourselves,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.900
the animal world, our structures and so on.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.540
Let us first look at a simple example if we
have the map, Bill, please. Thank you.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.500
Just to use a very early example of which
is a quite familiar geometry.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.120
I'll mention it quite quickly.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.060
Here we have these two countries, I've drawn
it with the shrunken Atlantic.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.670
Possibly we're drifting that way again, I
don't know.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.700
And with the shrunken Atlantic, so you can
see the two simply

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.020
in their proper proportions, and their proper
scale.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.640
Now notice if I ask how much coastline or
edge, perimeter,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.640
Britain has for each unit of area. There's
really a good deal.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.980
Nobody can be very far away and every square
of area can possess

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.340
an edge on the sea in quite small squares.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.840
But if I make squares of the same size in
this big country,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.590
I leave a great section of the country far
from the sea.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.820
The squares in there, of a size to fit neatly
in Britain,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240
would be nowhere near the sea, they have no
coast at all.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.060
This region contains for example the state
of Nebraska,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.300
like Switzerland without any sea coast.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.940
I will refer to it from time to time.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.980
Western movies are often made in Western Nebraska

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.180
and Eastern Colorado, far from the sea.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.880
And here we have the United States and Britain
drawn on a scale more nearly equal

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.870
and now you see the same effect begins to
appear.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110
Even though the shape is quite different,
still it would be true

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.200
if I make squares which have edges that are
coast, many squares,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.180
little pieces of coast, many squares would
be far from the sea here as here.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.680
Indeed the larger the area, the less surface,
the less edge it has per unit area.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.280
Let us do that a little more formally on the
board.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.840
And with our blocks. And we'll see how it
can work.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.240
Let us first work, I shall first work and
discuss the problem solely in the flat plane.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.220
Just to make it easy enough.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.260
Now, clearly the world is not flat, the world
is not flat in any part.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.790
It is our symbols which are flat.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.350
Even paper, as we've seen,
has plenty of thickness and plenty of scale.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.320
But it's worthwhile to work first in our mind
in two dimensions,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.810
just because that's easier than three, so
I'll speak of a flat world

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.150
as I speak of a flat map. In reality we shall
very soon have to go over to the solid bulk.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.810
In looking at the flat, then you can see that
around a block, there are four edges,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.320
around a square, the face of a block. There
are four edges.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.260
Every square owns the same four edges.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.000
And only if I amass many together, do I begin
to see that there are

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.170
some blocks, like Nebraska or like Switzerland,
which are isolated.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.100
Let us write down what that leads us to.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.880
If I have a square. I'm not sure how you write
what you call the distance round,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.350
the region around, I will call it the coastline
if you like.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.740
If you more... a fancy word is perimeter.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.940
Now the perimeter is proportional to the size
of the edge.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.660
If that is L, the perimeter of a square is
4 L.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.510
If it's a circle, it's a different formula
but it's still proportional to L.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.260
If I take two blocks, make one just double
the size of the other,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.730
you would quite agree I get twice the perimeter
but the shape remains the same.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.730
That's the proof.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.750
So perimeter is proportional to L, a straight
line curve.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.930
On the other hand, the area, all that, is
proportional to L squared.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.940
Again the same argument would work.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.960
So you see if I simply consider bigger and
bigger L's.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.020
One, two, three.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.780
I would get one, four, nine.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.111
And clearly this is going up faster than this.

00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:55.500
This is going up only in a straight line this
is going up as the square.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:02.420
So the amount of area per unit perimeter is
always increasing, the bigger the object is.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.940
Without any change of shape.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.120
And of course for a smaller object, what happens?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.680
Just the reverse. The more perimeter for the
little bit of area.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.180
And the same thing happens in the three dimensional
world, as I say,

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:20.520
where we'll now discuss the surface which
is

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.080
proportional to the square of the dimension.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.660
And the volume which is proportional to the
cube of the dimension.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.760
Again, this goes up faster than that.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.410
And indeed if you wish you may work out the
ratio of these two and see how it goes.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:43.389
And you'll find that the ratio, there's more
volume, more surface per unit volume,

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:46.460
as you get smaller and smaller, just in the
ratio of the sizes.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.479
One power cancels out and the others remain.
