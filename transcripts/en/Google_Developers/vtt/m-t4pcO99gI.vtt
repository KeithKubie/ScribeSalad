â™ª [upbeat music plays] 

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:07.833
Nicolas Lassus: The idea of GoAnimate is
for anyone to be able to create animations,

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.833
without having to draw
or animate anything.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:13.667
So, our team internally
is creating characters,

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:14.708
animating them.

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:18.208
And for users, it's just a matter
of dragging characters,

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:19.625
typing their scripts.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.542
And we generate the animation for them,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.375
so making it really easy.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:27.417
Alvin Hung: So, how did I come up
with the idea for GoAnimate?

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.875
I was trying to make
an animation for my wife

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:34.125
and I tried to do it 
using other existing software

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.750
and none of them worked
very well for me.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.083
It was very difficult.

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:39.208
And it required me to do a lot of drawing.

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.542
And I'm not an artist.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.375
And so, I thought,
"Hey, that's too difficult."

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.083
That's why I created GoAnimate.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.625
A simple way for me to make animations.

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.250
Nicolas Lassus: I think we're part
of a big movement

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.708
where animation is going mainstream.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:52.667
You see it on TV.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.375
You see it in commercials.

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:56.500
Animations is used more and more.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.667
But it's still usual for professionals
to edit videos.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:04.042
What we're trying to do
is to make it available to anyone.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:07.000
The opportunities that
YouTube has offered us definitely

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.458
is related to the size of YouTube.

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:10.958
It is so massive.

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.000
Alvin Hung: YouTube is huge.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.583
Being able to tap into that community,

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:19.542
being able to tap into that
user base is tremendous for us.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:22.042
Nicolas Lassus: For a while,
already before on GoAnimate.com,

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.875
people were able to export
their animations to YouTube.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:28.417
And so we simply, we actually
made our tools available on YouTube.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:30.875
And the feedback has been really positive.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:33.833
Our traffic increased around 50%,

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:37.708
if we look at both our GoAnimate
and our YouTube platforms.

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:40.917
And especially the exports to YouTube.

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.625
I've seen a tremendous
increase about five-fold.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:44.083
Alvin Hung: Going forward,

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.458
what we want to do is to create
many genre of 2-D animations.

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.917
We want to have Japanese-looking,
Manga, anime-looking animations.

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:53.833
We want to have youth, paper
comics looking animations.

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.958
We want to make it so that
when you watch an animation,

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.125
you don't really necessarily know that
it's actually made with GoAnimate

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.208
because the styling, the genre,
can be so diverse.

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:06.625
Nicolas Lassus: And so hopefully we'll see
a lot more videos being created online

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.375
thanks to our tools.
