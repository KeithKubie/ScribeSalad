00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
these interesting rigs and you have to
 

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:32.389 align:start position:0%
these interesting rigs and you have to

00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
decide with each shot how much depth and
 

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:36.169 align:start position:0%
decide with each shot how much depth and
that's<00:30:33.179><c> all</c><00:30:33.419><c> about</c><00:30:33.720><c> like</c><00:30:34.200><c> no</c><00:30:35.070><c> depth</c><00:30:35.370><c> is</c><00:30:35.669><c> to</c><00:30:35.970><c> D</c>

00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's all about like no depth is to D
 

00:30:36.179 --> 00:30:38.450 align:start position:0%
that's all about like no depth is to D
and<00:30:36.389><c> then</c><00:30:36.480><c> you</c><00:30:36.659><c> widen</c><00:30:36.960><c> it</c><00:30:37.259><c> to</c><00:30:38.039><c> two</c><00:30:38.220><c> and</c><00:30:38.340><c> a</c><00:30:38.370><c> half</c>

you<00:30:38.580><c> don't</c><00:30:38.730><c> go</c><00:30:38.850><c> any</c><00:30:39.000><c> wider</c><00:30:39.149><c> than</c><00:30:39.299><c> that</c><00:30:40.309><c> for</c>

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:41.309 align:start position:0%
you don't go any wider than that for

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
each shot you know in close-ups you just
 

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
each shot you know in close-ups you just

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.659 align:start position:0%

and<00:30:45.870><c> then</c><00:30:45.960><c> you</c><00:30:46.259><c> do</c><00:30:46.440><c> depth</c><00:30:46.710><c> the</c><00:30:47.190><c> bigger</c><00:30:47.370><c> depth</c>

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:47.669 align:start position:0%
and then you do depth the bigger depth
 

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:51.350 align:start position:0%
and then you do depth the bigger depth
for<00:30:47.909><c> the</c><00:30:48.029><c> for</c><00:30:48.690><c> the</c><00:30:48.750><c> wide</c><00:30:48.929><c> shots</c><00:30:49.259><c> and</c><00:30:49.440><c> and</c><00:30:50.360><c> we</c>
