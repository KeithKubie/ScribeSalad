00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Happy new year?

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.089
Guys that’s in like a week.

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:08.530
Oh right, I’m on the Julian Calendar.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.080
Good day everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.940
Have you ever wondered why the calendar is
the way it is?

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.720
What drove us in the western world to have
a 365 day year?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.680
Turns out it’s an interplay between astronomy,
religion, and history.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.970
The calendar we use right now is the Gregorian
calendar, so named because it was implemented

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.150
by Pope Gregory the thirteenth in 1582.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.920
Why would the pope be interested in the calendar?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.250
[[*RE-TRACKED on 12/18 - Cars have faces shoot*]]Well
Easter was traditionally supposed to fall

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.941
on the Sunday after the first full moon after
the spring equinox, March 21st, but it had

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:39.680
started slipping later and later behind the
solar event.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.969
Gregory was worried they were missing Christ’s
rebirthday, so he commissioned italian scientist

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.770
Aloysius Lilius to fix it and make sure they
were on Jesus’ good side.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.170
When they made the switch, the catholic world
jumped forward a full 10 days.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.100
And you thought daylight savings was bad.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.850
Many non-catholic countries wouldn’t adopt
the Gregorian calendar for hundreds of years

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.850
still.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.809
Russia switched after their October revolution
in 1917, which under the new system, technically

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.039
began in November.

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.560
The reason the Gregorian Calendar is more
accurate with our solar cycle is because it

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.740
changed how we approached leap years.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.490
It still has a leap year every 4 years, like
the Julian Calendar, except for years that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.350
are divisible by 100, except except for years
that are divisible by 400.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.380
So 2000 was a leap year, but 2100 will not
be.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.069
Why this wonky system for leap years?

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.429
As it turns out, our revolution around the
sun is not a perfect 365 days, but 365 days,

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.999
5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.229
Before Julius Caesar became emperor the calendar
was all over the place, literally being manipulated

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.179
by the roman high priest for political reasons.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.520
Sometimes years were lengthened to keep allies
in office, sometimes they were shortened to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.079
kick rivals out quicker.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.359
Julius Caesar put a stop to that by standardizing
the Julian calendar.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.200
Introduced in 45 BCE, or what to the romans
was 709 as they counted years from the founding

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.420
of the city of Rome.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.979
His calendar had 365 days every year with
an extra day every 4.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.069
It still made the average year length 11 minutes
and 14 seconds too long, but that wouldn’t

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.179
be evident until hundreds of years passed.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.390
To honor him for reforming the calendar, the
roman senate changed the name of Caesar's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.629
birth month to July.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.870
They’d honor him again a year later by murdering
him on the infamous ides of March

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.939
I always wondered, if Caesar could change
the calendar willy nilly, why didn’t he

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.939
just get rid of March?

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.840
Way to drop the ball, Caesar.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.910
The reason we’re in the year 2015 though
and not 2768 is because in 525 Christian Monk

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.739
Dionysius Exiguus determined that Jesus was
born in the roman year 753, and started counting

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.290
over again from there.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.390
Because of him we get the terms BC for before
Christ, and AD, which does not stand for After

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.689
Death but actually Anno Domini, which in Latin
means “The Year of Our Lord.”

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.370
In the academic and scientific communities,
to keep things neutral and welcoming to people

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.409
of all faiths, you’ll often see the terms
BCE and CE for Before Common Era and Common

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.409
Era.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.780
Of course the Gregorian Calendar is far from
the only calendar in use around the world

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.780
today.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.030
Many calendars from cultures with less pronounced
seasons actually rely on the cycles of the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.549
moon instead of the Sun.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.819
But for predicting the change of seasons,
equinoxes, solstices, and when certain constellations

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.730
will be visible, the Gregorian is the one
we prefer for its regularity.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.490
At least until 4909, when it’ll be a day
ahead.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.060
If you already blew it on your new years resolution,
I’d say switch to the Julian calendar and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.579
try again next week.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.469
But first check out Catie’s video on what
you did wrong over here.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.349
I’ve never lived by a different calendar
but I’m sure a lot of you out there watching

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.349
do.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.855
What’s it like going by a system where the
seasons aren’t the same dates each year?

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:29.855
Do you use the gregorian calendar too?

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:29.869
Let us know in the comments, and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
