SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN:
Good morning.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.370
Thank you for joining
us today to celebrate

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.790
International Women's Day.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.540
This is a global
event, so I want

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.340
to encourage you
throughout the day

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.469
to use the social media
to express your voice.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:26.635
Please use #WomenTechMakers.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.530
I'm super excited to
be part of this event.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.650
I'm here because,
like many of you,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.260
I have a degree in
computer science.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.780
A master's in computer
science from University

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.240
of Wisconsin-Madison,
and a bachelor's

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.030
from Mount Holyoke College.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.980
Also I've been in the
industry for 15 years,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.280
since I graduated.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.510
And one of the senior
women engineers

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.100
in YouTube engineering.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.110
And I love being in technology.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.990
This is not always the case.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.200
Many women drop out of
technology in school,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.000
or even after they
start their career.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.300
Nearly 50% of women
within the first 10 years

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.230
of their technical carrier
either switch professions

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.320
or quit.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.420
I have not, and I'm confident
each and every one of you,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.850
after listening to the
great lineup of speakers

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.970
we have today and the events we
have planned, will not either.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.620
As technologists and thinkers,
we solve everyday problems,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.040
and we come up with innovative
ways to make things happen.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.340
Women make up 51% of
the world's population.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.070
Yet, according to the
Department of Commerce,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.850
women make up only 27% of
all computer science jobs

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.370
in the US.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.240
And these numbers are worse when
it comes to leadership roles.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.180
Women are part of 14% of Fortune
500 executive committees,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.800
17% of Congress, and
11% of founder or CEO

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.100
positions in venture-backed
[? packed ?] US firms.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.450
The number of women
studying computer science

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.200
is on the decline.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.860
It's nearly 8% below where
we were nearly 10 years ago,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.040
and this is important.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.840
It's important to note
and recognize this,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.340
because time and
time again we have

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.750
seen that diverse and
well-balanced teams result

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.870
in more effective decision
making, and in better product

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.370
designs.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.790
According to McKinsey,
companies which

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.020
have a higher proportion of
women in top management roles

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.330
result in higher
returns on investment,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.620
and bigger, higher
earnings than average.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.320
Catalyst found
out that companies

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.780
which have at least
three women as part

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.080
of their board of
directors have on average

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.580
10% return on investment
compared to only 6.2%

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.220
otherwise.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.480
Universities and companies
are recognizing this,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.510
and doing their part
to help bridge the gap.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.700
For instance, Google provides
a great work environment

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.640
for women.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.100
Has strong women leaders
to serve as role models

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.430
within the company, many of whom
you will be hearing from today.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.210
The women at Google
Network of over 5,000

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.640
women from 23 countries
is very active.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.380
And Google helps
organize events like this

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.689
to raise gender awareness.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:34.160
We also, as part of our
commitment to advancing

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.090
computing and technology
at all levels,

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.700
we have education and research
and scholarship programs

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.830
for aspiring
computer scientists.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.790
Our generation for
Google scholarships

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.480
are aimed at currently
enrolled high school

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.210
seniors, undergraduates,
and graduates

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.330
who are planning to
be full time enrolled

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.300
students in universities
in the US or Canada.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.810
The Anita Borg
scholarship is for women

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.550
across the world
who are pursuing

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.810
a degree in computer science.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.590
And the Women on the Web
program-- which started out

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.520
as a community based
initiative to encourage

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.590
more women participation in
Google for Business groups--

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.040
aimed at increasing the
number of women entrepreneurs

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.830
in technology,
and enabling women

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.060
to succeed by leveraging
the power of the internet

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.610
early on in their startups.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.850
This program that
started out in India

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.300
has now expanded to
Latin America, Africa,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.950
southeast Asia, and middle east.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.580
And it focuses on encouraging
women and empowering them

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.650
in emerging markets.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.650
From the very beginning
Google's mission has been,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.290
and goal has been,
and the mantra

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.420
has been, focus on the user
and all else will follow.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.530
It turns out our
users are 50% women,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.590
speak different
languages, and come

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.390
from different
parts of the world.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.230
And in order to better
understand this diverse user

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.910
space, and build great
products and services for them,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.670
we need our teams
to be diverse too.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.140
So Google puts in
a lot of effort

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.530
to ensure that we have an
all inclusive workplace.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.670
And that we reflect
what our users are,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.470
so that we can build out
better products and services.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.200
We also are proactively
looking at ways

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.650
in which we can make
the environment better,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.230
and empower women further.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.700
For instance, recently our
focus on unconscious bias.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.930
Research has shown
that when we are

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.220
aware of our
unconscious bias, we

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.830
can make more
objective decisions

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.410
and have better discussions.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:19.080
So over 20,000 Googlers
and 80% people managers

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.940
have been engaging
in workshops focused

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.840
on understanding the science
of how the mind works

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.090
to bring together
and have dialogues

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.180
across the company about
the unconscious bias

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.130
and the effect it has on how
we perceive others; how we

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.510
interact with our coworkers,
our clients, and the business

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.450
as a whole.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.040
Efforts like this allow us to
make ourselves into a better

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.095
company, and become a better
workplace environment.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.490
In honor of International
Women's Day,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.190
Google offices
all over the world

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.380
have been hosting
events like this.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.610
I was honored to be a speaker
at the International Women's Day

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.750
event in Paris just
this past Wednesday

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.990
to around 200-plus attendees.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:18.390
It was invigorating and very
energizing to see and hear

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.280
people's aspirations and
dreams in those attendees.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.780
And also to hear
stories from them

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.100
on how the number of
women in computer science

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.830
has been increasing in local
colleges and universities.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.120
So these efforts that
we're doing is paying off.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.320
In fact recently, when I was
getting ready for these talks,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.310
I found out that in
2014, for the first time

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.500
in the history of University
of California, Berkeley,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.920
an introductory
computer science class

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.049
has more women
enrolled than men.

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:58.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.360
And the slight change,
the slight positive trend,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.650
is significant for women
in computer science

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.530
and women in technology.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.780
So we have a great, great
agenda planned for you

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.110
with amazing
speakers, some of whom

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.220
I have the honor of
working closely with.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.510
And I'm confident by hearing
the inspiring talks from them,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.880
by engaging and networking
with all the different women

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.230
engineers who are
here at the event,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.780
you will end the day
even more energized,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.330
ready to go change the world,
and make things happen.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.680
[APPLAUSE]
