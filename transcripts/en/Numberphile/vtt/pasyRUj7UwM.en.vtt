00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.279
what's the closest you can get within

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.440
the rules and the rules are you're

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.240
allowed to add numbers together you're

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.770
allowed to subtract numbers you're

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.269
allowed to multiply numbers and you're

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.070
allowed to divide numbers you're allowed

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.049
to have powers but i'm actually not

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.720
using those because when you're writing

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.060
a program to do it they explode you get

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.740
these ridiculously big values and it's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.300
just easier to not bother but they are

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.070
allowed I'm just not going to use them

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.109
and you're allowed to put brackets in to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.310
choose the order so I'm going to put

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.539
some brackets there to symbolize that

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.530
and you're allowed to just bunch the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.510
numbers together so if you look here

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.559
concatenation there you go well done

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.480
there you guys think that earlier today

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.770
they were you going to have a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.020
concatenation theme today in fact you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.309
could take these two videos that

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.870
involved concatenation and just play

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.270
them one after the other and so you

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.430
didn't bat an eye when three four five

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.190
six you like what hang on you didn't

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.480
think well what's the mathematical

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.579
operation you've done there to put them

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.320
in order you're just perfectly happy

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.640
that of course three four five six can

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.369
be there and so concatenations a strange

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.280
one there's no agreed symbol for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.740
concatenation some people use two lines

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.430
some people use a plus in a circle some

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.140
people use like little dashes or dots

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.119
are all sorts of things i'm going to use

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.130
i tend to use the two lines right in to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.080
be complete I probably should have put

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.780
in this picture if we go back to the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.750
past to fix previous errors if I sing

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.460
more star I would have put three

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.490
concatenate for concatenate five

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.619
concatenate six and down here actually

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.829
done for concatenate three right you

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.840
know to be more fun so that is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.729
concatenation is clearly allowed if we

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.110
just for some reason we never bother

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.119
spelling it up so what I'm going to do

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.299
is here's my almost but not good enough

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.979
attempt so gonna be a park of square

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.229
this is really cool right so you start

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.770
with 12 so one concatenate two to 12

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.299
then x 3 x 4 divide that by five

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.170
multiply it by six multiply it by seven

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.530
add on eight put that whole thing in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.190
brackets and then multiply that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.990
by nine okay so what does this equal

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.560
let's check that and we're close 10 9 58

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.710
mark with exactly if it equal 10 9 58 we

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.900
are on so here we go so one can catenate

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.180
to that's 12 x 3 x 4 / 5 x 6 x 7

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.280
equals okay so the whole thing there

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.680
plus 8 equals 1217 point 6 times 9

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.360
equals ten thousand nine hundred 58.4

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.800
that's that's not bad ten thousand nine

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.690
hundred if you say classic parker square

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.250
where you're in so much trouble Brady

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.030
laughs come on that's not bad right

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.550
that's as close as I can get within the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.730
rules as initially I understood them man

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.380
what we'll do you think I'm not going

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.150
back a square on the screen runner okay

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.630
like a hashtag thanks for the quick a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.990
day is unnecessary right okay anyway so

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.520
as long as you try to sell the t-shirt

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.050
again but do you know how many people

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.360
shop to my shows wearing Parker Square t

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.660
shirts unbelievable honor right anyway

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.520
so what's interesting about the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.410
concatenation thing is it's never

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.300
explicitly stated to be able to look at

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.400
the start of the paper he talks a lot

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.070
about he loves plus product potentiation

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.800
two powers and brackets loves those he

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.709
will concede you can add in- and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.810
division which you like the SEC they're

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.300
not as good as plus and multiplication

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.459
or products but they're okay and they're

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.620
allowed it he never explicitly says

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.290
concatenation all he does is in here he

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.209
goes you can add a and B multiplied a

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.980
and B powers of a and B oh and of course

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.900
AMV forming a number so all the ones in

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.870
here a lot of them do use concatenation

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.310
right from the beginning it's never

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.920
assumed you can't do that but it's never

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.590
used as a step during the calculation

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.050
it's only used in a setup of the numbers

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.060
that you then apply the other operations

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.700
to and I like that's a bit arbitrary it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.380
should be a fully-fledged function if

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.970
you go include it you've got to include

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.940
it and so I found one x two concatenated

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.969
with three plus in brackets

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.479
four times 5 times 6 and then that so 4

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.769
times 5 just you know we're going with

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.860
this that's going to be 20 x 6 is 120 but

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.249
then 120 is concatenated with seven so

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.629
now you do the calculation first and

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.610
then you concatenate with another digit

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.399
then you add on an eight and that whole

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:53.749
thing you multiply by nine shall we

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:55.939
check it let's just do this simplify it

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.959
to their equals k 1 x 23 that's just 23

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.039
i think we're all quite happy with that

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.399
plus in brackets that's going to be 4

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:08.929
times 5 is 20 times 6 is 120 concatenate

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:11.239
with seven and then we're going to add

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:13.249
on 8 and then we're going to multiply

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:19.189
that 59 so now we've got 23 plus 12 if I

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.719
want to do this all at once actually you

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.819
know I'll do that step there is a

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.610
concatenation plus 8 and then that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.369
there's x 9 okay so let's let's so we

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:30.019
checked into the calculator now that

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.489
feels like it's obvious enough that we

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:35.329
can we can drive this home 1207 plus 8

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:39.979
equals unsurprisingly 1215 x 9 equals

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.839
that plus the 23 at the top equals ten

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.959
thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.829
there it is so we have filled the gap

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.259
because the gap was only there because

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.360
people weren't taking concatenations

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.119
seriously and I I've taken it seriously

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:01.879
I filled the gap and I'm going to send

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.409
it in I'm gonna I'm gonna be like I

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.779
think I thought the gap it is it is now

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.079
available let me give you that really

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.079
that's the only reason I found this by

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:14.539
the way is because I wasn't afraid to

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.849
try something where the odds are i was

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.619
going to fail miserably and i said i

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.539
think that is the morale of the Parker

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.549
square right you give it a go even

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:23.719
though it's probably not going to work

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.479
and you embrace it you own it when it

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.539
doesn't work every now and then it does

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.199
work out for you

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.810
times that base have we worked out the

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.640
length or something well you use a log

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.630
right so is log base whatever the base is

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.150
of your next digit
