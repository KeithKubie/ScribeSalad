00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:01.449
- [Voiceover] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:03.932
is give ourselves some
practice constructing

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:05.476
expressions with exponents

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:07.787
to solve real problems.

00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:10.514
So let's start looking
at these real problems.

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:12.326
So this first one says the surface area

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:15.007
of a cube is equal to the sum of the areas

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:16.796
of its six sides, and that makes sense

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:19.210
if I were to draw a cube here.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.811
If I were to draw a cube,

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.645
it has six sides, it has the three sides

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:24.551
we see right over here,

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:26.245
one, two, three, and
it has the three sides

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:27.324
that we don't see, if we were

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.345
to make this a transparent cube

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:30.750
then we could count those as well,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.806
so the one in the back here,

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:33.813
one in the back there, and then
the bottom right over here.

00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:37.462
So you have six sides of
a cube, we believe that,

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:41.030
and it says, Spencer has
two cube shaped blocks

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.933
that he wants to paint.

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.114
One cube has sides of length four units.

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:48.356
One cube has sides of length four units,

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.329
so let's say that this is
this one right over here.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.233
So it's a cube, so all of these dimensions

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.730
are four units.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.730
The other cube has lengths
of sides 2.5 units,

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:03.967
so the other cube is going
to look something like this.

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:05.989
The other cube looks something like this,

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:10.989
and the sides are 2.5, 2.5, 2.5.

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.558
Write a numerical expression

00:01:13.558 --> 00:01:16.320
with exponents for the total surface area

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.340
he has to paint.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.381
Well, there's six sides here,

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.144
and what's the area of
each of the six sides?

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:27.383
So there's six sides like this,

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:29.717
so there's going to be six times

00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:31.400
the area of each side, and what's the area

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.642
of each side?

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:34.639
Well, each side is going
to be four by four,

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.903
each side is a four by four square.

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:39.213
So each side is going to have an area

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:43.322
of four squared.

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:45.853
So the surface area of the six sides

00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:48.581
of this cube, is six times four squared.

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:50.334
Once again, the surface area,

00:01:50.334 --> 00:01:51.971
or the area of each side,

00:01:51.971 --> 00:01:53.561
is going to be four squared,

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.059
and there's six of them,

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:57.694
so that's the surface area of this cube,

00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.273
and then the same logic
for the surface area

00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:00.492
of this cube.

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:04.091
The area of each of the sides

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.540
is going to be 2.5 times 2.5,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.638
or we could write that as
2.5 to the second power,

00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.914
and there's going to be
six sides to the cube,

00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:15.897
so it's going to be six times 2.5 squared,

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:18.114
so a numerical expression

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:20.332
with exponents for the total
surface area he has to paint,

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:22.085
well that's the surface
area of both cubes,

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:23.710
this is the surface
area of the yellow cube,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.368
this is the surface area of the blue cube,

00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:28.423
and we are done.

00:02:28.423 --> 00:02:30.420
And just as a reminder on a little bit

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.068
of the notation I'm using,

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.845
this is not a decimal, this is higher

00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:36.863
than a decimal, it's kind
of halfway up the numbers,

00:02:36.863 --> 00:02:37.966
and when I write it like that,

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.905
that's a way of writing multiplication,

00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:40.984
and you're going to see that more and more

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:42.261
as you go into algebra.

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:43.921
I could have also written it this way,

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.277
I could have written it as six times four

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.906
squared, plus, six times

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.530
2.5 squared.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.749
This would have been
another way to write it,

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.359
and here, when you just
write another number

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.203
next to the parentheses,

00:03:00.203 --> 00:03:02.803
it means multiply by
whatever's in the parentheses,

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.368
so this is six times four squared,

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:06.768
this is six times four squared.

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:09.844
So while we're constructing
these exponent expressions

00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:13.083
it's also good to get used
to some of this notation.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.128
So let's do another one,

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:16.622
in fact, let's do two more.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.364
Boom Town was established in a remote part

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.720
of the world in 2010.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.888
Its population has tripled,

00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.152
let me underline that,

00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:28.625
its population has tripled every year

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.587
since its founding.

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:32.804
If there were 1,050 people

00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:34.708
in Boom Town when it was established,

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:35.648
let me write that down.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.945
So there's 1,050 people in Boom Town

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:40.501
when it was established,

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:43.925
what would be the
population after six years?

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:46.584
So remember, after every year it triples.

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:48.569
So after the first year,

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.043
we're going to multiply it by three,

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:51.286
we're going to have three
times the population.

00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:52.969
The second year, multiply it by three,

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.627
third year, fourth year,

00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:58.472
fifth year, and sixth year.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.166
Or, maybe the easier way,

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.987
or more compact way of writing this is,

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:04.323
its population after six years

00:04:04.323 --> 00:04:07.261
is going to be its initial population,

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:12.040
times three to the sixth power.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.780
We have six, we have six threes

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.894
that we're multiplying together.

00:04:15.894 --> 00:04:17.810
Times three to the sixth power,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.132
or, just as we just talked about,

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:23.452
the initial population, 1,050 people,

00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:28.452
times three to the sixth power.

00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:30.600
And the whole point here

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.106
is not to evaluate these things,

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:33.708
but just to construct the expression,

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.368
to know that we could evaluate this,

00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:36.807
and actually figure out the exact answer,

00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:37.991
but all they're asking us for

00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.509
is write a numerical
expression with exponents

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.448
to describe the population of Boom Town

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:46.269
after six years, and we just did that.

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:47.348
Let's do one more of these,

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:51.353
this is strangely fun (chuckles)

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:53.954
So we have a square wall with sides

00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:55.335
of length four meters.

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:57.506
Let's draw our square wall with sides

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.445
of length four meters.

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:01.825
So it's a square wall.

00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:04.332
I'm sensing a lot of
squares in this exercise

00:05:04.332 --> 00:05:06.329
or these exercises.

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:08.152
So I have a square wall

00:05:08.152 --> 00:05:09.904
with sides of length four meters,

00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:11.425
so this is four meters,

00:05:11.425 --> 00:05:13.074
and this is four meters.

00:05:13.074 --> 00:05:15.825
And it has three square windows.

00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.066
It has three square windows,

00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:20.353
let me do this in a different color.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.290
It has three square windows

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.703
each with sides of length 1.5 meters.

00:05:26.703 --> 00:05:28.247
So it might look like this.

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:29.628
One square window,

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:31.509
another square window,

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.308
and another square window,

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:38.308
and these are each 1.5 by 1.5.

00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:42.085
Lena, or Lena, wants to paper the wall,

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:43.408
so she needs to determine the area

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:45.734
of the wall that does
not include the windows.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:47.556
Write a numerical
expression with exponents

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:48.695
that describes the area

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:51.818
in square meters of the wall
that Lena wants to paper.

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.336
So that's going to be all this stuff

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:55.555
that I am shading in blue.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.657
Essentially the area of the larger wall,

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:02.657
minus the area of those three windows.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.540
And, so what's that going to be?

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.875
Well, the area of the larger wall

00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:07.130
is going to be four times four,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.011
we can just write that as
four to the second power

00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:10.590
or four squared.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.517
The reason why people even call it

00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:12.760
four squared, is because that's how

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.630
you figure out the area of a square.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.729
Four squared, and then
you want to subtract out

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.772
the area of these three windows.

00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:21.758
So there's three windows,

00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:25.947
each of them have an area of 1.5 squared.

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:28.948
This area is 1.5 squared,

00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:30.550
1.5 times 1.5, this area

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.431
is 1.5 times 1.5,

00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:35.112
this area is 1.5 times 1.5.

00:06:35.112 --> 00:06:36.110
So you get four squared minus

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.431
three times 1.5 squared.

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.453
And there you go, that's going

00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:45.453
to be the area that she wants to paper.
