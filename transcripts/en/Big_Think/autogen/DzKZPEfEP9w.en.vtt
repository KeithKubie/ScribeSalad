what is the basic cognitive software
that's running in the human brain that

that's running in the human brain that
 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.650
that's running in the human brain that
takes ideas in and smooshes them up and

takes ideas in and smooshes them up and
 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.270

creativity to happen because when you

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999
creativity to happen because when you
 

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.699
creativity to happen because when you
look at us compared to all the other

we're in New York City right now and
 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.679
we're in New York City right now and
when I flew in here it's like looking at

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689
when I flew in here it's like looking at
 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.749
when I flew in here it's like looking at
a motherboard that has risen from the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759
a motherboard that has risen from the
 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.349
a motherboard that has risen from the
earth and when you fly over a forest it

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359
earth and when you fly over a forest it
 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.910
earth and when you fly over a forest it
looks the same as it did a million years

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
looks the same as it did a million years
 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.389
looks the same as it did a million years
ago so we're running around the planet

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399
ago so we're running around the planet
 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.489

doing something unbelievable you don't

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499

the gajillion things that we do where

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060
the gajillion things that we do where
 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.309
the gajillion things that we do where
we're doing something really different

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319
we're doing something really different
 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.709
we're doing something really different
and and that's what that's what Anthony

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719
and and that's what that's what Anthony
 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.019
and and that's what that's what Anthony
and I have really tried to understand so

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:05.029
and I have really tried to understand so
 

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:07.629
and I have really tried to understand so
I'm a neuroscientist Anthony is a music

I'm a neuroscientist Anthony is a music
 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.809
I'm a neuroscientist Anthony is a music
composer and we started talking about

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819
composer and we started talking about
 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.940
composer and we started talking about
creativity a while ago many years ago

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
creativity a while ago many years ago
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.140
creativity a while ago many years ago
we've been good friends for a long time

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150
we've been good friends for a long time
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.790
we've been good friends for a long time
and we started realizing that there were

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800
and we started realizing that there were
 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740
and we started realizing that there were
all these very interesting ways which

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
all these very interesting ways which
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.630
all these very interesting ways which
are view

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640
are view
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.789
are view
came together so then we ended up

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799
came together so then we ended up
 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.500
came together so then we ended up
writing this book together what's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
writing this book together what's
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.069
writing this book together what's
special about the human brain is that we

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079
special about the human brain is that we
 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.009
special about the human brain is that we
during the evolution of the cortex got a

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019
during the evolution of the cortex got a
 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.259
during the evolution of the cortex got a
lot more space in between input and

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269
lot more space in between input and
 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.589
lot more space in between input and
output so other animals have these much

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599
output so other animals have these much
 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.000
output so other animals have these much
closer together so when they get some

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
closer together so when they get some
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.099
closer together so when they get some
stimulus they make a essentially

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109
stimulus they make a essentially
 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.039
stimulus they make a essentially
reflexive response in humans as the

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049
reflexive response in humans as the
 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.809
reflexive response in humans as the
cortex expanded there's a lot more room

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819
cortex expanded there's a lot more room
 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.449
cortex expanded there's a lot more room
there which means that inputs can come

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
there which means that inputs can come
 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.119
there which means that inputs can come
in and sort of percolate around and and

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129
in and sort of percolate around and and
 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.710
in and sort of percolate around and and
get stored and get thought about and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
get stored and get thought about and
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.240
get stored and get thought about and
then maybe you make an output or maybe

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
then maybe you make an output or maybe
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.849
then maybe you make an output or maybe
you don't and there's one other thing

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859
you don't and there's one other thing
 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.800
you don't and there's one other thing
that happened with the expansion of the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810
that happened with the expansion of the
 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.330
that happened with the expansion of the
cortex which is that we got a much

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340
cortex which is that we got a much
 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.940
cortex which is that we got a much
bigger prefrontal cortex that's the part

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
bigger prefrontal cortex that's the part
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.520
bigger prefrontal cortex that's the part
right behind the forehead and that is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530
right behind the forehead and that is
 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.569
right behind the forehead and that is
what allows us to simulate what ifs to

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579
what allows us to simulate what ifs to
 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.699
what allows us to simulate what ifs to
separate ourselves from our location in

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709
separate ourselves from our location in
 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.039
separate ourselves from our location in
space and time and think about

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049
space and time and think about
 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.470
space and time and think about
possibilities what if I did that what if

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480
possibilities what if I did that what if
 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.539
possibilities what if I did that what if
what if I had done that what if I could

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549
what if I had done that what if I could
 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.750
what if I had done that what if I could
do that and so we do this all of the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760
do that and so we do this all of the
 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.729
do that and so we do this all of the
time the amazing part is now there are

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739
time the amazing part is now there are
 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.619
time the amazing part is now there are
almost eight billion brains running

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629
almost eight billion brains running
 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.949
almost eight billion brains running
around the planet and as a result

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959
around the planet and as a result
 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.180
around the planet and as a result
creativity I mean the creativity of our

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
creativity I mean the creativity of our
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.740
creativity I mean the creativity of our
species has gone up in this mad amazing

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
species has gone up in this mad amazing
 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.339
species has gone up in this mad amazing
way because there's so much raw material

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349
way because there's so much raw material
 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.069
way because there's so much raw material
to draw on and we're you know there are
