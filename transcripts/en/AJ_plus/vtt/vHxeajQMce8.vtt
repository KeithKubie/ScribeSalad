00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
Historically, houses of worship for the black community, I believe, is what has

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.840
allowed us to keep our sanity as a people.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.300
Religion in the United States has been used throughout history not only as the bedrock of the persecution of

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.940
black Americans, but also as the bedrock of their emancipation.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:26.100
They made meaning of Christian teaching about salvation, of biblical traditions regarding liberation.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.300
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and today I’m going to explore the role of religion –

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.220
especially Christianity and Islam – in the black American history of liberation.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.180
And I want to ask if religion still has a role to play today in the fight against systematic racism.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.600
European colonizers justified slavery through the Bible. There was this idea

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.900
that biblically, through the story of Noah’s curse, Africans were meant to be

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.980
slaves. But black slaves also went on to adopt Christianity and make it into

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
a faith for survival and mobilization. What we know as the black church today formed

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.080
through what happened during slavery and the period after it. Now, slaveholders

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.770
didn’t really want their slaves to be exposed to Christianity. There was a fear

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.430
that by exposing them to it, they’d see themselves as, well, equal to the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.300
slaveholder since they would share the same faith. So they adjusted their faith’s

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.350
teachings. The version of Christianity that slaveholders spread usually mandated a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.300
divinely ordained racial hierarchy. That slavery was God’s will for people of African descent.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.000
And it’s not like the stolen Africans didn’t have their own

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.040
spiritual traditions before they were enslaved in the colonies.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.180
I’ll let Dr. Judith Weisenfeld of Princeton University explain.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.640
Enslaved Africans were not interested in converting to Christianity, for example.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.780
Enslaved peoples produced religious community on their own, maintaining connections to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.560
African traditional resources and creating new versions of those.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.860
Their own beliefs included a variety of traditional religions in west Africa and central Africa,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.620
but also Islam and Christianity, and they ended up practicing their faith in secret gatherings.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.700
But in the 1740s – decades before the United States even existed – a wave of religious enthusiasm among

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.440
European Protestants spread across the colonies. It’s known as the Great Awakening.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.840
The Christian revivals, as they were called, focused on renewed individual piety and religious devotion.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.800
And they had a more egalitarian message than the one the slaveholders espoused.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.440
People felt free to interpret the scripture and the teachings of Christianity

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.560
for themselves in ways that highlighted their humanity, their equal standing before God

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.960
and the notion that God would someday liberate them.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:45.440
And so we begin to see new forms of African-American Christianity emerge that are focused on this experience

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.940
of being born again and on a more direct access that doesn't require the oversight of white clergy.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300
It's out of this movement that you start to see the emergence of black leaders.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.440
A lot of them came out of the Baptist and Methodist denominations because those denominations

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.780
actually licensed black men to preach. And Weisenfeld says sometimes religion

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.020
even provided tools for slave revolts.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.920
One of the most famous examples, that comes much later, is that of Nat Turner,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.480
a religious visionary and preacher who led a rebellion in Virginia in August of 1831.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.180
Now, back in the late 1700s, free black people in the North had already begun to develop

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.340
their own denominations. In many cases, these denominations were in direct response

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.620
to the racism black Americans experienced in their predominantly white congregations.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.180
But it wasn’t until after the Civil War and the end of slavery that newly freed black people who were part of

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.660
the Baptist churches and communities in the South were able to organize more formally.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.700
When the National Baptist Convention was founded in 1895, it became the nation’s largest

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.060
African-American denomination, with almost 2 million members.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.220
So why is all this important?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.480
Well, these new institutions became central spaces for black organizing and public discussion of issues

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.340
like the abolition of slavery, and then later the status of free black people.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.080
It gave them a means to mobilize against their oppression.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:11.060
Control of religious life was always fraught under slavery, but it was sometimes the only arena in which

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.580
people could exercise authority and control.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.420
Black preachers, black ministers, other kinds of black religious leaders,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.600
have always been central figures in black communities.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.380
During the Great Migration, millions of Southern black people moved to Northern cities in search of better

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.140
opportunities, and to escape the Jim Crow South.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.340
It’s estimated that between 1916 and 1970, more than 6 million black Americans left their homes in the South

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.080
and relocated to Northern cities.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.300
This influx of Southerners not only transformed Northern black Protestant churches,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.700
but also created interactions that would offer black Americans a range of religious beliefs

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.240
outside of Christianity.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.520
In our interview, Weisenfeld notes that out of the Great Migration came two major revivalist movements

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.540
that identified Islam as the proper religion of black people:

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.740
the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.580
While Islam was one of the religions of the African slaves, it kind of disappeared as a conscious

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.940
faith and practice because slaves were forced to practice in secret.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.440
And it was through the work of Muslim missionaries, scholars and activists that versions of Islam

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.060
began to reemerge in black communities in the early 20th century, versions that reflected the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.100
fight against white supremacy and a search for independence.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.820
A lot of those immigrant preachers propagated the idea of universal brotherhood – an idea that appealed

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.320
to many black Americans.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.660
Noble Drew Ali, who is considered the father of the first modern black Muslim movement,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.900
established the Moorish Science Temple in the early 1900s.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.640
The Moorish Science Temple rejected the idea of tolerating white supremacy through the black church

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.220
and rejected the idea of black inferiority.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.480
The Temple didn’t reject Christianity, but it did see it as a European religion.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.940
Among the Temple’s central beliefs was the idea that black Americans were descendants of Moroccans

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.320
and their original faith was Islam.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.180
Ali rejected terms of the day like “Negro,” “colored” and even “black,” believing the term “Moor”

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.420
was more accurate. The Moorish Science Temple had thousands of members in the 1920s

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.200
across northern cities like Detroit and Philadelphia.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.160
And it’s important to note that it was far from mainstream or orthodox Islam.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.620
Even the Quran used by the Temple was written by Ali and derived from various sources.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.440
While the Moorish Science Temple was taking root, a man named Wallace Fard Muhammad established

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.740
another non-orthodox black Islamic movement in 1930. One that you’re probably familiar with:

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.840
the Nation of Islam.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:35.680
The world sees the problem in America as some gang-banging, dope-selling, crack-using black people.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.900
The Nation’s purpose was, according to Wallace Fard Muhammad, to use the faith to uplift black Americans

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.480
and make them self-reliant. And it was under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.140
who assumed leadership in 1934, that the Nation grew into a great political force.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:07:00.040
I represent to you, not a prophet. But I represent to you, God in person.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.860
It created one of the most influential black liberation figures of the 20th century.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.260
We don’t advocate violence, but our people have been the constant victims of brutality

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.080
on the part of America’s racists, and the government has found itself either unwilling or unable

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.200
to do anything about it.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.720
Malcolm X, a minister in the Nation of Islam, propagated a simple message:

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.700
uplift black Americans’ worth in their own eyes and make them independent.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.780
And the Nation of Islam was the foundation of his message, especially as it rejected Christianity

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.280
and how it had been used by white supremacy.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.240
Religion, whether Islam or Christianity, was a big deal during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.320
Religious spaces like mosques and churches became mobilization centers.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.080
Because churches and mosques were community centers and financially independent,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.020
they also were places where people were able to learn skills like public speaking,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.960
fundraising and organizing meetings.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.760
And it’s also why so many of the leaders of the civil rights movement were either ministers or active

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.620
members in their churches and mosques.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.620
There were also efforts, by the likes of ministers and theologians like James H. Cone,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.620
to create a black liberation theology.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.200
In a 2017 talk at the Yale Divinity School, Cone summarized the core of black theology in this way:

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.460
Black power is not only not alien to the gospel,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:24.160
it’s not alien to the gospel, but rather it is the gospel of Jesus and 20th century America.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.760
So we’ve talked about how religion has been for hundreds of years a central part of black liberation

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.840
and how black communities have dealt with white supremacy.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.480
But what role does religion have to play today in the fight against systematic racism?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.900
Well, I asked Dawud Walid, a Muslim activist, if he thought there was a place for religion in activism today,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.380
and here’s what he had to say.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:49.720
The movement towards black liberation in the United States of America has become less religious.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:57.040
If we look back at the 1950s and 1960s, it was the black church, but also the mosque under the nation of Islam,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.580
that were the most potent organizing forces. When we look at what's going on right now,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:09.180
the black church is seen as less of a means or a base for organizing.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.220
According to Pew, while black Americans are the most religiously inclined racial and ethnic group in the country,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.300
their church attendance has declined.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.220
The idea of religion as a central, organizing force has also shifted.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.720
In fact, black Americans under 30 are three times more likely to be religiously unaffiliated

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.220
than black Americans over 50.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.420
And some of this may have to do with tensions that may seem to exist between religious institutions

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.900
and activism, especially on social positions on issues like LGBTQIA rights,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.540
women’s representation and reproductive rights.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.380
We can look at the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance, which is a very left-orientated,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:52.980
a much more secular organization or movement. And in fact, there are many within the religious community

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:59.600
that actually are proponents of “black lives matter” as a slogan, but don't agree with the tactics

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.200
of the actual Black Lives Matter movement and the 501 (c) nonprofit organization.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.680
And even though there may be some tension, some religious groups are still involved in progressive social

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.960
activism. Take, for example, Reverend William Barber’s Moral Mondays movement.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.280
Ain’t no stopping us now! 
Say it again!

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.900
Moral Mondays is a campaign started in 2013 where church congregants have been leading protests

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.880
every Monday, in several state legislatures, against policies negatively impacting everything

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.440
from voting rights to the climate.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.020
And even if the future of religious institutions in black activist movements is uncertain,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.400
Walid is quick to point out what he sees as the central role religion has played

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.300
throughout black American history.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:47.980
It is this religiosity and this connection to the church and to the mosque that I believe has granted us the spiritual

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:53.920
strength and spiritual power to continue existing and struggling in these United States of America.
