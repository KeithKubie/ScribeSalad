well for about 15 years now we've been

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
well for about 15 years now we've been
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.480
well for about 15 years now we've been
able to measure brain

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
able to measure brain
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.280
able to measure brain
with brain imaging through our machine

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290
with brain imaging through our machine
 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.160
with brain imaging through our machine
methods we've been able to interpret

what that hotspot of information is what

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230
what that hotspot of information is what
 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.350
what that hotspot of information is what
the underlying information is in the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360
the underlying information is in the
 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.150
the underlying information is in the
various parts of the brain what we're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160
various parts of the brain what we're
 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.820
various parts of the brain what we're
doing is trying to tie the biology of

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830
doing is trying to tie the biology of
 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.010
doing is trying to tie the biology of
the brain the neural activity to the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020
the brain the neural activity to the
 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:38.580
the brain the neural activity to the
ideas that we're thinking about there

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590
ideas that we're thinking about there
 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.350
ideas that we're thinking about there
are total of eight distinct ones that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360
are total of eight distinct ones that
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.729
are total of eight distinct ones that
each one is going to be shown three

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739
each one is going to be shown three
 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.110
each one is going to be shown three
times and that'll be the data that we'll

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
times and that'll be the data that we'll
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.690
times and that'll be the data that we'll
be using and the only information that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700
be using and the only information that
 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.570
be using and the only information that
won't have to go on is the brain image

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580
won't have to go on is the brain image
 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.670
won't have to go on is the brain image
so from his brain image for these things

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680
so from his brain image for these things
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.410
so from his brain image for these things
we still have to identify which one it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420
we still have to identify which one it
 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.740
we still have to identify which one it
is

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750
is
 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.230
is
now that we've collected the images from

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240
now that we've collected the images from
 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.569
now that we've collected the images from
Justin's brain while he was thinking

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579
Justin's brain while he was thinking
 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.730
Justin's brain while he was thinking
about these eight words we've asked the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740
about these eight words we've asked the
 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.010
about these eight words we've asked the
computer algorithm to look at the brain

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020
computer algorithm to look at the brain
 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.380
computer algorithm to look at the brain
imaging data that we've collected and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390
imaging data that we've collected and
 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.240
imaging data that we've collected and
tell us which word was which was my

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250
tell us which word was which was my
 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.000
tell us which word was which was my

first guess so in the next experiment
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.149
first guess so in the next experiment
what we're doing is we're going to take

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159
what we're doing is we're going to take
 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.120
what we're doing is we're going to take
a classifier that was not trained using

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130
a classifier that was not trained using
 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.520
a classifier that was not trained using
data from Justin instead it was trained

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530
data from Justin instead it was trained
 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.490
data from Justin instead it was trained
using data from other people and we're

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500
using data from other people and we're
 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920
using data from other people and we're
going to determine whether that

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930
going to determine whether that
 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.260
going to determine whether that
classifier which has never seen data

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270
classifier which has never seen data
 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.630
classifier which has never seen data
from Justin's brain before can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640
from Justin's brain before can
 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.990
from Justin's brain before can
successfully determine which word that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000
successfully determine which word that
 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.010
successfully determine which word that
he's looking at so the first word we've

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020
he's looking at so the first word we've
 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.260
he's looking at so the first word we've
asked it to say was the word eye or was

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
asked it to say was the word eye or was
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.560
asked it to say was the word eye or was
it closet I think the word is all right

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
it closet I think the word is all right
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.960
it closet I think the word is all right
okay so it was correct it got it this is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970
okay so it was correct it got it this is
 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.230
okay so it was correct it got it this is
based entirely on other people's brain

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
based entirely on other people's brain
 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.040
based entirely on other people's brain
activation I think the word is apartment

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
activation I think the word is apartment
 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.800
activation I think the word is apartment
I think that it got on 10 out of 10 and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
I think that it got on 10 out of 10 and
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.330
I think that it got on 10 out of 10 and
in a two choice test it got a perfect

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340
in a two choice test it got a perfect
 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.990
in a two choice test it got a perfect
score

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
score
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.760
score
now what this shows is that other people

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
now what this shows is that other people
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.100
now what this shows is that other people
represented these 10 items rather

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110
represented these 10 items rather
 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.300
represented these 10 items rather
similarly to the way that Justin did it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310
similarly to the way that Justin did it
 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.880
similarly to the way that Justin did it
means that all of us to some extent when

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890
means that all of us to some extent when
 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.430
means that all of us to some extent when
we think of a chair or an apple or a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
we think of a chair or an apple or a
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.180
we think of a chair or an apple or a
hammer or any physical object very

the very first time 15 years ago we
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.490
the very first time 15 years ago we
didn't have the brain imaging technology

didn't have the brain imaging technology
 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.280
didn't have the brain imaging technology
for doing this 15 years ago we didn't
