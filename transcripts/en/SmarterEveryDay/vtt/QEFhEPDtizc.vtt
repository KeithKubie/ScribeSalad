Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.110
Smarter Every Day. So, I am very passionate about rockets. You probably know that

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.170
by now. But the reason I am is because my grandfather worked for NASA and he introduced me to

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.340
rockets. I knew from that moment when he introduced me that I wanted to explore

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.530
space, I want to be an astronaut. So here's what we did. My hero says

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.710
to him who much is given much is required, and I grew up in the shadow of that. I've been given

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.890
a lot. So we recognise that there are people who don't even know what rockets are.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.070
So a buddy of mine, and I, we lauched this operation.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.250
It took us a year and a half to plan and execute, but we took rockets to people who'd

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
never seen rockets before. But in order to do this, the first thing we had to do logistically

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.590
was figure out how to get rockets to the smallest nation in Africa.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.790
[music]

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.140
We have a class B

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.170
Estes model rocket and we're gonna let it fly and let these kids learn a little bit more about

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.850
science, and math and technology.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:46.060
[music]

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.470
(To students) In order for the fins to hold it straight

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.610
it has to be going fast. Before it goes fast, you have to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.660
hold it straight. 
The answer is science, OK.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.840
When your teacher gets ready to fire, we're going to count down. Now,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.020
what we do when you shoot rockets is you count from 5 down to zero.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.370
1.. zero

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.870
[students excited screams]

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.260
This is the inauguration

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.810
of the Gambian space program.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.380
5..4..3..2..1..Fire

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.700
Did you see that? Look, let me play it back. Watch this kid.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.880
right here. That guy. Ignore the other ones. He's having the moment.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.060
This is the very first time that this kid's ever seen a rocket in his entire life.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.660
Did you like it? -[laugh]

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.820
Do you remember what that's like for you? Well, here's the deal. You've been given many

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.010
opportunities that other people in the world haven't got. It's like this.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.200
To him who much is given, much is required. What have you been given?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.370
So me and Stevo's plan to get people excited about science technology engineering math was the initiation

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.570
of the Gambian space program. So it's simple. What are you going to do?

5..4..3..

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.050
2..1..Fire! [rocket launch]

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:14.400
