00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.027
- [Voiceover] Both mitosis and meiosis

00:00:02.027 --> 00:00:03.863
are forms of cell division

00:00:03.863 --> 00:00:06.562
that produce daughter cells
containing genetic information

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.485
from the parent cell.

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:09.193
Part a.

00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:11.405
Describe two events that are common

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.727
to both mitosis and meiosis

00:00:13.727 --> 00:00:15.926
that ensure the resulting daughter cells

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:18.981
inherit the appropriate
number of chromosomes.

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:19.681
All right.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.925
So, really we just wanna,

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.758
well, what are two
commonalities between the two?

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:26.173
Well, I can think of a bunch of them.

00:00:26.173 --> 00:00:27.403
You could start off saying,

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:31.295
well, DNA replicates before
going into either of them.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:35.485
So DNA replicates

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.222
before either,

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:42.752
before either.

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:44.308
You could say,

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:47.373
well, the chromatin
condenses into chromosomes

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:48.835
in both of them.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:53.391
Chromatin, chromatin

00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:57.427
condenses,

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:00.912
condenses into,

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:04.326
into chromosomes.

00:01:05.236 --> 00:01:08.822
You could talk about chromosomes form,

00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:12.581
getting aligned near
the center of the cell,

00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:17.364
attaching to, to, to fibers.

00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:19.401
You could talk about,

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.062
we could talk about cytokinesis.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:24.285
Splitting the cells.

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:28.334
So, cytokinesis,

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.504
kinesis involved,

00:01:31.504 --> 00:01:36.504
involved in creation of separate cells.

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:41.289
Creation of separate,

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.238
separate cells.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:47.328
In general the,

00:01:47.328 --> 00:01:50.714
your meiosis one has a lot of analogs

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:52.102
with mitosis in general.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:53.689
You could keep looking,

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.236
keep digging deeper and
listing more and more.

00:01:55.236 --> 00:01:56.777
They just want me to describe two events.

00:01:56.777 --> 00:01:59.664
I've already described three.

00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:01.793
Well, I'll leave it at that for now.

00:02:01.793 --> 00:02:03.372
In general, before you take the AP test,

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:06.935
mitosis and meiosis are good
things to know in detail,

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:08.307
because you might see questions like this

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:09.223
on the free answer section,

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:10.384
or they're likely to show up

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:11.793
in the multiple choice section as well.

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:13.844
But I think this is sufficient for part a.

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.184
We've described at least two events

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:17.884
that are common to both
mitosis and meiosis.

00:02:17.884 --> 00:02:18.673
If you have extra time,

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:20.833
you might try to list more.

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.876
And then part b.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.641
The genetic composition of daughter cells

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.404
produced by mitosis differs

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:30.214
from that of the daughter
cells produced by meiosis.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:32.350
Describe two features of
the cell division process

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.463
that lead to these differences.

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:36.181
Well, maybe the most obvious one,

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.591
the biggest difference between them,

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.218
is mitosis,

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:43.276
mitosis involves one division,

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:47.589
involves one division.

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:51.414
Meiosis involves two.

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:55.175
Meiosis involves,

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:57.242
involves, not inolves,

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:01.630
involves, involves two.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.019
This leads to

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.019
two daughter cells

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:15.774
from mitosis,

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:21.548
and four daughter,

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:25.521
daughter cells

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:28.771
from meiosis.

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:31.213
Meiosis.

00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:34.102
That's a pretty big difference

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:35.508
between the two.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:36.275
Another big difference,

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.062
and this is related to this.

00:03:38.062 --> 00:03:39.770
Because,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.730
because meiosis

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.450
has an extra division,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.633
has extra

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:54.169
division,

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.797
but DNA

00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:01.147
replicates once,

00:04:01.147 --> 00:04:03.602
like in, once,

00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:07.823
like in mitosis,

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:11.567
the daughter cells from meiosis

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.819
have half the number of chromosomes.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.838
They have a haploid number of chromosomes.

00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:21.045
The daughter

00:04:21.045 --> 00:04:22.665
cells

00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:26.237
in meiosis

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:30.807
have a haploid

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:33.761
number of chromosomes,

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.305
number of

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.415
chromosomes.

00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:41.237
Chromosomes.

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:42.120
So, and we could say,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.210
mitosis daughters have diploid,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.817
daughters have diploid number.

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:55.553
And these are probably the
two strongest differences.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:56.911
But you could talk about other things.

00:04:56.911 --> 00:04:59.545
You could talk about crossing
over occurring in meiosis

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:01.648
but not in mitosis.

00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:04.364
You could talk about the separation

00:05:04.364 --> 00:05:05.711
and independent sortment

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.679
of homologous chromosomes that you have.

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.349
Homologous, each member
of a homologous pair

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:12.231
that you have in meiosis

00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:13.336
that you don't have in mitosis.

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:15.008
So there's a bunch of
things you could talk about.

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:16.318
And you could go into arbitrary detail.

00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:18.908
It's nice that they only have
to list two in each of these,

00:05:18.908 --> 00:05:22.884
in each of these parts of question four.
