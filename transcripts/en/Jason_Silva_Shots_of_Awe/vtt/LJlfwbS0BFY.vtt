00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300
There's a great line
by Albert Camus.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.870
He says, life should be
lived to the point of tears.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.640
In other words, we should strive
to be moved, to be transported,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.090
to be shaken.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.980
We all want to be
touched by something

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.290
greater than ourselves.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.524
That's a difficult thing to do.

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:43.940
And so I've become
really obsessed

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.500
with the idea of experience
design, which is basically

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.890
hacking experience,
hacking subjectivity.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.100
Now, what is experience?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.170
What is first
person subjectivity?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.910
Well, in a way, it's
that evanescent flux

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.150
of sensation and perception
that is, in a way, all we have

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.870
and all we are.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.170
It's the
multi-dimensional matrix

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890
of first person experience
unfolding moment by moment.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.880
It's the voice in our head that
lets us know that we exist.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.830
So how can we inform, how
can we script that narrative?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.380
How can we be the director of
our own movies, so to speak?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.480
And it turns out that
the trick is attention.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.600
To hack experience, you've
got to hack attention.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.290
In a fantastic article
by Diana Slattery

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.900
says that what is required
is the capture and control

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.970
of attention to create a
state of deep immersion,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.690
of deep absorption.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.940
And this kind of immersion
is the prerequisite

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.840
for any kind of interpersonal
persuasion, transformation,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.620
or education to take place.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.710
In other words, any kind of
phase change in consciousness,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.810
any kind of true inspiration,
transformation, catharsis

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.560
requires this deep
immersion, this state

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.170
of focused attention.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800
And again, that being
the key to experience,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.970
that being the key to scripting
subjectivity, the narrative

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.500
of your own life, and that
seems to be ultimately

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.580
the key to happiness,
the meaning of our lives,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.800
this kind of deconstructing
of our consciousness

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.710
and tweaking our
perceptual apparatus.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.970
To kind of engineer a
kind of neural nirvana,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.284
to trade in real virtualities,
to trade in subjectivities,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:20.700
that is what it
means to be human.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.790
And that is what we are
increasingly becoming masters

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.650
at doing, at distilling, at
creating, and I love that.
