[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:05.110
KYLE THIERMANN:
Hawaii is home to some

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.443
of the most beautiful
and diverse landscapes

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:08.350
in the world.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.540
I first visited Hawaii
when I was a teenager.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.750
The day I arrived, I remember
diving down under water,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.820
opening my eyes,
and being struck

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.790
with the realization that
never before in my life

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.000
had I seen the color of
such deep blue water.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:32.545
I've returned every year since.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.440
But the water surrounding
these islands has a problem,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.970
and it stems from
something we use every day.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.080
How does wastewater
impact human health?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.680
ERICA PEREZ: It can
impact it through skin,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.014
bacterial infections,
gastrointestine infections.

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:00.430
KYLE THIERMANN:
Do you know anyone

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.990
who's been impacted
by that, like,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.847
have gotten staph infections
or anything like that?

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:04.680
ERICA PEREZ: I have.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.320
I have gotten staph
from the water. [LAUGHS]

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.130
And I also know people that
have gotten MRSA and other skin

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.399
infections.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.190
KYLE THIERMANN: Erica
is working to protect

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.960
coral and the
coastal environments

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.860
from one of its biggest
threats, cesspools.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.150
ERICA PEREZ: A
cesspool is essentially

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.800
also known as a dry well.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.400
It's a hole that's in the
ground that is capped,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300
and it's used for residential
wastewater discharge.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.620
So whatever is coming
from your toilet at home

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.890
goes into this underground
hole and is contained there.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.640
KYLE THIERMANN: The
problem with cesspools

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.680
is that there's no
waste treatment.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.190
This means that waste continues
to foster pathogens, bacteria,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.370
and excess nutrients, which can
eventually seep out of the pit

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.320
and contaminate the groundwater.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.110
In places like Puako, which
has a high water table,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.940
the contaminated
ground water easily

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.467
makes its way into the ocean.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.300
ERICA PEREZ: Researchers
from the University

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.710
of Hawaii, Hilo conducted dye
tracer studies here in Puako.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.300
What they did is they placed
dye in toilets of homes

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.110
with cesspools and waited
to see how long it came out

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.180
along the shoreline.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.360
And what they ended up finding
is that, from flush to reef,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.992
it took about six hours to three
days to reach the shoreline.

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:22.450
KYLE THIERMANN: According to
Hawaii's Department of Health,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.000
these cesspools release
approximately 55

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.100
million gallons of
untreated sewage

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.150
into the ground every day.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.420
This means that water
contaminated with disease

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.720
could be making its way
into Hawaii's famed beaches.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.202
So you have to ask, why are
cesspools still being used?

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.910
BRIAN LAMB: People
will give an argument,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.720
our ancestors have been
pooping in holes forever.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.740
Well, they also didn't
have cooking oils.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.080
They didn't have these kind of
processed foods that we're now

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.690
eating that are going
into the ground.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.880
KYLE THIERMANN: Brian Lamb,
a wastewater technician

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.250
on the Big Island,
showed me firsthand

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000
what type of wastewater is
making its way into the ocean.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.270
Not only have cesspools been
on Hawaii for generations,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.150
the cost of installing a
cleaner, individual wastewater

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.490
system can be
prohibitive, especially

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.350
for low-income families.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.060
But the current
systems will continue

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.980
to cause damage to
the reefs, which

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.930
are more than just a
tourist attraction that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.720
bring in $1 million a day.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.470
DANA REED: Coral reefs are one
of the most diverse ecosystems

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.940
that we have on our planet.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.420
They protect us
from wave energy.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.230
If we lose those coral reefs,
we no longer have protection,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.530
and this causes a lot more
coastal erosion and water comes

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.910
up on the island.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.020
The reefs themselves support
a huge amount of life.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.190
Without coral reefs, all
of our fisheries collapse.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.720
Coral reefs are an
incredibly important habitat

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.380
for the planet.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.010
KYLE THIERMANN: But this habitat
is at a fragile turning point.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.170
On a recent dive, I
saw the devastation

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.870
that's occurring to these
reefs, and it seemed to me

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.622
that not enough attention has
been paid to water quality.

00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:12.080
DANA REED: The
Department of Health

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.000
has had one person
on the island of Maui

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.720
who is in charge of coastal
water quality monitoring.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.460
That person recently retired
and has not yet been replaced.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.530
So currently,
we're the only ones

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.904
doing any sort of water
quality testing on Maui.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.570
KYLE THIERMANN: The
government is slowly

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.250
beginning to take
action, by banning

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.500
new cesspool construction
and offering tax

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.750
breaks for certain
properties to transition

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.670
to new wastewater systems.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.100
But that still leaves
tens of thousands

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.931
of cesspools on the islands.

00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:47.430
MICHAEL MONTGOMERY: Hawaii very
recently successfully banned

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.780
new cesspools, but
there's still a question

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.230
of how we're going to address
the legacy of, you know,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.640
the 88,000 cesspools
that are in Hawaii.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.025
And then most
importantly, the 19,000

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:04.000
that are actually near the
coast or near drinking water

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.585
supplies.

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:07.210
ERICA PEREZ: With
the ban on cesspools,

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.850
the Department of Health has
implemented a $10,000 tax

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.740
credit, so it can support
the financial cost

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.960
of transitioning
away from cesspools

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.999
to new, better technologies.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.540
KYLE THIERMANN: It
became clear to me

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.240
that there's no easy
solution in sight.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.360
But ultimately, the government,
along with home and business

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.440
owners will need
to work together

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.570
to find ways to protect humans
and the ocean environmentally,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.590
or the Hawaii that we've come
to know and I've come to love

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.870
might never be the same.

threatening the survival
of Hawaii's coral reefs.
