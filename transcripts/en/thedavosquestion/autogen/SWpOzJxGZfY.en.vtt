my name is jose miguel guzman i am
participating in the council on

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
participating in the council on
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.400
participating in the council on
population growth and this year is very

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410
population growth and this year is very
 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990
population growth and this year is very
important because this year the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
important because this year the
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.120
important because this year the
population will reach the seven billion

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
population will reach the seven billion
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.269
population will reach the seven billion
and that means that there is a lot of

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
and that means that there is a lot of
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.220
and that means that there is a lot of
challenges that the world has in knowing

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
challenges that the world has in knowing
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740
challenges that the world has in knowing
what are the implications of this figure

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
what are the implications of this figure
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660
what are the implications of this figure
and worried implication of the fact that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670
and worried implication of the fact that
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.279
and worried implication of the fact that
most of the population growth in the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
most of the population growth in the
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.870
most of the population growth in the
future will occur in developing

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
future will occur in developing
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.490
future will occur in developing
countries what we can do about that

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500
countries what we can do about that
 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.260
countries what we can do about that
first there are many options but the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
first there are many options but the
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.660
first there are many options but the
most of the the most important option is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
most of the the most important option is
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310
most of the the most important option is
that people have the capacity to take

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
that people have the capacity to take
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.760
that people have the capacity to take
decisions intervale with their lives

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770
decisions intervale with their lives
 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.860
decisions intervale with their lives
particularly to provide women with the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870
particularly to provide women with the
 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.790
particularly to provide women with the
means to decide freely and informed

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
means to decide freely and informed
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
means to decide freely and informed
about the number of children they want

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
about the number of children they want
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.920
about the number of children they want
to have this is the most important

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930
to have this is the most important
 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.260
to have this is the most important
mission and that governments can take is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
mission and that governments can take is
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.060
mission and that governments can take is
giving the people the opportunity to the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
giving the people the opportunity to the
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.939
giving the people the opportunity to the
tape decision by their own that that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
tape decision by their own that that
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.189
tape decision by their own that that
means that there are options but also we

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
means that there are options but also we
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410
means that there are options but also we
need to know about what are the severity

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
need to know about what are the severity
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750
need to know about what are the severity
situation in different countries because

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
situation in different countries because
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640
situation in different countries because
the situation is not the same we have

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
the situation is not the same we have
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920
the situation is not the same we have
countries in which you have a very high

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
countries in which you have a very high
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.620
countries in which you have a very high
fertility and that means that in most of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
fertility and that means that in most of
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.719
fertility and that means that in most of
them in those countries the population

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
them in those countries the population
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.510
them in those countries the population
will be growing very fast and also we

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
will be growing very fast and also we
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249
will be growing very fast and also we
know that if some countries most of the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
know that if some countries most of the
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890
know that if some countries most of the
growth will occur in urban areas so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
growth will occur in urban areas so
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630
growth will occur in urban areas so
there will be many cities in the world

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
there will be many cities in the world
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.179
there will be many cities in the world
particularly in Africa in Asia and will

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
particularly in Africa in Asia and will
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.580
particularly in Africa in Asia and will
be doubling the population in less than

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
be doubling the population in less than
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.810
be doubling the population in less than
25 years so that mean that the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820
25 years so that mean that the
 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.100
25 years so that mean that the
government's national governments and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
government's national governments and
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560
government's national governments and
local governments need to plan for that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
local governments need to plan for that
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.079
local governments need to plan for that
growth
