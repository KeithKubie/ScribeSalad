00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.910
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.200
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:10.370
It's Bill Burr and It's time for another tour of cities that I haven't done in

4
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:15.350
fucking years. Um, I don't even know what I'm driving right now.

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.140
This is one of the worst fucking cuts. Look into the back of this car. This,

6
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:22.670
there's no backup camera. I can't see shit, but a little side window there.

7
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.980
I'm almost almost took out this guy on a bike and he fucking freaked out on me

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.630
because what the fuck are you doing? I want to be like, well,

9
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.390
I'm doing what you would be doing if you're in the car. You know,

10
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:37.340
I'm not paying attention. I'm in a fucking car. So anyways, I'm in Phoenix,

11
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.600
Arizona. Uh, we're gonna slip this scared sports town here. All right.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.510
I was screaming like, sorry, you gotta if you got a sports town here,

13
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.700
this is one of the worst names for an arena I've seen in awhile.

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.610
Talking stick resort arena.

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.360
We'll go down to the talking sticks. Fucking resort arena. Nothing.

16
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.600
I was like, you're going to get like a massage or something.

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.460
Get a parking garage. They are up here. You got your chase field.

18
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.720
It's where the, uh, I want to say devil rays, but it's the diamond backs.

19
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.010
This is, you know what I like about that place? Whenever I drive by them,

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.560
that's where they beat the Yankees. And now 2001 when even I as a red sox fan,

21
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.900
cause it was right after nine 11, I was like, alright, fuck it.

22
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:24.260
I'll root for this. I'll root for them. You know, it's good for the city.

23
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.290
And uh, then they lost.

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.340
So first good feeling I had that post nine 11, watching them loose.

25
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570
This is this weird thing about this city of yours. What's the second one?

26
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.920
Like you leave the downtown area.

27
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.530
It just immediately becomes like road runner [inaudible] Shit.

28
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
Should I head back towards the downtown area? Well,

29
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.460
you don't have to pick out here. Dog's getting out. Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.930
That guy's base is so fucking,

31
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.770
it's big out here is other than really loud bass in the truck behind says

32
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:05.750
literally making my ears itch. Um,

33
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.060
I don't even, I can't even do this part of the video.

34
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.040
It was funny about that is it's shaken his whole car and he's just like,

35
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:18.640
just fucking up his suspension. All of it is just, just gradually coming loose.

36
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.910
It's like he's driving over a pothole when he's sitting still.

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
Why would you have it that loud dude?

38
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.020
I gotta fucking six sound system.

39
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.210
Not even a bass player would have the bass that louder. You know,

40
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.800
here the other instruments, is there anything worse than a Bass Solo

41
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.800
did? You can't fucking hear it.

42
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.910
I remember Billy Sheehan would always fucking have to Steve Vine and David Lee

43
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.270
rock. Steve Vine would be, Whoa, dude, all this fucking shit.

44
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.080
And then he come up and basically do the same thing. It was just like,

45
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.590
what do you like? What the fuck? Anyway,

46
00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:08.150
she wants a big thing out here is a little dogs going missing.

47
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.900
Can't leave the gate open out here. It's just too many. You know,

48
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.310
it's too many coyotes, snakes. I don't know what the fuck gets him out here.

49
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.490
Pedophiles to do. There's always a sexual Predator on the desert. Right.

50
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.250
I think this is the number one place that sexual Predator is after they get out

51
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:26.640
of jail. You know, this is where they,

52
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.390
they usually settle down in the downtown Phoenix area. You know,

53
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.390
just like looking at all the sweaty kids. I don't know why I'm saying that.

54
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.343
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.303
<v 0>Um,</v>

56
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.250
<v 1>[inaudible] Haley, a country song about a guy he was, Steve was take,</v>

57
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.170
we sing on him and his dad flying at 15th and

58
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.630
[inaudible] pains. It's like, no you didn't. No you didn't.

59
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.460
They would never let that accent into, that's fucking billion dollar aircraft.

60
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.990
Whatever it costs. You know? Remember top gun.

61
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.790
Nobody had a southern accent and that did that.

62
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.740
What was chipping Dale's looking guys,

63
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.100
they all had like the Midwest accent in there.

64
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.620
Know what's funny is I actually liked this place with this. Just nothing. Like,

65
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.100
Oh my God, Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.133
<v 0>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.370
<v 1>That's just a whole other level. All right. Don't, don't, don't,</v>

68
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:42.080
don't show his head. My gun dude, he was dressed like a toddler.

69
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.230
He basically had on a onesy.

70
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.260
All right, now we're getting no real Phoenix. I showed you the nice area.

71
00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:56.180
Here we go. I think I saw that. No country for old men that's been dumped.

72
00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:58.760
McDonald's, they don't even have a playground. I had this here.

73
00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:02.390
This is the [inaudible] America that Trump connected with, right?

74
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.293
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

75
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.413
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

76
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.713
<v 0>Literally a hormone.</v>

77
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.020
<v 1>Alright, there's a guy sitting in the back of the pickup truck.</v>

78
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.980
I mean this is like this guy's lit up with Chit and Hobo

79
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.070
back in the days you ride in box cars, but I guess trains don't exist anymore.

80
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.060
I love what you're afraid of. You won't even, it keeps catching us.

81
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.120
You got to know if you're sitting in the back of that ladies drinking out of his

82
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.890
jug, you looking at a guy, that guy has no social security number.

83
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.580
See that everybody perfectly good white guy. Look what happened.

84
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:47.320
You make the wrong decisions in life.

85
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.650
You know you end up in the back of a pickup truck and Phoenix, Arizona,

86
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.790
just hanging on for dear life fucking guy with a metal detector.

87
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.450
It was a weed whacker. Oh, I thought was a metal detector.

88
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.630
Lone Max cash loans on car titles. Jesus Christ.

89
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.330
How does that even work to come down? You can have your title in your car.

90
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.310
I'm going to take my title in there in exchange for cash and then I'm going to

91
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.780
go to the track. That's what I'm going to do. There you go. Horizontal strikes,

92
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.180
horizontal stripes. He likened his body something about being broken. This,

93
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.120
this type of heat. It just fucking beats the shit out of here.

94
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.050
There is a one call in this area that does not look to stolen.

95
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.210
Oh here we go. We're breaking out of urban sprawl.

96
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.290
Here's the landfill. This is the end of, this is the end of this shit.

97
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.660
All right, here we go. Uplifting.

98
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.790
Look at this poor bastard walking to work cause he brought his title down cause

99
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.800
you went to the track. Little river bed here. Some plenty's too and shit.

100
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:55.570
Right? Pale rider. Why would you advertise Brooklyn bedding here?

101
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.540
People are fucking sleeping on the ground.

102
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.390
Maybe it's for the all the people like me driving through it, right?

103
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.580
All of us privilege people. You guys like that? I wore a sweater.

104
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.930
This is my new thing to keep myself calm at. Wear sweaters were dead jeans,

105
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.630
you know, pair of Shell toes for a little flair.

106
00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.520
And this is a Duke blue devil hat. You know, I know some of you are to be like,

107
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:23.930
when the fuck did you become a Finn?

108
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.440
Yeah know about three weeks ago when I went to a game, it was phenomenal.

109
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.280
Look at that right there.

110
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.030
That's something Richard wrongs would buy on gas monkey garage.

111
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:36.120
Like he walked up to that and he always has the other guy talk first and you

112
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:40.650
know, just to be like, so what do you thinking? I got mad.

113
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.150
I don't know why. I was thinking like tech grant, which Ah,

114
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.020
I can't, I, I can't do 10 grantees. And the guy's like, well what do you,

115
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:53.940
what are you thinking? I mean, I was thinking like four,

116
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.340
it's where they grow other weed. Is Weed legal in Arizona?

117
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.890
There's no way it's legal. There's no, they don't even celebrate.

118
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.260
They don't even celebrate Martin Luther King Gay.

119
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:12.220
There's no way they let you smoke a joint. Pawn shops are so fucking overrated.

120
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.140
Punk shops are so overrated. When you watch, what's that? What's it at?

121
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.130
Poncho pawn stars. Onstar? Yeah. When you watch pawn star,

122
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.900
you think you're going to go in there and there's going to be like a Superbowl

123
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.690
ring, like a Indian motorcycle and you get in there. It's just,

124
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:33.020
it's like a Casio keyboard. Somebody old apron.

125
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.530
It's like were resolved the good shit.

126
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.540
Cars. Twos, silver. What does it say? Cold guns.

127
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.680
Why gold guns? Gold. Gold guns.

128
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.330
Gold space guns. Oh, okay. Okay. Roger Martin was,

129
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:57.180
they had a rough weekend. Like, I believe that's a hospital.

130
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.560
If you get sick, I guess you go over there, you know as you do,

131
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.750
it's the fucking worst. There's no way.

132
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.560
When I get older there's no way I'm going. I'm not done.

133
00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.910
I'm not dipping in the hospital. I'm like fuck it. Dying in there.

134
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.870
Listen to the respirator. The person next to me with that smell.

135
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.100
I hate hospitals. You know, I got,

136
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.040
and you know I got my affairs in order and one of them is just like,

137
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.890
you know when I'm in a bad way, pull the fucking plug.

138
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.970
I'm not going to be laying there like in that Metallica video cause everybody's

139
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:31.080
fucking talking around me. I didn't, I think I saw him move his toe.

140
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.370
Can you hear my voice in there and I'm just thinking on a loop.

141
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.250
All they'd kill me. Kill me. Kill me. I don't care if I'm going to help.

142
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.040
Let's just get it. Let's just get on, but then I'm ready to meet the devil.

143
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:43.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

144
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.320
<v 1>Well it could be worse than just laying there in your fucking head.</v>

145
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.160
You know? Right as you feel yourself dying. Oh good. I feel myself.

146
00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:54.200
I'm starting to die and that you just feel it.

147
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.850
Injecting nutrition into your arm.

148
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.900
Can you cry when you were in a coma?

149
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.090
<v 0>Good. That happened. I don't know.</v>

150
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.410
<v 1>I wonder if that's a good taco. Hey,</v>

151
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:10.290
let's find a good place to get something to eat this best.

152
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.560
You want to get a Taco? I don't know about this place. Inventive burritos.

153
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.790
Inventive burrito means a white guy's making

154
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.300
Mexican infused.

155
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.440
What do they have against cutting the grass out in these fucking desert places?

156
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.040
Church's chicken, KFC, auto zone. Big Gun parliament.

157
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:37.400
It's the same fucking 12 stores. Do you know what he does about broke areas

158
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.960
in the south west versus the east coast is at least like the land is lush back

159
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:48.860
on the east coast. Like this shit just looks so fucking dead.

160
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.540
It's like tumbleweeds and stuff. It just looks extra broken.

161
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.670
My Dad's still fucking half 15 so yet you still have your cowboy hat on.

162
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.410
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.500
<v 1>this is like a thing. If you fly like at 50 Joseph, they'd be like good looking.</v>

164
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.423
You know what I mean?

165
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.290
You can't come in there with that fucking country bumpkin bullshit.

166
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.570
You got to lose that accent. Get yourself a little high and tight haircut.

167
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:27.340
Go in there with your fucking cowboy boots. You don't have to do this.

168
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.320
Those fucking loaded ticks after all those years are riding bulls and shooting

169
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:34.400
wild boar or they put them on that little fucking was that ride the centrifuge,

170
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.170
Turkish twist, whatever they put them at, will you face starts doing this shit?

171
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:41.050
You know, they just said they gone, whew.

172
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.240
It's gonna take a lot more, a lot more than that. You know,

173
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.520
going around in a circle of scare redneck. You know what I mean?

174
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.490
They put dynamite and old lawnmowers blowing their legs off.

175
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.400
You seen that video? Blew my leg off.

176
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.160
This guy blows his leg off and that's what he says. I blew my leg off.

177
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.920
That's it. Where's the screaming? Oh Yeah, God, I lights.

178
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.370
I'm going to get your belt and you just blew my leg off.

179
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.000
Probably called his mom. Mom,

180
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.340
mom's me. I blew my leg off.

181
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:23.340
Nah, I'm not going to be home.

182
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.250
Let's try to think of a good cowboy. Name's Jesse. I blew my leg off.

183
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.850
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

184
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.710
<v 1>Jesse won't be here today. He blew his leg off shooting in an old tractor.</v>

185
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.860
That's what this guy did. He had an old fucking tractor.

186
00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:47.210
He filled it up with this explosive and there's some sort of like, you know,

187
00:12:47.211 --> 00:12:49.550
ratio for whatever pounds of explosives,

188
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.480
the amount of feet you have to be away from it. And he didn't do that. You know,

189
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.930
like when you put together something, you just throw the directions out.

190
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.350
He did that with like fucking dynamite and he stuck in an old mom.

191
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.250
No riding mower, just that blade alone, if that came flying out,

192
00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:08.030
you would take your fucking head off and he stand it. You know,

193
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.890
like he already shot something and now he's just going for the kill shot.

194
00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:16.400
Just walked right up to it, shoots the thing.

195
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.910
Your camera goes like that and he falls down. He just goes, I blew my leg off.

196
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:25.680
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

197
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.630
<v 1>you got to tell that story for the rest of your fucking life.</v>

198
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.870
How'd you lose your leg? We in Fallujah. Nah,

199
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.690
I put a bunch of dynamite, an old tractor and I uh, was Bob

200
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.940
Seven, eight feet away from it and I started shooting at it

201
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.780
and you know, it blew up and it did, took my leg with it.

202
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.110
Was it painful? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Who you screaming now?

203
00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:00.220
What'd you do? I just stated the obvious gloom leg.

204
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.480
It's like an endless character. You want to come in your mouth? No,

205
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:14.700
he'd say it after Kevin. Your mouth. Oh,

206
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.460
there's a fucking hotel. We did it. It was perfect.

207
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.490
This really isn't a tour as much as I'm telling stories cause there's nothing to

208
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:25.324
see here.

209
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.980
This is one of these areas where they just put a bunch of shops and they try to

210
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:31.600
get human beings to sort of gather.

211
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.970
We'll put an urban outfitter as an anchor store. Then we'll have a chipotle.

212
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.500
What else do people like to do? I Dunno, man.

213
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.030
I've just always been a truth teller. If there's just truth laying on the table,

214
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:50.800
I just gotta say it. The balls stuck to my leg.

215
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.840
Can I start with the salad? The overshare guy.

216
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.140
[inaudible] I don't even know what it is. Chipotle lay. There you go.

217
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.943
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.880
<v 1>that's all good jogging that fat people do. They run.</v>

219
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.540
They try to make a light to go into chipotle and I'm kidding.

220
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.440
They would go to cvs.

221
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.410
Oh, Bill with the low house. Stand up. Look at stand up live comedy theater.

222
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.700
From what I heard, it's one of the biggest comedy clubs,

223
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.310
one of the biggest comedy clubs in North America.

224
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.040
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

225
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.170
<v 1>as far as, he's fucking hilarious.</v>

226
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.820
This shit he gets amped up about, dude. You know what I like?

227
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.710
Do you want to like, I like mustard.

228
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.610
Is there anything better than mustard on a sandwich? May. It just, it's crazy.

229
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.370
It's great. Who did really like is the listener. It's like,

230
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.130
where do I take that conversation? What'd she, Paul,

231
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.090
what do you think about man, don't like it. Not a mayonnaise guy.

232
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.670
It's a sandwich.
