00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.540
One of the most interesting ideas in Philosophy lies in [the] little masterpiece called the symposium written by the Philosopher plato

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.819
in ancient Greece in

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.750
385 Bc

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.549
The symposium tells the story of a dinner party that unfolded in athens at the home of a distinguished playwright called agathon

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.070
Many interesting characters Gathered to share food and drink and talk about important things

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.750
[they're] lying on couches sharing excellent roasted food and vegetables

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.989
And there's good wine too at the start of the dinner party

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.090
[the] host announces that he wants each of his guests to make a speech on what they think love or

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Arrows as they called it is

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.110
Plato reserves the best and most interesting theory for his hero socrates who advances an iDea that becomes known as the door of love?

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.489
after everyone has spoken and some are quite drunk [-]

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.219
socrates tells us that

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.689
Most of us start to learn about love in a very immediate and physical way

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.948
By being powerfully attracted to one particular person's face and body

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.430
This is what we now call romantic sexual love

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.119
However [socrates] is keen not to say that this is what love is or aims at in its essence

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.229
This kind of bodily infatuation is just the starting point the first step in his famous ladder of love

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.959
For socrates the love of one beautiful person isn't and should never be the whole story

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.359
it's an invitation to step on a ladder that if we follow up when some with

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.739
Thoughtfulness and dignity will lead us to an appreciation of bigger things like wisdom truth morality and goodness

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.039
What's interesting is [that] plato doesn't want to censor our interest in lust or sex?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.119
He doesn't [think] it evil or degenerate he accepts it

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.739
But sees as a starting point however plato doesn't want us to stay stuck on that run he invites us on a journey

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.879
So we start with the love of one specific beautiful person?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.729
And then we move on past that one-off case to a love of the beauty of people in general

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.598
And then we move up yet another run from a physical to an intellectual beauty the kind of beauty you might find in a work

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.359
Philosophy or the laws of a city when you've become skilled at perceiving this sort of beauty

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.479
You're abled for example to appreciate the appeal of a beautiful mind even in an ugly body

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.459
Eventually the true student of love is able to love what plato calls

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.869
The Former Beauty itself which is synonymous with wisdom and goodness

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.699
This all helps to explain why sometimes the sight of beautiful person might move us for plato

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.019
This is because we [ensure] in them something beyond their appearance

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.839
We sense that there's a ladder that we've been invited to step on that will eventually lead us to wisdom

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.509
Plato's argument does two things [it]

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:04.119
[crosses] the idea that an interest in beauty is shallow. It's the starting point to something deep also it frees us [to] believe that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.099
beauty exists Beyond one person it exists in unexpected places

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.839
The beauty of the mind is linked but superior to that of the body you might start lusting after a beautiful body

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.659
But the argument goes the idea is that you may end up with a love of philosophy and truth

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780
you
