[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.930
JI: It's really--

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm very happy to be here today.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.660
Thanks for having me.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.790
I don't know what
you guys envision

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.010
today's going to be like.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.195
I was looking
around and it said I

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.570
will talk about the behind
the scenes of being a pianist.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.280
It's too complex to just call it
behind the scenes of a pianist.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480
So I'll talk about
the complexity of it,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.050
I guess, and how each
pianist or musician has,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.880
obviously, like you and I have
different experiences in life.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.230
So today, what I'm
here to talk about is--

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.740
I want to sort of
reassure, or just

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.350
tell everybody flat out
that times may be tough.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.140
The world may be not
so great right now.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.220
We have amazing things that
have happened technologically,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.250
but then as a result
of that, there

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.990
may be some things
that may lack--

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.150
humanity and
compassion and empathy.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.310
And I wanted to talk about these
subjects from my vantage point

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.919
and from my experiences of
being in the classical music

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.710
industry, being a
musician and a performing

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.120
artist since the age of 10.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.290
And so just a
little background--

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.790
I was signed to a very
commercial artist management

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.925
company called IMG Artists.

00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:44.090
You guys know IMG
Models, IMG Sports.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.560
I was the youngest
one to ever be signed.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.480
And when I was 10, I started
traveling three to four times

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.680
a month playing
concerts, making money,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.710
and dealing with grown-ups.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.340
But it all kind of started
because I was very talented.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.050
I was, quote unquote, "a
prodigy," as they say.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.014
And I just had an innate
joy and passion to perform.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.320
And through navigating my
career when I was little,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.000
I got to come in contact with so
many different types of people,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.860
people from all over
the states of America--

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.010
the South, the Midwest,
Northeast, you name it--

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.500
and then Europe, and then Asia.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.990
And so from a very
young age, I got

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.030
to experience firsthand
different types

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.900
of personalities, different
types of cultures,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.940
different types of perception of
life and perception of society.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.390
And when you're 10 or 11,
you can't really distinguish,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.420
oh, this person is this or
this person is that, right?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.250
You kind of take it
all in from the basis

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.620
of how they interact with you.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.070
And I'm pretty sure no
matter where you go,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.960
people are going to be nice
to a 10-year-old, right?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.020
They're not going to put
the same sort of pressure

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.720
or the same sort
of-- even if I was,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.700
quote unquote, "a
professional," everybody

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.760
was really kind towards me.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.800
And now in my late 20s, I think
about all the little things

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.680
that we are concerned about
when it comes to social conduct

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.030
and stuff like that.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.550
I never really experienced
that when I was little.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.010
And so I say that's sort of
like a double-edged sword,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.310
because maybe I am a little
bit out of touch with reality

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.854
in terms of how you grew up--

00:03:58.854 --> 00:04:00.270
going through the
regular schools,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.162
and then going into the
job force at a certain age,

00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:04.620
and growing up with
your peers that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.130
are the same age as you
that receive information

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.690
at the same rate as you.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.256
I might not have
received information

00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:12.630
at the same rate
as you, but I've

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.420
experienced things a little
bit different than you.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.149
So I think I can be here today
to talk about my experiences

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:29.310
and tell you that, or remind you
that we can do things every day

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:38.880
in our day-to-day things to make
this world a little bit more

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.370
filled with
understanding people.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.620
ALEX HK CHUNG: So Ji, please
tell us a little bit more

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.620
to better orient the audience.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.160
How has the piano
playing inspired you,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.630
and what kept you
going in that regard?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.380
JI: So I want to
start off by saying

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.970
when I was about 18 years
old, I had to leave the stage.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.730
I had to sort of quit playing
music for a little while.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:19.120
And at that moment, I quit with
no intention of coming back.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.900
But I did that because I
realized at a very young age

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.610
that I love music, but I
also love having a purpose

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.940
and I also love people.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.700
And as you probably know,
classical music is not

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.650
the most mainstream, you know?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.020
The first thing that
doesn't comes to your mind

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.430
when you think of
classical music

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.030
is, oh, I want to go
and have an experience.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.890
It'll be a life-changing
experience for me.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.850
That's not the first
thing you think of, right?

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.480
Like, if I were to go to,
say, a Beyonce concert,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.590
I know I'm in for a treat.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.070
I know I'm going to walk
out of that stadium feeling

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.420
like my brain has just been
like [EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECT]..

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.510
But you don't have
that same anticipation

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.560
with classical music.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.840
You go because probably, A,
if you like classical music,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.050
you go because you
like the performer.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.890
B, you go maybe because it's
sort of the high-society

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.810
cultural thing.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.890
And we're all guilty of this.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:29.996
We like those things.

00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:32.620
Those are the social constructs
that we have set for ourselves,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.910
so of course we're going to
do things that follow that.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.590
And so that's one of them.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.780
And that probably gives way
to the sort of dwindling

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.510
of the industry, per se.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.540
But going back to my point,
I just lost the reason--

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.800
if I was going to do this--

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.970
I was 18 years old.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.960
And normal kids when
they're 18, they're

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.751
like, oh, what college
am I going to go to?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.560
Do I even have a major
that I want to study?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.170
But for me-- in hindsight
it was not such a big deal.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.160
But when I was 18 I
felt like, oh my god,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.680
this is what I have to do
for the rest of my life.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.760
I'm not enjoying this.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.350
I'm not having any fun.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.290
I feel like I'm going on stage
and being like a circus act,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.280
because all these
people come and watch

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.280
me play because I'm, quote
unquote, "a prodigy,"

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.520
and they just want
to be impressed.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.610
But I thought to myself,
this is not why I love music.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.120
I love performing,
but I didn't do it

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.180
so that I could fit
some sort of format

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.400
that we have already
created in the industry.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.670
I felt that as I got
older, I had something more

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.970
to say with the music.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.140
And because of the things
that were happening

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.490
around me socially,
it obviously inspires

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.390
and feeds into the way
I listen and perceive

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.360
and translate music.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.240
But as with most industries,
we scream for change

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.290
but we're very reluctant
for change, right?

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.100
And so that was
exactly the case.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.440
And so that's why I left.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.220
But when I left, I left with
a sort of disdain and disgust

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.390
for it, because I didn't
feel that sort of passion

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.580
in what music did to me
when I was younger anymore.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.440
But I quit for two years.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.344
I did a lot of different things.

00:08:29.344 --> 00:08:31.010
One of the things I
made sure that I did

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.360
was to collaborate with
other genres of art--

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.159
visual art, more what we are--

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.150
as modern-day teenagers--
are all in tune with.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.460
And I was just
trying to figure out

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.050
a way to tell beautiful
stories in more ways

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.300
than one, because
I believed and I

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.130
was hopeful in the
power of numbers.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:03.080
And so eventually, everything
kind of led me back to music.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.770
And it gave me a
whole new perception

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.230
on how I understand this
music and how I want

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.360
to convey it to the people.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.739
And for so long, I had been
beaten over the head with,

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.280
this is how you're
supposed to do it.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.060
This is the format-- like, blah,
blah, blah, whatever it is.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.740
But I think-- for so long,
I didn't pay attention

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.590
to my own voice.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.710
You know?

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:44.430
And when I was like
23, 24, I started

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.440
searching for that voice again.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.770
I started searching for
how I felt when I listened

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.230
to music when I was seven.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.760
I started searching
for, there must be--

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.270
I came back to this
because I realized

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.720
classical music has
so much emotions

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.380
in one sitting, so many
emotions that we can cover.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.620
And it was so shocking
to me that I could so

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.640
easily understand and
relate to a piece of music

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.900
that was written by
Bach 300 years ago,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.880
and that I could play that
piece of music on stage

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.430
and you will feel what I felt.
To me, that's really cool.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.130
I mean, I don't think
any science can really

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:38.640
explain that sort of lineage
or that sort of streamline

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.220
of human emotions that get
carried through and passed on

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.050
over hundreds of years.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.680
So that was really
fascinating to me.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.530
And then I dug a
little deeper and then

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:58.710
I asked myself, if
I can sit you down

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.560
and you could feel
all these things

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.540
and it could be like
a therapy session

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.120
almost, if you will,
because you feel everything

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.400
and it kind of lets
everything out,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.720
why don't people want
to listen to this more?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.970
And so that began
my sort of research

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:22.590
on, why do we have this sort
of compartmentalized notion

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.570
of what classical music is?

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.780
And a lot of people say,
oh, that's what we like.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.190
I mean, some people just
don't like classical music.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.860
Some people just
don't like pop music.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.440
I understand that
and I respect that.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.110
But perhaps you haven't been
looking for the right thing.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.290
You haven't been privy
to the right things

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.060
to understand why I
make you feel that way.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.510
And maybe if you were a little
bit more curious about why

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.150
you felt the way you felt when
I played the piece that way,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:01.080
then maybe it could
lead into trying

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.170
to understand from a very
different lens, right?

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.960
And so the next point
I want to make--

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.680
and I want to show a couple
of different examples--

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.190
is I want to kind of
stay away from the music

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.760
for a little while and
talk about everyday things.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.220
And so I have a story--

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.280
I was here in February
for about a month,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.640
and then I went
back to the States.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.650
And I was in an elevator
and I was mid-phone call.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.890
But I got into the elevator.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.050
And most elevators in New York
City are complete dead zones,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.130
and so you lose
service completely.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.196
But here, everything works.

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:43.520
Cellphones work
everywhere, right?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.270
And so I had just
gotten so accustomed

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.230
to just being on
the phone, and so I

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.620
didn't think twice about it.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.530
And when I was in the
elevator-- and it was

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.150
like a corporate building, too.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:13:00.930
And New York is pretty densely
populated with liberal people--

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.540
people that want
equality, people

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.427
that think those are good
things to society, right?

00:13:08.427 --> 00:13:11.010
But I was in the elevator and I
was like, hello, hello, hello?

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.510
And then these three people were
like, you're in an elevator.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.830
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.327
And I got really flushed.

00:13:21.327 --> 00:13:23.160
And then I went home
and I thought about it,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.560
and it bothered me a little bit.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.670
Because I wasn't trying to be
a douchebag in the elevator

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.607
and say, oh, I can't--

00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:33.190
there are people
like that, of course.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.898
But that was not what
I was trying to do.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.142
And then I was like, maybe
it's because I had just

00:13:43.142 --> 00:13:45.600
been so accustomed to just
being on the phone all the time,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.870
and had I been in New York
this whole entire time maybe

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.450
I'd have been more aware of
that and I would have shut

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.220
my phone off or something or
told the other person that I

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.386
was going into the elevator.

00:13:54.386 --> 00:14:00.960
But for people who say that they
want equality and are liberal

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.230
and support all these
things, and then

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.640
on a very plain,
simple, everyday thing

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.690
like talking on the
phone in the elevator,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.310
they give you a dirty look
and they make a comment.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:24.242
If they had just thought,
oh, why is he doing that?

00:14:24.242 --> 00:14:25.950
It could be a number
of different things.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.470
I could have been the douchebag.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.180
I could have been
somebody who had

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.160
some sort of mental
disability and didn't

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
know social etiquette.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.454
Or I could have just been me.

00:14:40.454 --> 00:14:42.120
But instead of throwing
that dirty look,

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.750
they could have thought twice,
or maybe a second longer--

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.930
or even the fact that like,
oh, maybe he's not white.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.650
He's Asian.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.870
Maybe phones work in elevators
in Asia, which they do.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:04.050
But I think we as human race
now in modern-day society,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.610
we kind of fall short at
the length at which we will

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.330
go to understand other people.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.860
And you could blame
that on social media.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.960
ALEX HK CHUNG: How
has that experience

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.490
transformed into your
expressiveness, into piano?

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.160
Or was that concert
music that you wanted--

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.660
JI: Of course.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.502
Like, I get bottled up and
I get really frustrated,

00:15:30.502 --> 00:15:31.960
and then it just
kind of pours out.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.960
And I want to figure out--

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.490
everybody wants to tie in what
they do, and to mean something,

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:39.990
right?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.490
I mean, I'm sure
you all do what you

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.340
do because you wanted to be
a part of a greater meaning

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.380
and purpose in life.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.320
And that's exactly what I do.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.410
And I want to encourage
and urge everybody

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:58.860
to just go that extra step
to maybe think about why,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.980
and give everybody the
benefit of the doubt

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.430
and see that there is a
reason for everything.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.150
If a douchebag was on the
phone, then you don't say that.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.940
You say, oh, well,
maybe he needs

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.800
to be led a different way.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.419
He needs to be shown
a different path.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:19.710
There's ways you could do this.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.290
I mean, we do this with puppies.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.820
If you get a new puppy
and they do an accident,

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.790
we don't scold them.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.706
We don't yell at them.

00:16:27.706 --> 00:16:28.660
We don't hit them.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.760
We put them where
they need to go.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.080
No matter how many times it
takes them to get it right,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.190
we do it.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.540
Right?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:41.100
I think the amount
of responsibilities

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.960
that we take on ourselves
for our pets should

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.330
be the same for humans--

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.660
and not just your immediate
relatives and your friends,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.130
but everybody.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.510
We are all responsible
for one another.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:01.740
And I'm sure everybody in this
room want this kind of life

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.300
where we all understand, right?

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.150
But I'm very guilty of this.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.920
I'm talking right
now because I want

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.890
to remind myself to be a better
person, because I did something

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.932
today earlier on that
counteracts exactly what I'm

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:14.640
saying right now.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.400
ALEX HK CHUNG: So how has
your experience like these

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.609
transferred to your, I
guess, concert pianist?

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:27.420
As a performer, as a musician,
how has the experience

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.379
changed or inspired you
to connect the dots,

00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:33.420
to think a little bit more
about different people

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.310
or to understand
a little bit more?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.670
How has this quest led to
where you are right now?

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.240
JI: So being a
classical musician

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.990
means being a sort of messenger,
messenger of music that has

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.500
been written a long time ago.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.020
It all depends on
the interpretation.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.120
But at the core of it is a human
being that wrote this music.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.400
And this human being was
probably writing this music

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.180
because he was inspired by his
surroundings, his emotions,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.175
and all these things.

00:18:04.175 --> 00:18:06.070
So it's not just
a piece of music.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.430
It's someone's soul, right?

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.310
And I'm going to give you an
example of this one piece.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:17.880
So this is a piece, a song
written by Robert Schumann.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.400
He was a composer
in the 19th century.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.580
So he wrote this song,
and it's called Widmung.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.300
And it translates to Dedication.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.440
And he wrote this
song to his wife.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.850
And that's the
gist of the story.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.450
It's a love, romantic story.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.570
And so I am living in 2018.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.030
I look at this piece of
music for the first time

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.710
and I see a couple
of things, right?

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.780
I see some German on top.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.040
What does that mean?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.640
Sincere and lively, right?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.840
What do I take from that?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.500
I don't know.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.900
Let's leave it.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.490
Sincere but lively,
like happily sincere?

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.032
I'm confused.

00:18:56.032 --> 00:18:56.990
Can you press it again?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.920
Thank you.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.280
I have the time, the
meter, which is 3:2.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.860
And some of you know
music, some of you may not.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.510
But that basically means--

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.730
can you press?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.840
That there are three--

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.650
one more time.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.110
Three beats in one
measure, and a measure

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.650
is what those lines
are, the black lines.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.100
Can you press one more time?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.560
And then we have in this
case-- and not in every case,

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.900
but because this is
a song transcription,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.640
we have the lyric on top.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.650
And that's the
English translation.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.860
And just one more time.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.190
But I want to pay
attention to this.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.230
So this is in the
very opening bar.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.794
And it goes--

00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:40.758
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.260
And it's throughout
the whole entire piece.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.810
Robert Schumann was-- and
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:00.400
but most musicians I know
are not very extroverted.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.430
They're not very confident
people socially, you know?

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.650
Disclaimer.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.490
They're not.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.452
And so if it was
a confident person

00:20:14.452 --> 00:20:15.910
and he was super
leisurely and they

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.451
wanted to express their love,
maybe it would have been like--

00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:25.490
[PLAYING CONFIDENTLY]
But since he is--

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.690
he's nervous.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.850
He doesn't know what
she is going to say.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.023
So he's like
second-guessing himself.

00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:33.981
[PLAYING TIMIDLY]

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.376
And all throughout.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.730
It just-- he keeps
going and pulling back,

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.470
keeps going and pulling back.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.620
But that's love, right?

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.250
That's a relationship
to this day, right?

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.977
You're not always
so comfortable.

00:21:02.977 --> 00:21:04.435
You always need to
be on your toes.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.110
This song was written
more than 200 years ago.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.690
Still, the same
shit happens today.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.176
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.230
Yeah, so.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.630
I'm going to play this later
so you hear the whole thing.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.010
But can you press another one?

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.900
OK, so another point that I want
to make that I learned through

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:34.330
my daily self-deprecating
routines of practicing--

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.570
and I practice about, on a good
day, six to seven hours a day.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.090
And it's just-- it's not pretty.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.130
It's loud and it's annoying,
and you don't want to sit there.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.790
It's not, oh, you're
going to practice.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.623
I'm going to listen to
some beautiful music.

00:21:46.623 --> 00:21:48.580
Never.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.530
And I'll show you why.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.000
But this is a passage from
Beethoven's Piano Sonata Number

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.990
23.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.700
It's in the third movement.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.320
And this particular passage
is technically challenging.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.450
And so we as musicians,
or instrumentalists,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.290
spend hours and hours to
perfect the technique.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.250
So the technique and
musicality and emotion

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.110
are not two separate things.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.820
You need the technique in
order to convey the emotions.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.770
If you don't have
the technique--

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:28.120
and we live in a society where
the standard is so high--

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.750
then the emotions which
are even there won't even

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.810
get across poignantly or at
all, because to some ear,

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:40.440
if they can't play
it right then they

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.510
just completely
negate any sort of--

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.390
so our job is to make sure
that everything is solid

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.950
and there so that we
can highlight or put

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.440
a spotlight on what
needs to be expressed.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.670
So we do these
ridiculous exercises.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.980
Can you press one?

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.480
Thank you.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.340
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:09.940
is I'm going to put emphasis on
the first beat, the first note

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.500
of every beat.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.900
So I'm going to
just do two bars.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.425
And so it sounds
something like this.

00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:19.335
[PLAYING DRAMATICALLY]

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.460
And can you hit it again?

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.430
Now I'm going to do--

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.346
[PLAYING IN ANOTHER STYLE]

00:23:30.262 --> 00:23:32.320
Can you hit it again?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.420
That's on the third beat.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.120
[PLAYING IN ANOTHER STYLE]

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.840
And so on and so forth.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.070
In doing this--

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:44.280
I mean, so many
musicians do this kind

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.710
of regimented practicing,
and this exact type

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:49.350
of practicing in
order to get a passage

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.450
like this solid and steady.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.530
And I was thinking about this.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.940
Why do we do this?

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.500
And I was thinking
about my fingers.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.320
If you look at your
fingers, try doing this.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.220
Try holding this
and trying to play

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.410
your fourth finger,
your ring finger

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.390
without lifting
any other finger.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.290
That's weird, right?

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.091
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.450
Your fourth finger is so weak.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.140
But each finger has
its own characteristic.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.870
Each finger has its own
strengths and weaknesses.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.380
I thought about this in
a societal point of view.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.940
What if these five fingers
were different people?

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.220
In order to have complete
harmony and unison

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.440
and rhythm in time--

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:41.540
the whole thing about
music is the expression

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.100
within a given time, right?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.970
And history and
society and people

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.010
are constantly moving together
in the never-stopping time.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.360
You can't stop time.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.850
You always have to go with time.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:06.260
And so the reason why I
isolate these certain notes is

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.810
so that I put emphasis
or I strengthen

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.890
that one note at one point,
and then another finger

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.000
with another, different
way of practicing,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.070
if that makes any sense.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.720
I'm like rambling on right now.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:30.020
But anyways, I thought why
don't we literally just force

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.840
ourselves to put
ourselves in a situation

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.910
where we may be next to
this one person at one time,

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.690
and then another day we may
be next to another person--

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.790
someone that's completely
different from us,

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.620
someone that doesn't
understand us,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.580
or we don't understand them?

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.200
But perhaps if we
practiced this more often,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.960
like I practice this
every day, then we

00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.110
will have perfect
steady harmony in time.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:04.040
So if I keep doing
that, you'll hear it.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.141
Because I'll play it.

00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:06.140
And hopefully it's good.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.640
But here's another point--

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.860
and I'm just doing this to save
my own ass-- if it's not good,

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.860
it's because we have
to keep doing it.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.050
So yeah, so that's it.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.870
ALEX HK CHUNG: Thanks, Ji,
to sharing your experience

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.380
and connecting that
with how you practice

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.097
and how you think about
practicing that difficult note.

00:26:28.097 --> 00:26:29.930
JI: Oh, I do have one
more thing that I want

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.575
to say before I play, though.

00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:35.150
And so right now
I'm at this point

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.270
where I want to present
classical music in a way

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:43.280
that as a whole, when I play
a number of pieces together,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.150
has a narrative and a story
that we all can relate to.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:55.070
So some of the things that I
do may not be so conventional,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.830
because say for instance--
like, this is the third movement

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.560
of the sonata.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.860
I'm making a program
where I begin

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.222
the program with the third
movement of the sonata.

00:27:05.222 --> 00:27:06.680
Usually if you're
playing a sonata,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.260
you play the whole
damn sonata first

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.270
and you play with the
first movement beginning.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.020
But I don't want to
play the whole sonata.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.603
I just want to play
the third movement

00:27:13.603 --> 00:27:14.810
and go on to the next piece.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:18.600
This is very unorthodox.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.560
But the music has its
components in which I

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.150
can deliver the message to you.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:32.120
And so maybe this can
help you better understand

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.770
the music in general.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.190
And this is just
one little fragment

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.860
of a pianist in the
world doing his part

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.290
to make you feel something,
because that's what

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.172
music is at the end of the day.

00:27:44.172 --> 00:27:45.380
ALEX HK CHUNG: Thank you, Ji.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.330

hear how you want to express

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.900
and what you want
to express to us.
