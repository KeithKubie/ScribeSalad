00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're going to think

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.630
about the economic profit of a monopoly,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.110
of a monopoly firm.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.890
And to do that, we're gonna
draw our standard price

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.283
and quantity axes, so that's quantity,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.143
and this is price.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.730
And this is going to of
course be in dollars,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.090
and we can first think about the demand

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880
for this monopoly firm's product.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.620
And the demand curve would look similar

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.960
to other demand curves that
we've seen multiple times,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.800
that at a high price, people
wouldn't be demanding a lot,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.680
and then at a lower price,
or as price goes lower,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.050
people are going to demand a
higher and higher quantity,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.130
or the market will demand a
higher, and higher quantity.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.910
So that might be the demand curve.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.620
Now what's interesting
about any imperfectly

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.300
competitive firm, and the
extreme case is a monopoly,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.010
is what the marginal revenue curve

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760
looks like given this demand curve.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.140
In a perfectly competitive firm,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.410
the marginal revenue curve
is equal to the demand curve,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.750
and in that situation, it's
actually a horizontal line.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.770
But here, because when the
monopoly firm reduces price,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.010
it doesn't just reduce it
on that incremental unit,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.990
it would be typical that
it would have to reduce

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.520
its price on all of the
units, and we've studied

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.740
this in other videos.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530
You have a marginal revenue curve

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.540
that would go down faster
than the demand curve,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.770
it would look something like this,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.300
and if this is unfamiliar to you,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.550
I encourage you to watch
some of those videos

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.890
that go into depth why this is happening.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.220
So it's a monopoly, or
actually any imperfectly

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.360
competitive firm, its
marginal revenue curve

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.220
will go down faster than the demand curve.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520
So what would be a rational quantity

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.500
for this firm to produce?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.750
Well to think about that,
we have to think about

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.960
its marginal cost curve.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.330
So its marginal cost
curve, the typical way

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.700
we often think about
it is, at first you get

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420
some economies of scale,
but then you start having

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.330
coordination costs, and maybe
some diseconomies of scale,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.000
your inputs start getting more expensive,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.980
and so your marginal cost curve might look

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.180
something like that.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.010
And the rational quantity produced is,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.470
as long as your incremental
revenue for every unit

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.760
is higher than your incremental
cost for every unit,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.400
you would wanna produce more,
and more, and more, and more

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.120
until the point that your marginal cost

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.570
is equal to your marginal revenue.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.470
And so the rational quantity to produce

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.540
right over here would be right over there.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.380
I'll do that Q, I could
call that Q for the firm,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.300
I could also call that Q sub M,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.680
because we're dealing with a situation

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.260
where the firm is, at least
from the producer side,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.240
it is the market, it is the only producer,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.620
it's a monopoly.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.240
But what's the price here?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.480
Well to know that, we just have to look

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.313
at the demand curve.

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:36.620
At this quantity, the
price is right over here.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.650
So the price is right
over here, and once again,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.820
we could call that the market price,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.380
and so something interesting
has happened here

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.880
for the monopoly firm.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.040
In a perfectly competitive
firm, where the marginal cost

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.930
and demand curves intersect,
that's what dictated

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.857
the demand, because the demand curve

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.060
and the marginal revenue
curve were the same.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.130
But here, we are now producing
a quantity less than that,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.150
we're producing a quantity where price

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.530
is greater than marginal cost,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.410
you could see it right over there.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.400
At this quantity price is
greater than marginal cost,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920
and so you can view this
difference right over here

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.560
as kind of a markup that is possible

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.890
for a monopoly firm to do
that would not be possible

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.660
with a perfectly competitive firm.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.440
And this also introduces an idea

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.920
of dead weight loss.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.200
Because at least in theory,
at a higher quantity,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.230
people were willing to pay
more than the marginal cost,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.230
so you would think that there is some type

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.928
of a benefit that the
market as a whole could gain

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:38.800
from that incremental unit,
or those incremental units,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.200
and then even some more incremental units.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.560
It feels like there's to
gain, but because of what

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.320
is rational for this monopoly firm,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.300
and there's insurmountable
barriers for entry

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.270
for other people to enter, this
is not going to be captured

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.931
until you have this dead weight loss.

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.410
Now an interesting
question, and this is where

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.090
I started off is, well what would be

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.770
the economic profit
for this monopoly firm?

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.950
And to think about that, we have to think

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.150
about the average total cost curve.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.550
And so the average total
cost, I'll draw a typical

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.367
average total cost curve, it
might look something like this.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.930
While marginal cost is below
the average total cost,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.060
the average total cost
will trend downwards,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.560
and as soon as marginal cost is higher

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.320
than average total cost,
well now of course,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.070
average total cost is going
to start trending upwards.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.122
So marginal costs intersects
the average total cost curve

00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:33.770
at the minimum point right over there.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.680
And so based on this
average total cost curve,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.980
it looks like this monopoly firm

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.270
is earning an economic profit,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.880
because at that quantity,
this is the price

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.430
per unit it's getting.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.020
This is the average cost per unit,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.180
so on average per unit,
it's getting this height,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.180
it's getting this
difference right over here,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.650
and then if you were to multiply it

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.060
times the number of
units, well that's going

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.430
to give you its economic profit.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.940
So you could view the economic profit

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.110
in this situation as
being this shaded area

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.670
of this rectangle.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.740
So I'll leave ya there.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.820
The big thing to appreciate is,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.050
when we're dealing with
imperfect competition,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.280
and the extreme form of a monopoly,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.280
your marginal revenue curve is
no longer your demand curve,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.350
and your marginal revenue
curve is downward sloping

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.830
like this, it's not the flat curve

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.870
that we saw with the perfect competition.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.650
And because of that, your marginal cost

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.636
is going to intersect marginal revenue

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:33.600
at a quantity where price is
greater than marginal cost,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
which introduces dead
weight loss in the market,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.750
and the way to think
about the economic profit

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.760
is to compare what that
price in the market

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.063
is at that quantity, to
the average total cost

00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:46.140
at that quantity.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.840
And what's also interesting
about this monopoly firm

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.350
is because of the barriers to entry,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.920
we talked about in the long
run with perfect competition,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.920
if there's economic profit going on,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.513
more entrants would enter into the market,

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:58.570
but that's not going
to happen in a monopoly

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.990
because the barriers to entry are so high.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.410
So this monopoly is sitting pretty,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.750
it's going to be able to keep earning

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.480
this type of economic profit,
unless something dramatically

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.533
changes in the market somehow.
