00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:06.261
I always had the idea

00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:08.878
that I wanted to work for a company

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:11.275
maybe in the financial world.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.634
Maybe I was somehow biased and affected

00:00:14.634 --> 00:00:16.516
by movies like "Wall Street."

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.609
So, I grew up in Italy

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.415
and watching movies like "Wall Street"

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:23.615
where movies that were picturing

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:25.857
this image of successful people

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:28.982
managing in a very successful business environment,

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:32.347
and it was something that was really intriguing,

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:33.742
only to find out later on

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.027
that the world is not exactly

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:37.771
what you see in those movies.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.106
But I guess I had a clear idea

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:43.573
that I was very attracted by a career

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:45.643
in an international environment

00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:50.107
and an environment where corporate challenges

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:51.222
were probably one of the things

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:53.109
that would have interested me.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.046
So, I think it turned out

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:56.736
that things were not so much different

00:00:56.736 --> 00:01:00.385
from what I projected when I was in grade school.
