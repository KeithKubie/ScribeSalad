is a proven technique for getting

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
is a proven technique for getting
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.240
is a proven technique for getting
students to understand material at a

students to understand material at a
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.939
students to understand material at a
deeper level and I was committed to that

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

I had taught before in other
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.730
I had taught before in other
environments and this was clearly the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
environments and this was clearly the
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710
environments and this was clearly the
place that was the best match in

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
place that was the best match in
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959

is an unequaled way for students to
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.560
is an unequaled way for students to
learn they get practice in the actual

skills of the domain as well as coming
up with the concepts and the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
up with the concepts and the
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340
up with the concepts and the
methodologies that they can take back to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
methodologies that they can take back to
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.950
methodologies that they can take back to
their organization

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960
their organization
 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.500

students grapple with these questions

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
students grapple with these questions
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.319
students grapple with these questions
and and methodologies in their teamwork

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
and and methodologies in their teamwork
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.670
and and methodologies in their teamwork
and we often find that they take back to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
and we often find that they take back to
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399
and we often find that they take back to
their workplace the same week that they

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
their workplace the same week that they
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.609
their workplace the same week that they
learn a new skill and apply it so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
learn a new skill and apply it so
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.840
learn a new skill and apply it so
students really love the grounded way

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
students really love the grounded way
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999
students really love the grounded way
that we teach with learning by doing I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
that we teach with learning by doing I
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.940
that we teach with learning by doing I
had a 30 year career in industry and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
had a 30 year career in industry and
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.270

I've brought that knowledge with me to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
I've brought that knowledge with me to
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.289
I've brought that knowledge with me to
campus and teach courses that involve

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299
campus and teach courses that involve
 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.780
campus and teach courses that involve
contextual design as well as my research

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790
contextual design as well as my research
 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.340
contextual design as well as my research
involving a lot of contextual design

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
involving a lot of contextual design
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050
involving a lot of contextual design
work I felt that I was able to learn a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
work I felt that I was able to learn a
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359
work I felt that I was able to learn a
lot from her experiences and every time

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
lot from her experiences and every time
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670
lot from her experiences and every time
she got out to teach her to lead a class

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
she got out to teach her to lead a class
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560
she got out to teach her to lead a class
discussion she would draw from that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
discussion she would draw from that
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.999
discussion she would draw from that
personal experience but when we would

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
personal experience but when we would
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950
personal experience but when we would
kind of have a reality check to see that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
kind of have a reality check to see that
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690
kind of have a reality check to see that
you know this material is not just some

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
you know this material is not just some
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399
you know this material is not just some
saying that we're gonna learn and then

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
saying that we're gonna learn and then
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870
saying that we're gonna learn and then
throw away but it's actually something

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
throw away but it's actually something
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670
throw away but it's actually something
that we would use in the real world and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
that we would use in the real world and
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.639
that we would use in the real world and
so it has all of these real-world

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649
so it has all of these real-world
 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.810
so it has all of these real-world
applications the idea is for the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
applications the idea is for the
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.670
applications the idea is for the
students to succeed we want them to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
students to succeed we want them to
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.620
students to succeed we want them to
learn before it's time for the grades to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
learn before it's time for the grades to
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.020
learn before it's time for the grades to
come and so they are actively involved

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
come and so they are actively involved
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.960
come and so they are actively involved
with faculty all
