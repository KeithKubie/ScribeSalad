00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.135
Assignment grades. After you've submitted your assignment, either on

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:06.939
T-square or through Udacity, your course staff will grade

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.460
them according to your Professor's specifications, and they'll return

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.710
the scores for you on T-square. You'll be able

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.090
to find your grades in the Grade Book section

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.910
of T-square. Note that these are only scores for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.490
each graded assignment in the class. We'll discuss how

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.090
to get your final grade later in this lesson.
