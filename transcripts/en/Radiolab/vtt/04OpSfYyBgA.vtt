00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.840
You are listening to radiolab, radiolab from

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.700
W and Y.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.300
S. T. E. N. P. R. A. I'm Jana, boom rotten. I'm Robert Krulwich,

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
Radiolab podcast. And before we get to the podcast part of the podcast,

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.900
we should just say that Robert and I, by the time you hear this,

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.950
we're going to be like seconds away from the beginning of our live show tour.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.120
It is called apocalyptical. Yeah, it's like apocalypse on an elliptical.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.620
It's how I like to think of it. It's got monsters and explosions, great stories,

9
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.770
great musicians. Glen Coachy, Darren Grey, Sarah it lip state.

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
Amazing comedians. Uh, depending on the city you might see Reggie Watts,

11
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.940
Simon AmSteel, Kurt Braunohler. Oh, fear Eisenberg, Patton Oswald.

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.090
And we're going to be performing in 21 cities.

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.640
And the first show was in Hartford, Connecticut. Yes.

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
Wednesday of the week that this podcast comes out in Thursday of that week,

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.920
we're going to be in Hartford, Connecticut.

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.450
I remember we go from city to city to city,

17
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:00.740
to city to city during the months of October and November. Yeah.

18
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.510
And you can find out what cities we're going to begin.

19
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.780
And what time is we're gonna be there and how to buy the tickets at

20
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.050
radiolab.org/live okay. Now the podcast,

21
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.060
take it away. Kay. It's something you do every day.

22
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.090
You don't think about it very much, but when you do it in New York City,

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.220
strange things happen.

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.270
What is he at? What are you talking about? I don't know. It's a teeth, but my,

25
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.420
are you going to tell me what it is? Well,

26
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.320
I can tell you that it all started with this guy. I'll go with this.

27
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.530
That's good writer who's been on the show a few times. I'm Fredrick Kaufman,

28
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.740
the author of at the farm. How food stopped being food.

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.470
We brought him in to tell us a story about the human gut.

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.450
This was a while back member this year.

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.140
It was during the occupy Wall Street protest,

32
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.930
so you know I've been occupying Wall Street for about 30 years now.

33
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.200
Fred actually lives right near Wall Street and somebody took a shit right on my

34
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:56.230
doorstep the other morning. Really? Yeah.

35
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.310
I had an occupy Wall Street Turd on my doorstep. How do you know that?

36
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:03.610
It wasn't, you know, some right wing and could have been a tea party Turd.

37
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:06.860
It could've been a tea party Turd. I sent it to the lab for an hour.

38
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.740
The blue as opposed to red and this whole a poop on the stoop story.

39
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.590
This reminds me of a whole other series of stories that it sent Fred off on a,

40
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:17.190
on a significant rant. You know, you don't,

41
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:21.530
you don't get the even the beginning of what's going on here about poop

42
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.070
<v 1>[inaudible]. So</v>

43
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.060
<v 0>Fred told us that the first thing we had to do about North River sewage</v>

44
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.860
treatment plan was we had to go to North River wastewater treatment plan.

45
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.710
Go there, crossover.

46
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.640
It's just over on the upper west side in Manhattan usually.

47
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.530
How often do you come here? So our producer, Pat Walters and I,

48
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.390
we went up there. Yeah, included in this intention. I don't know.

49
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.760
Walter's just muscled his splay into position two years. Again,

50
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.850
why are you doing, anyway, we went up there and we ended up talking to this guy,

51
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:59.750
Steve [inaudible]. Robert, Hey rob, how are you? I've never, she like,

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.990
yeah, he's like the,

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.880
I've been on camera before and Superintendent of the planet NYC,

54
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.730
Steve is basically the eliminator.

55
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.800
He eliminates a very significant portion of New York City's boop. We have it.

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.910
I think it's really neat jobs sooner. The glory of this position.

57
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.670
It's pretty exciting because again,

58
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.600
you really get to see this kid Steve at the beginning of a process that I think

59
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.730
we all kind of know the outline of,

60
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.110
but the details and the places that New York City's poop in particular end up

61
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.900
taking you are truly astonishing.

62
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.050
So the first thing that we learned is that in New York City,

63
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.670
this whole wastewater treatment thing,

64
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.410
it happens on an almost unbelievable scale and gallows about citywide,

65
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.880
about 1.3 billion gallons every, every single day.

66
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.890
That 7.45 pounds per gallon, that's, you know,

67
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.030
7 billion pounds. Wow.

68
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.620
Which is actually more than the weight of all the elephants on the planet. What?

69
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.260
Yes. We counted, we know we interviewed the elephant,

70
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.060
but until 1986 we dumped pretty much all of it into the ocean or straight into

71
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.590
the Hudson river. 1986 and that's like yesterday, you know,

72
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.470
and can imagine a west side of Manhattan before 1986 all the sewage went into

73
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:12.670
the river. Unprocessed, unprocessed, went straight into the river and treated.

74
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.700
That blows my mind. Yeah. It was not a good situation.

75
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.490
But by 1986 the city had built several treatment plants, including this one,

76
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.960
which happens to be the biggest,

77
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.990
it's a very impressive building with trees on top and soccer fields.

78
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:28.880
And I watched it get built. It's right near my neighborhood.

79
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.210
So kids played soccer, that player, they played soccer on top of the poo place.

80
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.380
Did you have any sense of what lies inside that building? No,

81
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.813
I had no,

82
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.220
<v 2>no. We're going to walk in according to the process. All right.</v>

83
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.580
And then in the walking tours I've had of New York City,

84
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.593
this beats everything.

85
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.400
<v 0>Yeah. That we're going to Andrew through the doors. Mark Exit.</v>

86
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.300
That's always a good way.

87
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.460
So imagine parkland on top and a kind of open framework.

88
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.420
Sort of like a parking garage and word like up on the top level with the

89
00:05:05.421 --> 00:05:07.340
treatment plant itself underneath us.

90
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.370
And Steve Walks us over to this manhole cover, opened it up.

91
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.830
<v 2>Hey Aaron, look down and see ya. And we looked down.</v>

92
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.440
That's where the water comes in. Well, below the highways.

93
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:20.441
I mean there's this river river of everything is this broiling brown tore it way

94
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:22.940
below us.

95
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.600
The vitamin a channel is a hundred feet down to the first thing Steve has to do

96
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:28.250
is like be headed up out of there.

97
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.700
We pumped it up a hundred feet and it cascades down through the rest of the

98
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:36.500
process. Ultimately back to the ribbon and at this point it becomes

99
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.683
<v 3>um,</v>

100
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.830
<v 2>series of waterfalls</v>

101
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.790
<v 3>like Viagra. Yeah, that's exactly right.</v>

102
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.640
<v 2>Warren. Down below us through this eight story staircase of pools,</v>

103
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.040
almost like Charisse lakes, we go high.

104
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.730
That is each point a processes Loa and each pool has its own job.

105
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.990
Starting from the top,

106
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.700
there's like one room where they just skim the oil off the surface. Fats,

107
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:03.230
oils and greases float to the top and we skim them off. Sewage flows down again.

108
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.430
So we're going to walk down this envelope. Warm is wide open space.

109
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.200
This is impressive. This. This feels the big long gallery here. Yeah,

110
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.270
like a huge rectangular lake. Our Lake. Okay. That's correct.

111
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.860
A warm sewage. So if the air temperature is cold enough,

112
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.150
the vapor condenses on the cold concrete and it rains inside the building.

113
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.140
If it's really cold range and drips, call or whatever,

114
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.280
it condenses and comes down and droplets.

115
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.730
That's the definition of rain and it's all be soaking wet in here cause it's

116
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.190
raining and if it's really cold,

117
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.020
that vape of freezes and we'll have snow on the floor. All right.

118
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.870
Real climate. Meanwhile, in the lake,

119
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.480
the sludgy stuff kind of settles down to the bottom,

120
00:06:48.481 --> 00:06:51.930
settles out and get sent along down to another layer to the next step.

121
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.120
And as you go down deeper and deeper,

122
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.040
eventually you get to this one broom that's like weirdly kind of beautiful.

123
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.040
It had a kind of dome like top and they were,

124
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.180
there was a big pond in front of yours. It's frothy, it's a lie.

125
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.000
Kind of Nice like Tan colored to it.

126
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.330
The pond was brimming with life becomes a biological process.

127
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.570
One that is spookily similar to what happens in our own stomach,

128
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.940
we heat it to 98 degrees. Low and behold,

129
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.180
it's coming from humans and this is where they add a bunch of bacteria to the

130
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:25.590
sewage does show which is actually food to this bacteria and then Steve adds

131
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.230
other bacteria to eat those bacteria.

132
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.180
The ash it form is eat the complex proteins and carbohydrates and the method

133
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:37.950
formers eat them. The acid formers and cannibal fest, everyone's eating,

134
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.250
everything's eating, everything go from bug and now this bacteria,

135
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.960
they were little mayflies and bugs calling on the surface and everywhere around

136
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:49.430
the room. They were enormous deletions of spiders.

137
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.920
They're all over the place. I received them. The images,

138
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.960
images eat the sludge, the spiders eat the meat.

139
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.370
You said if this was an outdoor plant, we had birds eating the spiders.

140
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.440
It's a whole ecosystem and it's exactly see, right,

141
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.910
so well York City has its waste treatment plant,

142
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.460
a rain forest filled with animals,

143
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.900
but of course the product of all this. Oh, through that door. What do you says?

144
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.300
Discuss? It's so bad.

145
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:28.620
I just want to smell more of it because what you've left with is this thick soup

146
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.560
of like super concentrated to it. Right. How much do you smell?

147
00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:36.340
You smell it on mouth. Yeah. Oh No, it smells. Let's get out of here.

148
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.750
I smell it. Yeah, hold on. Once you have that soup, you take that.

149
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.310
We put it through a Santa fuge where we mechanically spin it as salad spinner.

150
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.791
Whoa.

151
00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:49.350
It's kind of like the spin cycle in your washing machine and it basically sweats

152
00:08:49.351 --> 00:08:53.100
out all the additional moisture and what I'm left with is I got real

153
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:56.070
concentrated like 30% solids, moist soil,

154
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.943
<v 0>a ton of it.</v>

155
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.440
There's 125 million gallons of it and if you want to like try to picture that in

156
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.230
your mind. I did a that much sludge.

157
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.080
That's what this stuff is called would fill the rose bowl.

158
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.550
I'm not even a football fan,

159
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:13.551
but just like picture a big college football stadium filled with this

160
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.740
concentrated sewage sludge and that's what Steve's left with at the end of every

161
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.190
single day. Which leads to the obvious question. What do I do with that stuff?

162
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.670
Um, all right. I'll go ahead and place the microphone.

163
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:29.190
This is where the story takes a really strange turn.

164
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.090
This is where things got a little, how would you put it? A little emotional.

165
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.280
Emotional. Mike, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

166
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.560
Ended up tracking down this guy named Mike. Mike Sharp,

167
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.280
who's hired to answer this question like what do we do with New York City is

168
00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.660
processed sewage sludge.

169
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.440
He says for awhile they hauled it 103 miles out in the ocean and dumped it just

170
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:47.274
like before,

171
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.530
but eventually what happened was in 1988 the government banned all ocean

172
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:56.670
disposal of waste and because New York City had been dumping so much of this

173
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:59.220
stuff in the ocean for so long, the EPA said,

174
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:01.200
not only do you have to stop dumping in the ocean,

175
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.320
you have to find something good to do with some of it. Beneficial.

176
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:08.010
Where use of biosolids is our sewage Guy Steve again, and he says,

177
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.460
you can use this sludge as fertilizer can use as fertilizer.

178
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.150
Steve told us that lots of cities do this.

179
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.050
You can go to home depot and buy a bag of middle organizer.

180
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.260
Middle organized is biosolids familiar walking.

181
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.310
So when you buy a bag of Malloy orgonite and spread it over your tomatoes,

182
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.850
you're actually using treated poop from the people of Milwaukee.

183
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.980
They've marketed it for a retail sale,

184
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.720
and this is basically where Mike comes in. It was his job to sell our sludge.

185
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.710
So off I went. Is this like a thing? He does, yeah.

186
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.420
He'd done it in other places for other towns,

187
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.830
but this time start spreading the new,

188
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.880
it didn't go the way it usually does.

189
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.040
He doesn't remember exactly who he approached first,

190
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:49.350
but state Alabama after state,

191
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.770
Ohio after state in the ANA said No.

192
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.810
I can read number one state. I won't even mention who, but you know,

193
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.490
the comment was made, you're not going to get in New York City here.

194
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.080
Don't even think about it.

195
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.190
There were talented to accept biosolids from every city in the planet except New

196
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.400
York City, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama.

197
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.600
We don't want New York City biosolids like ours is.

198
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.020
We don't want cities like a biosolids. The objections were all over the map.

199
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.100
The floods will have toxins in it or disease or like who knows? You know,

200
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:27.090
it'll have the city in it even though technically when they tested it,

201
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.620
it was no different than the sludge from anywhere else. It's the same stuff.

202
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.700
But I wanna know over Kansas and over again in Kentucky.

203
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.750
And here's the same thing.

204
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.000
Don't think you're ever going to get New York City permitted here.

205
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.053
I feel a little [inaudible].

206
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.710
I haven't even lived here that long and I'm feeling so it's um,

207
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.580
your residency in New York, it's such a collective effort here.

208
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.640
You know that there was a prejudice against New York City versus almost any

209
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.540
other sludge in the country. And as you mentioned that a certain point,

210
00:11:55.541 --> 00:12:00.541
Mike started offering to give this stuff away for free and still nobody wants it

211
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.900
until it was kind of an just one of those flukes of life.

212
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.930
You got to Colorado. Uh, I got lost coming out of the airport.

213
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.030
Huge thunderstorm. I thought I was going north,

214
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.620
ended up going south and all of a sudden he's about 75 miles east of Denver.

215
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.740
You have, you have pretty far south. Like I said,

216
00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:23.130
I was lost in a big thunderstorm in winter. The first down I find a hotel,

217
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.280
so anyway,

218
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.710
next morning down to the coffee shop gets to talking with some guy and telling

219
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:32.550
him I've got all of this sludge New York City and I just want to put it on a

220
00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:35.250
train and bring it out to the farms in Colorado.

221
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.030
Bonds is you're going to do what? Typical reaction.

222
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.630
You're going to put something from New York City on a rail car and haul it all

223
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.980
the way here, but then he paused and said, keep talking.

224
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.620
And we talked about the concept and before Mike knew it,

225
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:54.090
he'd found a place that would accept New York city's unwanted sludge

226
00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.010
fertilizers, fertilizer. That plant doesn't care what it comes from.

227
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.900
This is Wayne Wayne Scholtz.

228
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.280
He ended up running the operation in Colorado or track out there would hold 17

229
00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:06.330
train cars

230
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.240
and this is how the New York City poop train began.

231
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.960
A couple of days before Earth Day,

232
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.980
1992 several thousand tons of New York City sludge left the big apple headed for

233
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.970
Lamar, Colorado, 1600 miles away.

234
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.540
But it wasn't exactly an immediate success.

235
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.790
<v 4>Well, I think a whole thing started out pretty small.</v>

236
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.090
Initially there was just three or four farms that were using it.

237
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.220
This guy's one of the first farmers to start using it. Sure.

238
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:42.450
My name's John Stope intensives. He remembers early on,

239
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.610
public was invited to come out and comment on what they thought about the

240
00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:49.630
biosolids and it conjured up some very strong emotions.

241
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.460
One person said something that they were concerned if any of this got spilled

242
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:57.400
out of the trucks transporting it onto the highway,

243
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:01.510
that it would probably eat a hole in the asphalt and had to be treated like a

244
00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:03.010
nuclear disaster site.

245
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.970
And there were people who said their horse had died from biosalts.

246
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.050
I never heard the horror story, but I can tell you one about a cow. You know,

247
00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:15.100
I think it's typical that people are always suspicious of something that's from

248
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:15.934
far away.

249
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.110
There was a salsa commercial about that time.

250
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.680
I cook him off a Connie sauce, the cowboys, uh,

251
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.700
through the cookout camp basically cause they were upset because the salsa he

252
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:31.330
was serving was made in New York City. New York

253
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.840
<v 0>get a rope and that's kind of how it was.</v>

254
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.500
But then pharmacy we were using it started to notice that it was kind of

255
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.470
awesome.

256
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.460
I remember going to a farmer's field not long after he'd started using the

257
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:51.000
biosolids. The previous wheat crop was 40 Bushel.

258
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.080
After using the [inaudible]

259
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.880
<v 2>66 bushel wheat,</v>

260
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.340
the scrapping increased by a third and you never hear a 66 Bushel.

261
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.860
John says they started to notice other little things about it too.

262
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:04.520
We had a lot of trouble with an aphid called the Russian wheat Aphid,

263
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.900
but we saw an interesting thing with a couple of neighbors east of me.

264
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.640
When they put the biosolids in their field,

265
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.240
it kept the aphids away and wasn't just eight minutes.

266
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.060
We have a big prairie dog problem out here.

267
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.640
One farmer told Wayne when he put the biosolids in this field,

268
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.260
they packed up and lived across to the neighbor and he thought it was a human

269
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:27.320
scent. And as word got out, Winston started getting calls from all over.

270
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:31.100
The county will put me on the list, put me on the list. I wanted some of that.

271
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.880
There was a waiting list because as the New York City biosolids had gained

272
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:38.090
acceptance in Colorado, other states that started picking them up too.

273
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.110
I had a list of 50 farmers and wanting the product and after a few years they

274
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:46.550
were getting a train load pretty much every week the most in a month sometimes

275
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.270
too. It was 153 drinkers.

276
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.270
It's quite that much stick with ebb and flow depending on the flow of the

277
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.501
biosolids but makes sense.

278
00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:59.501
On average we covered maybe 10,000 acres a year and we had enough demand to

279
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:01.040
cover,

280
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.990
I mean farmer demand that we could easily cover 50 to 75,000 acres a year

281
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.550
<v 0>and here is what I think is the most amazing part of this whole story.</v>

282
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.600
You take it from Lake John who accounts for a big chunk of those acres.

283
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.290
John's growing wheat. Yes,

284
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.130
the hard red winter wheat and the wheat goes primarily into bread type of

285
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:23.990
products. A lot of bread type products with a pound of wheat. Rough.

286
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.560
Just rule of thumb is you get about a loaf of bread and if you do some quick

287
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:31.340
math, he said you'd get about 2000 pounds of wheat from each acre that you farm.

288
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.630
So that's 2000 loaves of bread per acre times the 10,000 acres that the

289
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:40.370
biosolids were on. So you just keep Ng Roche. And so we're up into the,

290
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.910
around 20 million loaves of bread or something like that. And that's each year.

291
00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:47.450
So we're talking hundreds of millions of loaves of bread, which means don says,

292
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:52.451
you may well have eaten a slice of bread that had a grain or two of wheat come

293
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:56.600
from our farm and to like in some small but very real sense,

294
00:16:56.601 --> 00:17:01.601
that's a slice of bread that we helped make with the stuff that we like make

295
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.970
biosolids from New York come from the bread that they ate, that uh,

296
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.900
went into their sewer system and end up in the wastewater treatment plant and

297
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:16.280
ended up in Colorado. And then, uh, you know, the cycle begins again.

298
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.813
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

299
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.990
<v 2>It was the ultimate and recycling. This is a magical thing. That's Fred again,</v>

300
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.540
the writer from the beginning of the story, it's really going from,

301
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.070
from the straight line,

302
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.940
make it go away and never return to a circle.

303
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.980
The end is in the beginning.

304
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:38.830
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

305
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.830
<v 2>I was and by it turns out that's not the end of the story.</v>

306
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.530
Since I turned off utilities and locked the doors a couple weeks ago,

307
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:50.220
we sent a reporter

308
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.750
<v 5>out to Colorado to hang out with Wayne.</v>

309
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.520
All I'm seeing here is a bunch of empty buildings. These are our buildings.

310
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.750
Empty everything, shut down, everything shut down and when she found, wow,

311
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.230
it's that the circle had become a straight line again.

312
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.410
At least I could have shown that one. It was an operation.

313
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.980
Winter did that for a long time. Things were great at one time.

314
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.340
Summer Oh seven I had 26 employees,

315
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.700
everybody hopping and it was slowly New York had come in and Oh,

316
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.550
you've got to cheapen up your prize.

317
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.710
You got somebody else who do this cheaper and the economy prices,

318
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.760
the diesel field, the railroad cost of transportation,

319
00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:38.761
just slowly it got down to floor for employees and myself and all they have to

320
00:18:41.801 --> 00:18:45.700
do is send you a 30 day written notice and your contracts gone.

321
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.170
That's how it happened. But you know everything's bottom line.

322
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.190
<v 6>I remember the last day or last load, which you happen to be 20 years,</v>

323
00:18:55.191 --> 00:18:57.380
the day of our first load showing up,

324
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.590
our first load showed up on Earth Day 1992 and our last load showed up April

325
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.070
22nd, 2012 and we sat there and watched the last load.

326
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.000
And you spread it across the farm ground there?

327
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.970
<v 5>Yeah, they have asked me if,</v>

328
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.460
if something happens,

329
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:21.750
would I be interested in managing it and I tore stole them. Yes.

330
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.200
But I'm not sitting around holding my breath.

331
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.480
Well New York does with it now. They go to landfills,

332
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.300
they mix it with garbage and they buried in landfills.

333
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.440
I gotta say it's kind of sad to come in here and see it now. Nothing

334
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.003
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

335
00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.180
<v 5>wait, hold on a second.</v>

336
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.420
I mean I obviously feel for Wayne and all those people who lost their jobs,

337
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:06.900
but it sounds, it sounded to me a little nuts from the beginning that we would,

338
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.380
<v 0>what are our bio, whatever it's called on the,</v>

339
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:13.010
on a train and put it all the way to Colorado. That's,

340
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.190
that must cost a lot of money. Yeah, it's Kinda nuts.

341
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.120
It's costing like millions of dollars and we've always put some of it in the

342
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:20.750
landfill.

343
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.680
It's just that now we put about half of it into landfill and half of it into

344
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.380
like abandoned strip mines and none of it goes to Colorado. But, well, how,

345
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.830
how much wood are we saving by not getting it on trains and sending it across

346
00:20:33.831 --> 00:20:37.400
the country or what's well like, so according to Mike and Wayne,

347
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.050
it's about half as expensive to put it in a landfill as it was to send it to

348
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.850
Colorado, which sounds like a lot, but if you add it up, if you add up the,

349
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.460
of sending all of this stuff that we were sending in Colorado and you add up the

350
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:55.810
cost of the landfill and you do the subtraction and you divide it across like

351
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:59.530
let's just say like 8 million people, it cost,

352
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.560
it would cost you Robert Krulwich about 25 cents a month to send it back.

353
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.660
That's it. Quarter for quarter. God, that's nothing.

354
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:12.820
I would have expected the answer to be a lot more than that.

355
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:15.670
Me To come on New York, do the right thing.

356
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:20.590
Can we store our own pride, integrity, you know,

357
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:25.330
integrity in the fields of Colorado here, we could close the circle again,

358
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:26.320
close the circle.

359
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:33.480
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

360
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.470
<v 0>well, usually Jen, Robert would say thank you and we'll see you next time.</v>

361
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.870
But they're not here because they're on tour.

362
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.790
You can find more information about the tour at radiolab.org/live thanks for

363
00:21:44.791 --> 00:21:45.030
listening.
