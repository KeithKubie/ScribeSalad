00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.490
Pop Quiz Hotshot!

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.359
What body parts can you cut out and the only
side effects are you get to eat ice cream

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:06.359
for a week?

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:17.100
We all know what they are, but what do 
they do?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.100
Happy Monday!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.100
What are tonsils for?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Seriously.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.190
When I was a kid, it seemed like everyone
was getting their tonsils out, but talking

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.730
about it here at the office, we could have
sworn no one does that anymore.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.399
Luckily for us, SSDragon19 asked us to do
a video about tonsils; and every Monday we

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.070
like to answer one of YOUR questions!

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.929
Because, y'all are great and stuff.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.560
If you open your mouth wide and look in the
back -- you'll see two palatine tonsils are

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.879
tucked up in the back on the top right and
left sides behind the hanging thing -- that's

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.679
called the uvula by the way.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.730
Those two palatine tonsils are part of a defensive
barrier called the Waldeyer ring which protects

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.260
the largest gaping entrance for bacterial
and viral infections to your body -- your

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.499
ears, nose and throat.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.510
You've got those two, plus two adenoids at
the back of the nasal cavity, a single lingual

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.569
tonsil down your throat on the tongue; and
a few others.

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.120
This Waldeyer ring of tonsils and adenoids
are an important part of the lymphatic system.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.550
Which (among other things) produces and moves
white blood cells and bacteria-eating lymphocytes

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.030
around the body to defend it.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.440
Tonsils hold B-cells; which are like scouts
for the immune system -- they look for bacterial

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740
invaders, and if they're found they send for
reinforcements!

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.620
Once the cells figure out how to beat the
invader, they call for antibodies to be produced

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.290
which search the body for other viruses or
bacteria that need kicking out.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.980
Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system,
because they are basically exposed lymph nodes.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.210
The lymphatic system balances the fluids in
our bodies, and also helps us fight infections.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.220
See, capillaries are constantly leaking water
and proteins into the tissues around them.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.110
If we did nothing about it, we'd swell up.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.860
So the lymphatic system takes that clear,
colorless fluid, called lymph, which also

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.651
contains white blood cells and bacteria-eating
lymphocytes from the soft tissues to the lymph

00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.060
nodes for cleaning.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.430
If there's an infection the lymph systems
clean it out using that fluid, which is why

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.659
lymph nodes in your groin, neck, chest, abdomen,
and armpits swell to indicate an infection;

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.890
just like those old buggers the tonsils!

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.890
They get infected more often between the ages
of 4 and 10 years old, because the immune

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.349
system is more active in kids than adults.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.019
After 11, the tonsils shrink.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.960
Swollen tonsils can cause breathing problems,
sleep apnea, or increase risk of other bacterial

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.020
infections; not to mention the sickness causing
the swelling.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.719
Normally, theyâ€™re removed if they become
infected multiple times in a single year,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.939
and though it's less common than 60 years
ago, there are still 380,000 tonsillectomies

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.409
annually in the U.S..

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.330
So what do the tonsils do?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.579
They're the body's version of a guard tower.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.170
But, the reason you can live without your
tonsils is because we've got a pretty awesome

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.439
immune system!

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.270
Thanks for your question SSDragon19!

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.079
Do you have a science question YOU want answered?

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.650
Ask us in the comments and if we pick yours
you can get some fun DNews swag!

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.599
Maybe even a DNews t-shirt!

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.720
Subscribe to DNews and tell us if you've got
your tonsils, too.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
I've got mine.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.919
I was super jealous of all that ice cream.
