00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
Congratulations. You have now learned some very fundamental concepts

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.530
of computer science, and you understand the issue of P vs NP.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.200
We've also shown that the problems that Alice, Bob, and Carol

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.920
were working on are among the hardest problems in NP.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.710
They are NP-complete; so nobody knows if

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.860
there's a polynomial-time algorithm for those problems,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.110
and actually finding 1 would be a sensation.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.240
Now, the question, of course, is what does that mean for Alice, Bob, and Carol?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.240
Should they just give up?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.960
Should they ask their bosses to give them a new problem?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.189
Or should they make their bosses watch this Udacity course?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.130
In the next unit, we'll be looking at 2 things:

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.560
The first 1 is how to recognize that a problem is NP-complete.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.990
And we'll then turn our attention to what to do when you encounter an NP-complete problem.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.090
Because, well, there will not only be good news, but as it turns out,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090
there's still some options available.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.590
It is possible to poke loopholes into the laws of NP-completeness.

00:00:55.590 --> 99:59:59.000
So there's still hope for Alice, Bob and Carol. So see you next time.
