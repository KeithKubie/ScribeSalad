00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.480
Welcome back to my series
of presentations on

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.480
mortgage-backed securities.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.100
So let's review what we've
already gone over.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.460
So I've already drawn here-- I
actually prepared ahead of

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.580
time-- so I've already drawn
here kind of what we've

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.570
already talked about.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.560
So we start with borrowers
who need to buy houses.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.570
Each of them borrowed
$1 million.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.890
Actually let me write
that down.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.240
Let me change the
color of my pen.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.410
Where'd my pen go?

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.110
OK.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.790
So each of these people
borrowed $1 million.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.920
OK.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.230
Each of them borrowed $1 million
and there were 1,000

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.150
of them, right?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.170
So $1 million times 1,000.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.250
That's $1 billion that
they needed.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.460
And they said that they would
pay 10% a year on that money

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.100
that they borrowed.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.940
So that's 10% for each of them
is $100,000 and then as we

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.500
said, there's 1,000 borrowers.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.370
So they're going to put in
$100 million, right?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.030
100,000 times 1,000
is 100 million.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.070
So just to simplify.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.000
Keep it in your mind. $1 million
goes to a bunch of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.050
borrowers, goes to 1,000
borrowers, to be specific.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.130
And then each year, those
borrowers are going to give

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.280
the special purpose entity--
this is just a corporation

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.560
designed to kind of structure
these mortgage-backed

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.430
securities-- they're going to
give 10% of the billion, or

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.690
$100 million back into this.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.190
And then we said, OK, well where
does that money for this

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.960
special purpose entity, or for
this corporation, come from?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.150
Well it comes from the investors
in the actual

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.400
mortgage-backed securities.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.060
And just to be clear, so
the asset within this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.175
entity are the loans.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.920
The loans are the main asset
that's inside of the special

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.470
purpose entity.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.580
And the loans are just the right
on these 10% payments.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.430
And so money came from when the
owners of each of these

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.870
mortgage-backed securities--
each, let's say, paid $1,000

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.140
for the mortgage-backed
securities.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.620
And in return, they're going
to get 10% on their money.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.750
So each security cost $1,000.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.040
And then they're going to
they're going to get

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.640
$100 back per month.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669
And we said there are a million
of these securities,

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.210
so $1,000 times 1 million,
that's where the $1 billion

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.460
comes from.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.140
My thing's been acting up.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.550
That's where the $1 billion
comes from.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.800
And that essentially is
lent to the borrowers.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.680
And these guys will get 10%.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.500
Now one thing I want you to keep
in mind is, they get 10%

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.370
only if every one of these
borrowers pays their loans,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.760
never defaults, never
pre-pays.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.300
Pre-paying a mortgage is just
saying, I sold the house.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.470
I don't need the mortgage
anymore, so I just pay it off.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.390
So it's only 10%, indefinitely,
if all of the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.990
borrowers pay all the money
and never default or

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.560
anything like that.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.670
So this 10% is kind of
in an ideal world.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.520
Well everyone knows that it's
not going to be exactly 10%.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.630
Some percentage of these
borrowers are going to default

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.240
on their mortgage.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.840
Some of them are going
to pay ahead of time.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.990
And actually that's what the
buyer of the mortgage-backed

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.230
security should try
to figure out.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.220
And all sorts of buyers are
going to have all sorts of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.100
different assumptions.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.350
And this is what you probably
read some articles about,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.560
these hedge funds with these
computer models to value their

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.930
mortgage-backed securities.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.610
And that's what those
computer models do.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.450
They try to look at historical
data and figure out, OK, for a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.940
given population pool in a given
part of the country,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.530
what percentage of
them are able to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.510
pay off their mortgage?

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.140
What percentage of them default
on their mortgage?

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.100
And when they default, what
is kind of the recovery?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.190
Say they default on a $1 million
mortgage, and then the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.930
special purpose entity would
get control of that house.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.070
And then if that house is sold
for $500,000 because the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.610
property value went down, then
the recovery would be 50%.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.430
So that's all of the things that
someone needs to factor

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.260
in when they figure out what
will be the real return.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.030
10% is if everyone pays.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.120
So let's make some very simple
assumptions for ourselves.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.760
Let's say we are thinking
about investing in a

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.490
mortgage-backed security and we
want to gauge for ourselves

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.490
what we think the return
is going to be.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.420
Well let's say we know that this
pool of borrowers that--

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.450
my pen keeps not working--
that 20% will default.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.529
We're not going to worry about
pre-payment rates and all

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.390
things like that.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.884
Let's say 20% are going
to default.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.660
Of these 1,000 borrowers, 200 of
them are just going to lose

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.480
their job or whatever.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.730
They can't afford a
mortgage anymore.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.240
And of those 20% that default,
we have a 50% recovery.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.270
So that means borrower X
defaulted on his loan.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.450
And then when we go and get
the property-- because the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.620
loan was secured by the
property-- when we auction off

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.980
the property, we only
get $500,000 for it.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.350
So we get a 50% recovery.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.780
50% of the original
value of the loan.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.820
So if 20% default and then
there's a 50% recovery, then

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:14.570
on average you're going to get
10% of the loan is worthless.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.910
And I'm going to make
some kind of

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.750
handwaving assumptions here.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.760
But you can assume
statistically, and since this

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.230
is a large number of borrowers--
it's 1,000, right?

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.470
If there's only one borrower
it would be hard to kind of

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.650
gauge when he defaults,
if he defaults at all.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.590
We would just know that
there is a 20% chance.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.430
But when there's a large number
of borrowers, you can

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.460
kind of do the math and say,
OK, on average 200 of these

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.750
guys are going to default, and
instead of actually getting

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.470
10%, since 10% of the loans are
going to be worthless, I'm

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.940
going to get 10% less
than this 10%.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.610
So I'm going to get 9%.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.210
So this is based on the
model that we just

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.500
constructed, right?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.910
This is the model that
we constructed.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.080
This is a much simpler model
than what most people use.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.950
But based on the model that we
just constructed, I think the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.990
real return we're going to get
on this mortgage-backed

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.570
security is 9%.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.190
If there was another investor
who assumed a 50% default

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.040
rate, but with a higher
recovery, he or she would have

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.120
a different kind of expected
return from this security.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.000
So why is this even useful?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.760
Well think about it.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.540
Before, in the case we did in
the first video, when someone

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.620
just borrows from the bank,
the bank has very specific

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.670
lending requirements.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.320
They have their own model.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.180
So there's a whole class of
borrowers that they might have

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.680
not been able to service.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.970
Right?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.830
There might be people with
really good credit scores,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.730
really good incomes, who don't
have a down payment.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.210
And if they don't meet what the
bank's requirements are,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.540
they would never get a loan.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.430
But there are probably some
investors out there that would

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.970
say, you know what?

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.310
For the right interest rate and
for the right assumptions

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.110
in my model, I'm willing to give
anybody a loan, as long

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.840
as I'm compensated
for it enough.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.230
And this is what this
mortgage-backed security

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.260
market allows.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.495
It allows-- let's say this group
of borrowers-- let's say

00:07:02.495 --> 00:07:12.520
this pool of borrowers right
here actually didn't--

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.710
This pool of borrowers
actually aren't the

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:22.270
traditional-- they don't have
25% down and they don't have

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.340
kind of the traditional
requirements to get a normal

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.290
mortgage-- but if I pool a bunch
of people who don't have

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.630
those traditional requirements,
but they're good

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.740
in other ways-- they have a
high income or high credit

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.940
score-- I can go through this
alternate mechanism to find

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.130
investors that are willing
to loan them money.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.840
So essentially, from the
borrower's point of view, it

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.260
allows more access to loan
funding that they would have

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.790
otherwise not been able to.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.770
And from an investor point of
view, it allows another place

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.880
for me to invest in.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.170
Maybe I feel that the computer
models that I have are really

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.350
good at predicting things like
default rates, and recovery

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.320
rates, and what a
loan is worth.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.950
And I feel that I can, in some
ways, be a better loan officer

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.480
than the banks.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.150
And this would be an attractive
place for

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.590
me to invest in.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.890
It also might just have a risk
reward characteristic that

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.360
doesn't exist in the market
already, and it allows you to

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.600
diversify into one other
asset class.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.740
So that's the value that it has

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.780
across the entire spectrum.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.050
Now in the next presentation I'm
going to show how you can,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.720
I guess, further complicate this
even more, so that you

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.570
can open up the investment
to even a

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.820
larger group of investors.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.320
Because you can think about it
right now, there's probably

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.530
some people who say, OK, I
already said, some people will

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.760
do these models and try to make
their own assumptions and

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.039
say, OK, this is going
to give me 9% a year.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.580
But there's a whole bunch of
people who are going to say

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.450
this is just too complicated
for me.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.740
This seems risky.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.980
I don't have any fancy models.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.560
I only like to invest
in things where I

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.120
know I get my money.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.580
Very highly rated debt
is where I'm going

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.390
to invest my money.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.850
And there's another group of
people who say, OK, 9%, that's

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.670
nice and everything, but I'm
a hotshot, I'm a gambler.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.280
9% isn't the type of
returns I want.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.670
I want to take more risk
and more return.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.690
And so there should be
something, maybe, for those

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:10.500
people as well.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.650
So that's what we're going to
show you in the presentation

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.970
on collateralized debt
obligations.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.460
See you soon.
