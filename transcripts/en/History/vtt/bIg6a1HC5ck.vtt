00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.380
I’m a turn ’em loose so we can
play with them a little while.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.290
[kisses] Hey, puppies!

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.040
You know,
they’re progressing good.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.120
They learning.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.460
Each time you take ’em out,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.580
they get a little better
and a little better.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
The mama had
a little bitty short tail,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.210
and the daddy had

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.580
a regular sized tail,
big old beagle tail,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.040
and they all
took after the mama.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.080
[kisses]

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.830
[whistles]

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.380
Half rabbit dog
and half squirrel dog.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.580
[kisses]
Come on, puppy!

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.420
I love raising puppies.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.960
I’ve raised puppies all my life
and trained them.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.210
Should have been working ’em

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.620
a little more
than I been working them.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.540
I usually start ’em when they’re
a little smaller than this.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.790
These are kind of big.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.420
I shoulda
had ’em started already.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.250
But they gonna catch on.
They catch on quick.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.750
Rabbit season’s
just around the corner.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.420
When they gonna be
about six months old,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.330
I better take ’em in the woods
and go rabbit hunting.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500
[whistles]

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.670
Can you tell Pa what that is?

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.830
- It looks like,
um, coon tracks.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.120
- No. That’s rabbit tracks.
Coons got long fingers.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
See, that’s a rabbit track,
little short and pointy.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000
Remember, they always
comes to a point,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580
that little rabbit,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.540
and it’s about the size
of the end of your finger.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.080
Look at ’em.
They got that nose down.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.290
They’re smellin’.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.830
[puppies bark]
- A rabbit!

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.830
[puppies bark]

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.080
- Come here, Rascal!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.500
Come here, Ras!
[laughs]

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.330
Run, little rabbit, run.
[laughs]

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.880
There’s one
that can’t even come close

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.460
to keeping up with the rabbit.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.250
That rabbit
got a good hidin’ place.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.790
He let the puppies get close.
He plays with the puppies.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.000
He lets ’em get close,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.920
and then he takes off
into the trees.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.580
- There’s a hole kind of...

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.290
See that hole over there
in that tree.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.120
Something similar to that,
but it’s perfect for a rabbit.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.500
And he goes straight into that
hole in the tree every time.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.120
Come here, puppy!
[kisses]

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.250
They’re still lookin’ for him.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.290
Good job, little puppy!

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.290
Good job!

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620
- Yeah, they fast
for three months old.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.380
Not as fast as you,
though, bubba.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.250
You was faster
than the puppies, huh?
