00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.980
Today we’re going to be making muffins.
But trust me, this is one recipe you won’t

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.240
be able to find in the kitchen cookbook. In
this project we’re using backyard science,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.720
and a bucket full of soda cans, to make a
batch, of mini metal biscuits.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.040
Let’s start this project with the mini metal
foundry we made in another video, and a big

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
bag of charcoal briquets. These might look
like the kind for BBQ’ing and grilling,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.390
and that’s because they are. When 5 briquets
are spaced evenly at the bottom, we’re ready

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.420
to add a crucible. Like this one I made out
of a steel fire extinguisher. And I’ve found

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.730
that putting the container on a layer of charcoal,
helps melt the cans faster once we fire it

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.270
up. Now let’s connect a 1” steel pipe
through the “air supply” port on the side

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.949
of the foundry. This will get the fire hot
enough to melt metal, but we still need a

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.230
way to shoot the air in. We could just blow
through it, but a much better idea, is to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.030
use a hair dryer. Which you can find at most
thrift stores for about $3. Now I taped the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.510
hair dryer to some PVC pipe and inserted a
couple of 1” couplings, to connect the steel

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.550
tube at one end, and give the blower tube
a quick release feature. This way it’s super

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.380
easy to take apart, and fits into a 5 gallon
bucket for easy storage. Now since the blower

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.410
tube is at a strategically placed angle, it’s
really helpful to support it so it doesn’t

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.220
strain the foundry. This little trick will
help keep the walls from cracking, and increase

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.340
the life of the unit dramatically. Now that
the foundry’s all set up, let’s fill it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.530
to the top with charcoal, and breathe some
life into them the same way you’d light

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.990
up your BBQ. My tool of choice is a propane
torch because it gets everything heated up

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.300
in a hurry. The coals are burning, so let’s
flip the hair dryer to the “low” setting,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.230
and blow a steady stream of oxygen on the
charcoal to really heat things up. You can

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.920
see how the cover we made, keeps the heat
inside, so it conserves energy while it’s

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.920
bringing up the temperature. The coolest part,
is that the crucible, lines up perfectly with

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.100
the hole in the center. Alright, with that
warming up, let’s round up some soda cans,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.200
like these ones I got from a local recycling
depot, and this important tool that makes

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.490
the whole operation possible. A pair of steel
tongs from the dollar store. After 10 minutes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.720
you can see the foundry is scorching hot,
and the handles probably are as well, so let’s

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.920
use the tongs to carefully remove the top
without getting burned. You can see the steel

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.690
crucible is glowing orange, and that means
it’s ready for action. The container is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.330
3” wide, which is the perfect size for melting
standard sized soda cans like these. And at

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.700
temperatures over 1,000ºF, you can see it’ll
liquify them, in just a few seconds. Now I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.410
cranked it up to full power to melt more cans
in a hurry, and averaged around 10-12 cans

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.350
per minute. The cool thing, is that it doesn’t
matter if the cans are dirty, painted, or

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.990
still have soda inside. The furnace eats anything,
and pulls out pure liquid aluminum, which

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.990
you’ll see in just a second. In my experience,
38-45 cans produce around 1 lb of molten aluminum.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.070
And if you try crushing your cans first, you
can melt them with the cover in place, so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.080
less metal will get oxidized in the process. Now
after liquifying about 50 cans you can see

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.720
the container is completely full, but there’s
a lot of gunk floating around that we really don't need.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.500
The easiest way to isolate the aluminum is
with something like this steel cake pan, I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.490
got at the thrift shop for $.50. First, let’s
go ahead and carefully remove the crucible,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.840
making sure we’ve got a very secure grip
with our tongs. Then very slowly, pour the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.890
liquid into the steel mold. You can see the
slag stays behind, and almost acts like a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.310
strainer, helping prevent anything solid from
flowing down-stream. Now that we’ve separated

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.800
the good stuff out, why don’t we tap the
container on a slab of concrete, and dump

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.490
out the dross.  By keeping our crucible clean,
we can use it again right away. Now just for

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.260
fun, I tried melting a bunch more cans, so
I could pour them into a brand new cupcake

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.970
pan. The hope here, is that this fancy pan,
will give a cool and unique look to the aluminum

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.340
ingots, when they cool. The pan is made of
steel, but it’s catching fire because the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.760
non-stick coating is burning off, but this
will be the only time it does that. After

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.160
a couple of minutes, you can see the ingots
have hardened, but they’re still blisteringly

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.580
hot. So much so, that they’ll ignite a piece
of paper instantly, just by touching it. Now

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.400
it’s a really good idea, to have a bucket
of cold water nearby so you can cool them

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.510
down. When they drop into cold water, you
can see they’re still hot enough, to bring

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.680
the water to an instant boil. But after about
10 seconds, they cool to the point where you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.310
could pick them up bare handed, if you wanted
to. Now I also tried pouring ingots in a mini

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.849
muffin pan, to get a smaller variety, and
ended up with some really adorable, mini metal

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.810
muffins. These ones are actually my favorites
now because they’re so easy to work with.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.310
The purpose of an ingot is to keep some pure
metal handy for when you want to make something

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.090
cool. So now that we have some, all we have
to do is fire up the foundry and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.250
toss a few nuggets into a clean crucible.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.780
This setup can liquify ingots in 5-10 minutes,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.150
and check this out .. by melting clean ingots,
there isn’t any dross we have to fish out

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.910
either. Instead, there’s only a thin skin
of aluminum oxide. Which means this entire

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.690
crucible, is full of molten aluminum, ready
for casting. I tried pouring mine into a 5

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.680
gallon bucket filled with sand, and one other
specialty item. Which you can see bursts into

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.120
flames and absorbs two full pounds of liquid
metal. After 5-10 minutes the metal is hard

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.980
enough to grab onto with a pair of channel
locks, so we can break the mold and reveal

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.160
the casting inside. Watch for how to make
something like this in another project video.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.960
When it’s time to clean up, all the metal
working tools fit conveniently, into a 5 gallon

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.780
bucket, and when the foundry has cooled down,
the handle makes it easy to flip over and

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.320
dump out the ashes. Cleanup is quick, and
when you replace your potted plant, you can

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.370
see the whole thing reverts to it’s innocent
disguise as fashionable home decor. Well now

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.139
you know how to turn scrap aluminum soda cans,
into shiny metallic muffins, which you can

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.330
simply admire with pride, or use to make just about anything you want. Well that’s it for now. If you

Behold, the sword, that was pulled from the
sand. Hey guys, this was just a prototype

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.760
for another project video I’m working on,
but hundreds of you left comments asking me

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.560
to give it away. So, I will oblige, and I’ll
give it as a gift, to one of you. But before

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.440
I explain the rules on how to win, we should
really take a second to thank Audlble.com
