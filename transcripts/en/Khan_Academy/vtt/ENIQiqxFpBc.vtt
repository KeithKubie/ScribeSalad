00:00:01.077 --> 00:00:02.878
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.878 --> 00:00:06.209
is explore continuity over an interval.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.485
But to do that, let's refresh our memory

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:10.951
about continuity at a point.

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.779
So we say that f

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.862
is continuous

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.172
when

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.403
x is equal to c,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.251
if and only if,

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:24.002
so I'm gonna make these
two-way arrows right over here,

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.442
the limit

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:26.275
of f of x

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:29.659
as x approaches c

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.242
is equal to f of c.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.929
And when we first introduced this,

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.062
we said, hey, this looks
a little bit technical,

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:37.911
but it's actually pretty intuitive.

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:39.404
Think about what's happening.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:41.830
The limit as x approaches c of f of x,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.631
so let's say that f of x as x approaches c

00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:47.106
is approaching some value.

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.501
So if we approach,

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.742
if we approach from the left,

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:52.398
we're getting to this value.

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:55.048
If we approach from the right,
we're getting this value.

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:57.921
Well, in order for the
function to be continuous,

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.984
if I had to draw this function
without picking up my pen,

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:03.815
well, the value of the
function at that point

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.735
should be the same as the limit.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:10.367
This is really just a more
rigorous way of describing

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.469
this notion of not having
to pick up your pencil,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.243
this notion of connectedness,

00:01:14.243 --> 00:01:15.712
that you don't have any jumps

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:18.876
or any discontinuities of any kind.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:19.891
So with that out the way,

00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:24.007
let's discuss continuity over intervals.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:25.621
Let me delete this really fast,

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.438
so I have space to work with.

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:31.752
So we say, so I'm gonna first
talk about an open interval,

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:33.276
and then we're gonna talk
about a closed interval

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:35.888
because a closed interval gets
a little bit more involved.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:36.805
So we say f

00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:38.725
is continuous

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:43.071
over an open interval from a to b.

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.694
So the parentheses instead of brackets,

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:48.999
this shows that we're not
including the endpoint.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.164
So this would be all of the
points between x equals a

00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:53.664
and x equals b,

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:57.590
but not equaling x
equals a and x equals b.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.934
So f is continuous over
this open interval,

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.740
if and only if,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.990
if and only if,

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:06.973
f is continuous,

00:02:06.973 --> 00:02:08.223
f is continuous

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.465
over

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.216
every point in,

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:14.549
over every point

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:17.914
in

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:18.997
the interval.

00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:23.112
So let's do a couple of examples of that.

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:26.025
So let's say we're talking
about the open interval

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.855
from negative seven

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.272
to negative five.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.635
Is f continuous over that interval?

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.358
Let's see, we're going from negative seven

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:37.775
to negative five,

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:40.301
and there's a couple of
ways you could do it.

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:42.852
There's the
not-so-mathematically-rigorous way,

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:45.041
where you could say, hey,
look, if I start here,

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.374
I can get all the way to negative five

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.649
without having to pick up my pencil.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:51.348
If you wanted to do more rigorously

00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:53.567
and you actually had the
definition of the function,

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.112
you might be able to do a proof,

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.239
that for any of these
points over the interval,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.612
that the limit as x approaches
any one of these points

00:03:00.612 --> 00:03:03.315
of f of x is equal to
the value of the function

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:04.496
at that point.

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:06.609
It's harder to do when
you only have a graph.

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.518
When you only have a graph,

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:08.881
you can only just do it by inspection,

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:11.327
and say, okay, I can go from
that point to that point

00:03:11.327 --> 00:03:12.798
without picking up my pencil,

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:15.866
so I feel pretty good about it.

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.884
Now let's do another interval.

00:03:17.884 --> 00:03:20.344
Let's say the, so let me
put a check mark here,

00:03:20.344 --> 00:03:21.986
that is continuous.

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:26.341
Let's think about the
interval from negative two

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.258
to positive one, the open interval.

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.542
So this is interesting
because the function

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:34.611
at negative two is up here.

00:03:34.611 --> 00:03:36.501
And so if you really wanted
to start at negative two,

00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:39.360
you would have to start here
and then jump immediately down

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.262
as soon as you get slightly
larger than negative two

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:42.775
and then keep going.

00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:44.068
But this is an open interval,

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:45.671
so we're not actually concerned

00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.103
with what exactly happens at negative two,

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.195
we're concerned what happens when we are

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.386
all the numbers larger than negative two.

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:57.093
So we would actually
start right over here,

00:03:57.093 --> 00:04:00.157
and then we would go to one.

00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.317
And once again, based on the intuitive

00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.702
I didn't have to pick up my pen idea,

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:07.995
this function would be continuous

00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:08.828
over this,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.819
over this interval.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.804
So what's an example of an interval

00:04:13.804 --> 00:04:16.221
where the function
would not be continuous?

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:19.287
Well, think about the interval from,

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:20.694
well, this is a pretty
straightforward one,

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:24.221
the open interval from three to five.

00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.236
The function is here
when x is equal to three.

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:28.991
But if we wanted to get to five,

00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:31.033
it looks like we're asymptoting,

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:34.581
it looks like we're
asymptoting up towards infinity

00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:37.476
and we just keep on going
for a very long time.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.498
And then we would have to pick
up our pencil and jump over,

00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:44.779
and then we would come
back down right over here.

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:48.852
And so here we are not
continuous over that interval.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:51.051
So now let's think about the more,

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:52.578
the slightly more involved interval.

00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:54.328
The slightly more involved case

00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:56.505
is when you have a closed interval.

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.755
F is continuous

00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:02.431
over the closed interval from a to b.

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:05.002
So this includes not just
the points between a and b,

00:05:05.002 --> 00:05:06.837
but the endpoints as well,

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:08.087
if and only if,

00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:10.097
f is

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.530
continuous

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.363
over the open interval

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.101
and the one-sided limits.

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.009
Let me right this.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:19.842
And

00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:21.815
the limit

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:25.061
as x approaches a

00:05:26.072 --> 00:05:27.239
from the right

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.753
of f of x

00:05:29.753 --> 00:05:31.336
is equal to f of a,

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:33.327
and the limit

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:37.147
as x approaches b

00:05:37.147 --> 00:05:38.314
from the left,

00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:41.511
from the left of f of x

00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:44.019
is equal to f of b.

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:47.117
Now what's going on here?

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:49.662
Well, it's just saying
that the one-sided limit,

00:05:49.662 --> 00:05:51.986
when you're operating within the Interval,

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:54.925
has to approach the same
value as the function.

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:58.308
So for example, if we
said the closed interval

00:05:58.308 --> 00:06:01.644
from negative seven to negative five,

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.009
well, this one is still reasonable,

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.156
you know, just based on the
picking up your pencil thing.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.653
You don't have to pick up your pencil.

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:10.372
And what you would do is at the endpoint,

00:06:10.372 --> 00:06:11.584
and at negative seven,

00:06:11.584 --> 00:06:14.101
this function is just
plain old continuous,

00:06:14.101 --> 00:06:16.761
but if it wasn't defined over here,

00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.369
it could still be continuous
because you would do

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:21.377
the right-handed limit towards it.

00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:22.837
And you'd say, okay,
the right-handed limit

00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:24.748
is equal to the value of the function.

00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:27.075
And then at this endpoint,
at the second endpoint,

00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:29.385
you'd say, okay, the left-handed limit

00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:32.371
is equal to the function, even
if it wasn't defined here,

00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:35.698
even if the two-sided
limit were not defined.

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:37.890
And so we could actually
look at an example of that.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.637
If we were looking at

00:06:39.637 --> 00:06:42.118
the interval from the closed,

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:44.516
and you could have one
side open, one side closed,

00:06:44.516 --> 00:06:47.764
but let's just do the closed
interval from negative three

00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:49.514
to negative two.

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:53.219
So notice I did not have
to pick up my pencil.

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.584
I'm including negative three,

00:06:54.584 --> 00:06:57.435
and I'm getting all the
way to negative two.

00:06:57.435 --> 00:07:00.320
If you knew the analytic
definition of this function,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.300
you could prove that, hey, the
limit at any of these points

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.535
inside, between negative
three and negative two,

00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:08.351
is equal to the value of the function.

00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:11.145
Negative three, the function
is clearly, at negative three,

00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.052
the function is just plain old continuous.

00:07:13.052 --> 00:07:16.187
The two-sided limit approaches
the value of the function.

00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:19.324
But at negative two, the
two-sided limit does not exist.

00:07:19.324 --> 00:07:21.179
When you approach from the left,

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:23.051
it looks like you're approaching zero.

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.785
F of x is equal to zero.

00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:26.833
When you approach from the right,

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:29.954
it looks like f of x is
approaching negative three.

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:33.532
So even though the two-sided
limit does not exist,

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:35.188
we can still be good

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:39.150
because the left-handed limit does exist.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.979
And the left-handed limit is approaching

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:44.099
the value of the function.

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:47.356
So we actually are continuous
over that interval.

00:07:47.356 --> 00:07:49.367
But then if we did the interval,

00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:53.828
if we did the closed
interval from negative two to

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:56.166
negative two to one,

00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:57.543
pause the video and think about,

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.270
based on what we just talked about,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.043
are we continuous over this interval?

00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:06.219
Well, we're going from negative two

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.052
to one,

00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:10.563
and negative two is the lower bound.

00:08:10.563 --> 00:08:13.072
So is this right over here,

00:08:13.072 --> 00:08:15.112
is this right over here true?

00:08:15.112 --> 00:08:19.143
Is the limit as we approach
negative two from the right,

00:08:19.143 --> 00:08:22.353
is that the same thing
as f of negative two?

00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:24.302
Well, the limit as we
approach from the right

00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:26.520
seems to be approaching negative three,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.237
and f of negative two is zero.

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:31.779
So this limit does not, this, this,

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:35.130
these two things, the limit
as we approach from the right

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.606
and the value of the
function are not the same.

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:39.881
And so we do not have
that, I guess you could say

00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:42.470
that one-sided (laughs)
continuity at negative two.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.770
And that also makes sense.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.243
If I start at negative two,

00:08:45.243 --> 00:08:46.856
let me do this in a color you can see,

00:08:46.856 --> 00:08:48.293
if I start at negative two

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:50.924
and I want to go the rest
of the interval to one,

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:52.545
I have to pick up my pencil.

00:08:52.545 --> 00:08:55.339
Pick up my pencil, go here,
and then keep on going.

00:08:55.339 --> 00:08:59.506
So this is, we are not
continuous over that interval.
