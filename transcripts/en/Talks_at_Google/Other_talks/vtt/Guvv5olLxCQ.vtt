00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.730
MALE SPEAKER: Our guest today
is a renowned astronomer,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.510
and a member of the National
Academy of Sciences,

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.385
with award-winning
accomplishments documented

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:09.017
in about 700 research papers.

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:11.350
As the Richard and Rhoda
Goldman Distinguished Professor

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.687
in Physics and Physical
Sciences at UC Berkeley,

00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:15.520
he's been voted the
best professor on campus

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.390
a record nine times, and
was named the Carnegie-CASE

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.850
National Professor of the Year
among doctoral institutions

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.540
in 2006.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.394
In 2011, the Nobel
Prize in Physics

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:26.060
was awarded to the
leaders of two teams,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.601
for the discovery
of the accelerating

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.066
expansion of the universe.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.440
Those two teams had one member
in common, and here he is.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040
Please welcome Dr.
Alex Filippenko.

00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:43.280
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: So, I'm
very pleased to be here today.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.160
This is my first time
at the Googleplex,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.900
and it's been fun
wandering around and seeing

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.990
your neck of the woods here.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.920
What I'd like to describe
today is the discovery

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.810
of the accelerating
expansion of the universe.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.540
And the reason that
I wanted my slides,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.370
I mean I can tell the 5
or 10 or 15 minute version

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.090
without any props whatsoever
to various people,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.910
but since this is
a Google audience,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.820
I thought I'd
actually use graphs,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.720
which is something you can't
do for the general public,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.690
of course.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.730
But I wanted to give you some
of the inside scoop of how

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.989
the work was done.

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:19.780
So if we could have
the next slide, please.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.656
This is unfortunate because I've
got 100 slides or something,

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:24.530
so you're going to have
to listen to my cues.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.790
I'll say Next, all right?

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.690
Go ahead, next.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.290
This is going to
happen really a lot,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.456
so you're not going to be
able to read the newspaper

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.500
or something while I'm
giving my talk, OK?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.510
Thank you so much.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.580
Anyway, in 2011 the
Nobel Prize in physics

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.600
was given to these
three gentlemen.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.700
The Nobel Prize went to the
leaders of the two teams

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.590
that discovered the accelerating
expansion of the universe.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.010
Saul Perlmutter, at the Lawrence
Berkeley Lab and the Department

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.110
of Physics at UC Berkeley,
was the head of the Supernova

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.330
Cosmology Project, and I was
associated with that team

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.540
initially.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.330
And then there was Brian
Schmidt's High Redshift

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.120
Supernova Search Team, with
which I was later associated.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.220
And then my
post-doc, Adam Riess,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.630
who did a lot of the work
in the mid- to late 1990s,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.760
he actually made the
measurements of the data

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.530
when he was a
post-doc in my group.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.900
And he was the first author
on the Schmidt team paper,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.560
and I'm glad that he was
awarded the prize as well.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.190
It's unfortunate
that the prize can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.970
go to only three
people, at most.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.000
This is unlike the
Peace Prize, which

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.510
is handled in a
very different way.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.590
That's the rule, or at
least the tradition.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610
But these gentlemen understood
that without the other 48 of us

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.770
working in the trenches,
the discovery would never

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.700
have been made.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.210
So they spent a good
fraction of their prize money

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.010
flying the rest of us out to
Stockholm in December of 2011

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.620
to participate in Nobel Week.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.410
And that was just an amazing set
of celebrations and parties--

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.410
everyone just sort of
cheering for science.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.349
It was like the
Swedish Super Bowl.

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.390
Anyway, if you could go
to the next slide please,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.260
you can see the High Redshift
Supernova Search Team

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.340
right after the awarding
of the gold medal

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460
to Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.620
And the rest of us like to
say that besides the handshake

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.610
from the King of
Sweden, the gold medal,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.760
and a share of the $1.5 million,
we experienced everything else

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.360
that Nobel Week was all about.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.710
So we got most of what
there was to offer.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.860
But it was really a lot of fun.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.510
If we could go to the
next slide, please.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.700
The story starts of
course with Edwin Hubble,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.500
who discovered the
expansion of the universe.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.740
Next, please.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.159
He examined galaxies, which
are these giant collections

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.450
of hundreds of billions of
stars, gravitationally bound

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.270
together.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.950
And he devised a way to
determine their distances.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.140
I'll discuss that
method in a few minutes.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.600
He also looked at their spectra.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.270
Next, please.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.330
And the spectra were
all red shifted.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.740
That discovery was actually
made by Vesto Slipher

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.780
some one decade earlier.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.500
So these various spectral
lines, due for example

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.330
to neutral sodium and hydrogen
and singly ionized calcium,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.830
the whole pattern was
shifted to the red.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.740
And he found-- next,
please-- that the relatively

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.610
nearby galaxies had small
red shifts for their spectra.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.790
And-- next slide, please-- the
more distant galaxies, which

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.649
typically appear smaller
and fainter in the sky

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.470
had bigger red shifts.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.330
And this can be interpreted
in terms of a motion.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.380
And you've all heard the audible
Doppler effect, of course.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.590
But in fact, we
now know-- and this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.520
is something that Hubble
himself resisted for awhile-- we

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.400
now know-- next
slide, please-- I'm

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.230
just showing you a graph
of a low red shift galaxy,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.580
in fact one that's very near us.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.400
It's moving away very little--
zero kilometers per second

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.090
is very little.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.840
And then one that's
moving away at a tenth

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.890
of the speed of light.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.740
And you can see the same pattern
of lines, but shifted over.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.810
OK, next please.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.390
We now know that this red shift,
the cosmological red shift,

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.950
is caused by the
expansion of space itself.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.100
So it's not as
though the galaxies

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.630
are moving through some
pre-existing space,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.210
like bullets flying
around outside.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.650
Rather, it's a stretching
of space itself.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.810
And we can tell by, for
example, looking at the surface

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.480
brightness of galaxies, looking
at the brightness per unit

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.180
area, it turns out that the
brightness per unit area,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.520
as a function of
red shift, differs

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.360
if you have a truly expanding
universe versus a universe

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.560
through which
objects are moving.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.970
And the data agree
with the expansion

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.580
of space interpretation for
the cosmological red shift.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.730
Next slide, please.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.810
So from our perspective,
here we are in the middle

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.220
and all these other galaxies
are moving away from us

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.510
with a speed that's
proportional to their distance,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.300
because the stretching of
space is greater for the more

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.990
distant ones than
for the nearby ones.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.510
And there's something a bit
strange about this diagram

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.780
as I've drawn it.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.067
What's weird about it?

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:53.150
Yeah, we're in the middle.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.899
Why would that be?

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:56.580
Do these other
galaxies not like us?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.750
Do we smell?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.190
Is it something we said?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.720
Or are all these other
galaxies lactose-intolerant?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.220
Get it?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.820
Milky Way galaxy,
lactose-intolerant?

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.640
Anyway.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.660
When I tell my students
at Cal about cosmology

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.670
and the expanding universe,
I say, what is it?

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.340
Are we from Stanford
or something?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.620
With due apologies to the
many of you who I'm sure

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.520
are Stanford alumni, or even
on the faculty like Peter.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.470
It's truly an outstanding
institution, it really is.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.330
Just not quite as
outstanding as Cal.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.970
But anyway, we don't think
we're in any central location.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.190
Next slide, please.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.880
This is a property of any
uniformly homogeneously

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.280
expanding universe,
such that any galaxy,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.660
any raisin thinks
it's at the center

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.660
because the dough is
uniformly filled with yeast,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.090
and you let it bake for an hour.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.750
And let's say it doubles
in size in that time.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.900
You see all these other
raisins going away,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.912
but your friend
sees the same thing.

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:55.870
And by the way, the
universe is either infinite

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.500
or it wraps around
itself, so don't

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.080
worry about the
finite size here.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.650
So there is no center, at
least not in the dimensions

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.790
that we can physically probe.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.560
There may be a
mathematically valid center.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.880
For example, here's a
two dimensional universe.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.160
It's closed.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.640
The laws of physics in
this hypothetical universe

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.350
only act within
the rubber itself.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.940
And the creatures
in this universe

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.440
could figure out the
equation for their universe.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.550
R is a constant.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.920
Theta and phi go through 0 to 2
pi and 0 to pi, so R theta phi.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.550
But they only live on a
two-dimensional surface.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.550
Or x squared plus y
squared plus z squared

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.230
is a constant square
of the radius.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.390
Again, three variables, three
spatial dimensions, but they

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.450
only live in two of them.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.420
The center of this
balloon is the center

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.960
of this expanding universe.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.780
That's in a mathematically
describable, but physically

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.350
inaccessible dimension.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.650
So we may live in a three
dimensional version of this.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.070
We actually don't know the
true shape of our universe,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.980
so we're not sure.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.200
Next slide, please.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.810
In any case, we're not
in any central location.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.570
So here's what I never show
to the general public--

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.689
a graph of Hubble's law,
the recession speed.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:08.480
Oh, you've got one.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:08.979
Great.

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:11.879
Thank you so much.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.170
Let's see if it goes backwards.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.490
Ooh, it does go backwards.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.460
Goes forward, too.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.280
Thank you so much.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.100
Thank you.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.480
It's good-- there's a
time symmetry in physics.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.830
At the microscopic level, if
you reverse the arrow of time,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.410
everything looks
the same, which is

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.621
why entropy and the arrow of
time is such a bizarre thing,

00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:30.120
right?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.470
But anyway, here's Hubble's law.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.860
The speed of a galaxy caused
by the expansion of space

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.600
at any given time is
proportional to its distance,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.100
with the constant
of proportionality

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.489
being given by
Hubble's constant.

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:45.030
And it's a constant
only in the sense

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:48.500
that it's the same everywhere
in the universe at a given time.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.760
The value actually
changes with time,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.730
so the knot here just means the
constant at the present time.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.230
And you get the
recession speed just

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.550
by multiplying the speed
of light by the red shift.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.630
OK, so that's Hubble's law.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.390
And with today's
telescopes, we've

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.110
measured the current rate
of expansion pretty well.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.640
It's, for those who care, of
order 70 kilometers per second,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.870
per megaparsec.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.950
Megaparsec is about a 3 and
1/4 million light-years.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.280
But we expect the expansion
rate to change with time.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.500
And this is quite obvious.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.040
The universe has galaxies in it.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.250
All of them are going to
be pulling on each other.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.150
That should slow down
the rate at which

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.580
the universe is expanding.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.060
This is a clear prediction
in general relativity.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.710
It's true also in
Newtonian gravity.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.870
If I toss the apple, the
mutual gravitational attraction

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.980
between the Earth and
the apple slows it down,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.100
brings it to a halt.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.350
Eventually it comes back.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.220
So in the case of the universe,
if the density of the universe

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.330
is sufficiently high,
then the slowing down

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.460
of the rate of expansion
will be quite large.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.780
And eventually the universe will
stop and reverse its motion.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.000
So it'll collapse in on itself.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.970
It will implode.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.840
So you could start
with a Big Bang,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.650
with a Big Crunch,
a dense hot state.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.760
Or you could say,
Big Bang, Gnab Gib,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.030
which is Big Bang backwards.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.350
OK, so in that kind of a
universe, in an empty universe,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.050
you have no slowing down.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.340
But if you have a dense
universe, then the separation

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.250
between two arbitrary
clusters of galaxies--

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.460
the so-called scale factor-- it
increases, but at a slower rate

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.350
and then reaches some maximum
height, then comes back down.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.150
That's of course a graph
of this apple's motion.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.550
So in that kind of
a universe, you'd

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.430
be looking at the galaxies,
you'd be lying on your back.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.390
They're getting fainter
and smaller with time.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.230
You would say it's
a good universe.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.540
And then you would notice
something a bit peculiar.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.960
And right around
now, you'd start

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.380
getting a little bit nervous.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.810
And then it would be,
oh, goodbye cruel world.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.017
So that's what the
universe would do.

00:10:48.017 --> 00:10:49.600
That would be the
fate of the universe

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.550
if we live in a dense
universe, a universe where

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.880
the average density
of gravitating matter

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.380
is greater than some
critical density.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.590
This is known as omega matter.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.810
So if omega matter
is greater than 1,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.450
you have this critical
universe-- overly critical

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.560
universe that
collapses on itself.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.410
But you could have
a universe that

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.500
doesn't have quite
so much matter.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.920
And it would slow
down the expansion,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.550
and it would asymptotically
approach 0 as time approaches

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.620
infinity.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.500
So this would be a universe in
a sense like the apple thrown

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.100
at a speed equal to the
escape speed from the earth.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.750
It keeps on going away forever.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.820
It doesn't quite ever stop.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.160
And then you could have
a low density universe,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.910
which is analogous
to an apple thrown

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.510
at a speed greater
than the escape speed.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.080
So it keeps on going away
forever, asymptotically

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.480
approaches some non-zero
positive velocity.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.160
And most measurements
of the matter density

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.490
suggested that we live in
a universe that's only 30%

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.050
of this critical density.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.500
So if that's the case, and
you're lying on your back

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.260
and looking up at
the galaxies, they'll

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.110
keep on getting fainter and
smaller forever, all right?

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.080
And that's a very different fate
compared with the Big Crunch.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.810
This eternal expansion
is a very different fate.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.430
And cosmologists, those
who study the structure

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.260
and evolution of the
universe as a whole,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.100
want to know what the fate
of the universe will be,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.160
just because.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.660
All right.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.150
Well, you could measure the
average density of matter,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.080
compare it with this
critical density,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.000
and figure out what
universe you're in.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.200
But that's a hard thing to do,
because matter comes in clumps.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.830
It comes in these clusters.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.000
And the clusters have
dark matter in them.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.610
And then there's
voids that don't

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.190
have much material in them.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.860
So it's hard to get a
representative volume

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:39.700
of the universe.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.040
And moreover, you're not sure
you're seeing everything,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.180
even gravitationally you're not
sure you're seeing everything.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.880
So another technique
is to examine

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.880
the past history
of the expansion.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.410
And I like to go back
to the apple analogy.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.750
If I measure the apple's
speed at many different times,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.850
and its trajectory,
then I can see

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.080
how much it's been
slowing down, figure out

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.840
whether it will ever stop
and implode on itself.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.980
All right.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.720
In a similar way, if we
measure the rate of expansion

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.210
in the past at many
times, and compare it

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:11.830
with what it is
right now, we could

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.100
predict the fate
of the universe.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.210
The way to do this is
to essentially look back

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.840
into the past and see
which of these curves

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.520
the universe has been following.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.110
Clearly it's not
an empty universe.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.190
So this is just an
extreme approximation.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:31.070
But the universe, if what other
astronomers are telling us,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.740
should be behaving
something like this.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.960
We should see the
universe following

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.420
that kind of a trajectory.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:43.340
So let's focus in on the
time period before now.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.020
We're 13.8 billion years
into the universe right now.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.370
So let's look at this, OK?

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:52.450
Now, the definition of the
redshift is the following.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.610
A given red shift is simply
the size of the universe now,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.480
divided by the size
of the universe,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.440
or the scale factor, as it was
when the light was emitted.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.250
So redshift 0-- well, 1 plus
0 by advanced mathematics

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.410
is 1, that just means we're
looking at the universe now.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.430
A red shift 1 means that
we're looking at the universe

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.310
back when essentially
all distances were

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.770
half of their present value.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.090
So arbitrary
clusters of galaxies

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.747
were separated by half of their
value, of their present value.

00:14:26.747 --> 00:14:27.330
So here we go.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.090
There is now, t equals now.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.360
There's redshift 0.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.940
Suppose we look at redshift 1.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.420
Suppose we look at
galaxies at redshift 1.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.060
All right.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.050
Then you'll notice that
the lookback time-- that

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.990
is, how far back in
time we're looking--

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.750
depends on which
universe we're in.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.220
Take a look at this here.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.870
In a dense universe,
we're looking back

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.760
in time some amount,
some billions of years.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.700
And the distance is the speed
of light times the time.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.090
So if we measure
the distance, we

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.690
can figure out
the lookback time.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.740
In a less dense universe, the
lookback time-- the distance--

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.620
is bigger.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.470
In an even less dense
universe, the lookback time

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.440
and the distance at a given
redshift are even bigger.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.430
In an empty universe,
for a given redshift,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.830
you're seeing as far back
as you could possibly see.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:23.130
So we expect, then, looking
at different redshifts,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.310
we expect to measure
different distances,

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.540
or different lookback
times, and the universe

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.290
should be-- the data should be
following one of these lines.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.620
And the observer's view of
this theoretical diagram

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.850
is the following.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.090
At small redshifts, you
just have Hubble's law.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.860
That just means that the
slopes of all these curves

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.690
are the same right now.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.460
That's just-- the universe
is expanding right now,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.930
with whatever rate
it's expanding.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.890
That's just a given.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.450
And two clusters of galaxies
have whatever separation

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.330
they have right now.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:01.510
That's just a given, too.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.940
That's why all these models
have to converge at now.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.550
Their slopes are equal, and
their separations are equal.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.610
So the slopes differ very
little at small redshifts.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.160
That's what you're seeing
down here, Hubble's law.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.830
But as you go to
bigger redshifts,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.410
you start seeing deviations
from Hubble's law.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.970
At a given redshift--
I'm sorry, I hardly ever

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.900
use a laser pointer anymore--
at a given redshift,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.040
you can see the dense
universe-- well, that galaxy,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.950
is at a smaller distance than
in a less dense universe.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.010
And that's a smaller distance
than in a less dense universe.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.200
The empty universe, well,
that's where the distance

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.100
is the biggest for
a given redshift.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.960
So the procedure is clear.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.000
Measure the
distances of galaxies

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.330
having a wide range of redshifts
and see which of these curves

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:53.330
the universe has been following.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.860
Various observers told us
we would find this result.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.570
But we wanted to see.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.560
So how do we do that?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.070
Well redshifts are easy to get.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.750
You just take spectra of
these little blobs here,

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.000
all these are little galaxies.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.250
There's only a couple of
stars in our own Milky Way

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.800
galaxy in the Hubble
ultra-deep field.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.060
So you take their spectra,
and that gives the redshift.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.200
That's easy.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.859
The distance is a
little bit harder.

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:18.569
We will define,
what I will call it,

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.619
luminosity distance
in the stock.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.450
That's simply the
distance of an object,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.930
d sub L, such that the
light that you see,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.560
the given brightness b,
follows the inverse square law.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.310
So that's just a
luminosity distance.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.620
There are many
distances in cosmology,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.050
and you've got our
remain consistent.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.780
So you need something
of known luminosity.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.320
You need to know L, and you
measure the brightness b.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.810
And that allows you to
derive the distance.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.140
The measurement of the
brightness is easy, but how do

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.550
you know the luminosity?

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.810
Well, you need what astronomers
call a standard candle,

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.650
or a standardizable
candle, something

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.780
that is always the same,
like a 100-watt light bulb.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.820
And it's just like the
judging the distance

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.090
of an oncoming car at night.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.260
You've calibrated how
bright the headlights

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.180
of a car of known distance are.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.220
And you look at cars whose
headlights are fainter,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.100
and you figure out
their distance.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.580
If you're not very good at
doing this almost intuitively,

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.260
you shouldn't be
driving at night.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.840
So Hubble did this
with a type of star

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.190
known as a cepheid variable.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.470
And you might think, oh
it's a variable star,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.330
so that's no good.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.860
But it turns out that there
are certain categories

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.880
of cepheid variables.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.660
And the point is, you know
what their true luminosity is.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.880
And let's just look at
that one right there.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.610
Let's call it Mike,
just for kicks, OK,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.780
because he introduced me.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.310
What if you know that Mike
is just like Betelgeuse,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.360
the left shoulder of
the great hunter Orion?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.520
Magnificent, luminous
star Betelgeuse is.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.980
It's relatively nearby.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.960
We know its distance.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.293
We know its apparent brightness.

00:18:50.293 --> 00:18:51.360
We know the luminosity.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.490
We know its oomph.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.340
If we then look at Michael
in that other galaxy there,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.310
we can figure out its distance
from the inverse square law.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.860
And then if we get the same
answer with star Vikram

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.150
or something like that, we
start gaining confidence

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.160
that we're using
the right technique.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.000
So this is what Hubble
used to determine

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.150
the distances of galaxies
in the mid-1920s.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.820
And he was the one who
showed what many suspected,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.760
and that is that these
spiral nebulae are far,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.200
far outside our
Milky Way galaxy.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.280
And our view of the universe
expanded by a gigantic amount

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.890
with that realization.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.320
Well, these galaxies are so
faint and fuzzy and distant

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.200
that you can't see individual
normal stars within them.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.350
But it turns out, there
is one type of star

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.390
that is visible,
even from distances

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.690
of billions of light years.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.760
And that's the supernova,
an exploding star.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.340
Very few stars explode at
the end of their lives,

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.380
but those that do are
critical to our existence,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.800
because we are made of the
carbon, oxygen, calcium,

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.190
iron that get spat out of
exploding stars like this.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.120
So we owe our existence
to this phenomenon.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.980
Anyway, they become very
bright, in some cases--

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.540
up to a few billion
solar luminosities.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.234
So if our sun were to do
this, then sunblock of 50

00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:13.400
just wouldn't cut it, folks.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.630
You'd need sun block,
or supernova block,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.730
of a few billion to
protect yourself.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.130
But don't worry, be happy.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.030
Our sun isn't going to do this.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.770
So the name of the game is to
find some of these supernovae

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.410
in galaxies whose
distances we already know,

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.399
because we can see relatively
normal stars like Mike

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:32.190
and Vikram in them.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.170
So we know the distance
of this galaxy.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.770
We measure the apparent
brightness of the supernova.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.270
That allows us to determine
its true luminosity.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.920
But it's hard to find
these supernovae,

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.790
because they occur only once
every few decades in a given

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.610
galaxy.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.730
So if I were a
really cruel adviser,

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.620
I would have each of
my students looking

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.270
through the eyepiece
of a telescope

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.620
at one and only one
galaxy, preferably

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.520
at night-- you see
more galaxies at night

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.800
than during the day-- until
that student finds a supernova.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.610
Then we let them graduate and
move on to greener pastures.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.200
Meanwhile I will have had
decades worth of slave labor

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.662
out of said student.

00:21:05.662 --> 00:21:07.120
Well, if there are
some crimes that

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.120
are so egregious that even
a tenured professor can

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.640
and should get fired, then
that would be one such crime.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.110
Of course, I could
have my students

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.900
look at thousands of galaxies.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.700
These are random,
independent phenomena.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.510
So if they look
at more galaxies,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.770
you'll find more supernovae.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.330
But that would be considered
cruel and unusual punishment

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.744
as well.

00:21:24.744 --> 00:21:27.090
Fortunately, with
modern technology,

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.360
we have a better way.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.810
We attach CCD cameras to the
eyepiece end of a telescope,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.240
take photographs of
thousands of galaxies,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.230
and then simply look for arrows.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.080
And where you see an arrow,
you see an exploding star.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.770
You see once, twice, three
times, four times, five times.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.680
By the process of rigorous
mathematical induction,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.160
I conclude that this
must work every time.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.290
So obviously, it's
not that easy,

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.920
otherwise we wouldn't give
degrees for this kind of work.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.340
What we've done
is we've developed

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.700
a robotic telescope
at Lick Observatory,

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.820
just a two-hour
drive from Berkeley,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.510
or a little bit over an hour
from the Googleplex here.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.810
In fact, Mike
showed me the view,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:05.970
which was a bit hazy today.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.136
Couldn't quite see it today.

00:22:07.136 --> 00:22:08.840
But I'm sure many
of you have seen it.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.280
This is not a big
telescope, but it's

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.440
been programmed to look at
lots and lots of galaxies.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.290
And it's one of
several telescopes

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.070
at Lick Observatory,
Mount Hamilton.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.560
Go and visit it
one of these days.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.800
Great place to go.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.670
And my close
associate, Weidong Li,

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:27.010
programmed this telescope to
look at nearly 10,000 galaxies

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.590
a week, and to automatically
compare the new pictures

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.930
with the old pictures.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.030
And through the magic
of digital subtraction,

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.235
here's the template.

00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:38.110
Here's the new image.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.035
This is, by the way,
a negative image.

00:22:40.035 --> 00:22:42.160
These aren't all black
holes, otherwise black holes

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.610
would be easy to find.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.134
Anyway, so here's a
supernova candidate.

00:22:47.134 --> 00:22:49.050
And here's something
that the software thought

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.790
was a cosmic ray, just a charged
particle that hit the detector.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.160
And here's a poorly
subtracted star.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.750
The image quality varies
with time a little bit,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.680
as mirrors point in different
locations, their shape changes.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.400
So you get maybe a few
dozen candidates per night.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.760
And when you're observing a few
dozen-- 1,000 galaxies a night,

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.016
you only expect maybe
a supernova candidate

00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:14.140
every three or four nights.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.510
So most of these are going
to be not real things.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.560
They could be cosmic rays, or
maybe an asteroid with Earth's

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.770
name written on it,
hurtling toward us.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.030
One person's garbage is
another person's gold.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.060
Someday, astronomers
and engineers

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.410
will save humanity by
finding the asteroid that's

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.000
30 years from hitting us.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.650
And then they'll go
and they'll deflect it.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.110
So anyway, we have maybe a few
dozen candidates per night.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.340
And then I use slaves-- I mean
undergraduate students-- who,

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.570
with their superior
eye/brain combination,

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.510
examine these
candidates, determine

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.460
which ones are worthy
of further investigation

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.320
because they're likely
to be supernovae.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.065
And I'm very proud of my team,
because I get students, even

00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:59.710
in their freshman and sophomore
year, hands-on experience

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.250
with real data analysis.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.500
And occasionally I've even
had high school students,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.220
and they write home to Mother
when they discover a supernova,

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.790
and it's just really great,
because they get very jazzed.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.870
And most of them
don't go on and become

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.430
professors of astrophysics.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.414
That's probably good.

00:24:13.414 --> 00:24:14.830
There's enough of
us in the world.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.280
They go on to become
engineers, computer scientists,

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.210
applied physicists-- people
who are more immediately

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.800
useful to society.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.020
But the hook was the
cool stuff in the cosmos,

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.470
and the research experience that
they get as part of my team,

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.370
and other teams at
Berkeley and Stanford

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.797
and other great institutions,
is really invaluable.

00:24:33.797 --> 00:24:35.630
And something I don't
need to tell you guys,

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.330
but I think we are losing our
technological edge in the US.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.060
And we have to shape up, or
we will be quickly passed up.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:46.700
Anyway, so-- what's that?

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.800
A supernova?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.994
Brightens over maybe three
weeks, fades over a few months.

00:24:51.994 --> 00:24:53.410
I'll do more
questions afterwards.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.820
I realize some of you
will need to leave,

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.320
so I'm kind of
rushing a little bit.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.830
But I'll be very, very happy
to answer more questions later.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.060
But yeah, I sped up the process
and that animation so as to not

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.910
bore you.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.690
So we find them, and then
it's important to take

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.630
their spectra.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.010
And so we collect the
light, for example,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.540
with the 3-meter telescope
at Lick Observatory.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.550
And I have undergraduate
and graduate students

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.050
involved heavily in that
stage of analysis as well.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.170
And the spectrum tells you
what kind of a supernova

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.010
you're looking at.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.790
There are different ways in
which different kinds of stars

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.890
can explode.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:30.220
And only some of them are
luminous enough to be useful,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.750
and standard enough.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.510
If you've got light bulbs
of a huge range of lumens,

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.000
that's not going to be so good.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.530
The ones that are useful for
cosmology are the so-called

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:41.970
type 1a's.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.260
You have this roller
coaster of a spectrum.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.820
There's the calcium
in your bones,

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.120
the oxygen that you breathe.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.590
This is real life stuff.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.300
We are made of
star stuff, right?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.160
So type 1a supernova
is useful, because it

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.560
comes from a very
weird type of a star.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.790
Our sun will become a white
dwarf in about 7 billion years.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.730
But fear not, it won't blow up.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:04.680
A white dwarf is a
weird sort of matter

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.670
called degenerate
matter, not because it's

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.670
morally reprehensible,
but this is simply

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.660
the term quantum physicists
give to a very, very highly

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.210
compressed state of matter,
where all the electrons are

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.510
basically in their own little
cubbyhole, pigeonhole, energy

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.010
level.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.710
And they can't occupy
the same energy

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.550
levels and the same
quantum states,

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.017
and so they exert this
weird degeneracy pressure

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:26.600
on each other.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.830
It's truly magnificent.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.040
It's unlike any sort
of thermal pressure.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.820
Anyway, if you have a white
dwarf in a binary system that's

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.820
sufficiently tight,
then that white dwarf

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.180
can steal material
from the other star

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.560
and approach a mass
which becomes unstable

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.030
and it undergoes a
thermonuclear runaway.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.040
And it happens at about
the same mass each time,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.840
1.4 solar masses.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.730
And the thermonuclear
runaway occurs

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.980
in about the same way each time.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.860
And it's very luminous-- four
billion solar luminosities.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.760
So these are excellent and
pretty standard candles.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.400
And they can be
seen very far away.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.490
But we want to look at
them in great detail,

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.020
because it turns out they're
not perfectly standard.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.880
So here are some
spectra that my team

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.190
took a little over 20 years ago.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.670
And we started noticing-- we
took these spectra at Lick-- we

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.440
started noticing that the
spectra of these things

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.030
are not all identical.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.840
So here's a pretty
normal one, 1990N,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.200
and there's this line here.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.600
But you see it's weaker
in that supernova.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.120
And then in the
supernova it's stronger.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.560
And then this supernova also has
this weird absorption feature,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.710
which is due to
titanium, it turns out.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.820
So they're vaguely similar,
but there are differences.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.390
Here there's some clear
differences as well.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.220
So not all type
1a's are the same.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.700
That turned out to be a
very important realization

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.070
in the early 1990s.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.120
We can't treat them all as
being identical objects.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.810
And moreover, these
guys, it turns out,

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.260
are on the whole subluminous.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.630
These are overluminous, compared
to the more or less vanilla

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.090
flavored type 1a supernova.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.580
So if you don't take
that into account,

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.430
and you're looking at some
distant type 1a supernova,

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.530
and you don't know
the true luminosity,

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.710
you will get an incorrect
distance, and hence

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.580
an incorrect lookback time.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.350
So it's totally important
to take this detail

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.710
into consideration.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.070
Not all the headlights
are the same, simply put.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.560
And you've got to know which
kind you you're looking at.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.530
Well, the next realization
was that, oh wow.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:33.650
Turns out the luminous
type 1a supernovae

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.560
have slower light curves.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.940
That is, they rise and
decline more slowly

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.740
than the subluminous ones.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.290
And the normal ones are
sort of right in here.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.030
So if you find a whole
bunch of nearby ones

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.340
whose distance is known, and
you calibrate this relationship,

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.050
then you can look at the
distant high redshift ones,

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.380
measure the light curve
and say, aha, this

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.560
is a 94-watt light bulb instead
of a 100-watt light bulb.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:02.210
Or maybe it's a
115-watt light bulb.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.860
So instead of
saying, well, they're

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.710
all 100 watts with a
dispersion of 50 watts,

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.290
you can say no, this one's 94
plus or minus 13, or something

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:10.980
like that.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.820
You really improve the precision
of the distance measurements,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.530
and hence of the lookback times.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.210
And this is what really allowed
the type 1a's to become useful

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.530
in cosmology, and to ultimately
lead to this amazing discovery.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.290
Well, this relationship
here was first pointed out

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.220
by Mark Phillips and
then Mario Hamuy in Chile

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.550
gathered a whole bunch
of type 1a supernovae

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.990
and showed, or
sort of calibrated

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.950
the relationship even better.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.140
And then my former post-doc
Adam Riess, who at the time

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.750
was a grad student
at Harvard, used

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.612
their sample, the
Chilean sample,

00:29:48.612 --> 00:29:51.810
to calibrate type 1a supernovae.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.430
And then he took a new
set of type 1a supernovae.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.320
OK, this is a different
setup here, in the top graph,

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.760
and he applied this machinery.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.530
Here we have the supernovae,
if you treat them

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.910
as a standard candle-- 100
watts plus or minus 50-- you

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.030
see all kinds of
dispersion here.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.330
Moreover, there are
some huge outliers.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.880
When you take into account this
luminosity light curve shape

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.060
relationship, and
when you also take

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.370
into account dust and
other interstellar

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.680
debris, through which
the light is going--

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.930
that I won't go into
the details of-- you

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.400
decrease the
dispersion to one third

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.940
of what it used to be--
15% rather than 45% or 50%.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.910
And these outliers go right
down to where they should be.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.710
So the technique works well.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.440
So that's what
gave us confidence

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.400
that we could use type
1a's to do cosmology.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.260
And although my robotic
telescope did not

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.680
contribute to the
original sample that

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.930
was used to define
this relationship,

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.960
it has been used since that time
to refine this relationship,

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.470
and decrease our resulting
scatter more and more.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.430
So we're calibrating these
things better and better

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.630
with time.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.480
And in fact, one of my most
recent graduate students,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.860
Mohan Ganeshalingam
did a thesis on this.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.930
And here you can see
the various light curves

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.320
that we have collected
with Kate and you

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.050
can see very clearly that
the more luminous guys have

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.490
slower light curves than
the less luminous ones.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:33.150
And so here is Mohan's Hubble
diagram without any correction.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.770
It just looks like
crap, sort of.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.650
I mean, it's pretty bad.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.930
And you can't do precision
cosmology with that.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.580
You can tell the
universe is expanding,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.810
but you can't do
precision cosmology.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.490
Whereas when you apply our
machinery, look at that.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.230
I mean, that's fantastic.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.030
This is a relatively
nearby sample,

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.690
but this is the
kind of confidence

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.710
we need to get before going on
and doing this great redshifts.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.760
Now, it turns out
that Wayne Rosing, who

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.750
used to be Vice President of
Engineering here, has gone on

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.600
and started this thing called
the Las Cumbres Observatory

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.250
Global Telescope Network.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.540
He's got a network
of little telescopes

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.500
all over the world,
with which we

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.110
can follow variable
stars and exploding

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:16.380
stars throughout the
24-hour day/night cycle.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.740
Their motto, I think,
is the sun never

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.310
rises on the Las Cumbres
Observatory Global Telescope

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.920
Network.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.750
So Wayne, partly
based on the success

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.470
we had with our Kate
telescope-- and in fact,

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.830
he very generously
helped fund that

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.100
telescope-- he has now
globalized this whole thing

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.230
and is pursuing one
of his passions.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.070
So it's fantastic.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.220
He's a good friend of mine.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.280
Anyway, now that we've gained
some confidence with the nearby

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.050
ones-- and it's 2 o'clock, but
you'll permit me to go longer,

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:54.070
right?-- let's go and do
the actual cosmology now.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.750
Let's find these things
in distant galaxies.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.700
Now, let me remind you,
there are two reasons

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.770
you want to find the
distant supernovae.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.020
The first reason is, by
the observed brightness

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.010
compared to the luminosity,
you get the distance and hence

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.370
the lookback time.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.790
And from the spectrum,
you get the redshift.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.500
So the supernova is critical
for two reasons-- a distance

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.080
through the inverse square
law, and a red shift.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.610
So, we find these things with
a wide-angle cameras attached

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.500
to relatively big telescopes--
this is in Chile, Cerro Tololo

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.000
Inter-American
Observatory-- and modern,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.100
wide-angle CCD cameras actually
are these gigantic things.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.357
It's amazing what the
silicon revolution

00:33:36.357 --> 00:33:38.190
has done, not just for
computers, of course,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.080
but for astronomical
imaging technology.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:48.330
We now routinely have these
16k by 32k arrays of pixels.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.425
And this is about the
size of the full moon.

00:33:50.425 --> 00:33:52.530
Of course, the full
moon isn't rectangular,

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.660
but this is roughly the
size of the full moon.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.900
And in this picture,
there are literally

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.240
thousands of galaxies.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.950
Nearly every blob
you see is a galaxy.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.030
So if you take
many such pictures

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.870
over the course of
a couple of nights,

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.600
and then repeat the
process three weeks later,

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.580
you will have taken the mug shot
of perhaps 100,000 galaxies.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.330
And in those three weeks,
some of those 100,000 galaxies

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.500
will have produced
a type 1a supernova.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.929
Indeed, several dozen
will if you do the math.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.739
So we did that, and through
digital subtraction,

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.300
here's a small subset
of one of those images,

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.630
taken on the 7th of April, 1997.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.620
Subtract that from
the 28th of April,

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.679
you get a bunch of noise.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.270
That's OK.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.850
Any measurement
process, as you know,

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:39.139
necessarily has some
noise associated with it.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.790
But here, cleverly placed
in the middle of the square,

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.170
is something that looks
like it might be real.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.427
And here's a Hubble picture
of it a few weeks later,

00:34:46.427 --> 00:34:48.010
and it's marked with
an arrow, so it's

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.760
got to be a type 1a supernova.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.392
I wish it were that easy.

00:34:51.392 --> 00:34:52.850
You don't know that
it's a type 1a,

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.350
and you don't know
it's the redshift

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.170
until you take a spectrum.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:00.480
So this was my main
job on both teams.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.400
I'm a trained spectroscopist.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.790
I've been studying supernovae
since the 1980s, the mid-1980s,

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.550
and I have access to the world's
biggest optical telescopes,

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.490
the twin Keck 10-meter
telescopes in Hawaii.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.290
And I urge you to visit
those, if you've not done so.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.210
They're an amazing
thing to look at.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.870
Here's Fred Chaffee, a
former director of Keck,

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.020
just showing you the size
scale of these gigantic eyes

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.560
that are gathering
light from afar.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.720
So with the Kecks, I could
get spectra of these type

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.840
1a supernovae that at redshifts
of, say, 0.455 in this case.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.810
This is a lookback time of
about five billion years.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.130
So we're seeing this thing as
it was five billion years ago.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:46.190
And lo and behold, the
spectrum to within the noise

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:50.090
looks very similar to a low
redshift type 1a supernova.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.890
So that's really great.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.210
So here's the punchline.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.510
Here are several of
these type 1a supernovae

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.190
that have been verified
through spectroscopy,

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.030
and whose redshifts
have been measured.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.590
And the punchline is
that they are faint.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.780
They're very, very faint.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.980
And you might say, well,
they're in these scrawny,

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.990
pathetic-looking galaxies that
are obviously very distant.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.970
Here you can't
even see the galaxy

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.480
before the supernova went off.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.060
Obviously, these are
distant galaxies.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.560
So the supernovae
should look faint.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.640
And that argument is
correct, but the point

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.350
is, they look fainter than
they had any right to be.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.664
For a given redshift, you
expect a certain range

00:36:28.664 --> 00:36:30.080
of brightnesses,
depending on what

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.770
the universe has been doing.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.780
And the measured brightnesses
were fainter than expected.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.930
Let me show you that.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:39.670
Here are the possible
models that we expected.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.800
Indeed, people told us that we
would measure probably this.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.740
a Theorists actually
prefer omega matter of 1,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.600
for reasons I can go into in
the Q&amp;A. But what we measured,

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.590
when we measured distance
luminosity, distance

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.930
versus redshift, was this curve.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.180
That wasn't-- in
a multiple choice,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.560
that was "none of the above."

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.470
And if you follow the natural
progression of omega matter,

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.560
this ratio of the average of the
true density of the universe,

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.350
critical density, greater
than one, 1.30 negative,

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:21.110
negative matter density,
which seems a bit odd,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.760
because we exist.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.960
And last time I checked,
I'm gravitationally

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.160
attracted to the earth, rather
than being spirited away

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.180
like on [? SpaceEx
?] or whatever.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.360
So here's a picture from
Adam Riess' lab notebook,

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.420
when he was in my group
in the fall of '97.

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.770
He has this little thing here.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.136
Omega matter is negative .36.

00:37:46.136 --> 00:37:48.610
Oh, gosh, I hadn't
taught him well yet.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.580
It should be negative 0.36,
because the decimal points

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.580
are easy to lose, right?

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.038
I hope you've all
been taught that.

00:37:55.038 --> 00:37:55.610
But, anyway.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.360
So there it is, negative matter.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.390
Well, the negative
sign is simply

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:06.310
indicating that we're witnessing
an accelerating universe rather

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.740
than a decelerating universe.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.590
The wrong sign, right?

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.210
So this is kind of weird.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.800
Well, I was actually
privileged to announce

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.090
this result for the
Riess/Schmidt group

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.220
for the first time
at a meeting in LA.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.880
And here's the
headline that came out.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.360
"Astronomers See a Cosmic
Antigravity Force at Work."

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.810
We use this term
"antigravity" hesitantly,

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.110
because people ask us, can we
attach this stuff, whatever

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:34.200
it is, to our cars and levitate
over Bay Area traffic jams?

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.520
And the answer is no.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.560
It's either a property
of space itself,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.394
or there's so little of it
that it'll never be harnessed.

00:38:40.394 --> 00:38:41.060
Never say never.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.880
But anyway, by December of '98,
the editors of Science Magazine

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.980
proclaimed this to be the
single most important discovery

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.410
in all areas of
science that year.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.840
And we were obviously
very pleased by this,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.170
but of course we're not
yet sure that it's true.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.300
But they said, well, look.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.460
Other physicists
and astronomers have

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.490
had the better part
of a year to find

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.440
an obvious flaw in
what you've done,

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.380
and no one has found
an obvious flaw.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.090
So either you're right or you're
wrong for some subtle reason

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.149
that will end up
teaching us something

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:13.440
interesting about the universe.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.180
And indeed, of course that's
generally how science operates.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.080
Now, the caricature
of Einstein looks

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.750
surprised here, not
because he's blowing

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.322
multiple universes
out of his pipe.

00:39:23.322 --> 00:39:25.780
You might not have known that
there are multiple universes,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.071
and they come from the pipes
of theoretical physicists.

00:39:28.071 --> 00:39:29.739
Well, the first
statement might be true.

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:31.530
And I'll be happy to
come back and tell you

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.810
about the possible multiverse.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.370
But he's surprised
because this one universe

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:38.200
is expanding faster
and faster with time,

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.110
rather than more
and more slowly,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.170
as one would expect in
normal general relativity.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.700
And he's doubly
surprised because he

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.750
has a sheaf of papers here where
there's an equation-- lambda

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.680
equals 8 pi g,
Newton's constant,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.702
times the density of the vacuum.

00:39:53.702 --> 00:39:55.910
And you might wonder, who's
this bozo from Berzerkely

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.576
talking about the
density of the vacuum.

00:39:57.576 --> 00:40:01.260
You were taught on your mother's
knee that the vacuum is sheer

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.190
emptiness-- zero, zilch, nada.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:07.130
How can it have a non-zero
energy or matter density?

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.310
Well, this was Einstein's
idea, not mine.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.380
And he was a lot
smarter than I am.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.170
So the point is this.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.620
Back in 1917, when he
developed the general theory

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.470
of relativity, its
basic attribute--

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.650
that is, gravity pulls--
remains the same as in Newtonian

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.790
gravity.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.210
So the universe should be
collapsing in on itself,

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.490
because all the galaxies
are pulling on each other.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.775
Or, maybe the universe
was born with a big bang.

00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:34.900
And in that case, the
universe should be expanding.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.900
But in any case, it should
be a dynamic universe,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.440
yet there was at
that time no evidence

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.600
for a dynamic universe.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.150
People thought it was static.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.840
And Einstein himself felt
that the static model

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.510
was very aesthetically pleasing.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.700
So he conjured up something that
was not aesthetically pleasing,

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.310
by his own admission.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:00.450
The cosmological constant,
which in this case, it repels.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.020
It's the opposite of gravity.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.070
So if you have something pulling
down and something pulling up

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:09.420
and the net force is zero,
you can get a static universe.

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.050
Or, if the universe started
in an expanding state,

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.350
then you could have a negative
cosmological constant.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:20.350
And that could
nullify the expansion.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.160
So you could get a static state.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.570
Turns out this is an
unstable solution.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:28.370
You can't have a static universe
for very long in this case,

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.200
because if you perturb this
galaxy a little bit inward,

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.200
it turns out that the
gravitational force increases,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.950
and it continues to go inward.

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:40.740
And conversely, if you perturb
it outward a little bit,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.750
then it turns out it
continues to go outward.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.990
So it wasn't a very satisfactory
solution in many ways.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.280
It also implied that the
density of the vacuum

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.470
is non-zero, which seemed weird.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.800
There was no experimental
evidence for that.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.270
And moreover, something
that seemed so finely tuned

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.690
like this seemed ad hoc.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.270
It seemed arbitrary.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:04.484
It did not make the
equations wrong.

00:42:04.484 --> 00:42:06.150
The cosmological
constant can be thought

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.180
of as a constant of integration.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.210
So that in and of itself
isn't so weird, other

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.000
than that it's a vacuum
energy that's non-zero.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.010
But even if there is this vacuum
energy, why the world should

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.400
its value-- why in
the world should

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.587
the value of the constant
be tuned to exactly match

00:42:23.587 --> 00:42:24.920
the attractive force of gravity?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.100
It just didn't seem right.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.890
So Einstein never liked it.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:33.410
He reluctantly included it in
his solutions for the universe.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.560
A dozen years later,
Hubble discovered

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.660
that the universe
isn't static after all.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.160
So the whole physical and
philosophical motivation

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.610
for this cosmological constant,
this ugly fudge factor,

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:44.670
disappeared.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.090
Einstein renounced
the idea, supposedly,

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:49.380
as having been the biggest
blunder of his career.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.310
Because had he not introduced
it, he could have been famous.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.370
He could have predicted that the
universe is in a dynamic state.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.237
So here he is, sad that he
ever introduced the idea.

00:42:58.237 --> 00:43:00.070
I don't know that that's
what he's thinking,

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.610
but it might be
what he's thinking.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.270
What have we done the better
part of a century later?

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.280
We've reincarnated the idea.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.570
Not to give a static
universe, but one

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.310
which, on the largest
scales, beyond about 100

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:14.660
million light years, is
accelerating in its expansion.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.680
So here in this room,
the down arrow dominates.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.310
Everywhere in our solar
system, it's down.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.720
Everywhere in our galaxy, down.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.140
But as you get to distances
of 100 million light years

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.450
or more, the up arrow
dominates and you

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.560
have an accelerating universe.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.390
And so Einstein's biggest
blunder, as he referred to it,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.600
may have been, in some ways, his
greatest intellectual triumph,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.520
conjuring up such a thing.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.770
And if he were around right
now to see the evidence that we

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.910
and others have amassed,
maybe his reaction

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:53.250
would be something like what
was in Science Magazine.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:57.390
So we now interpret this
omega matter less than 0

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:02.650
to instead be the cosmological
constant is positive,

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.140
or something like it.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.320
It's not necessarily Einstein's
cosmological constant.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.020
It could be something
having a similar effect

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.000
that on the biggest
scales, it leads

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.240
to this acceleration,
which is kind of weird.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.440
Anyway, you might
worry that, well, OK,

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.370
this is only out to four or five
billion light years in time--

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.150
I'm sorry, four or five
billion years in time.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:28.540
What would be the
predicted effect

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.580
if we were to look
back farther in time,

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.650
if something like the
cosmological constant

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.410
were really operating.

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:38.870
And there the idea is
actually pretty simple.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.230
The curve looks
something like this.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.530
The universe decelerates
originally, and then

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.390
after a while
starts accelerating.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.930
And the reason for
that is that long ago,

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.080
when galaxies were
closer together,

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.540
their gravitational
attraction for each other

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.420
was bigger than it is now.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.340
And the repulsion, if
it's a property of space,

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.360
or something within space,
was relatively minor.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.200
As the universe expanded,
the gravitational attraction

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.400
declined with time.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.850
It's a 1 over r squared force.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.060
But the repulsion
increased with time.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:14.230
If the repulsion is caused
by something in space,

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:17.290
or a property of space itself,
than the more space there is,

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.240
the greater is the
repulsive effect.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.490
So in a sense, gravity
is coming downward.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.640
Antigravity, if you
will, is going upward.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.000
And at some point, they cross.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.400
And that's where the
universe starts accelerating,

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.170
right around here somewhere.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.430
But the clear prediction was
that if we look far enough

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:37.470
back in time, we should see the
phase at which the universe was

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.950
decelerating, if
we found something

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:41.860
like the cosmological constant.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.770
So Adam Riess became
principal investigator

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.820
of a Hubble project that we
initiated to find and monitor

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.890
very distant supernovae-- seven,
eight billion, nine billion,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:57.040
or even ten billion
light years away.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.880
And we found that
indeed, the data

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.670
followed the predictions
of early deceleration.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:09.050
So we witnessed the phase
of early deceleration,

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.790
and then about five
billion years ago,

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.120
that transition to acceleration.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.180
A transition from
deceleration to acceleration--

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.450
that's mathematically
known as a jerk.

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:24.720
In fact, a jerk is any time you
have a nonzero third derivative

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.950
of position.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.160
So you have position,
velocity, acceleration, jerk.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.940
I actually didn't know that
until we made this discovery.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.010
So in a sense, we
witnessed the cosmos

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.400
as having gone through a jerk.

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.650
And the headline that came
out in the New York Times

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:44.780
was "A 'Cosmic Jerk' That
Reversed the Universe."

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.807
And there's my former
post-doc Adam Riess.

00:46:47.807 --> 00:46:49.390
So I start getting
these phone calls--

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.060
hey, who's this jerk
you work with who

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.610
reversed the expansion
of the universe?

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.240
Anyway, this isn't
the greatest photo.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.540
And Adam's mother was not
pleased by this juxtaposition.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.040
Right?

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.517
You never read the
articles in newspapers,

00:47:02.517 --> 00:47:03.850
unless you're really interested.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.380
You go flipping through them,
you look at the headlines,

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.255
look at the pictures.

00:47:06.255 --> 00:47:10.130
And only a small subset
do you have time to read.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:14.030
Well, so then what is this stuff
that's causing this effect?

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.340
It's clearly not the visible
matter of the universe,

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.430
because all normal
visible matter pulls.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:20.730
It's also not antimatter.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.740
You might think
antigravity, antimatter.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.020
Good try, but antimatter
has a positive gravitational

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:27.180
attraction.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.200
It's also not dark matter.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.880
Many of you have
heard of dark matter.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.130
You can see it
there, there, there.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.320
Lots of dark matter.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.200
It's what binds galaxies and
clusters of galaxies together.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.260
And I can't help but tell
you a small aside about one

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.770
of my heroes, Fritz Zwicky,
an astrophysicist at Caltech

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.940
who died just
before I got there.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.250
Actually, a few years
before I got there.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.150
He was the first to look
at clusters of galaxies

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:55.690
and realize that the individual
galaxies are moving around so

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:59.244
quickly that there's got be
sort of additional material

00:47:59.244 --> 00:48:00.910
there, holding the
whole thing together.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.760
Otherwise, they'd
go flying apart.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.200
And yet we see lots of
clusters of galaxies.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.450
They're not just chance,
superpositions of galaxies

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.670
passing through the night.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:14.120
So he suggested that there might
be such a thing as dark matter.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.960
And he was routinely
ignored, but he

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.950
was decades ahead of his
time on a number of issues.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.690
One reason he was
perhaps ignored

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.800
was that he was somewhat
arrogant and abrasive.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.400
Somewhat is being a
little bit polite.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.810
And he did not have
a great opinion

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.242
of the intellectual capacity
of his colleagues at Caltech.

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.200
And, you know, Caltech's
a pretty brainy place.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.680
So they didn't take well
to this implied criticism.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.170
And here, he may
be showing you what

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.874
he thinks of their
typical brain size.

00:48:41.874 --> 00:48:44.040
I mean, I don't know that
that's what he's thinking,

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.140
but he's on record as having
referred to his colleagues

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.270
as "spherical bastards."

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:52.370
Because they're bastards
anyway you look at them.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.760
And of course, a sphere
is the only object

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.610
that looks the same from
all directions, right?

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:00.290
I would not recommend that
you refer to your friends

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.100
as spherical bastards, or
your Google colleagues here.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.910
You will quickly end up
friendless, or colleague-less.

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.310
But anyway, I like Fritz a lot.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.550
Anyway, so dark matter
helps bind clusters

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:15.260
of galaxies, and even
galaxies together.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.960
Indeed, it's critical
to the formation

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.726
of clusters of
galaxies and galaxies.

00:49:18.726 --> 00:49:20.850
We wouldn't be here if it
were not for dark matter,

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.270
even though we're not
made of dark matter.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.120
But the acceleration has to be
something entirely different.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.400
It has to be something that
pushes in a sense, but not

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.110
enough to disrupt galaxies
and clusters of galaxies.

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:36.580
So the name that was given
to it, for better or worse,

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.380
was dark energy.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.780
It's dark, we don't see it.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:42.580
It's also mysterious--
in that sense, it's dark.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.260
Yet it's clearly
some form of energy.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.540
But the reason a
lot of us are not

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.880
entirely happy with that
term is that if there's

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.130
one equation that even people
on the street often know,

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.900
it's e equals mc squared, or
at least they've heard of it.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:59.350
So we're forever being asked,
are dark energy and dark matter

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:01.140
just two different
sides of the same coin?

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.920
And the probable answer is
no, even though we don't yet

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.600
know what the dark energy is.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.420
Anyway, in honor of the
Nobel Prize and stuff,

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.740
Noelle, my wife, who's
here, made this t-shirt,

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.450
"Dark Energy Is The New Black."

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:13.980
And she gave it
to the rest of us,

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.940
who did not get a share of the
one and a half million bucks.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:20.100
But you gave it to the
team leaders, as well.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.690
And she even got one to the
King of Sweden, we think,

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.750
if the courier gave it to him.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.390
So what is the dark energy?

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.470
The honest truth
is, we don't know.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.680
They're really hundreds
of possibilities.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.490
The possibility I
like most, and the one

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:35.810
that's still consistent
with the data,

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.010
is that the dark
energy is essentially

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:40.340
the zero point
energy of the vacuum.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.420
If you have quantum
fluctuations, which we know

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.820
occur-- they affect
the energy levels

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.970
of the electrons in a
hydrogen atom, for example.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:49.540
That's the Lamb shift.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.980
Then you have this energy and it
can cause an expansion of space

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.720
faster and faster if there's
a positive net energy.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.080
But theorists had
always said that, well,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.830
for every positive
energy fluctuation,

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.480
there's a negative energy one.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.060
In the parlance
of string theory,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.331
these are thermionic and
bozonic fluctuations,

00:51:09.331 --> 00:51:11.080
it turns out, if you
want to look them up.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.150
And people had always assumed
that they all balance out,

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:15.799
and the energy of
the vacuum is 0.

00:51:15.799 --> 00:51:17.340
And the main reason
for thinking that

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:20.170
is that the back of the
envelope calculation

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:23.080
suggests that
vacuum energy should

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.530
be 10 to the 120th power,
which is 20 orders of magnitude

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:29.490
bigger than a real Google.

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.250
Or I shouldn't
say a real Google,

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.520
the original Google, right,
is ten to the hundredth.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.870
The vacuum energy should be 10
to the 120th, 10 to the 122,

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.540
I think, if you want
three significant digits.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.297
And that wouldn't
even allow us to form.

00:51:41.297 --> 00:51:42.130
We wouldn't be here.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.380
Stars wouldn't be here.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.550
Galaxies wouldn't be here
if that were the case.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.830
So people had always
assumed it's 0.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:51.870
But if it's not 0 by
some weird circumstance

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:53.710
that we don't yet
understand, then it

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.950
turns out space itself has the
desired property of expanding

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:00.610
faster and faster with time.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.270
It's a very weird thing.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:06.030
And the data are consistent
with this interpretation.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.160
A lot of theorists don't
like this interpretation.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.450
They think it might be some sort
of a new field, a little bit

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.010
like the Higgs field
that's been in the news

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.780
so much the past year or two.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.530
And in fact, a whole category
of models of this order known

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.512
as quintessence, like the
Aristotelian fifth essence.

00:52:21.512 --> 00:52:23.970
You know, earth, air, fire,
and water, and the quintessence

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:24.910
out there.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.850
And there are hundreds,
if not thousands

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:27.850
of candidate theories.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.950
And the problem is,
all of them have

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:33.030
additional bells
and whistles that

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:36.020
are not super well
physically motivated.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.030
And the data do not agree
any better with those ideas

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.310
than they do with the simple
cosmological constant.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.300
So I'm betting on the
cosmological constant,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.440
but I may well be wrong.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.360
What we're doing now
is trying to trace,

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.670
in greater detail, the expansion
history of the universe

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:57.392
to set observational constraints
that will be used to rule out

00:52:57.392 --> 00:52:58.600
some of the candidate theory.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.680
So that's what we're
busy doing now.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.960
The other possibility,
other than dark energy,

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.840
is that general
relativity is wrong.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.820
For completeness, I do
need to mention this.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.440
Most theorists don't
like this possibility,

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.490
but it's not yet
completely ruled out.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.180
So maybe there
isn't a dark energy.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.460
Maybe instead, general
relativity is wrong.

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.686
But that would be a
pretty exciting thing too.

00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:20.560
Because we really do
think general relativity

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.450
is very beautiful, and
has an amazing theoretical

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.250
underpinning.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:28.850
Finally, you might worry that
all these conclusions are just

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:30.060
based on supernovae.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.630
I mean, that would
be pretty weak.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.770
I mean, what if there was
something different about them

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:35.410
long ago.

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:37.970
They used to be less
luminous than they are now.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.040
We have to look for
that possibility.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:43.607
And there are many things
I'm leaving out of this talk.

00:53:43.607 --> 00:53:45.440
That's why they pay us
the big bucks, right?

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.020
Yeah, right.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.720
So anyway-- in academia.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.947
So to figure out
the details, right?

00:53:49.947 --> 00:53:51.030
They pay us the big bucks.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:54.600
So in science, as you all
know, the more important

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.350
the discovery is,
the more important

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.820
it is to verify it through
completely independent

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.860
techniques.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.290
And so because there
were two teams that

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:05.630
made the same announcement
at virtually the same time,

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.370
a lot of physicists and
astrophysicists took note.

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.730
They started testing
this conclusion.

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.980
And let me just briefly
tell you about some

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:17.840
of the other tests which lead to
the same conclusion, basically.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.880
One is by looking at the early
afterglow of the universe,

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.100
the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.410
You can set lots of
interesting constraints

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:29.860
on the properties and
constituents of the universe.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.010
And in particular, here's a map
I'm sure all of you have seen.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.890
It's a baby picture, an infant
picture of the universe,

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:37.840
where the temperature
of the universe,

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.470
to a good first approximation,
is 2.7 degrees Kelvin.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.920
But at the one part
per 10,000 down

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.130
to one part per
100,000 level, there

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:48.850
are small variations
in temperature.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:50.200
That's what you're seeing here.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.580
They correspond to small
variations in density.

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.770
That's good, because it's from
those variations in density

00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:58.950
that galaxies and
clusters of galaxies

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.710
were able to
gravitationally form.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.620
So if the universe
were completely smooth

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.930
from the beginning, we wouldn't
be here talking about it.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:11.030
So from studies of the angular
sizes of these little freckles,

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:15.280
you can tell that the
universe, over large distances,

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.280
is Euclidean.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.750
It's flat.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.890
The sum of the interior
angles of a triangle

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:22.010
is always 180
degrees, for example.

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:24.430
And in general
relativity, that can only

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:27.430
be the case if the
density of the universe

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:29.020
is the critical density.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.170
And yet, we know the density
of normal matter is only 30%

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:33.420
of the critical density.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.980
So in a sense, you need
70% of something else.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.240
That's consistent
with the supernovae.

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.470
The something else
being dark energy.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.820
The other point is, you take
those little fluctuations,

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.260
and then you let gravity do its
thing over billions of years.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.630
And gravity, that
great sculptor,

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.970
sculpts the galaxies and
clusters of galaxies and voids.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:56.430
And when you do numerical
simulations, starting

00:55:56.430 --> 00:56:00.980
with this picture, which is
a map of the variations when

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.960
the universe was
380,000 years old,

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.690
and let gravity do
its thing, and you

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:09.870
don't include dark energy,
the final distribution

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.730
of galaxies and clusters
of galaxies in voids

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:17.010
differs, in an observationally
significant way,

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.530
from the observed
structure of the universe.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.260
Whereas when you include
dark energy in the mix,

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.730
then the final structure
ends up looking

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.340
like the observed structure.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.590
And this is the
observed structure,

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:32.420
based on measurements of
literally millions of galaxies.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.020
So that's another
piece of evidence

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.860
that the dark energy
really does exist.

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.080
And there are other pieces
of evidence as well.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.850
So that's why we really
believe it's true.

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:43.210
We think that the
composition of the universe

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.150
looks something
like this right now.

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.330
Dark energy is 70%
of the total pie.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.080
And we don't exactly
know what it is.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.040
In fact, we really
don't know what it is.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.646
Dark matter is most
of the remainder,

00:56:54.646 --> 00:56:56.270
and we're not sure
what that is either.

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:58.650
We think it might be
little particles left over

00:56:58.650 --> 00:56:59.800
from the big bang.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.130
WIMPS-- weakly interacting
massive particles--

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.730
but they've never been
detected in a laboratory.

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.295
I'm becoming mildly
concerned about that.

00:57:07.295 --> 00:57:11.340
The ordinary matter is only
5% of the total contents.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:15.720
And the easily visible ordinary
matter is only half a percent.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.102
So in a sense, we're the
debris of the universe.

00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:19.560
We're the afterthought
of creation.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.855
That's not to say you're
not important to yourselves,

00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:23.730
your loved ones, your
families, your friends.

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:27.030
But you're not made of the
dominant stuff of the universe.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:28.940
The dominant stuff
is the dark energy,

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.570
followed by dark matter.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.140
And we don't know what they are.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.460
So for the kids-- I go
and talk to kids sometimes

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.640
about this-- I tell
them, if anyone tells you

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.330
physics is dead and
there's nothing left

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.320
to be learned
about the universe,

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:46.110
you tell them, what about the
origin and detailed nature

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:49.950
of 95% of the contents
of the universe?

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:53.190
So this is one reason
cosmology remains so exciting.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:54.740
We don't know what
these things are.

00:57:54.740 --> 00:58:00.330
And moreover, dark energy may be
one of the few observable clues

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:07.940
that will allow us to
discard some of the ideas

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.290
for quantum gravity, of
which string theory is

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.920
a generic umbrella.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.660
Quantum mechanics works
great on small scales.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.050
General relativity works
great on large scales,

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:21.270
but the two together are
in violent disagreement.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.830
We are after a quantum
theory of gravity.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.620
Any quantum theory of
gravity that does not

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:30.400
account for the acceleration
is not a viable candidate.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.980
So this is one of the
few observational tests

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.610
we have of quantum
theories of gravity.

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:39.550
So because of its importance,
it was recognized with the Nobel

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:44.540
in 2011, and also because it had
been confirmed in so many ways.

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:46.380
We don't know what
the dark energy is,

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.800
but we are pretty
sure at this point

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.880
that the universe really is
accelerating in its expansion.

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.870
So here's a brief
history of the universe,

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:55.700
just to close things off.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.300
We think it began with some
sort of a quantum fluctuation,

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.680
maybe out of nothing.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.450
And then there were
quantum fluctuations

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:05.560
within this rapidly
expanding universe

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.970
that led to small variations
in the distribution of matter,

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:14.070
which then grew over time in a
universe that was decelerating.

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:15.790
And then in the last
five billion years

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:18.550
or so, it had
started accelerating.

00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:21.420
And recent data have
led to an update

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:25.740
of the age of the universe from
13.7 to 13.8 billion years.

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:27.860
And it did not take
us 100 million years

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.160
to gather those data.

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.250
It's just that-- anyway.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:36.760
So the universe aged 100 million
years in the last year or two.

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:38.630
So that's the history
of the universe.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.070
What will be its future?

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:41.810
How will the universe end?

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:46.260
Well, if the dark energy really
is the cosmological constant,

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.400
it'll never go away.

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.260
It will continue
to be repulsive.

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.380
The universe will expand
faster and faster with time.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.500
A runaway universe, I call it.

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.980
So if you want to see
a galaxy like this

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.830
with your very own eyes
through a telescope,

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.730
go up to Lick
Observatory, or Chabot,

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:05.490
or Morrison Planetarium, or
your local astronomy club,

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:09.290
and look through a telescope
soon-- within the next few tens

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:10.530
of billions of years.

01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:14.180
Because beyond that
time, all those galaxies

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.200
will be whisked away
to such great distances

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.920
that we will no longer see them.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.440
There's a possibility,
of course,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.197
that the universe
will recollapse,

01:00:23.197 --> 01:00:25.530
because we don't yet quite
know what the dark energy is.

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:28.260
But I think it's going
to expand forever.

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.140
Robert Frost didn't know
of these two possibilities

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.800
when he wrote his famous
poem Fire and Ice.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.280
I think it was actually based
on something in Dante's Inferno.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.560
But in retrospect, it's
very relevant to what

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.290
I've told you today.

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:43.320
The poem goes
something like this.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.610
Some say the world
will end in fire.

01:00:45.610 --> 01:00:47.290
Some say in ice.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:49.310
From what I've
tasted of desire, I

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.450
hold with those who favor fire.

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:55.400
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.350
to say that for destruction,
ice is also great

01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.750
and would suffice.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:03.340
So Frost would prefer
the recollapsing universe

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.420
that ends up hot and compressed.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.370
But if the universe and
he had to perish twice,

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:11.740
then eternal expansion
would be OK with him.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.870
And that's perhaps appropriate
given his name, Robert Frost,

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:18.400
right, and ending in ice.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.110
Well, anyway, this
research couldn't

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:22.940
have been done without the
help of many, many people

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.540
and federal foundations.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.580
I'm very, very grateful to them.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.680
I'm also grateful to
all the opportunities

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.170
I've had with like the Hubble
Space Telescope, the Keck

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.240
Observatory.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.760
And in particular
Lick Observatory,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.060
because this is where
a lot of the data

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.989
for the nearby
supernovae was gathered.

01:01:39.989 --> 01:01:41.780
And this is the
observatory where we really

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.750
train our students
and post-docs.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.600
And they can be
principal investigators

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.630
of their own projects, rather
than just helping me do things

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:51.890
that I define from
start to finish.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:57.100
So they grow in their
intellectual independence

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.700
by using these facilities.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.560
And my colleague Jeff Marcy has
discovered lots of exoplanets

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.060
there.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.370
So I'm very much a supporter
of Lick Observatory.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:10.150
I'm actually currently president
of the board of an organization

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:12.000
called Friends of
Lick Observatory.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.790
And we're actually
trying to raise money

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.590
to support Lick
Observatory, in part

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.090
because the University
of California

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:20.770
is highly financially
squeezed right now

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.170
and has told us that
we're doing great science,

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:26.020
but they can simply no longer
support the Observatory

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.740
anymore.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.710
So if you'd like
to join Friends,

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:33.130
let me know or you know
which search engine to use

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:37.680
to find a website
where you'll find this.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.460
And if you want to
support a place that's

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.710
cutting edge in its technology
and stuff, let me know.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.810
I'm also happy to
arrange a visit

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:49.150
for Google employees
and their friends.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:50.510
It's a great place to go.

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.140
You can look through the
old 36-inch James Lick

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.730
refractor at whose base
James Lick is buried.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:58.970
That's a wonderful experience.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:02.440
And at any time, if you guys
want to set up a Google Chat

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.390
and ask questions of me, or just
ruminate about the universe,

01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.710
I'm happy to do that
kind of thing as well.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.746
So there I am.

01:03:10.746 --> 01:03:11.870
You can find me on Google+.

01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:14.571
And it's been great visiting.

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:16.820
I hope there'll be a little
bit of time for questions.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.050
But thank you all for coming.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.740
AUDIENCE: So in your
graph, you have dark energy

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.840
as 70% of the content
of the universe,

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.557
Dark Matter is 25%--
but 70% of what?

01:03:38.557 --> 01:03:39.390
What is [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:42.370
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: So
let me go back to this pie.

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.340
The dark energy is
70% of the universe.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.570
70% of what?

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.470
The pie is the whole thing.

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:51.460
Whatever the density
of the universe is,

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.940
OK, that's the whole pie.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.580
Now, that density
we now know was

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.460
very close to the critical
density between what

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.230
we call a positively
curved universe,

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:05.366
a hypersphere-- like the
three dimensional balloon--

01:04:05.366 --> 01:04:06.740
and a negatively
curved universe.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.310
Hyperbolic space.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:10.830
Closest two-dimensional
example I can think of for you

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.980
is a horse's saddle.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.480
So we're right on
the dividing line.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.190
We're a flat universe
over very large distances,

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:20.110
ignoring black holes
and stars and all that.

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.140
Light travels along
Euclidean straight lines.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.690
So it's 70% of that density.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.530
But the point is, is this pie
could apply to the universe,

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:32.060
regardless of what
its density is.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.866
It's just, here's the whole pie
and there are its constituents.

01:04:35.866 --> 01:04:37.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:37.686 --> 01:04:39.600
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
It's energy en masse,

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.090
through e equals mc squared.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:43.480
It doesn't really matter which
one you're talking about.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.010
So this has me and you in it.

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:49.680
That's in the form
of ordinary matter.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.140
But it also has
something that we

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.280
think doesn't have
a matter component.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.770
It is a pure energy,
sort of like light

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.800
is a pure form of energy.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.660
Has zero rest mass.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.370
But dark energy is not light.

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:03.850
It's just-- it's a different
form of pure energy

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.040
which has what we call
negative pressure.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.980
And in general relativity,
it's the negative pressure

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.107
that causes the acceleration.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:14.850
AUDIENCE: So I've been
somewhat confused for a while,

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:18.190
I guess, about the
distinction between things

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.990
in space-- galaxies and
whatnot moving through space

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.410
and apart from each other--
as opposed to space itself

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:24.580
expanding.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.280
And so you're describing
this expansion

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.030
that causes redshift and
space itself expanding.

01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:30.500
But then you're talking about
the gravitational attraction

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.640
that would cause deceleration,
pulling things back together.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.500
That sounds like it would be the
object in space pulling things

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.100
together.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.740
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: So
that's a good, fine point.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.550
It turns out that in
general relativity,

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:44.130
you can consider a uniform
distribution of matter.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.120
That's the simplest universe.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.980
And the self-gravity
of the universe

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:52.720
itself causes the
fabric of the universe

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.410
itself to slow down
in its stretching.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:59.914
This is actually
part of the framework

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:00.830
of general relativity.

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:03.570
That, in other words, if we had
found that the universe isn't

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:06.240
behaving this way, we
would have been surprised,

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.810
based on general relativity.

01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:12.060
Now, within the universe, you
can also have pulling motions.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.220
So the Andromeda galaxy,
our nearest big neighbor,

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.960
is in our local cluster, our
local group, it's called.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.320
It is moving toward us.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.422
In fact, we're going to merge
in about four billion years.

01:06:24.422 --> 01:06:25.880
And after a couple
of billion years

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.660
of looking like
a train wreck, we

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.700
will turn into a different
type of galaxy altogether,

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.370
an elliptical galaxy.

01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:35.900
So those are motions
through space.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:37.790
They're called peculiar motions.

01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:41.110
And they're caused by
individual galaxies, or clusters

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.590
of galaxies, pulling
on each other.

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:46.640
Nevertheless, for the
universe as a whole,

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.850
you can treat that matter as
being uniformly spread out

01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:52.570
and ask yourself,
what effect does it

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:54.840
have on the universe as a whole?

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.560
And you get these different
amounts of deceleration.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.549
Or in the case of dark
energy, acceleration.

01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:04.090
Nevertheless, there are peculiar
motions within the universe,

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:04.670
as well.

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.760
It's like the raisins
tugging on each other,

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.610
and moving through the dough.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.130
That's happening as well.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.630
Yes.

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.480
AUDIENCE: So the space between
us and the Andromeda galaxy

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.550
is probably still
expanding, although--

01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:14.910
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.550
The space between us and the
Andromeda galaxy is expanding,

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:20.670
but the problem is that the
gravitational attraction

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:24.160
is so great that it
greatly dominates.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.060
But yes, strictly speaking,
if there were no dark energy,

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:32.150
we would be attracting that
Andromeda galaxy a little bit

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.090
more than we are.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.670
You're absolutely right.

01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:37.990
But it's a negligible effect
within a cluster of galaxies,

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:41.000
because the matter
density is so much greater

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.990
than this dark energy density,
whatever the dark energy is.

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.490
Yeah.

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:46.499
AUDIENCE: If space
itself is expanding,

01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:48.540
how does that relate to
the microwave background?

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.150
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah,
if space itself is expanding,

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.710
how does that relate to
the microwave background?

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:52.870
AUDIENCE: Did the
temperature [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:54.960
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
The microwave background

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.390
is the stretched electromagnetic
radiation from long ago.

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:03.640
So when the universe
was 380,000 years old,

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.870
its temperature had dropped
to about 3,000 or 4,000--

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.940
about 3,000 degrees Kelvin.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.850
At that point,
electrons combined

01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:15.440
with protons for
the first time ever,

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.890
a process interestingly
known as recombination.

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:21.614
Because plasma physicists
can ionize gases and then

01:08:21.614 --> 01:08:24.050
they watch them
recombine in their labs.

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.790
But it's happening
for the first time.

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:28.520
At that point, the
universe becomes

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.490
transparent to radiation.

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:32.500
Because you don't have
all these free electrons

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.550
that can easily scatter
electromagnetic radiation, OK?

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:39.010
At that point, 3,000 degrees,
well that's about the sun.

01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:40.600
It's half the sun's temperature.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:46.189
So the light waves back then
were optical and near infrared.

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:49.600
They have stretched
a factor of 1,000.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.390
In fact, the stretching factor
since that time is 1,079.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.020
We now know it quite precisely.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.760
So the waves have stretched
by a factor of 1,079.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.670
Their typical
wavelength right now

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.590
is in the microwave
region of the spectrum.

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:09.979
They preserve their black body
spectral energy distribution.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.450
It's just that now that
black body corresponds

01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:16.010
to 2.7 degrees, which,
you will realize,

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:19.560
is 3,000 divided by 1,079.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.920
So the microwave background
is the microwave background

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.424
because of the stretching.

01:09:24.424 --> 01:09:26.840
It's the wavelength that it
has because of the stretching.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:31.310
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
So the temperature

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:32.810
is going through a
jerk in the sense

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:36.479
that the universe is expanding
faster now than it would have

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.380
in the absence of dark energy.

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.399
So indeed, the temperature
of the universe

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.920
is going down
faster than it would

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.011
have in the absence
of dark energy.

01:09:45.011 --> 01:09:45.510
Yeah.

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:48.260
So the temperature, in a sense,
went through a jerk as well.

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:48.760
Yeah

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.968
AUDIENCE: Is that detectable?

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.950
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
Is it detectable?

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.920
Very good question.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.230
I believe the answer is that
in principle it's detectable.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:00.550
But it has not
yet been detected.

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:05.080
The way to detect
it is interesting.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.820
And indeed, there were
detections of the microwave

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.160
background long before
Penzias and Wilson.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.910
It turns out that certain clouds
of gas in interstellar space

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:20.320
had cyanogen molecules--
CN-- as well as others.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.880
And there are certain
transitions in the cyanogen

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.220
molecule that are excited by
microwave wavelength photons.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:33.540
But they're excited more if
the temperature of the universe

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.730
were slightly higher
than the current 2.7.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:41.630
So astronomers looked at
these clouds at redshift 1,

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:43.180
when by the way the
temperature would

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.830
have been 5.4-- 1 plus z times
the current temperature--

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:52.400
and lo and behold, the
transitions were clearly

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.530
stronger back then, because
the absorption lines produced

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:59.590
by those clouds of gas were
stronger than would have been

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.060
the case had the temperature
back then been 2.7.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.440
So in fact, we've measured not
only the microwave background,

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.530
but changes in its temperature.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.770
What has not been
done is studies

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:15.710
of enough molecular clouds
at a variety of redshifts

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:19.150
to see a transition in the rate
of change of the temperature.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:23.160
But in principle, I see no
reason that couldn't be done.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.730
That is very cool.

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:26.740
You're the first-- I
can tell I'm at Google.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.200
You're the first
person ever, ever,

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.570
to have asked me that question.

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:35.150
So I feel like I'm on a
thesis exam or something

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:37.500
here, where you have to
answer these kinds of things

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.070
really well.

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:39.380
Yeah.

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:40.320
Other questions?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.190
Right there, yes.

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:45.710
AUDIENCE: How do we
know the basic nature

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.760
of the cosmic microwave
background that

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.310
is coming from a
blast from the past,

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.527
as opposed to, say,
the void glowing?

01:11:52.527 --> 01:11:53.860
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah, yeah.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.130
So various people
have tried to think

01:11:56.130 --> 01:12:00.310
of ways of reproducing
the microwave background

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.020
radiation through local sources.

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.200
And in fact, iron
whiskers, turns out,

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.210
radiate in a way that
has some good properties.

01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:18.630
You can't get a perfect
single temperature background

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:24.490
if you've got objects at
different redshifts glowing,

01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.690
due to whatever process.

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:28.180
You'd need to somehow
finagle them all

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.030
to have a slightly different
intrinsic spectrum, such

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.180
that when you add
them all together

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.820
at these different redshifts,
all their contributions,

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.890
they end up giving
you a black body that

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:43.900
is better than the thickness of
the pen with which you draw it.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.760
That's how good the data are.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.880
I mean, the measurements
from Coby and Planck

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.310
and the W map satellites
are absolutely perfect

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:54.030
black bodies.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.670
And so we've thought of
no way of doing that.

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:58.760
And yet, if the
universe did begin

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.500
in a hot compressed state, for
which we have other evidence--

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.500
primordial abundances
of hydrogen, deuterium,

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.550
things like that
as well-- then you

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.590
would expect this afterglow.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:13.120
Indeed, George Gamow and
his students and post-docs

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.900
predicted it.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.290
So it's a natural prediction
of an expanding universe.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:20.750
And it's enormously
difficult and ad hoc

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:23.890
to conjure up in any other way,
is what I would say, I guess.

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:25.160
Yeah.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.910
AUDIENCE: So probably a naive
question about redshift.

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:31.490
So the light waves
generate long ago

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.760
because of the stretch of the
space got longer light wave.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.150
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
That's right.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:36.160
AUDIENCE: Wavelengths.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.900
But when the space is
stretched, doesn't the rule

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:41.840
for example, the way we measure
length, also get stretched?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.250
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah,
the lengths of the rulers

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.640
are not stretched.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.571
Indeed we're not expanding.

01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:51.070
I mean, you might
after a big lunch,

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.210
but that's your fault,
not the universe's fault.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:54.890
You're held by
electromagnetic forces.

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:57.450
And again, it's a
spring that's so tight

01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:59.480
that you can't stretch it.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.910
We're held to the
earth by gravity

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:03.280
in a way that's much greater.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.430
It easily overcomes the natural
tendency of space to expand.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:09.510
So even our local group of
galaxies is not expanding.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:12.360
Indeed, within it, Andromeda
is coming toward us.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.054
So if Hubble had only looked
at the Andromeda galaxy,

01:14:15.054 --> 01:14:17.470
he would have concluded that
the universe is collapsing in

01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:18.710
on itself.

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:23.890
The expansion of space
is only visible starting,

01:14:23.890 --> 01:14:27.670
oh, 4 or 5 million
light years out.

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:30.600
That's where the
density of material

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.860
and the strength of
gravitational fields and things

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:38.730
like that become low enough
that the stretching of space

01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:40.690
can start taking over.

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:43.680
But we and the rulers
are not stretching.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.680
They're held together
by a spring that's

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.553
so tight that you
can't stretch it.

01:14:47.553 --> 01:14:50.330
AUDIENCE: Or can I say that
actually the stretch is there.

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:52.600
It's just too small--
dominated by the other forces.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.480
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah,
the stretch is there.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.813
That's another way of saying it.

01:14:55.813 --> 01:14:57.900
But it's so overpowered
by the other forces

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.070
that it's not noticeable.

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:02.760
I'm very careful
to say it that way,

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.380
because even in
some textbooks, you

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.710
read the incorrect
statement that, oh yes,

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.120
of course our
galaxy is expanding.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.010
But because our galaxy is only
100,000 light years across,

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.190
if you put 100,000 light
years into Hubble's law,

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:21.210
you get a negligible
amount of expansion.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:22.760
That is a wrong explanation.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.290
You cannot put 100,000 light
years into Hubble's law.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:30.860
Because that would imply
that our galaxy is stretching

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.640
with the rest of the
universe unimpeded.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.510
And that's not true.

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:38.700
It is being impeded
by its local gravity.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.939
So just watch out.

01:15:39.939 --> 01:15:41.230
There's that subtle difference.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:42.820
And I didn't want
you to walk away

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:45.900
thinking that it's only
that our galaxy is small,

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.400
and therefore you can't
notice the stretching

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.680
over a distance of only
100,000 light years.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.620
It's more than that.

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.410
It's that our galaxy impedes
the stretching because

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:55.605
of its self-gravity.

01:15:55.605 --> 01:15:59.720
AUDIENCE: Light is
redshifted by the expansion,

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.850
then it seems like that light
is going to be losing energy.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.200
Does that energy go somewhere?

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.300
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO: Ooh!

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.420
Boy oh boy.

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.910
The light is indeed
losing energy.

01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:10.590
That's right.

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:14.450
Light has energy,
and therefore in fact

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:15.650
has a gravitational effect.

01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:19.040
In fact, you could have a
black hole whose interior

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.010
consists entirely
of light, before it

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.740
went into the singularity
and got eaten.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.730
But you can imagine creating
a black hole out of light,

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:31.160
because light has energy and
therefore it bends space-time.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.450
So in fact, what happens is,
in an expanding universe,

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:39.510
the light itself-- forget about
anything else in the universe--

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:42.730
the light itself is
impeding the expansion.

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:46.910
The light is doing
work on the universe.

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:51.850
And that is one way of thinking
of the redshifting of light.

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:53.440
It is losing
energy, because it's

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.511
doing work on the universe.

01:16:55.511 --> 01:16:56.510
Isn't that a cool thing?

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:57.760
That's an interesting insight.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.590
Yeah.

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:01.040
Very cool.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.144
And the universe is pretty
cool too, at 2.7 degrees now.

01:17:04.144 --> 01:17:05.810
MALE SPEAKER: So,
we're out of time now.

01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:07.893
We need to get Dr. Filippenko
to his next meeting.

01:17:07.893 --> 01:17:08.770
So thanks again.

01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:10.645
DR. ALEX FILIPPENKO:
Well, thank you so much.

01:17:10.645 --> 01:17:11.300
Thank you.
