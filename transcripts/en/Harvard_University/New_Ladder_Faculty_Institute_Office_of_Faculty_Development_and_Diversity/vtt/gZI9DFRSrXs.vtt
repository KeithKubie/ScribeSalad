JUDITH SINGER: Thank
you all for coming out

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.360
this afternoon for the 10th
annual New Faculty Institute.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.260
This is the 10th year
we have been hosting

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.870
these events for
new faculty from all

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.120
across Harvard University.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm Judy Singer.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.030
I'm the Senior Vice Provost
for Faculty Development

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.080
and Diversity.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.450
And I'm also a professor of
statistics at the Graduate

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.310
School of Education.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.380
I will come back and
make a few remarks,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.790
but we're privileged to have
Provost Alan Garber joining us.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.842
And I thought rather than
me start and then turn over

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:39.800
to Alan, I'm just going
to turn it over to Alan

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
to come and make a few remarks.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
And he'll also take some
questions from you--

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.210
if you wonder what
a provost does,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.360
which is often a question
that people wonder.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580
So Alan, why don't
you come on over.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.380
ALAN GARBER: Can you hear
me OK without the mic?

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.121
Half the room?

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:55.620
OK.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.550
I'll use the mic.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.050
OK.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.720
Thanks.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.530
First of all, let me
thank Judy and her office

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.330
for organizing this event.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.060
It's an example of the wonderful
work that her office does.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.670
And I'm going to be pretty
brief in my welcoming comments.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.040
But there's a reason
why I want to emphasize

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.770
what her office does.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.110
You all came here for
different reasons--

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.030
presumably, because of the
professional opportunities.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.150
But what that means in
each case, I'm sure,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.370
is different among you.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.620
For some of you, it's about
your immediate colleagues.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.160
For some of you, it's about the
students in your department,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680
perhaps in your school.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.410
It may have a lot to do with
the kinds of collaborations

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.500
that you can have.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.200
And you're also at different
levels of seniority.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.420
Some of you are beginning
assistant professors.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Some of you are tenured
faculty here at Harvard.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330
So what that means
is I'm not going

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.310
to take your time
by telling you what

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.029
you need to do to get tenure.

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:01.820
And by the way, when
the provost says that,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.450
it sounds almost like it's
a contract or a guarantee

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.310
or something, so I'm
not going to go there.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.720
But there is one
common bit of advice

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.240
that I'd like to give
all of you, which

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.980
is to truly take advantage of
what Harvard University has

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.200
to offer.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.980
Well, what do I mean by that?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760
There's the obvious
kinds of resources

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.520
that you have available
to you for your research,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.500
and for your teaching and so on.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.090
But for many
people, it's so easy

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.200
to become fully
engaged in what's

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.900
going on in your school
or your department

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.240
that you might lose
sight of what's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.920
going on in the rest
of the university,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.640
and how you might benefit
from becoming involved

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.320
in the university more broadly.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.140
And in fact, today's event,
where we bring together

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.120
people from all
over the university,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.190
is actually not as common
as I would like it to be.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.730
And this is part of what
Judy's office works on--

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.350
to bring together faculty
from across the university.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.984
Now, especially if you're a
beginning assistant professor,

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.400
you may be thinking,
well, don't I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.040
need to worry about getting
my papers published,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.170
my research done, all
the other things that you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.260
need to do to get your
career off the ground.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.700
That's all necessary.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.270
But if you don't take
advantage of the fact

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.020
that you have colleagues
with expertise in virtually

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.830
every academic endeavor,
who, if nothing else,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.490
will educate you in
a very broad sense--

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.990
if you don't take
advantage of that,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.010
then you're missing out of
a lot of what makes Harvard

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.440
such a special place.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.540
There are extraordinary
people here

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.980
in every field and
extraordinary resources.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.390
And we have dinners for
faculty, other kinds of events,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.420
to make sure that
there are opportunities

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.750
to get to know people
outside your area.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.690
Occasionally, new research
collaborations form.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.490
Often, friendships form.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.350
You have a lot in
common with people who

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.060
aren't in your immediate area.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.630
I urge you to seek opportunities
to take advantage of that.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.040
It's not only about faculty.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.720
It's also about
sometimes sharing

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.280
students for collaboration.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.240
Students and postdocs-- as many
of you who are experienced,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.250
tenured faculty
certainly know that--

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.950
are often the glue
that will hold together

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.370
interdisciplinary
collaborations.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.190
There is another part of Harvard
that I would urge you not

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.570
to overlook, and that's our
many cultural institutions

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.600
and resources.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.120
I'll just mention a few that
report to the provost's office.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.810
There is the-- well, this isn't
exactly a cultural institution,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.670
but the Harvard Library.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.120
It's the largest university
library in the world.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.900
And when I say library,
by the way, some of you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.380
are probably surprised
I used the singular.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.440
It's many libraries,
many different buildings.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.350
There are many, many treasures
to be found in the library.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.260
There is the
Harvard Art Museums.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.610
By some measures, it's the
sixth largest art museum

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.340
in the country.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.060
And it's an unusual museum.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.710
It's quite new.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.990
It only opened a few years ago.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.390
And it's set up to
be a teaching museum.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.110
You will find that,
for many of you,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.530
it can be a resource
for your teaching.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.980
And they support various kinds
of courses in many subjects,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.740
not only those
related to, say, art--

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.520
or even, not only
the humanities.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.450
And then there's the ART, the
American Repertory Theater,

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.460
which is a theater that every
year typically gets a Tony

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.160
Award for a play that
was developed there

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.620
and is brought to New York.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.390
So I could go on and on.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.880
There's many different kinds
of musical opportunities,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.380
and so on.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.710
This is an amazing
community that's

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.380
just full of life and vitality.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.760
And if you don't take advantage
of all there is to offer,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.130
it's not as though you
will have a bad experience,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.500
but you really missed out.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.892
So I urge you to get to know
your colleagues, and especially

00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:12.350
today, take the opportunities
to get to know the people who

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.750
are here.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.822
And then, I hope
I'll get a chance

00:06:16.822 --> 00:06:18.530
to talk with you again
about what we look

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.990
for to make tenure decisions.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.510
But that's a story
for another day.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.450
You have a great panel
here to hear from,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.690
who will be able to tell you
a lot more than I can about

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.300
how you manage the various
demands on your time,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.489
how you manage life
as a faculty member.

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:37.280
They are people who
are in the thick of it,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.520
at a somewhat different stage
of their careers than I am.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.310
So I don't want to
take much more time.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.940
But let me ask if there are
any questions or comments.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.750
Well, I hope this means that
all your questions have already

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.470
been answered.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.302
Well, let me just
turn it over to Judy.

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:03.760
Do you want to
introduce the panel?

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.635
JUDITH SINGER: Yep.

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:06.760
ALAN GARBER: Oh, you're
going to have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.380
JUDITH SINGER: Thank you, Alan.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.046
Alan has to run off
to his next meeting.

00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:17.306
One of the things provosts do
is they make opening remarks.

00:07:17.306 --> 00:07:19.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.610
So let me just make a few
comments about Harvard

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.330
in general.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.621
And then I'm going to have
everybody go around the room

00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:27.560
and introduce
themselves, very briefly,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.140
and then turn it
over to my colleague

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.542
Elizabeth Ancarana, the
Assistant Provost for Faculty

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:35.000
Development and Diversity, who
will moderate and facilitate

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.010
the panel.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.720
As I said earlier,
I've been here awhile.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.180
I actually started as a
faculty member in 1984

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.220
when I was three years old.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.810
And it was pretty amazing that
they hired three-year-olds

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.410
at that time.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.150
But Harvard didn't
have a tenure track.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.920
So you could hire
a three-year-old,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.919
and you wouldn't expect
that they would actually

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.220
grow up to get tenure.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.100
I did get tenure in 1993.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.800
And I want to share with
you a few lessons that I've

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.130
learned more from my
provostial perch, probably

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.510
in contrast to
some of the things

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.770
that you'll hear from some
of our colleagues here.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.470
One is about the size
of the university.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.850
Harvard is a very,
very large place.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.540
So we have, not counting
our affiliated hospitals,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.950
where there are another
12,000 faculty--

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.290
I did not add zeros.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.260
There are 12,000 faculty in the
Harvard affiliated hospitals.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.830
There are 1,500 ladder
faculty at the university.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.659
About 1,100 of them are tenured.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.559
That's nearly 3/4 of the
ladder faculty are tenured.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.070
And the remaining are assistant
and associate professors--

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.320
tenure track faculty.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.300
The language of
having a tenure track

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.100
is relatively new at Harvard.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.890
Each of you were hired
with the expectation

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.450
that we would nurture
your careers here.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.970
And we would like to
see you succeed here.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.490
That doesn't mean everybody
will, but what it means

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.180
is we have an investment.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.000
It's very much in
contrast to what

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.460
happened when I was
initially hired,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.020
which was assume you will not
get tenure, which basically

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.480
is a great way to get people to
not invest in the institution.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.390
And so part of what
we've done-- this

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.760
is entirely enlightened
self-interest.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.620
And the enlightened
self interest

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.064
is by having a tenure track, we
are more likely to hire faculty

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.730
at the assistant and
associate professor

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.980
level who will invest
in their careers

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.760
here, invest in their teaching--

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.335
we do take teaching
seriously here--

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:35.570
and contribute to
the environment

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.210
and the life of the university.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.690
The university is also
increasingly diverse.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.180
You'd never know it by seeing
portraits in these rooms--

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.480
they're mostly dead, white men
hanging around on the walls--

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.240
but we are increasingly diverse.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.900
Right now about 30% of the
ladder faculty are female.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.390
About 22% are minorities.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.660
Your entering class, the
people around the room,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.510
is over 40% female
and 27% minority.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.450
That's very different from
the Harvard of the past.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.270
And that's part of a
conscious decision of working

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.590
towards inclusive excellence.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.380
We think we can be
a stronger faculty

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.610
by being a more diverse faculty,
and by welcoming voices that

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.610
previously might not be a
part of Harvard University,

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.250
but whose voices we really
want here at the table.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.020
The third thing that I'll
say is much more different

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.410
recently is a push towards
what President Faust calls

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.820
One Harvard.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.280
And the One Harvard
mantra is very

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.840
different from the every tub
on its own bottom mantra.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.896
So Harvard is a
proud institution.

00:10:40.896 --> 00:10:42.270
It's been around
for a long time.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.330
It's been pretty
successful and it

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.150
has operated, still operates,
on what's called a tub system.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.380
Each one of the
schools is independent.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.740
It sets its own tuition.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.600
It has its own endowment.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.140
One of the things that President
Faust wanted to foster,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.260
and we have every expectation
that the next president

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.330
of Harvard will
continue to foster,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.680
is the notion of One Harvard.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.870
And this event is a very clear
illustration of the One Harvard

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.890
ethos.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.690
We hope that you
had orientations

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.380
within your own school.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.320
But we also want to
welcome you to being

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.390
the faculty of the university.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.050
And as Alan mentioned, our
office hosts a lot of events

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.180
during the academic year.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.910
Some of them are like this,
more professional development.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.410
Some of them are purely social.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.350
You heard Alan mention the
American Repertory Theater.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.350
We often do faculty
nights at the ART.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.836
We did one last week
for WARHOLCAPOTE,

00:11:36.836 --> 00:11:38.960
which is playing at the
American Repertory Theater.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.750
And having seen it,
I suspect this, too,

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.110
is heading to Broadway
if not a Tony Award.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.480
And as part of these
faculty nights,

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.220
we have somebody
from the production.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.080
Last week, we had
Rob Roth, who was

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.530
the writer of the
script of WARHOLCAPOTE,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.170
come in and do a talk just
for the faculty with Q&amp;A,

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.210
and get a sense
of what's involved

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.980
in the artistic production.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.470
We're also planning,
later this semester,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.720
media training for faculty.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.860
Some of you have never been
approached by a reporter.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.470
And it's important
to know how to think

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.941
about presenting yourself
and presenting your research,

00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:16.940
and also how to work with
the public information

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.570
officers in your schools to get
word out about your research.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.390
And so we're going to be hosting
an event in early November.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.810
This is all, by way of saying,
is don't delete my emails

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.660
They have lots of
interesting things in them.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.630
And I'm going to
stop there, and ask

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.975
people to go around the room
and introduce themselves.

00:12:34.975 --> 00:12:36.350
ELIZABETH ANCARANA:
It's so great

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.740
to see you all here today.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.880
Thanks so much for coming.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.421
This is a large
group, and we're just

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.230
delighted to have you here.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.320
As Judy mentioned, my name
is Elizabeth Ancarana,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.610
and I'm the Assistant Provost
for Faculty Development

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.100
and Diversity.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.580
I have the pleasure of
introducing our four faculty

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.960
panelists to you today.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.540
We have four panelists, who
will each talk for about 10

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.440
or 15 minutes on various
aspects of work and life,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.140
and navigating your
scholarly career at Harvard.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.580
I'm going to start
with Michael Luca.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.030
Mike is the Lee J.
Styslinger III Associate

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:12.890
Professor of Business
Administration

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.690
at Harvard Business School.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.660
Mike's research uses field
experiments and observational

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.110
data to understand how online
platforms are impacting

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.240
the world, how their
data can improve

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.970
our understanding of
society and the economy,

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.910
and how to better design
the platforms themselves.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.040
His recent research has
sought to understand

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.500
how data from Yelp can
improve our understanding

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.130
of the minimum wage, how
Airbnb's design choices have

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.500
facilitated
discrimination, and how

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.610
to rethink government disclosure
policies for the digital age.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.770
At HBS, he teaches
a doctoral course

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.630
on field experiments
and an MBA course

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.170
on applying behavioral
insights for the social good.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.120
Mike earned his
Bachelor's of Science

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.450
from SUNY Albany and his
PhD from Boston University.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.306
JUDITH SINGER: Mike and I both
graduated from SUNY Albany.

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.752
We're quite happy about that.

00:14:01.752 --> 00:14:02.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.480
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: From his
perspective as a newly promoted

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.520
associate professor,
Mike will talk

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.770
about navigating Harvard
in your department,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.220
and pleasures of your
faculty position.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.080
Next to Mike--

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.746
MICHAEL LUCA: I didn't
choose the topic.

00:14:15.746 --> 00:14:18.202
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.057 --> 00:14:21.140
ELIZABETH ANCARANA: Next
to Mike is Emily Balskus.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.360
Emily is the Morris
Kahn Associate Professor

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.920
of Chemistry and
Chemical Biology

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.170
in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.150
integrating knowledge
of microbiology

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.340
with an understanding
of biochemical logic

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.110
and organic chemistry.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.990
Emily's research aims
to discover, understand,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.050
and manipulate microbial
metabolism, which

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.270
is essential to life on Earth.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.030
Her work focuses on deciphering
the chemical mechanisms

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.090
by which microorganisms living
in and on the human body

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.450
influence health and disease,
as well as developing approaches

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.780
for manipulating functions
of human-associated microbial

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.250
communities.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.060
The Balskus Lab is uncovering
new metabolic pathways

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.670
in enzymes and microbial genome
sequencing data, and devising

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.240
strategies for integrating
synthetic organic chemistry

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:11.390
with microbial metabolism to
modify cellular metabolites.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.860
Emily earned her
bachelor's degree

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.400
from Williams College
and her PhD from Harvard.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.030
Emily, from her perspective
as an associate professor,

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.780
will talk about
mentoring, setting

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.810
priorities, and resources for
your scholarship at Harvard.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.450
Next to Emily, we have our
two tenured faculty members.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.280
We have Sara Bleich.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.610
Sara is a professor of public
health policy at the Harvard TH

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.520
Chan School of Public Health and
the Department of Health Policy

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.750
and Management.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.060
She's also the Carol K.
Pforzheimer Professor

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.850
at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.550
Sara's scholarship lies at
the nexus of health policy

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.680
and health services research.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.620
Her work provides evidence to
support policy alternatives

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.050
for obesity prevention
and control,

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.790
particularly among
populations of higher

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.230
risk for this disease.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.110
A signature theme
throughout her research

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:03.050
is an interest in asking
simple yet meaningful questions

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.370
about the complex
problem of obesity,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.870
which can fill important
gaps in the literature.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.000
During the Obama
administration, Sara also

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.940
served as a White House Fellow,
where she was a senior policy

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.460
advisor to the US
Department of Agriculture

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.580
and the first lady's
Let's Move! initiative.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.920
Sara holds a bachelor's
degree from Columbia

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.980
and a PhD from Harvard.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.610
Sara is going to focus, from
her vantage point as a recently

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.570
tenured faculty member, on
establishing your reputation

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:39.680
as a scholar, navigating
the new tenure review

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.790
process, mentoring and
your life at Harvard,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.995
and some other tips.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.780
And finally, we
have Jason Mitchell.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.240
Jason is a professor of
psychology in the Faculty

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.770
of Arts and Sciences.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.230
And he's also taken on the
role as faculty director

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.650
of Harvard's Program
in General Education.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.540
Jason uses neural
imaging techniques

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.900
to study the brain basis of
human social interaction,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.640
especially how we make sense
of the thoughts, feelings,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.390
and personalities
of those around us.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.579
Situated in the field of
social cognitive neuroscience,

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.359
his research makes use of new
imaging techniques developed

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.119
by cognitive neuroscientists
to illuminate,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.579
in innovative ways,
long-standing questions

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:27.640
in social psychology around
how the brain processes

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.320
information.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.000
His experimental
work has produced

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.030
four general discoveries
around social cognition,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.790
understanding the minds of
others, our future self,

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.040
and altruistic behavior.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.950
Jason received his bachelor's
and master's degrees

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.210
from Yale University and
his PhD from Harvard.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.030
From his vantage point as
a tenured faculty member,

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.270
Jason will talk about
teaching, teaching resources,

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.270
and his experience
teaching at Harvard.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.400
So welcome.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.290
And why don't we
begin with you, Mike.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:17:59.847
Mike?

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:00.680
MICHAEL LUCA: Great.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.919
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:04.960
I just wanted to start by
saying that I'm honored

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.640
and humbled to have
the opportunity

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.290
to chat with you all today.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.480
When Judy invited
me to speak here,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.460
I remember my initial
thought was, oh, well,

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.660
that must have been
meant for somebody else.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.010
After all, she was looking
for an esteemed faculty member

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.150
to come participate in this.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.392
But before she could change
her mind, I responded quickly.

00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:24.850
And at that point,
I think it would

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.850
have been too awkward to
rescind the invitation.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.350
So here I am.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.360
So when I started
thinking about the things

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.940
that I wanted to
share today, my mind

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.700
started drifting, actually,
back to before I was a faculty

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.850
member here, and to when I was
a graduate student at Boston

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.930
University.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.500
I remember in April 2010,
I had gotten a phone call

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.110
from a friend and a
classmate, who had implored

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.450
me to come to the office.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.380
Our offices were
actually, literally

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.870
converted bathrooms on the
fifth floor of the economics

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.015
building there.

00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:56.140
"Hurry," he told me, "you've
got to come see this."

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.620
So I went into the office.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.700
And when I arrived, I
remember he opened a browser

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.880
to show me a blog post about a
paper we had been working on.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.806
And the blog post
was by Al Roth,

00:19:05.806 --> 00:19:07.930
who's a leading economist,
who was then at Harvard.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.080
I'll kind of gloss over the
fact that he's now at Stanford--

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.080
conversation for another day.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.650
So we had never met Al at that
point, but we were Al groupies.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.120
We knew the research,
and we were fans.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.300
And this was a big deal for us.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.785
Looking back now-- I went
back and found the blog post.

00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:26.410
Actually, it turns
out it wasn't really

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.380
a blog post so much as
a sentence with a link

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.010
to our paper.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.110
But that was enough for us.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.710
So I remember, that day,
this felt like a big break.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.050
So we went over to
celebrate-- how else would one

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.180
celebrate other than to
have chai lattes with skim

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.510
milk at the Starbucks down the
street from Boston University.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.930
And of course, later we went
and told our parents about this.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.750
So I remember, a year
and a half later, I

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.267
was invited to interview
at Harvard Business School.

00:19:52.267 --> 00:19:54.100
And I hadn't really
been at business schools

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.500
before, let alone
Harvard Business School.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.720
And I saw that Al was on
my interview schedule.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.030
So I sat there, and
I was preparing.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.040
I prepared my content,
but also prepared what

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.748
should I say when I
finally have a chance

00:20:04.748 --> 00:20:06.850
to meet Professor Roth.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.380
Hello, Professor Roth.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.660
I thought, no, that's
maybe too formal.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.800
Hey Al, good to see you.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.920
I was like, no, that doesn't
quite seem right either.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.300
So in any case, I
arrived at Al's office,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.550
and we chatted about research.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.300
The day went well.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.460
And ultimately, I ended
up getting and accepting

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.577
an offer at HBS, for which
I'm all very grateful.

00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:27.160
But there was one
part of the day that

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.510
stuck with me for the years.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.700
And it was kind of an
idiosyncratic interaction

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.610
that I had had with Al as
I was leaving his office.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.410
He may be horrified
that I'm sharing this.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.350
He said, "Here's a piece of
advice for the job market."

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.250
I leaned in, waiting to hear
what the words of wisdom from

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.530
this future Nobel laureate-- who
now has won the Nobel Prize--

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.270
had to say to me.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.860
And Al leaned over,
and I remember

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.660
he said, "If you see
a bathroom, use it."

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.706
And the advice was,
"Otherwise, you just

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:56.830
don't know when you're
going to have another chance

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.720
to get into a bathroom
on the job market."

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.640
And this actually stuck
with me through the years

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.000
for multiple reasons.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.250
One, it's useful.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.230
And when I go on
talks I still kind of

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.210
have this in the
back of my head.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.820
But it also stuck with me
because this was the moment

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.490
that I first realized
that Al wasn't just

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.340
a giant in the field, that
Al was actually a very kind

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.880
person, a thoughtful person,
and an empathetic person.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.130
And for me, my interaction with
Al on that day was basically

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.620
my vision of what Harvard is
when it's at its best, which

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.140
is, at its best,
the university life

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.810
provides this
opportunity to engage

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.270
with inspiring colleagues,
the opportunity

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.420
to teach, to mentor, to
learn from students--

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.730
here we have amazing
students-- and the opportunity

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.760
to have a unique platform for
creating change and sharing

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.440
knowledge with the
world around us.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.780
And importantly, it's an
environment that, at its best,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.550
is so supportive that
your colleagues all

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.133
want to make sure that you have
a chance to go to the bathroom

00:21:54.133 --> 00:21:55.960
before your next meeting.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.990
So when thinking about
Harvard, though, Harvard also

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.250
has a set of challenges.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.560
And this is what I was
thinking about when

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.910
reflecting on navigating
the Harvard system.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.150
And when I think
about the reasons

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.860
that sometimes the
promise of Harvard

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.610
isn't realized for individual
faculty members who

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.830
are navigating it, I see
three challenges that,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.790
at least for me, come to mind.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.780
The first is those
inspiring colleagues--

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.190
they could also be
intimidating as hell.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.900
So you're in there, and
these are amazing minds

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.180
that you're surrounded by.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.700
And sometimes, by assembling
a large group of impressive,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.860
quick-on-their-feet,
often opinionated people,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.360
this could create a culture of
self-doubt and an environment

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.440
in which it's easy to feel
like wherever you are,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.290
you need to have
your game face on.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.290
Second-- and this seems like a
little bit of a paradox after

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.760
the first thing I said--

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.790
is that we're surrounded
by fascinating people,

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.550
but Harvard can also be
a lonely place if you

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.750
let it be a lonely place.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.450
And I'll circle back to the
relationship between this

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.810
and One Harvard in a little
bit, but many of your colleagues

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.750
will have unimaginably busy
schedules, between research,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.170
teaching, lectures, and-- at
least one case that I could

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:05.810
think about--

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.275
a cameo in the latest
Spider-Man movie.

00:23:08.275 --> 00:23:11.020
And if you haven't seen it
yet, you should watch it.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.010
And at times, when
thinking about that,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.420
it's hard to find
your community.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.225
I remember once taking
a train to New York

00:23:16.225 --> 00:23:18.850
just to catch up with lunch from
a colleague from the economics

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.530
department here.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:24.277
So third-- and this
also seems a little bit

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:26.110
funny on the surface--
which is that there's

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.470
a lot of things going on at
Harvard, as you mentioned.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.966
And I know what you're thinking.

00:23:30.966 --> 00:23:31.840
Oh, isn't that great?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.850
Isn't that the
reason we're here?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.900
How is that challenging?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.810
But actually, it's great to
have so many things going on,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.646
but it could also
be overwhelming.

00:23:39.646 --> 00:23:41.020
And it's overwhelming
when you're

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.840
trying to balance your research,
your teaching, attending

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.630
seminars, giving talks, while
also trying to find time

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.820
for friends, family, and
the latest episode of Game

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.646
of Thrones.

00:23:49.646 --> 00:23:51.770
And if anybody knows what
happened in the last one,

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.645
please don't tell me.

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:54.740
I haven't quite
caught up on it yet.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.520
So with this in
mind, I just wanted

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.020
to share a few thoughts about
navigating the Harvard system,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.400
and about overcoming
some of these challenges

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.234
to make sure that you could
get as much from it as I

00:24:05.234 --> 00:24:07.150
feel like I've been able
to get out of it now.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.850
And I think it has
a lot of promise.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.370
The first thing that I think
about is to seek advice.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.260
So when thinking about
being a faculty member

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.760
rather than being a graduate
student-- especially for people

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.400
who are new here-- as
a graduate student,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.700
it's very easy to seek advice.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.530
It's sort of part and
parcel of being a student.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.340
But then when you start
looking for a job,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.300
there is a little bit of
a change in the ethos.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.250
You start polishing
your research.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.560
You start practicing
for interviews.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.320
You prepare for any question
that might be thrown your way.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.820
And if you don't
have an answer, you

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.194
know why you don't
have an answer

00:24:41.194 --> 00:24:43.570
and how you would
go about getting it.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.490
And then when you start
as a faculty member,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.950
sometimes it's easy to
stay in this mindset

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.900
and think that you're
always being evaluated,

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.900
or that you always should have
the answers to everything.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.460
But when I think
about that, I think

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.720
that's sometimes a mistake.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.178
And I think that
you're missing out

00:24:57.178 --> 00:25:00.100
by not seeking the advice
from your colleagues.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.039
Why?

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:02.080
Because here's the thing.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.750
When thinking about the
colleagues in your department,

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.030
the people who
hired you like you.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.754
And they want you to succeed.

00:25:08.754 --> 00:25:10.420
And you're actually
surrounded by people

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.030
who care about your success,
otherwise none of you

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.650
would be here today.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.980
And for me, I really think
it's important to just

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.650
let that sink in, and to feel
comfortable seeking out advice

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.660
from your senior
colleagues and mentors.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.630
And linking this back to this
feeling of needing a game face,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.690
I think it's important sometimes
to just take your game face off

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.899
and to share your successes,
but also your struggles,

00:25:30.899 --> 00:25:33.439
your thoughts, your concerns,
the things that you're not sure

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:34.720
what the answer is to.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.120
And remember that seeking
advice doesn't mean

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.470
following everybody's advice.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.532
It just means hearing
what people have to say

00:25:41.532 --> 00:25:43.240
and understanding that
some of the advice

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.156
is going to be contradictory,
but this way you

00:25:45.156 --> 00:25:47.680
could get a broader
perspective on the challenges

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.965
that you are facing.

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.760
Now, second-- cross bridges.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.710
And now I should caveat that--

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.110
I don't mean that in a
deep metaphorical sense.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.730
I mean that in a literal sense.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.600
The Larz Anderson Bridge is
finally done with construction.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.040
It's actually quite nice now.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.600
And if you still
don't like that one,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.270
you could cross between
HBS and Harvard Square

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.060
on the walking bridge
down the street from it.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.800
So the reason I say this is
because, for me personally,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.300
I've found it a privilege to
be part of the Harvard Business

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.130
School community,
but I've also found

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.440
a great set of collaborators
around the university

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.770
more broadly.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.830
So I've had co-authors
in the Kennedy

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.151
School of the economics
department, the psychology

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:26.650
department.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.770
I've presented in the
computer science department.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.270
And last year, I organized a
workshop with a group of people

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.160
from the sociology department.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.277
And I didn't actually
know any of these people

00:26:35.277 --> 00:26:36.610
before I came to the university.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.940
These are just people who,
through chance encounters,

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.210
I had the opportunity to
meet in my years here.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.694
And overall,
thinking about this,

00:26:45.694 --> 00:26:47.110
part of what's
facilitated this is

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.193
that people are generally
excited about their work

00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:50.890
and about exchanging ideas.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:52.750
And also, a little bit
of practical advice.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.446
As a practical matter,
Crema and Henrietta's Table

00:26:55.446 --> 00:26:57.195
are convenient to many
different schools--

00:26:57.195 --> 00:27:00.650
so an easy meeting place
for those looking to do so.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.370
So the thing that I would
want to take away for that is

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.320
to enjoy your department-- so I
love the unit that I'm located

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:06.820
in--

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.160
but also to find what I think
about as a vacation home

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.920
in another part of the school.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.630
So third comes down to
teaching at Harvard.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.430
When I think about
teaching, for me, there's

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.070
a switch I really
turned on here,

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.610
which was the idea that we
really, at the heart of it,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.480
should be enjoying our
teaching and enjoying

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.680
working with students.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.277
When thinking about the role
of students at the university,

00:27:29.277 --> 00:27:31.360
they really are vital to
the intellectual vibrancy

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.650
that all of us feel.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.830
And I think there is sometimes
a little bit of bias,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.880
I think, about, oh, my
students are my mini-mes,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.296
or my students are my workforce,
or my students are people

00:27:39.296 --> 00:27:40.630
I want to impart something on.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.510
But I think that
relationships with students

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.600
are best when you respect your
students, and learn from them

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.210
as well as feeling like
you're just teaching them.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:53.530
And it reminds me of this
moment in Kung Fu Panda 3--

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.290
don't pretend you haven't
seen it, I know many of you

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.130
probably have--

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.010
where the protagonist, Po, comes
to this important realization

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.710
about teaching after almost
giving up, and feeling

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.480
like he's not a great teacher.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.300
And I remember, he realizes
that his goal as a teacher

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.730
is not just to help the
students to be like him.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.500
His job is to help the
students be the best them

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.900
that they could be, and to
help find their strengths.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.540
So when I think
about when I've had

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.030
the most successful
collaborations with,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.000
or engagements with,
students at the university

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.120
has been when I've thought
about students and the things

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.100
that they would
need, and the fact

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.124
that the things
that worked for you

00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.790
may not work for your
doctoral students,

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.497
or may not work for
the MBA students

00:28:32.497 --> 00:28:34.330
you're teaching in a
classroom, and thinking

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.954
about what the
different strengths they

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:38.530
have in the different approaches
to teaching there are.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.990
Forth is the fact
that there is a lot

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.500
of strongly established norms.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.800
And we were even talking
before this panel about,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.280
sometimes norms vary across
different parts of the school.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.890
And one thing that I think
people underappreciate

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.226
is that sometimes it's
good to break norms.

00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:55.600
So there are some norms that
make a lot of sense and that

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.240
are good to have in place,
but there are a lot of norms

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.550
that are just norms for--

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.160
I don't even know why
they became norms.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.020
For me, I had one
personal experience

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.660
with this when I
had my first son.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.280
At Harvard Business
School, there

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.800
wasn't a real norm for fathers
to take parental leave at HBS.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.470
I remember, the
idea was essentially

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.990
that you would teach
your class as usual,

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.580
and on the day that
the baby arrived,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.860
you would have people
on call to cover

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.210
for the next couple of days.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.001
They would cover your
class, and then you'd

00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:25.817
get back to teaching
shortly thereafter.

00:29:25.817 --> 00:29:27.400
And I remember, after
our conversation

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.770
with a mentor who--

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.670
note aforementioned
advice-seeking--

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.529
I chatted with
and thought about,

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:34.820
is this something I want to do.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.630
I'd like to spend more time
with my son when he's born.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.000
I decided to ignore that norm
and to take parental leave

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.910
so I could spend time
doing things that parents

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.650
of new babies want to do--

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.770
change diapers, not sleep,
and get to know your child.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.480
And I remember that I had
a very awkward conversation

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.880
in the department about
wanting to do this.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.470
But once I actually
got it out there,

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.450
despite the fact that there
wasn't a strong norm of this,

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.520
people were actually
very supportive of it.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.220
And looking back on it, it
was amazing to spend this time

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.180
together with my son.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.980
And in retrospect,
I can't imagine

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.720
not having spent that time
home and away from work.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.270
So lastly, I just wanted
to end on a positive note.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.890
So I wanted to
quote the economist

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.890
John Maynard Keynes, who
in the typical optimism

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.246
of an economist said, "In the
long run, we're all dead."

00:30:21.246 --> 00:30:23.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.200
And this brings me
to the broader point,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.460
which is something that I
would want people to take away

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.470
with them today, which
is that we're often

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.160
told about the things that
we could do after tenure,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.380
and to play it safe while
you're going for a promotion,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.230
and to optimize a
little bit to that.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.030
And when I think about
this, I sometimes

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.516
feel that this
advice is misguided.

00:30:45.516 --> 00:30:47.140
And the way, at least
that I've thought

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.210
about navigating, as a
junior faculty member,

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:50.800
through the
university is that we

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.840
have a limited amount of time.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.970
So I think sometimes the
best that we could do

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:57.280
is just think about the
time that we have here,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.130
and the impact that you can have
while you're fortunate to be

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.880
in this environment.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.050
So I tend to think about
things in a shorter horizon

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:09.500
than the 35-year, here's what
I'm going to do down the road.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.860
And for me, this has meant
taking unconventional risks

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.460
at times-- so taking on
untraditional research

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.160
projects, teaching
untraditional courses.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.500
So at HBS, this means things
that are not only based

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.500
on cases, but also things
that are in the field,

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.410
and even courses that are
cross-listed with the Kennedy

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.100
School--

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.430
and hoping that if I do things
that are high impact, and that

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:34.540
are important, and, for
me, fun, that other people

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.946
will find them to
be that as well.

00:31:36.946 --> 00:31:38.320
So for me, it
also, though, means

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320
remembering that there
is life beyond Harvard.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.909
And on a practical level,
we have a commitment device

00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:44.950
that we set for ourselves
in our household, which

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.616
is to try to have a
day trip every week.

00:31:46.616 --> 00:31:49.300
So some of the things that we
like to do in the Boston area--

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.790
for people who are new--

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:53.870
include going to Rockport
for a lobster at Roy Moore,

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.670
Salem for a day trip to
the Peabody Essex Museum,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.250
and the deCordova Sculpture
Park for an afternoon

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.180
stroll with our kids.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.550
And the last thing that I want
to note is that some of those

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.216
places, actually, you
get free admission

00:32:04.216 --> 00:32:06.030
if you bring your Harvard ID.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.507
And for some that don't-- the
Outings &amp; Innings website,

00:32:08.507 --> 00:32:10.340
which I don't know if
it's managed by your--

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.010
JUDITH SINGER: It's not.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:11.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:11.760
MICHAEL LUCA: Got it.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.301
So they have great
discounts, though,

00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:14.950
for a lot of things
in the Boston area.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.180
So I'll stop here for now.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.814
But I'm looking forward
to chatting more.

00:32:19.814 --> 00:32:23.181
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.070
EMILY BALSKUS: OK.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.840
It looks like I'm next.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.735
So I'd just like to start
by echoing everyone else

00:32:30.735 --> 00:32:32.340
and welcoming you to Harvard.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.960
So you're about to start a
really amazing both academic as

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.640
well as personal journey here.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.040
And I guarantee you'll
learn things you never

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.550
imagined, and not just in
the context of your research

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.960
and your scholarship.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.880
So I think I'll start with the
ending, sort of the punch line.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.880
My overall message that I want
to convey today is really,

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.610
I think, to embrace
this experience

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.980
as a learning opportunity--

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.950
so really, the next step
in your own education.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.450
And just like every
previous step,

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.830
I think you'll mature as
a scholar and as a teacher

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.670
as you go along.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.610
And for me at least, I
think viewing my time

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.760
as a junior faculty
member through this lens

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.100
has been incredibly
helpful in dealing

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.860
with the obstacles,
stresses, and anxieties

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.720
that I think
inevitably accompany

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.210
this type of position.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.280
So the specific
things that I wanted

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.910
to talk to all about today
are establishing yourself

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.970
as a scholar, with a
particular focus on resources

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.670
for scholarship that
are available here,

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.710
and also priority setting.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.920
And then secondly, mentoring--
both in the context

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.820
of being mentored by others
and mentoring others.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.600
And I want to note
before I start

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.686
that, because I'm an
experimental scientist,

00:33:51.686 --> 00:33:54.060
some of the things that have
been really important for me

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.310
are definitely not
going to be universally

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.660
applicable to everyone.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.060
And likewise, if some
of the scientists

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.890
here have additional
questions about things

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.930
that I won't have
time to cover, I'd

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.100
be happy to chat with anyone
outside of this event.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.860
So first, in thinking
about establishing yourself

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.170
as a scholar here at
Harvard, one piece

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:17.070
of advice that I have,
that I especially

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.370
extend the scientists, is
to get started right away--

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.469
not just with your
research, but also

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:27.360
in building relationships within
and outside of the university.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.040
So especially if you're
an experimental scientist,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.580
I think it can be
really easy to focus

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.000
a lot of your time and energy
on preparing to do research.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.150
So your lab space might
not be finished yet.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.900
There's always a lot of
things to order and to get up

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.989
and running.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:46.830
Make sure that as
you're doing this,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.980
you're also still
engaging with, especially,

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.500
grad students within
the department-- also,

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:59.100
your colleagues both in and
outside of your department.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.500
You start thinking about
writing grants and proposals.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.940
It may seem like
it's a long way away

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.350
before you feel
ready to do that,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.310
but I think you know the
experience of attempting

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:16.810
to write these things early
on is really, really helpful.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.480
You go to meetings
in your field,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.300
even though you
might not actually

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.890
have independent work
ready to present.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.730
Early on, start figuring
out what resources on campus

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.990
can be helpful to you.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.300
So for example, for scientists,
if you start reaching out

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.340
to staff in the dean's office--

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.950
Jeremy Bloxham's staff--
you can learn a lot

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.420
about funding opportunities.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.960
You can look at
example proposals.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.510
This is something that I
started doing right away,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.450
and it was really helpful.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.310
If you know, for
example, that there

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:58.740
are facilities or instruments
somewhere within Harvard that

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.260
would be helpful to your
research eventually,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.420
I'd really urge you
to start getting

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.780
in touch with those people,
exploring those resources, now.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.000
The university's a big place.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.110
Things can sometimes move
more slowly than you'd like.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.300
And so if you're
on people's radar

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.350
and you have done some of
the legwork in advance,

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.450
that can help
enormously in helping

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:26.010
to move things along when
you're ready to do those things.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.800
A second message,
I think, is take

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.470
advantage of this opportunity
to explore in your scholarship.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.650
So don't be afraid to step
outside of your comfort zone

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.050
and move into new areas
if you see that there are

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.790
really exciting opportunities.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:45.240
So this is really, I think,
personally relevant for me.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.790
The research work I'm
actually now best known

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.460
for was not something
that I proposed to work

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.510
on when I applied for jobs.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.330
It wasn't even
something that I had

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.255
explored in any previous
training experience.

00:36:57.255 --> 00:37:02.250
And so it's been
really amazing to have

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.230
had the opportunity to kind of
start off in a new direction.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:10.740
And I think I'd just advise
everyone to believe in yourself

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.185
and trust your
scholarly instincts.

00:37:13.185 --> 00:37:16.980
It really, I think,
is not the time

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.690
to be too conservative when
it comes to your scholarship.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.910
And I think that, with that
spirit of exploration in mind,

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:30.420
I'd also encourage everyone to
try to seek out organizations

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:35.250
and initiatives that lie outside
of your own research group

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.590
and department to
get involved in.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.840
And so I had the
opportunity pretty early on

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.810
to get involved in the Microbial
Sciences Initiative, which--

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.150
across the sciences,
there are many initiatives

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:49.590
like this that are designed
to bring together professors,

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.500
graduate students, and postdocs
from different departments,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.810
different schools,
who are interested

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:55.860
in similar questions.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.380
In our case, it's studies
of the microbial world.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.240
And this was incredibly helpful.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.750
I made a lot of connections
to faculty members

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.490
at other departments
and schools.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:09.090
I met some current collaborators
through people in the MSI.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.540
My first graduate
students and postdocs

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.930
could get help with experiments
we weren't as familiar with,

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.060
because we had met people
through this organization.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.910
So it really helped to
shape my research program.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.420
And also, I think, just gave me,
pretty early on-- since I was

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.110
such an enthusiastic
contributor--

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:35.520
a lot of visibility among that
group of people on campus.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.435
So another piece
of advice that I

00:38:38.435 --> 00:38:41.550
have found to be really
helpful in my own work

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.390
is to try as much as possible
to integrate your scholarship

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.820
into other activities
and obligations

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.360
that you have to do-- things
like teaching and service.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.590
And so I've had a
couple of opportunities

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.800
to design new classes.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.330
And every time I've done this--
both at the graduate level

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.280
and, actually, at the
undergraduate level

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.240
in the context of a
freshman seminar--

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.530
I've tried to frame the courses
around areas of science that

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.810
are closely related to my
own research interests.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.290
And so you can then use
the time you're spending

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.120
preparing for the class--

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:18.330
it benefits you, because
it's research time as well.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.950
And even when I teach a big
undergraduate class-- so

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.360
I've taught, in the past,
undergraduate organic

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.320
chemistry.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.180
And I'd try to find sometimes
subtle, sometimes not-so-subtle

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.430
ways of introducing
concepts and themes

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.970
that I'm excited about in
my research into lectures.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:38.700
And this is not only, I think,
a good way to engage students,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.020
really introducing them
to questions and ideas

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.240
that practicing scientists
are interested in,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.100
but I think it's also
a really good way

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.910
to practice communicating
your science

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.670
and research to an audience
of non-specialists,

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:58.540
which will pay dividends
in a lot of other contexts.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.370
So one other thing
that I'll mention

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:06.810
is the importance of
building good time management

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:11.370
skills right from the start,
and making your scholarly work

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.970
a priority.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.290
So I kind of alluded to
all these other activities.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.630
I'm sure you're starting
to experience this--

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.680
if you haven't started
to experience it yet--

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.942
there is a lot of
additional obligations

00:40:23.942 --> 00:40:26.400
that you'll have to deal with
that you potentially have not

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.050
experienced before.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:35.280
And I think that it can be an
obstacle for, particularly,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.800
new faculty at the
assistant professor level

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.056
to try to manage scholarly
work in the context

00:40:41.056 --> 00:40:42.180
of these other obligations.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.320
And the big problem
is that of course

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.180
all these other
obligations usually

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.710
have deadlines attached to them.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.800
And so it's really easy
to sort of push other work

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.870
aside to get those seemingly
more urgent things finished.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.632
And so there are a lot of ways
to deal with this problem.

00:40:58.632 --> 00:41:00.090
One thing that's
worked well for me

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:04.440
is to try to organize my
schedule so that I place

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.290
time blocks that are
dedicated to certain things

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.810
like writing and reading.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.630
I'll try to carve out very
specific periods of time

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:14.640
to prepare for class,
and not really let

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:21.660
myself spend time outside of
those blocks on certain things.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.970
I think the other
thing to remember

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.990
is that research, at
least in the context

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:30.360
of experimental science,
I think it always takes

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.820
longer than you think it will.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.750
So I think for me
it's been a goal

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:41.850
to try to find a balance in
terms of time management,

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:48.560
where I can keep up a steady
pace with a lot of the writing

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:54.670
and travel, all the
other components

00:41:54.670 --> 00:42:02.280
of scholarly activities, that
is manageable, not overwhelming,

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.910
but allows me to
make steady progress

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.720
over long, long periods of time.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.540
And so I think, again, there
are many different solutions

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.380
to that problem.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.081
But really, having
time management

00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:17.580
at the forefront
of your mind as you

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.663
start to tackle some of
these new responsibilities

00:42:19.663 --> 00:42:21.510
can be helpful.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.120
And with this in mind, I
think one of the things

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.787
that hopefully you'll do here--

00:42:25.787 --> 00:42:27.370
building bonds with
younger colleagues

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.760
can be really helpful.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:35.110
It's great to exchange ideas
about those types of things.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.560
I know that some of my newly
tenured female colleagues

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.470
in science, they actually have
a weekly lunch meeting where

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:42.850
they'll get
together, have lunch,

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:46.604
and each person will bring
a problem or a question

00:42:46.604 --> 00:42:48.520
that they'd like to pose
the rest of the group

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.390
to get advice about.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.174
So you can organize
those types of groups

00:42:52.174 --> 00:42:53.590
with colleagues
in your department

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:56.380
or in other departments.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.950
Then, I think the last thing I
want to say about scholarship,

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.840
is really, it's
been very helpful

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.370
for me to approach my scholarly
work with a growth mindset.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:14.170
I think it's really easy to
feel like everybody expects

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.800
you to already be the scholar
that you'll be in seven years

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.340
right now, or that
because you've been hired

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.200
to be at a place like
this that you have

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.410
to be successful at
everything you attempt to do,

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.550
all the time.

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:31.370
And I can reassure you
that's not the case.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:36.070
And as I mentioned earlier,
I've found it very helpful

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.790
to think about what I can learn
from each of the experiences

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.550
that I've encountered
during the process of being

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.910
a junior faculty member.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.560
So having this growth
mindset makes it a lot easier

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.320
to deal with things like
rejected papers, rejected

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.860
grants, teaching evaluations,
and things like that.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.360
So the next topic I wanted
to touch on is mentoring.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.210
And as I think probably
everyone knows,

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:09.040
you'll have both formal mentors
here as well as, hopefully,

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.480
informal mentors.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.610
And I know the formal
side of mentoring

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.604
can differ a lot between
departments, between schools.

00:44:15.604 --> 00:44:17.020
And so what I have
to say probably

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.830
applies mostly to thinking
about informal mentors

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.645
and interactions with them.

00:44:22.645 --> 00:44:25.690
And so one piece of
advice, again, that

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:29.530
has been very important for
me has been to find mentors

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.600
in multiple departments.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.630
Particularly if your work
is interdisciplinary,

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.730
I think it's critical
to get feedback

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.460
from scholars in
related fields that

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.035
lie outside of the expertise
that's in your department.

00:44:43.035 --> 00:44:44.957
For me, actually, right
from the beginning,

00:44:44.957 --> 00:44:47.290
I was encouraged to have
someone from another department

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.670
on my formal
mentoring committee,

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.950
and I think that's
been very helpful.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.660
But I've also made
an effort to get

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.410
to know colleagues in
other departments in a more

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:58.490
informal way as well.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:01.210
And so I'd urge
everyone, if you think

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:06.280
that it would be helpful to
you to have a potentially

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.200
formal mentor from
another department,

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:13.810
just make sure that you
ask about that opportunity.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.765
So another piece of
advice I'm sure pretty

00:45:17.765 --> 00:45:19.390
much everyone has
probably heard before

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:25.490
is to figure out, really, how
to engage each of your mentors

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:26.690
on an individual basis.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.280
So some of your
mentors will really

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.110
want to talk about
the things that

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.660
are frustrating you, problems
you're encountering, and will

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.660
give good advice--
not all of them will.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:42.010
Some them may be more
excited about talking

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:47.140
to you about teaching, or coming
to actually sit in on classes.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.530
Others will be really
good, really engaged

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.830
when you ask them to look
at your scholarly work, look

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:59.280
at your papers or other
pieces of written work.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.266
And so trying to figure out what
everyone is good at but also

00:46:05.266 --> 00:46:06.640
really engaged
in, I think, helps

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.290
you to distribute the mentoring
burden across multiple people.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.870
It's important, I think, to
be persistent when you're

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.630
interacting with your mentors.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.480
You might need, in identifying
especially informal mentors,

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.200
to interact with multiple
people to figure out

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.459
who you best connect with.

00:46:27.459 --> 00:46:29.500
I think this has been
alluded to a couple times--

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.540
you also face the obstacle
that everyone here

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.880
is really, incredibly busy.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.820
And so it's
important to identify

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.760
when it's really important
that you interact with someone,

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.180
and be persistent when
it really matters.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.870
But of course, planning as
far in advance as possible

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:51.970
also will help
with that problem.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.865
Finding mentors who
are in your field who

00:46:53.865 --> 00:46:55.990
are outside of Harvard has
also been something that

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:57.740
has really helped me a lot.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.010
I was actually forced
to do this because all

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.740
of my graduate and postdoctoral
training was here at Harvard.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.747
And so for certain things
like grant applications,

00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:07.330
other opportunities,
I actually wasn't

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.310
allowed to have
reference letter writers

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.300
from within the university.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.410
So I was forced to go out
and try to build connections

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.940
with people at other places.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.640
And that actually was
very, very helpful.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.360
Some of those people
were individuals

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.650
who had known me
earlier on in my career.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.540
Some of those
people were actually

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.420
people who I had first
got to know through just

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.400
scientific collaborations.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.350
But I think that having
that outside perspective

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.890
can be really helpful.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.100
And of course, those
people can continue

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.390
to be supporters down the line.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.550
So I guess then
the last thing I'd

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.700
like to say about mentoring
is that I'd encourage everyone

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.860
to get involved in
mentoring others.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.790
So I think one reason,
at least that I

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.377
have been hesitant to reach
out to mentors in the past,

00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:00.960
is that I always
worry about taking up

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.420
too much of someone's time.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.190
And of course, having multiple
mentors can help with this.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.490
But I think another
thing that's helped me

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.710
not to worry as much about
this aspect of mentoring

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.310
is really to start volunteering
my time to mentor others.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:16.680
And this includes not just,
of course, the students who

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:21.240
are in my research group
but also other opportunities

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:21.870
around campus.

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:25.170
So there are lots of, for
example, undergraduate groups

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.340
focused on science research.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:33.025
Women in Science, I've
worked with those groups.

00:48:33.025 --> 00:48:34.650
I've participated in
the Graduate Women

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.560
in Science Mentoring Program.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.400
Also, I try whenever I can to
help the younger colleagues

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.680
here and at other institutions.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.620
I think not only can you
sort of pay back the time

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.390
that others have
spent helping you,

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:55.380
but all of these experiences
add to your general mentoring

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:55.980
skills.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:02.010
And this will be, down the road,
beneficial for your students

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:05.310
that you're working with, and
with the many other people

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:08.400
you'll have the opportunity
to mentor during your career.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.170
So I think those
are the major points

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.910
that I wanted to emphasize.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.890
And once again, welcome.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.920
I'd be really excited
to answer any questions

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.320
that you have later on.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:23.437 --> 00:49:24.520
SARA BLEICH: Hi, everyone.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.069
One, it's great to be here.

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:27.610
I'm with the School
of Public Health.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.770
And I want you to grain-of-salt
a lot of what I say,

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:31.300
because I didn't go
through the process here.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.520
I've been back for one year.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.270
So I'm going to try
to stay pretty general

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.960
and talk about
what I think works

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.660
as you go through
the tenure process,

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.710
but definitely
talk to people who

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:40.751
have been through the
process in your department.

00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:43.540
And I would say that if I
can leave you with any advice

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.460
today, I would say
you will probably

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.920
get promoted if you can
do good, innovative work,

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.320
if you can be highly
reliable and collegial.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.570
And those three things
become so important as you

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.870
move through the process.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.750
And so what I want
to do is give you,

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.420
for me, what have been key
bullets that have, I think,

00:49:58.420 --> 00:49:59.740
helped me navigate the process.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.750
And it will hopefully be
something that you could adapt.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.640
And the first is really where
we started with this-- what

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:04.848
is your professional shingle?

00:50:04.848 --> 00:50:06.984
And so you all went around
and you said, I do x.

00:50:06.984 --> 00:50:09.400
And the best outcome of when
you meet a new person is they

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.130
walk away and they say,
so-and-so is so interesting,

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:14.290
and they do blah
blah blah blah blah.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.650
So you want to keep your shingle
short and brief and clear,

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.372
and you want it to
be able to be grown.

00:50:19.372 --> 00:50:20.830
So for example,
I've always focused

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:22.270
on obesity policy,
which can take

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.870
on a zillion different forms.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.900
But I purposely always
said obesity policy,

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.240
because I sort of knew
that I'll be in one area,

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.440
then another, then a third.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.350
And I want to leave
myself that room to grow.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:34.026
And I would imagine
all of your fields,

00:50:34.026 --> 00:50:36.400
there's a couple of words
which would define what you do,

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.510
which you could
leave with someone.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.343
And they can say, oh,
I met John at a party.

00:50:39.343 --> 00:50:41.510
He has the most
interesting area of blah.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.060
But you want to leave
someone with that impression.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.893
If you do that, you've
sort of done your job

00:50:44.893 --> 00:50:46.450
at whatever that interaction is.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.770
Another is focus.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:48.940
And you hear this a lot.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.710
And I think the key is to
focus on an area that you love.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.080
There's no point in being
focused on something

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:53.890
you do not like.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.030
Because this is your life.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.794
This is your time away
from your children.

00:50:56.794 --> 00:50:58.210
And so pick an
area that you love.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:59.440
Because it's going
to frustrate you.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.910
It's going to make you crazy.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.285
Things are not
going to work out.

00:51:02.285 --> 00:51:04.535
But if you love it, and it
gets you up in the morning,

00:51:04.535 --> 00:51:07.150
it's going to make the process
that much more enjoyable.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:10.240
Another concrete
bit of advice is

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.860
you should, if you
haven't already,

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.380
pick one to three professional
conferences which you

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.190
will attend every single year.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.480
And in doing so, begin to
build this network of people

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.230
that you know quite
well, that are outside

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:21.880
of the university, that
matter a lot for going

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.510
through the process.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.790
Because they'll be the referee
letters that you get back.

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.331
And don't just go
to the conferences.

00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:28.480
Challenge yourself that at
every single conference,

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.980
you're going to reach
out to two to four people

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.690
you've never met
before, whose work

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.330
you've cited in papers, who you
want to get to know, and make

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:35.621
sure you have coffee with them.

00:51:35.621 --> 00:51:37.510
And they may be people
that are more senior.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.280
They may be other
doctoral students.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.440
But just gradually begin
to grow your network,

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.330
and those sorts of
things pay off dividends.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.857
Because you'll need someone
to give a lecture somewhere.

00:51:45.857 --> 00:51:47.940
Or, you'll need someone
to serve on x and y panel.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.260
And someone will think,
oh, I met that person

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.034
at a conference.

00:51:50.034 --> 00:51:50.950
They seem really nice.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.283
Let me go ahead and invite them.

00:51:52.283 --> 00:51:55.510
And so don't discount the value
of personal relationships.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:52:00.070
Because I think in this world,
it really does matter a lot.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.390
I mentioned, be reliable.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.330
And I say that sort
of tongue-in-cheek,

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:06.750
but I think that the two
hardest things in life

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:08.208
are to do what you
say you're going

00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:09.730
to do, and show up on time.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:13.000
And we are academics, so it's
sort of like herding cats.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.370
But I think that for
me, at least personally,

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.890
I am allergic to people that
cannot respond to email,

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.139
and I'm allergic to people
that are late to my office.

00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:22.810
Because my time is so
precious to me, personally.

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:24.979
And so all of us
have our red lines.

00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:26.770
And you just want to
think carefully about,

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.129
for your working style,
for the group that you run,

00:52:29.129 --> 00:52:30.920
what are the things
that make it effective.

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.370
And then get rid of the things
that don't make it effective.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.380
You can sort of think of
it as the calendar test.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.940
You wake up every day and
you look at your calendar.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.740
And I suspect-- well, I
know-- that all of you

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.614
are extremely bright.

00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:41.470
So it's not the difficulty
of the work that

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:42.730
makes your day challenging.

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:44.577
It's the people that
are in your life that

00:52:44.577 --> 00:52:46.660
are either hard to work
with, that you don't like.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.951
And the luxury of this world
is you can pick and choose

00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:49.570
your teams.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:51.400
So I would pick
very, very carefully.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.140
And surround
yourself with people

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.200
that, ideally, play to your
weaknesses, not your strengths,

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.290
and that help you really push
good ideas through the process.

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:00.280
I would be patient.

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.380
I remember on my first
day of graduate school,

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:03.790
I sat down with my mentor--

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.248
this is Bob Blendon, who's in
the School of Public Health--

00:53:06.248 --> 00:53:07.360
and he said--

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.030
he said, "Sara"-- and I'm
a very impatient person--

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:11.844
he said, "you have to
have staying power.

00:53:11.844 --> 00:53:13.510
You have to chip on
an issue long enough

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.718
to really have an influence."

00:53:14.718 --> 00:53:17.207
And in academic
research, you never quite

00:53:17.207 --> 00:53:19.040
know when that moment's
going to come along.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.680
And so you do this because
you love the field,

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.600
and you love to sort
of pull at threads.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.210
But that does require, I think,
a high degree of patience--

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:28.600
both with the process of
academia and with yourself.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.670
And so I think setting
reasonable benchmarks

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:32.050
and not making
yourself too crazy

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.314
becomes very important
along the way.

00:53:34.314 --> 00:53:36.730
And the last piece, and this
goes back to the conferencing

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.820
piece, but it's a
broader point about,

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.390
you'll hear people say network.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:42.640
And I'm going to reiterate,
you really should network.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:44.530
And so Alan mentioned,
get out in the school

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.932
and try out different things.

00:53:45.932 --> 00:53:47.890
And those are all
opportunities for networking.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:49.639
And this is an opportunity
for networking.

00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:51.970
Walking down the hall is an
opportunity for networking.

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:55.420
My post when I finished
graduate school was at Hopkins.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.010
And I was there for eight years.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.740
And I think in my first year, I
had coffee with like 60 people.

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.950
Because I'd meet with
someone and I'd say,

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:01.840
oh, is there anyone
else that you really

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.506
admire that you think
I should talk to--

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.200
often unrelated to my field.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.370
And the act of buying
someone a cup of coffee that

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:10.240
maybe cost me $2,
that act of kindness

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.620
paid so many dividends.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.590
Like, you'd run
into someone they'd

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.173
say, oh, that was so nice of you
to buy me that cup of coffee.

00:54:15.173 --> 00:54:16.720
My first year I'm like, really?

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.580
But over and over again
I had that reaction.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.100
And it was also just kind of
nice to get to know people.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:23.260
Your time is so precious.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.350
But I'd say particularly
for those of you

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:27.100
that are brand new to
the school and don't

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.710
have a lot of exposure here,
just take the time to get out.

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:30.820
Maybe every week
you say to yourself,

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:31.930
I'm going to email a new person.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.763
I'm going to try to get
to know someone new.

00:54:33.763 --> 00:54:36.160
And it really is both
helpful for understanding

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.500
how different the university
is across schools,

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.400
but then just, ideally,
having people at your level

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.660
that become mentors
and peers and people

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.002
that you can relate to.

00:54:45.002 --> 00:54:46.210
So that's sort of reputation.

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.600
And then switching over to
navigating the tenure process,

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:50.881
thinking globally--

00:54:50.881 --> 00:54:51.880
not just about Harvard--

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.920
I think, again, do good work.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.500
Don't make yourself crazy trying
to get through the Harvard

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.400
process.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.470
Just do good academic
work and make

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:01.136
yourself promotable anywhere.

00:55:01.136 --> 00:55:03.260
And ideally, you will make
it through this process.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.550
But the thing to remember is
all of us, I would imagine,

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:08.290
are in prime years of our lives.

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.089
We are at childbearing years.

00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:11.380
We're at getting-married years.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.460
We're at having a life.

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.759
And so this job is
important, but so, too,

00:55:14.759 --> 00:55:15.550
is everything else.

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.205
And if you make yourself
crazy to get through a process

00:55:18.205 --> 00:55:20.830
and then don't make it through,
it's not going to feel so good.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:23.246
But if you just do good work
that makes you professionally

00:55:23.246 --> 00:55:24.732
happy, you will
be happy anywhere

00:55:24.732 --> 00:55:25.690
where you do that work.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.250
And I would just sort of keep
that in the back of your mind.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.220
I would also be--
and this is something

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:32.260
that has helped me
hugely as a mom,

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.200
which is level-set people
from the beginning.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.120
When I first had my
daughter, who's--

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.867
the oldest is six, the youngest
is four-- someone said to me,

00:55:39.867 --> 00:55:41.950
don't do anything when
she's young that you do not

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:43.570
want to do when she is old.

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:45.660
And the exact same
thing applies here.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.740
Do not answer email at
night and on the weekends

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.030
if you don't want
to start doing that

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.196
for the rest of your career.

00:55:50.196 --> 00:55:52.570
Because the minute you
stop, you're slacking.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:54.610
Well, not working on a Saturday
is not slacking, but if you've

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.200
done it for six years,
and you have a kid,

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.180
and all of a sudden someone
can't rely on you-- like, well,

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.530
what happened to so-and-so?

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:00.402
So level-set people.

00:56:00.402 --> 00:56:02.110
It doesn't mean you
can't monitor emails.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.318
It doesn't mean that you
can't keep an eye on things.

00:56:04.318 --> 00:56:07.296
But don't create expectations
that for you to keep them up,

00:56:07.296 --> 00:56:08.920
you will literally
make yourself crazy.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.820
Because then you
really interfere

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.860
with your own well-being,
and other things

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.830
that matter to you that are
outside of this university.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.290
I would also-- and this is for
those of you that are coming

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.910
close to the tenure process--

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:22.090
get your hands on a successful
dossier from your department

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.020
if you can.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.030
So the dossier process is--

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.770
no offense, Judy-- is painful.

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:27.790
It is hard.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:29.360
It's just a lot
that you have to do,

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.485
which I think, on the other
side, is quite helpful.

00:56:31.485 --> 00:56:33.657
But the process of doing
it is quite challenging.

00:56:33.657 --> 00:56:35.740
So don't reinvent the wheel
more than you have to.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.032
You obviously have to
write up your own story.

00:56:38.032 --> 00:56:39.490
But get an example
of someone who's

00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.350
relatively recent
who's gone through that

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.280
can serve as a guide.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.009
And then to the extent to which
you're willing to get advice--

00:56:45.009 --> 00:56:47.050
because this is obviously
a very sensitive area--

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.920
get a couple of people to
read it and sort of say,

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.400
am I highlighting
the right points.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.690
And hopefully,
getting to that point,

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:54.887
you've had pretty
clear conversations

00:56:54.887 --> 00:56:57.220
with either your department
chair or your mentors about,

00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.750
am I hitting the right
benchmarks, where do I

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.790
need to course correct,
and am I elevating

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:02.230
the right things in my dossier.

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:04.313
And those are conversations
which shouldn't happen

00:57:04.313 --> 00:57:05.554
at year six or year seven.

00:57:05.554 --> 00:57:06.970
They should be
happening annually.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.553
You should really
know where you're at

00:57:08.553 --> 00:57:09.940
relative to where you should be.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.523
And importantly, you
should know where

00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:13.280
you're at relative to yourself.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.860
Don't be thinking about everyone
else in your department.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.790
It is your track.

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.069
It is your time.

00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:18.610
And it's really easy
to get caught up

00:57:18.610 --> 00:57:19.810
in the noise around you.

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.600
And that brings me
to the general tips.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.120
I think one of the things that
becomes important to success

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.030
in this environment, anywhere,
is your signal-to-noise ratio.

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.970
We are increasingly inundated
with invitations and asks,

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:34.210
or things that we should
be doing with our time.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:36.790
And you have to get
good at both saying no--

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.957
kids are really good excuse
for that, or mentors,

00:57:38.957 --> 00:57:40.540
you can use your
mentor as an excuse--

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.996
both saying no, but then
trying to figure out,

00:57:42.996 --> 00:57:44.620
what should I be
focusing on right now.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.090
Because I walk into
work and I think

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.215
that I know what my schedule
is going to look like.

00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:50.890
And then x, y, and z happens,
and I have to reprioritize.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:53.199
And so your ability to find
that needle in a haystack

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:55.240
and figure out what the
important nugget is right

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.830
now becomes really important.

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:59.650
And that's where, to Emily's
point, mentoring becomes key.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.180
So there are a
few people, still,

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.560
where an opportunity
will come along,

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.910
and I'm not quite sure
if it makes sense,

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.290
and I'll just feed
it to them and say,

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:07.790
should I or shouldn't I. And
then I'll get a quick response.

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:09.910
But if you have a few
people in your life, mentors

00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:11.440
that are both
formal and informal,

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.620
they can play that role.

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.220
And I would really urge you
to lean on them for that.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.760
And ideally, you should sit
down with yourself and be honest

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.807
and say, OK, I'm smart,
I'm on faculty at Harvard,

00:58:21.807 --> 00:58:23.890
but there's a lot of things
that don't do so well.

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:25.540
Figure out what your
holes are and plug them

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.581
with people who are really
good at plugging them.

00:58:27.581 --> 00:58:30.310
So in my case, I am in a soft
money environment, where I have

00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:31.602
to write grants all the time.

00:58:31.602 --> 00:58:33.310
And so when I went on
faculty at Harvard,

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:34.900
I had made one of these lists.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:36.826
And I felt very comfortable
in my topic area,

00:58:36.826 --> 00:58:38.450
but I had no idea
how to write a grant.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:41.290
So I attached myself to
the senior faculty member,

00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:44.020
who worked in mental health,
we had zero topical overlap,

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.700
but he showed me how
to write a grant.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.530
And that experience
was invaluable.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:49.187
And so each of you
is going to have

00:58:49.187 --> 00:58:51.520
the Achilles heel, the thing
that you're not so good at.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.449
Just find the one or two people
that can really support you,

00:58:54.449 --> 00:58:55.990
and make sure that
you're successful.

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:02.230
And then the other thing,
in terms of general advice,

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.712
would be--

00:59:03.712 --> 00:59:06.010
and this goes back to staff--

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:07.420
collaborations are so important.

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.920
They're particularly
important for those of us

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:10.840
that are either in the School
of Public Health or the Medical

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.340
School.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.673
But you're going to find
people that you work well with,

00:59:13.673 --> 00:59:15.190
and then hold on really tight.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.840
Because those
productive relationships

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.229
will pay dividends for
you professionally,

00:59:19.229 --> 00:59:20.770
but then it's just
nice to go to work

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:21.970
and surround
yourself with people

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:23.136
that you enjoy working with.

00:59:23.136 --> 00:59:25.940
And I think it's hard to
overemphasize that point.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.990
So in terms of other
key skills to mention,

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:32.090
we haven't talked much
about email today.

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:33.837
And I'm one of these
people who, I do not

00:59:33.837 --> 00:59:36.170
like to leave the office until
I can see all of my email

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.980
on one page.

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.420
It doesn't always happen.

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.517
But email drives me a
little bit crazy sometimes.

00:59:40.517 --> 00:59:42.350
And I think that each
of us is going to have

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.120
our own system for managing it.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.820
But it is worth spending a few
minutes and thinking about it.

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.740
And I wouldn't just do
that in the abstract.

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.635
There are people that you know
that probably work like you

00:59:50.635 --> 00:59:52.160
and think like
you-- ask them, how

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.600
do you manage all
your email, what are

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.710
the strategies that you use.

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:57.080
And just figure out what is a
system that works well for you.

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.470
Because it will suck up all
of your time if you let it.

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:00.969
And so that's
something that I think

01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:04.040
it is worth putting a
little bit of thought into.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.444
And then the last thing--

01:00:06.444 --> 01:00:08.360
and I had a really good
experience with this--

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.660
is don't make any decisions when
you're angry or you're tired.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.660
And any time you get a new
opportunity, even if it sounds

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.610
perfect, give it 24 hours.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.690
And find out, do I want
to work with that person,

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:20.356
does that person have
a reputation which

01:00:20.356 --> 01:00:21.350
may hurt me later.

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:26.390
Because it is so much better
to say no gracefully than to

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.640
have to extract yourself
because of a bad experience.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.130
Because anywhere--
particularly, I

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:33.840
think, at Harvard-- your
reputation is your currency.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.420
And if it gets
damaged because you

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:37.129
get into a bad
working relationship

01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:39.170
that you perhaps could
have prevented with better

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:41.740
knowledge, those can
be pretty hard things

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.970
to course-correct from.

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:44.750
So I'd be thoughtful,
I'd be careful,

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:46.700
and I'd rely on a few
trusted colleagues

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.810
to help you navigate
the process.

01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:50.277
And lastly, have fun.

01:00:50.277 --> 01:00:52.610
I mean, I know that when I'm
here, I'm not with my kids.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:54.560
And so there's obviously
trade-offs there.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.660
I love my job, and
I love being a mom.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.390
And I think that if you
allow this environment, which

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:02.000
is quite intense, to become
very, very stressful,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.460
it's hard then to enjoy the
pleasurable things that we

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.960
should be doing
when we're not here.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.120
And so figuring out
what works for you,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.796
and listening to your
own sort of non-verbals,

01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:12.170
and how you respond
to situations

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.520
becomes really important.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.144
And I want to extend
my congratulations

01:01:15.144 --> 01:01:16.953
in welcoming you all here.

01:01:16.953 --> 01:01:20.390
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:23.422 --> 01:01:25.630
JASON MITCHELL: So thanks,
Judy, for organizing this.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:28.160
I think I was at the
very first one of these

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.580
some number of years ago.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.090
I've, in general, found myself
in a very reminiscent mood,

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.850
and I think in large
part because I just

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:40.480
passed the 20 year mark
of being here at Harvard.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.470
I know that's when I
came because I drove up

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:48.280
on the morning after Princess
Diana had died on August 31,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.280
1997.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.750
And so it's really stuck in my
memory when exactly that was.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.000
And I think partly from having
just passed that anniversary,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.127
and also I'm thinking
about this, this event,

01:02:00.127 --> 01:02:01.960
I've spent a lot of the
last couple of weeks

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.910
thinking about two things.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.660
One, my perceptions
of how Harvard

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.510
has changed the most in the
years since I've been here,

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:13.940
and then also how I've changed
at Harvard in that 20 year

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.440
period.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.820
And what I realized--

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.070
I think by surprise,
it wasn't something

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.840
I had in the back
of my head even--

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.380
is that both of those
have landed on teaching--

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.970
both Harvard's
approach to teaching,

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.072
and my own thoughts about
how teaching has changed me.

01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:30.280
So I thought I would just
spend a few minutes talking

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.560
about reflections
on both of those.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.184
And then I've actually gotten
some additional thoughts

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.350
from all the wonderful
comments that came before me.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:40.630
So if I have time, I'll
augment, amplify some

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.950
of what you've heard before.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.060
So you heard Judy say,
right from the beginning,

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.430
that Harvard has changed
quite a bit with regard

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:53.050
to how it thinks about its
junior faculty members,

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.740
it's non-tenured
faculty members.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.948
And as you know-- you've
probably already sensed this

01:02:56.948 --> 01:02:59.290
if you've been here in
any capacity before--

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.740
you know that Harvard is
kind of a strange place.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.380
Like, it likes to do things
in its own particular way,

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.030
even though other
places have kind

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:10.000
of-- you would have thought--
worked out some of the kinks.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.700
And one of the ways that
Harvard was strange until fairly

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:16.300
recently was that almost
all of the tenured faculty

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.410
came from outside of its ranks.

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:21.730
The non-tenured faculty were
here for some number of years

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:25.480
before typically moving on
to some other institution.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.150
And that created a
lot of strangeness,

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.100
and strange dynamics
between faculty,

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.050
and faculty and
students, and lots

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.750
of senior people in
their 60s and 70s,

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.120
and then a bunch of younger
people in their 30s,

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.430
and no one in between.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:43.120
But one of the ways that I
think it created strangeness

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.710
was really around teaching.

01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.959
Because when you think about
what an institution might

01:03:46.959 --> 01:03:49.354
do in bringing folks from
outside, it's typically,

01:03:49.354 --> 01:03:51.520
you're looking for the best
scholars in that field--

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.840
the best historian of science,
or the best chemical engineer.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.820
And you may pay less attention
to whether that person's

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.320
a wonderful teacher.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.090
And so what kind of happened
was that senior faculty--

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:09.220
and I should also
say, many people

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.959
who were thinking
about coming to Harvard

01:04:10.959 --> 01:04:13.000
might have found it
attractive to come to a place

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.540
where teaching was
emphasized less than

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.070
at their previous institution.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:23.170
So much of the teaching devolved
to the younger, junior faculty.

01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:28.510
But there was also a sense that
teachers are sort of born, not

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.660
made, and that there
just wasn't much one

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.000
could do to influence teaching.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.650
You either had the
knack for it or not.

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.120
And so I think around the time
that the tenure system changed,

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.190
there was also this
realization that we

01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:46.450
could be approaching teaching
the same way that we approach

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.820
many of our mentoring
activities--

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.640
to take individuals who
were new to the classroom,

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.140
or new to the kinds of teaching
they were being asked to do,

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.702
whether it be case methods or
teaching a big lecture course,

01:04:57.702 --> 01:04:59.410
and to try to work
with those individuals

01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:02.720
to improve what it is
they did in the classroom.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.200
And so over the
last 10 or 15 years,

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.710
Harvard's made what I consider
to be a very sizable investment

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:12.490
in the infrastructure around
teaching and learning.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:17.210
So I'll just mention a couple
of those things that are--

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:20.500
and as others have said before,
I have a particular lens,

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.490
being an FAS faculty member.

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:25.190
So not all of this is
relevant to individuals

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:27.470
in the other schools.

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:31.240
But I think what is true across
the schools is the renewed

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.220
emphasis on trying
to help individuals--

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:37.930
especially our new assistant,
associate professors--

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:40.750
figure out how to be most
effective in the classroom.

01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:45.190
So under the umbrella of
"Harvard likes to do things

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.990
in its own way," what
Harvard has not done,

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:50.320
at least not in my department,
and I don't think across

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.787
the FAS-- although, it might
be different in your schools--

01:05:52.787 --> 01:05:55.120
is some of the things that
other institutions have done.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.380
For instance, in the FAS,
there's no FAS-wide policy

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:03.040
that your teaching is reviewed
by some other faculty member.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.700
Nobody has literally ever come
into my classroom in the 10

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.130
years I've been teaching
here to try to give me tips.

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.588
That may happen in
your department.

01:06:10.588 --> 01:06:11.362
I hope it does.

01:06:11.362 --> 01:06:12.820
But there's no kind
of expectation.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.340
I know other places, that's
actually built formally

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.860
into the mentoring process.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:19.840
And unlike other
places, there's nobody

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.944
who's ever reviewed a
syllabus I've written.

01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:23.860
I've just been asked--

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.000
I have, for the last 10 years,
been teaching Intro Psych.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.090
I got a bunch of PowerPoint
slides from the other person

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:30.779
who teaches it.

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:32.820
And that's been the extent
to which anybody knows

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.770
what I do inside my classroom.

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:38.340
So unlike, let's say at Yale,
there's no committee in the FAS

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.950
that reviews course syllabi.

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:44.487
This is kind of crazy when you
think about it in this way.

01:06:44.487 --> 01:06:46.570
So it's a little bit of
the quirkiness of Harvard.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:51.060
But I think it's also in the
spirit of Harvard trying to

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:56.760
instead not micromanage what
goes on inside your classroom.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.220
But instead, the FAS
and the university

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.580
have taken the approach of
trying to build infrastructure

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:09.210
to invest in systemic places
where faculty members can

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:13.560
improve their teaching and
access resources for improving

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.140
pedagogy.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.347
So I'll mention a few of those.

01:07:16.347 --> 01:07:18.430
And if you want to follow
up with me at any point,

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:20.790
I'd be happy to
talk more with you.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:23.070
So two things that will
be relevant for, I think,

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:27.060
everyone in this room is the
Bok Center, which I'm sure most

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.920
of you have heard about by now.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.430
And the Bok Center
was originally created

01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:35.370
with kind of a limited
mindset to think about,

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:39.180
how do we improve the
day-to-day, nuts-and-bolts

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.110
aspects of teaching.

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:43.050
So when I first
encountered the Bok Center

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.090
as a graduate student
in the late '90s,

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.040
lots of what they
did was to say, let's

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:47.890
talk about what's
going to happen

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.320
on the very first day of class.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.280
Let's workshop that.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.200
And that was
incredibly valuable.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.470
And as I got further
in my career,

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:58.380
I could access the Bok
Center for other kinds

01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.790
of nuts-and-bolts issues--

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.970
I'm having trouble figuring
out how to lecture effectively

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:03.960
in time management.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.220
And I had people help work
with me to think through,

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.120
why are your lecturers
not feeling right,

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.860
how can you manage
your time better.

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.990
And you can still
access the Bok Center

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:15.900
for those kinds of
nuts-and-bolts sorts

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.149
of concerns.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.309
And I would encourage you
to go over there, even

01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:22.350
in advance of actually
teaching your first class,

01:08:22.350 --> 01:08:25.890
to just talk to them
about tips about what

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:27.750
to do on the first
day of class, how

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:31.950
do you manage your time in a
120 minute lecture, et cetera.

01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:35.010
But recently, as you know,
the world has changed.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.830
And the 120 minute
lecture is not

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.899
the only format we
have available to us,

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.510
nor is the 5 to 10 page paper.

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:47.975
And so partly spurred on
by innovations and advances

01:08:47.975 --> 01:08:50.196
with digital learning,
the Bok Center,

01:08:50.196 --> 01:08:52.029
and also other parts
of the university which

01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:53.404
I'll talk about
in just a second,

01:08:53.404 --> 01:08:56.010
have also been very
interested in helping

01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:59.189
faculty think through what
they could be doing differently

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:00.069
in their class.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.979
So to think through,
sure, I know

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:04.290
that the five page paper
has been effective for you

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:05.270
as a learner--

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.680
that the 120 minute
lecture worked for you,

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.052
but given your goals
in this course,

01:09:10.052 --> 01:09:12.510
are there other ways that you
might approach the material--

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:14.370
everything from the
famed flipped classroom

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.830
that you've heard a lot about
to just thinking through what

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:18.954
kinds of assignments
you might challenge

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:21.120
your students with that are
different from the kinds

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.578
of assignments that
you encountered

01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:24.160
when you were an undergraduate.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.700
So part of that can be accessed
through the Bok Center.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.200
And again, I encourage
you as you're

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.979
thinking about your courses to
talk to folks over there, who,

01:09:31.979 --> 01:09:34.529
you could disregard all
of their suggestions,

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:36.870
but will at least help you
think in a different way

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:38.578
than you're probably
used to about what's

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:40.979
possible inside your classroom.

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:43.649
At the same time,
the university has

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:47.130
other university-wide programs.

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:50.580
So Peter Bol, who's the
Vice Provost for Advances

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:53.160
in Learning, runs
a couple of groups

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.720
that have a variety of
different initiatives.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.080
One is, Peter's group
hosts an entire library

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.700
of digital resources.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.980
So that could be
everything from,

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.169
hey, I'm teaching this
course, Intro Psych,

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:09.210
and I really need somebody
to talk to my students

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:11.100
about the hippocampus--
and I'm just not

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.350
an expert on the hippocampus.

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:15.670
So it turns out there's
some lecture that somebody

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.740
has filmed, somewhere.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.290
And maybe it's just a
little five minute blurb,

01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:21.180
and you can insert
that into your course--

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.850
either through
Canvas, the website,

01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:25.080
or show it to your students.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.060
So that's one kind
of digital resource.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.500
But everything up to, I can't
get enough TFs for my course,

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.560
is there any other way I could
think about designing sections,

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.935
and all sorts of tools
around rethinking,

01:10:37.935 --> 01:10:39.810
maybe I don't need to
have TFs for my course.

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.480
Maybe we can do this
peer-to-peer, among students.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.990
Or maybe we can do some kind
of digital platforming of what

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:47.110
goes on inside sections.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:50.320
So that's another area
where resources exist.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.180
They're not widely
advertised, but I

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.400
know that group is very
eager to have faculty

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.790
from across the schools
access those resources.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:04.170
And then finally, I'll mention
HILT, the Hauser Initiative

01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:08.320
in Learning and Teaching,
which provides small, startup,

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.160
what they often call
Spark Grants, for faculty

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.260
who want to try something
new in their course.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.840
That might be to create
some new resource,

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.480
or to help offset
personnel who will

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.050
help you think very differently
about what it is you're doing.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.970
There's a couple of other
FAS-specific resources,

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:26.550
which I won't mention now.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.330
But if you're
interested in accessing

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.850
some of these
pedagogical resources,

01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:33.280
again, I'm happy to
talk about any of this.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.350
Feel free to email
me at any point.

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:39.250
Part of my mission,
role, as faculty director

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.780
of the Program in
General Education,

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.570
is to talk to new faculty
about ideas they have.

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:45.850
Maybe not right now, as
you start your career here,

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:47.020
but things that you
might be interested

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.103
in sometime in the future.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.894
So that's, I think, how
Harvard has changed--

01:11:52.894 --> 01:11:54.310
at least, my
experience of Harvard

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.942
has changed-- since
I've come here.

01:11:55.942 --> 01:11:57.400
And I thought I
would also just say

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.690
a little bit about how
teaching has changed me

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:05.150
as a scholar and intellectual.

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:09.310
So maybe some of you have
this intuition as well.

01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:13.120
I felt like from the moment I
took Intro Psych as a freshman,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.280
through everything I ever
did as a psychologist

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.660
for the next 10 years, was
sort of like this decreasingly

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.720
sized funnel.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.240
It went from this
really big picture

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.980
of the field and
all the excitement

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.440
around learning the
whole panoply of what's

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.960
out there in psychology to
drilling down to very, very

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.420
specific problems
within the field,

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.240
writing grants and
papers, and becoming

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.330
an expert in something.

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:40.180
And I realized that the moment
where that really changed,

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.570
where the funnel
started expanding again,

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:46.580
was the moment that I
started teaching Intro Psych.

01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.310
And what that course
has done for me,

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:52.952
it has really forced me to
start to think about the field

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:54.910
through a lens that's
much broader than the one

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:56.826
I get by just talking
to my graduate students,

01:12:56.826 --> 01:12:59.810
or doing the kinds of
scholarly work that I do.

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:01.240
And so without
that experience, I

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:06.700
feel like I would be a much more
narrow intellectual, scholar,

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:10.840
academic than I ever would have
been after that experience.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.930
And so I think, OK,
that's all well and good.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.290
We like to be intellectuals.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.690
But then I thought, just
for selfish reasons,

01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:23.650
I feel like beyond just
my own personal enjoyment

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.960
of that experience, it
has actually affected

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.900
my scholarship in ways that I
could never have anticipated,

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.820
were I not to have the
teaching experience.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.710
It's helped me
understand how what I do

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:34.930
fits into a much bigger picture.

01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:37.750
It's often pointed
places out to me

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:41.050
where there just isn't research
being done, or not as much

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.290
as you'd like, and so
suggested questions

01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:46.630
that I didn't actually
know were there.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:49.480
And also, as someone
said, this place

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.550
is full of all sorts of
different kinds of people

01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:53.299
from all sorts of
different walks of life.

01:13:53.299 --> 01:13:56.140
And probably the most diverse
group on the entire campus

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.697
is our undergraduates.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:00.030
And as you'll see as you're--
for those of you who are--

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:02.200
especially teaching
in the FAS, it's

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.800
an enormous source both
of personal joy, but also

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.230
intellectual
excitement to engage

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:11.600
in this way with students.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.230
So that's just my own
personal reflection

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:18.262
on what it means to teach here.

01:14:18.262 --> 01:14:19.720
Could I take a
couple more minutes?

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:20.220
OK.

01:14:23.087 --> 01:14:24.670
Occasionally, you'll
hear someone talk

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:27.457
about how they've
gotten teaching relief,

01:14:27.457 --> 01:14:29.290
as if they put teaching
in the same category

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:32.620
as dental pain and
hemorrhoids or something.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.180
It never feels like that to me.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.220
I have always thought,
yes, sometimes I'm

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.180
exhausted by the
demands of teaching,

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.590
but in general, I have gotten
more out of it than I think,

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:44.580
probably, my students
have gotten out of me.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.330
I wanted to say a
couple other things that

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:48.400
were just spurred on
by various comments,

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.990
mostly to amplify them.

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:54.280
And Judy mentioned President
Faust's One Harvard Initiative,

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.640
which is fantastic.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.520
But despite the attempt
to bring us all on board,

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:02.530
I want to remind everyone
here that there is

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.180
no such thing as one Harvard.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.595
That is, Harvard
is not one thing.

01:15:07.595 --> 01:15:08.470
I'm reminded of how--

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.880
I grew up in New York City.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.477
And most people think about
New York City in a particular--

01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:14.310
like a little slice.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:18.370
They think of Times Square
and seeing Broadway plays.

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.954
And maybe getting
on a bus and seeing

01:15:19.954 --> 01:15:22.120
Grant's tomb and the Statue
of Liberty or something.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.320
But that's some very, very
tiny slice of New York City.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.400
There's 7 million
other experiences

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.800
of New York City besides
that, most of which

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.120
have nothing to do with that.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.990
And Harvard lends itself to the
same sorts of misconceptions.

01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:37.060
Even now, when I think
about what Harvard

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:41.920
is, I think of some guy with
a big gray beard who speaks

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.470
in iambic pentameter at faculty
meetings, and starts off

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:50.040
by saying, in my 47
years here at Harvard,

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.600
I have never been so
angry, at whatever

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.580
it is that they're angry about.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.090
And that is definitely
part of Harvard.

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:00.790
There is a Harvard
that does that.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:03.580
And there's the Harvard of
Nobel laureates, and New Yorker

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:07.450
contributors, and
National Academy members,

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:10.420
and all of those things
that make Harvard wonderful.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.790
And then there's the
Harvard of the people

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:15.490
in this room, the
people who are coming

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.900
to this place for
the first time,

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:19.316
often from different places
with completely different ways

01:16:19.316 --> 01:16:21.670
of doing things, with a
completely different lens

01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:23.200
on what's possible.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.080
And there's the Harvard of
our graduate students, who

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:29.050
are eager to engage
for the first time

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:30.970
in the same serious
way that we do,

01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:33.910
with the kinds of work that
animates us and keeps us up

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:34.540
at night.

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.950
And there are the
undergraduates,

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:41.316
as I mentioned before, who are
spectacular and open vessels

01:16:41.316 --> 01:16:43.690
for the kinds of things that
we want to teach them about.

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:46.270
There are the administrators,
who make this place run.

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:51.100
And each of those groups
is contributing to Harvard

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.580
in its own particular way.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.780
And so one of the things that
I have only recently begun

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:59.590
to realize is that there are
many paths through this place.

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:02.440
If you may want to be
that person in 47 years

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.350
time who gets up and throws a
shoe at the faculty meeting,

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:08.140
and that's wonderful, but
you may want your Harvard

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.260
to be one of political
activism, as we've

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.080
begun to see many of our
faculty are interested in.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.260
Or you may want your
Harvard to be an investment

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.120
in undergraduates.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.630
That's your particular slice
of what it means to be a here.

01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:25.046
So I would just encourage
you to remind yourself

01:17:25.046 --> 01:17:26.920
that just like your bus
tour of New York City

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.230
did not give you a sense
of what New York really

01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.840
is, your particular
experience through Harvard

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.200
will be shaded by the one
path you take through here.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.800
But that path can be much
more windy and multifaceted

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.822
than I think it appears
to us from the outside.

01:17:41.822 --> 01:17:43.030
Last thing I'm going to say--

01:17:45.610 --> 01:17:50.614
I think all of my colleagues
before me suggested to you--

01:17:50.614 --> 01:17:52.280
they gave you the
advice to seek advice.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.720
And I think that's really good.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.850
And I would actually
go one step further,

01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.630
which is that you
don't really want

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.600
to seek advice so much as
you want to seek criticism.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.400
And the distinction
that I make is

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.440
that very few of my
colleagues has ever

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.790
been willing to answer the
question, what could I--

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:15.820
if I go to them and
say, what kind of advice

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:19.330
would you give me, unless
you're an economist,

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.538
you tend not to want
to demoralize people.

01:18:21.538 --> 01:18:23.290
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:26.060
Or at least think
twice about it.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.451
So it's been very hard for me
to extract meaningful advice

01:18:29.451 --> 01:18:29.950
from that.

01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:32.500
And I think what
tends to come out

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.100
is the person's own experience
of how he or she navigated

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:36.809
through academia.

01:18:36.809 --> 01:18:39.016
But as I said before, there
are many different paths.

01:18:39.016 --> 01:18:41.570
And there are many different
paths to getting tenure here.

01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:43.959
No two people's
dossier looks the same.

01:18:43.959 --> 01:18:46.000
And so you should take
that with a grain of salt,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.150
that this was this
person's successful path

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:50.770
through to tenure, or
through Harvard, et cetera.

01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:53.320
What I do find more valuable
is to actually give people

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.360
license to criticize
you, and to actually

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.510
put yourself in the way of
criticism as much as you can.

01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:00.790
So the trick that I
use is to really play

01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:03.310
on people's own ego.

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:05.410
That's why I'm a psychologist.

01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:08.110
And it's to ask people
the question, what

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:10.630
would you do differently,
what would you

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:12.460
have done if you were me.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.830
And very few of my colleagues
are comfortable saying,

01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:16.246
oh, no, you did
it just perfectly.

01:19:16.246 --> 01:19:19.060
I couldn't improve
upon what you did.

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:22.552
But people need to feel
licensed to say, oh, yeah,

01:19:22.552 --> 01:19:24.010
I would have said
this differently,

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:26.090
or, I wouldn't have done
that, or whatever it is.

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.910
So I try to do this even now.

01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:29.260
After every meeting I have--

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.176
I will ask Judy at the
end of this, what could

01:19:31.176 --> 01:19:32.440
I have done differently--

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.680
every talk that I give,
both within my department

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.610
and also if I have close
friends outside the department.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:41.050
So I would just encourage
you to try to put yourself

01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:44.050
in the way of criticism as much
as possible with this growth

01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:48.280
mindset at the
back of your head.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.010
It's almost certain that you
are not an expert, or not

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:54.520
perfect at various
aspects of this job.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.860
And so I think about,
if you were launching

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.260
a satellite to a distant planet,
you've got a couple of choices.

01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.820
One is to get the trajectory
just right at the onset, which

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:06.050
is really hard--
impossible-- or to build

01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.510
in a system that
can course-correct

01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:08.914
as it gets there.

01:20:08.914 --> 01:20:11.080
I would encourage you to
think about your own career

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.650
in that way.

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:13.660
You're unlikely to
have the trajectory set

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.700
just right at the very outset.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:18.100
So think about how you
might build in mechanisms

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.120
for course-correcting.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.910
So I'm going to stop there.

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:23.432
And like everyone else, I'm
very happy to answer questions.

01:20:23.432 --> 01:20:26.736
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:30.450
ELIZABETH ANCARANA:
That was so interesting.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:34.830
Thank you to each of you
for such great advice

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.680
for your colleagues.
