o music]

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.094
You want-you want
to go put it up?

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.554
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know where it goes?

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.556
-You know how to put it up?
-Yes, sir.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.765
[cheerful music]

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.475
Carefully.
[laughs]

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.227
<i>Trevor thinks he knows
everything,</i>

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.354
but he's definitely
still got a lot to learn.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.525
All right.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:27.777
[music continues]

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.579
[grunts]

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.289

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.375
[music fades comically]

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.543
Ahh! [bleep]

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.044
Damn it, almost had it.

00:00:47.922 --> 00:00:49.799
[grunts] No!

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.634
Ah!

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.511
Third try. Ah.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:55.096
Oh.

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.515
[Trevor] Yeah.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.771
Gonna get it.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.899
Gonna...
All right, hold on.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.028
No! Oh... Ohh!

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:11.571
Ahh.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.657
Ah. Might need help.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.743
Might need help.
They think I'm a chump.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.204
Seventh time's the charm,
Trevor.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.207
[breathing heavily]

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.709
Michael?

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.128
Is there an easier way
to do this?

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:29.088
[Michael]

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.757
[Trevor groans loudly]

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.675
Why you trying to
put it up there?

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:34.427
[Trevor] 'Cause that's
where it goes.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.012
-Is it?
-[Trevor] Yes.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.764
Did you look at
the other side?

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.893
No, I looked at this side
and it was-it was up-up here.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.394
Did you look at
the hose behind you?

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:45.480
It was hanging--
Look, Wes,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.024
it was hanging up there,
all right?

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.651
-[Wes] Was it?
-Yes.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.944
Yes, sir.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.487
-Are you sure?
-[Trevor] Positive.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.740
You know there's a hose as
an example right behind you?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.909
[Trevor] Yeah, well, that's not
how it's supposed to go.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:58.910
[Wes laughs]

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.538
[upbeat country music]

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.424
[Trevor] Thank you, Dustin,
for helping me.

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:18.596
Ah, it fit!
Got it.

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:20.890
Ohh...

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.643
They half-ass things
around here.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.770
I didn't learn that way.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.694
My dad taught me better.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.116
-Did you get it?
-[Trevor] Yep.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.409
Nice.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.244
Now, how are we gonna
get it down?

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.538
-[both laugh]
-[Dustin] I know, right?
