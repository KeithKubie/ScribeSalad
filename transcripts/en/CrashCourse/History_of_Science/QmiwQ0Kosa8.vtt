00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.280
Sometimes, scientists realize they are doing
revolutionary work, and the world agrees.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.309
Darwin and Pasteur, for example, were massive
celebrities.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.910
Other times, revolutionaries toil quietly
for decades, leaving behind work that the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.490
rest of us appreciate only much later.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.540
This is the story of Gregor Mendel and the
birth, loss, and rebirth of classical genetics.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:34.900
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.700
According to Darwin, organisms have slightly
different traits, and this slight variation

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.780
becomes more important over time, as environments
change and some traits become more useful

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.780
than others.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.440
Organisms give traits to their descendants.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.820
Over millions of years, new species split
off as they become so different from their

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.980
ancestral species that they can no longer
interbreed.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.980
Sounds good!

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.440
But wait, how are traits passed down?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.540
If a tall person marries a short person and
they have a kid, how likely is that kid to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.649
be tall, medium, short?

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.729
Darwin knew perfectly well that he didn’t
know.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.220
He theorized the general category of thing
that he thought he should—or someone should—figure

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.220
out.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.520
He called the hypothetical unit of heredity
the “pangene.”

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.850
This is where we get “gene.”

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.820
But Darwin didn’t know what a “gene”
should look like.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.230
Would there be a gene for “tall” or “short?”

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.749
Or a bunch of genes that somehow interacted
to influence height?

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.090
Or was height all a product of what you ate
as a kid?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.399
Today, geneticists can answer these questions,
in part thanks to a contemporary of Darwin’s

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.710
who went largely unknown in his day.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.359
Gregor Mendel was born in the Austrian Empire,
in what is now the Czech Republic, in 1822—the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.350
same year as Galton and Pasteur.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.600
Mendel’s family were poor farmers.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.509
He was always interested in growing plants
and beekeeping.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.490
He went off to college to study philosophy
and physics at Palacký University.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.570
There, he studied with an agricultural scientist
named Johann Karl Nestler who specialized

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.119
in breeding sheep.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.539
But he ultimately became a monk at St. Thomas’s
Abbey.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.800
Still, that didn’t stop Mendel from studying
science.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.060
He asked his abbot for some land to set up
an experimental garden, specifically to study

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.880
natural variation in English peas.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.280
And from 1856 to 1863, that’s what Mendel
did.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.020
ThoughtBubble, show us the wonders of counting
English peas:

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.200
Mendel grew and tracked 28,000 plants.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.570
He focused on seven traits: seed color, individual
seed shape, unripe seed pod color, seed pod

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.940
shape, flower color, flower location, and
plant height.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.000
Importantly, these traits seemed to be inherited
independently of each other, which made these

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
seven traits really useful for doing quantitative,
or measurement-based, biology.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.650
This work on peas wasn’t that different
from Darwin’s pigeon breeding: both scientists

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.980
wanted to see how traits vary over time.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.840
But you can grow more peas, faster, than you
can pigeons.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.900
So, after seven years of carefully tending
peas, what did my dude conclude?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.970
Mendel noticed that some characteristics seemed
to be passed down often, and some tended to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360
disappear after only one generation.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.150
He coined the terms “dominant” and “recessive”
to describe these traits.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.380
Putting numbers to his experiments, Mendel
saw that 1 in 4 pea plants had purebred recessive

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.380
traits.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.730
2 in 4 were hybrids with both recessive and
dominant traits.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.250
And 1 in 4 were purebred dominant for the
traits.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.070
You can draw this as a square to help visualize
the “crosses” of the dominant and recessive

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.070
traits.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.240
Mendel also figured out three general claims
that are now known as the Laws of Menmdelian

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240
Inheritance.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.460
The first is the Law of Segregation, which
states that the genes that control traits

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.930
are distinct.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.930
Some of them, anyways.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.950
The second is the Law of Independent Assortment:
genes that control different traits switch

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.280
around when organisms breed.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.540
Changing a pea’s seed color in breeding,
say, doesn’t seem to change its height.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.500
And the third Mendelian law is that of Dominance:
some traits are dominant, and others recessive.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.980
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.940
Mendel shared his pea results in a paper called
“Experiments on Plant Hybridization” in

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.940
1865.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.159
And Mendel corresponded with the influential
Swiss botanist Carl Nägeli from 1866 to 1873.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.159
Boom!

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:25.800
Within one decade of Darwin's Origin, Wallace’s
Malay Archipelago, Galton’s Hereditary Genius,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.259
and Pasteur’s experiments on biogenesis—Mendel
had created a quantitative genetics.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.669
And yet… nobody cared.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.800
Why the eclipse of poor Gregor?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.979
First of all, Mendel himself didn’t care,
in the big-picture sense.

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.199
His goal had been to improve plant breeding.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.810
In no way was he trying to be like Chuck Darwin
and promote a grand theory of Life.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.430
Second, Mendel was so isolated in a backwater
abbey in eastern Europe, far from London or

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.430
Paris.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.770
Third, Mendel just had super bad luck: he
tried to reproduce the results of his pea

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.430
experiments—because, you know, the scientific
method.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.050
But his second model plant was hawkweed.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.300
No one knew at the time, but unlike humans
and mice and flies and peas, hawkweed reproduces

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.860
asexually.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.110
Two parents don’t neatly cross traits when
they make offspring.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.400
So, no Mendelian recessive and dominant traits.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
No square.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.919
Fourth, right after his hawkweed debacle,
Mendel got promoted to abbot in 1868.

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.969
This sidelined him with administrative duties.

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.889
Mendel didn’t publish after that, and he
wasn’t part of a larger scientific debate

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.189
about heredity.

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.150
He was just too busy to write a book like
Origin.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.479
He had an abbey to run.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.080
And fifth and finally, Mendel was scientifically
so far ahead of his time that other biologists

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.949
didn’t see how his work with peas related
to the grand sweep of evolution.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.830
It just wasn’t obvious.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.319
So Mendel died, and genetics was lost.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.550
For a few decades.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.210
Who rediscovered Mendel?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.210
Who didn’t!?

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.349
Right around 1900, four different researchers
working on the heritability of traits independently

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.599
read Mendel’s landmark paper and understood
just how critical his pea experiments had

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.599
been.

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.909
They became champions of “Mendelism,”
or the science of heredity, which was soon

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.710
renamed genetics.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.159
The rediscovery of Mendel’s research led
to the formulation of a specific research

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.580
plan by these geneticists.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.770
In 1900, Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries rediscovered
Mendel’s isolation of traits.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.000
De Vries was already a famous biologist for
popularizing Darwin’s term “pangene”

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.199
for the unit of heredity, and for coming up
with the term “mutation.”

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.900
De Vries rejected the gradual blending of
characteristics that others argued for.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.469
He thought traits could jump around, because
he could observe changes in his evening primroses

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:47.160
after only one generation.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.660
Also in 1900, German botanist Carl Correns
rediscovered Mendel.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.710
Correns had been a student of Mendel’s famous
colleague, Nägeli.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.870
Also–also in 1900, Austrian agronomist Erich
von Tschermak rediscovered Mendel and developed

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.940
disease-resistant hybrid crops.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.199
And then in 1901, American economist William
Jasper Spillman published his own independent

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.330
high-fiving of Mendel in a paper called “Quantitative
Studies on the Transmission of Parental Characters

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.529
to Hybrid Offspring.”

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:17.310
Which pretty much sums up classical genetics.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.469
Just think about these events: one monk who
loved gardening worked out how traits are

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:24.479
passed on in living things.

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:25.509
No one cared.

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:31.129
And then decades later, in the span of a single
year, four separate researchers realized that

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:35.569
this monk’s data on peas was absolutely
priceless.

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.020
Retroactively, Mendel became the “father”
of genetics.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.240
Historians of biology have debated exactly
how Mendel well really fits that title.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.259
But, overall, his legacy was secured by de
Vries and his contemporaries.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:52.229
The work of the first geneticists also gave
rise to a controversy in the life sciences.

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.000
On the one hand, those scientists who followed
Darwin and Galton believed that traits blended

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.289
smoothly.

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.410
This is what Galton saw in human populations.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.289
On the other hand, the geneticists like de
Vries had extensive hands-on experience with

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:10.849
plant breeding and could see that Mendel was
right: many traits jump around from generation

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:11.849
to generation.

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:17.080
But the botanists didn’t make Mendel a famous
science hero: the Fly Boys did.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.610
In the 1910s, a group at Columbia University
in New York led by Thomas Hunt Morgan conducted

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.139
extensive experiments on the genetics of fruit
flies.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:32.020
The scientists at Columbia’s Fly Room researched
mutations in the common fruit fly, Drosophila

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.020
melanogaster.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.360
One of Morgan’s star student’s, Alfred
“Hot Dog” Sturtevant, pioneered genetic

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.240
linkage maps, or ways of finding the locations
of genes on chromosomes, the tubelike physical

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.970
structures that store genetic material.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.200
This involved painstakingly breeding flies
with two different mutations and comparing

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.519
their chromosomes.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:59.730
Linkage maps are markers of order—of which
genes come after which—not exact locations.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.779
But they were still very useful in working
out how traits are passed down.

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:10.019
With many, many, gross experiments going on,
the Fly Room researchers needed a lot of flies.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.920
They also had to develop standardized breeding
practices.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.160
Over many fly generations, they “reconstructed”
their flies into a standard type that could

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.310
be crossed with stable mutants.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.810
This became the first real model organism,
a living laboratory technology that could

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:31.529
be shared with distant colleagues, upgraded
to surpass rivals, customized on demand, and

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.639
re-made easily in case of emergency.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:38.510
Today, we have many other model organisms,
including worms, mice, rats, rabbits, pigs,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.839
monkeys, and everyone’s favorite, bread
mold.

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:46.290
Three of the Fly Guys authored The Mechanism
of Mendelian Heredity in 1915, which became

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.470
the foundational textbook of classical genetics.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.430
And Morgan won the Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine in 1933 for his lab’s work on

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.500
the role that chromosomes play in heredity.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.730
But the Nobelist who did the most work on
how chromosomes transmit genetic information—in

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.949
an organism with way more chromosomes than
fruit flies—was American geneticist Barbara

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:06.949
McClintock.

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:13.329
In the 1920s, she discovered how genes combine—and
thus how information is exchanged when cells

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:14.329
divide.

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:19.880
She produced the first genetic map for corn
or maize, linking regions of the chromosome

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.959
to physical traits.

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:26.959
Then, in the 1940s and 50s, McClintock discovered
transposition of genes, or the ability of

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.690
genes to change position on chromosomes.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.209
She worked out how genes are responsible for
turning physical characteristics on and off.

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:39.899
She explained color variation in corn, theorizing
how genetic information is expressed across

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:42.730
generations, including why it’s sometimes
suppressed.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.790
And yet McClintock stopped publishing her
data in 1953 due to her colleagues’ skepticism.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.449
She was too far ahead of her time.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:52.980
Basically, she got Mendeled.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.790
But at least McClintock was awarded the Nobel
in Physiology or Medicine in 1983—four decades

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.730
later—for her discovery of jumping genes.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.600
She remains the only woman to receive an unshared
Nobel Prize in that category.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.149
Next time—we’ll heat things up and get
to work with the birth of thermodynamics!
