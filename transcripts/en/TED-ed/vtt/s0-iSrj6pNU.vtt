00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.121
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:10.020
Sarcophagus,

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.959
a stone coffin typically adorned

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:15.522
with decorative carvings or inscriptions.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.825
The history of the word sarcophagus

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.117
is so skin-crawlingly grotesque,

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:21.677
it seems to come right out

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:24.693
of a low-budget horror film.

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:27.608
Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however,

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:31.575
its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.404
where the Greek word sarkophagus

00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:36.274
was used to describe the limestone

00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:37.941
that a coffin was made of,

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.026
not the coffin itself.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.079
According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder,

00:00:43.103 --> 00:00:45.124
citizens of the Empire believed

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:47.523
that limestone from a quarry near Troy

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.074
would dissolve flesh.

00:00:50.098 --> 00:00:52.466
For this reason, it was quite desireable

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.113
in the construction of coffins.

00:00:55.137 --> 00:00:58.054
Though it's unclear
if the belief was widespread

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.136
or even accurately reported by Pliny,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.864
what is certain is that sarkophagus

00:01:03.888 --> 00:01:06.625
came from the Greek words sark,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.158
meaning flesh,

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:09.775
and phagein,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.818
a verb meaning to eat.

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:14.607
From flesh-eating stone

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:16.072
to stone coffin,

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:17.994
it's a fitting etymology

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:21.299
for the final resting
place of the deceased.
