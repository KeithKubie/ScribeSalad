00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.024
 Let's gain some experience in solving equations, 

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:04.044
 which include simple and decimate fractions. 

00:00:04.044 --> 00:00:06.703
 This equation includes ordinary fractions. 

00:00:06.703 --> 00:00:07.307
 Let's see. 

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:11.173
 We have minus 1/3 is equal to j / 4 minus 10/3. 

00:00:11.173 --> 00:00:12.252
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:13.494
 and see if you can find j. 

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:16.849
 What value of j will make this equation true? 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:17.650
 All right. 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.148
 Now let's do it together. 

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:20.994
 I want to isolate the variable, 

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:22.050
 which I'm trying to find, 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.617
 from one side. 

00:00:23.617 --> 00:00:25.196
 Since it is already on the right, 

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:26.589
 to try to get everything that includes j, 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.191
 on the right side and then 

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.689
 to get rid of everything else 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.908
 on the right side. 

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:32.835
 I want to remove this minus 10/3 

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.553
 and the best way I can think of it, 

00:00:34.553 --> 00:00:35.992
 is to add 10/3. 

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:38.349
 But I can not do this just on one side 

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.011
 of the equation. 

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:40.195
 Then it will no longer be equal. 

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.052
 If this is equal to that to 

00:00:42.052 --> 00:00:43.712
 be true the equality I do with this country, 

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.500
 I also have to do it with the other. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.240
 I have to add 10/3 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.761
 to both sides 

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.399
 of the equation. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.334
 And what will I get? 

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:54.656
 On the left side 

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:57.117
 I will have minus 1/3 plus 10/3, 

00:00:57.117 --> 00:00:58.835
 which is 

00:00:58.835 --> 00:01:00.518
 9/3. 

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.875
 And then it will be equal to ... 

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:04.442
 On the right side 

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:07.135
 minus 10/3 and plus 10/3 

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:09.062
 are destroyed by getting zero, 

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:10.804
 and I only leave with j / 4. 

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.718
 Equals to j / 4. 

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.295
 Now you may think that it is 9/3 

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:18.059
 the same thing as nine, divided into three. 

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:20.579
 It will be just 3. 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.960
 This simplifies things a little. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.063
 Three, let me just write it again, 

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:24.665
 so you do not go wrong. 

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.856
 Three equals j / 4. 

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.317
 To find j, 

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:33.418
 I can simply multiply both sides by four. 

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:34.834
 Because if I divide something into four 

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.274
 and then multiply by four, will 

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:37.435
 stayed with this thing only. 

00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:40.558
 If you started with j and divided into four, 

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:42.682
 and then multiply 

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:44.798
 four, 

00:01:44.798 --> 00:01:46.087
 I will have 

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.933
 only j on the right side. 

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.769
 But I can not just multiply 

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:50.209
 right side four. 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.194
 I have to do the same 

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:52.704
 and on the left side. 

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:53.528
 So I multiply the left side 

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:54.968
 also four. 

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:56.710
 And what was left to me? 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.332
 Four in three is twelve. 

00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:01.469
 Then j, divided into four, four, 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.710
 will be only j. 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.775
 We have obtained that j equals 12. 

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.667
 The nice thing about the equations 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.014
 is that you can check if it really is 

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:11.291
 you received the correct answer. 

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.715
 You can replace here with 12 for j 

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:17.896
 and check that minus 1/3 

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:23.034
 is equal to 12/4 minus 10/3. 

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:24.339
 Is that so? 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.879
 12/4 is the same as three 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.360
 and if I want to write it as a third, 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.809
 will be the same as 9/3. 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.828
 A 9/3 minus 10/3 is really 

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:36.685
 minus 1/3. 

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:38.926
 Correct answer. 

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.407
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:46.689
 I have n / 5 plus 0.6 equals 2. 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.788
 Let us isolate this article, 

00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:51.147
 which includes "n" on the left side. 

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:53.248
 Let's also get rid of this 0.6. 

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:56.185
 We will take 0.6 on the left side. 

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:57.207
 But I can not do it just to the left. 

00:02:57.207 --> 00:02:58.298
 I have to do it on both sides, 

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.261
 if I want equality to continue to be true. 

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:02.187
 Drop 0.6. 

00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:04.021
 Now on the left side 

00:03:04.021 --> 00:03:07.481
 I will only stay n / 5, 

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.419
 but on the right side 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.993
 2 minus 0.6, which will be 1.4. 

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.967
 And if you do not want to do it 

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:17.209
 in mind, you can calculate it 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.905
 separately. 

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:22.375
 We will have 2.0 minus 0.6. 

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:26.090
 You can say, "Oh, that's 20 tenths minus six tenths," 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.493
 which will be 14 tenths, which is what it is there. 

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:29.607
 Or if you want to do it a little 

00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:32.115
 in a more traditional way, 

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:32.939
 you will say, "Oh, I try to pull out 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.690
 six out of zero, let me regroup. " 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.153
 That will be 10. 

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.803
 I will take the position of the units. 

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.556
 If I take one of the position of the units, 

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.263
 this will be equal to 10 tenths. 

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:46.956
 10 tenth minus 6 tenths is 4 tenths. 

00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:49.552
 And then we carry one from below. 

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:51.315
 One minus zero is just one. 

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.338
 So it's 1.4. 

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:53.592
 Now find "n". 

00:03:53.592 --> 00:03:55.379
 On the left side we have "n", 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.761
 divided by five. 

00:03:56.761 --> 00:03:57.631
 If I want to have only "n" here, 

00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.314
 I can just multiply by five. 

00:03:59.314 --> 00:04:01.937
 If I multiply by five, 

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.073
 five by "n" divided by five 

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:06.512
 will be only "n". 

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.172
 But I can not only multiply the left side 

00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:08.659
 five. 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.612
 I must also multiply the right side 

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:12.120
 five. 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.093
 What will this give us? 

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:18.550
 We will get n = 1.4 by 5. 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.114
 1.4 by 5. 

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:24.007
 Maybe you will decide it in mind, 

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:26.328
 this is one and two-fifths. 

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:28.222
 And all this thing will be equal to seven, 

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:29.824
 but I will do it this way too. 

00:04:29.824 --> 00:04:33.736
 Five in four is 20. 

00:04:33.736 --> 00:04:35.117
 We regroup the couple. 

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.659
 One in five is five, plus two in seven. 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.658
 And then I will look at all the numbers, 

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:40.957
 I multiply, I have one figure 

00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:43.312
 to the right of the decimal point. 

00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:44.614
 So my answer will have one figure 

00:04:44.614 --> 00:04:45.972
 to the right of the decimal point. 

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:48.954
 This is 7.0 or only 7. 

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:52.009
 n equals 7. 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.820
 And you can check it out, 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.600
 because seven, divided by five, 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.076
 will be equal to 1.4 plus 0.6, 

00:04:59.076 --> 00:05:00.635
 equal to two. 

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:01.913
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:02.829
 That's too fun. 

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:03.537
 All right. 

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.811
 0.5 of the total 

00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.668
 (r + 2,75) is equal to 3. 

00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:11.106
 There are many ways 

00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:12.187
 to deal with this task. 

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:13.347
 Many times when you see 

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:14.416
 something like that, maybe 

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:17.249
 you will be tempted to say, "I will uncover the braces". 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.966
 But it makes it a little more complicated, 

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.532
 for 0.5 by 2, 75. 

00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:22.971
 You can calculate it and 

00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:23.935
 you will get a true answer if 

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:24.690
 you do it right. 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.896
 But the simplest way is 

00:05:26.896 --> 00:05:29.833
 to divide both sides to 0.5. 

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:30.727
 So I will include more 

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:32.666
 whole numbers. 

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:33.895
 If I divide ... 

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:34.592
 Do not forget that what I do from 

00:05:34.592 --> 00:05:35.451
 the left side, I have to do 

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:36.995
 and on the right side. 

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:38.806
 I figured that because 

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:40.385
 if it divides to 0.5 left side, 

00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.895
 I will be able to get rid of this. 

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:43.844
 And if it divides to the right-hand side 

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.609
 I will still get an integer. 

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:47.931
 Three divided by 0.5 is six. 

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:49.324
 This is the same thing as three, 

00:05:49.324 --> 00:05:50.253
 divided by one second. 

00:05:50.253 --> 00:05:52.610
 How many times does 1/2 fit in three? 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.386
 Six times. 

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.011
 So there will be six. 

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:56.812
 These are getting shorter. 

00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.342
 And then it will be six. 

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:02.866
 We have now simplified the whole thing 

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:07.576
 to r plus 2.75 will be equal to, 

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:11.007
 is equal to six. 

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:12.527
 To isolate only r from 

00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:14.222
 the left side, I can pull out 

00:06:14.222 --> 00:06:17.066
 2.75 on the left. 

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.970
 But as we have seen many times, 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.521
 I can not do it 

00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:24.692
 only to the left. 

00:06:24.692 --> 00:06:26.628
 I have - my brain is not working properly - 

00:06:26.628 --> 00:06:27.545
 2.75. 

00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:28.741
 I can not just do it on the left. 

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:30.378
 I have to do it also on the right. 

00:06:30.378 --> 00:06:31.841
 2.75. 

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:36.141
 This is simplified 

00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:38.149
 to r equals ... 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.761
 How much is six minus 2.75? 

00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:42.363
 If you want to do it in mind, 

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:44.139
 six minus two will be four, 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.240
 and then if you remove 0.75 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.003
 will remain 3.25. 

00:06:49.003 --> 00:06:49.758
 If you lack confidence 

00:06:49.758 --> 00:06:50.779
 to do it in mind, you can simply 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:51.499
 to write it. 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:56.151
 6.00 minus 2.75, 

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.113
 Be careful by arranging decimal places. 

00:06:58.113 --> 00:07:00.215
 Now I have to make some regrouping. 

00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:02.200
 I have zero hundredths 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.570
 and I'm trying to get five hundredths. 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.812
 This is not the case. 

00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:06.170
 I'll try to get out of here, 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.936
 but I have nothing here either. 

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:08.213
 I'll get out of here. 

00:07:08.213 --> 00:07:09.130
 One unit. 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.454
 I'll take one of these units. 

00:07:10.454 --> 00:07:11.475
 I'll stay with five units. 

00:07:11.475 --> 00:07:12.439
 And this will be equal to ... 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.994
 Here I have five units, 

00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:15.596
 and this unit I took, 

00:07:15.596 --> 00:07:17.268
 will be ten tenths. 

00:07:17.268 --> 00:07:18.928
 Then I can take it 

00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:20.310
 one of these tenths. 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.269
 And I will stay with nine-tenths. 

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.149
 And this will be ten hundredths. 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:25.030
 Now I can get out. 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.679
 Ten hundredth minus five hundredths 

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.594
 is five hundredths. 

00:07:28.594 --> 00:07:31.612
 Nine-tenth is minus seven-tenths 

00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:32.797
 two tenths. 

00:07:32.797 --> 00:07:34.213
 My decimal point will be there. 

00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:36.175
 Five minus two is three. 

00:07:36.175 --> 00:07:38.032
 3.25. 

00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:39.530
 You can check it. 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.115
 3.25 plus 2.75 is six, 0.5 is really 

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:45.926
 equal to three. 

00:07:45.926 --> 00:07:47.215
 Again we received 

00:07:47.215 --> 99:59:59.999
 correct answer.
