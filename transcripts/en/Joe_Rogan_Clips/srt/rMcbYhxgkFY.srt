1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,340
The Joe Rogan experience, speaking of
which I was watching a video today.

2
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,900
You know how Youtube for whatever reason,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:11,640
just starts recommending things and you
click on him watching a video today on,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,990
oh,
this is what it was.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,790
I was looking at bulletproof clothing
for whatever reason, cause I was like,

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
I saw an ad on Instagram where this
guy had a bulletproof hoodie on and it

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,970
looked like a regular
hoodie and he shot himself.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,240
Is there like a John Wick situation
where it's like, yes, it's like,

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,230
it's like sewn in between
the fabric. Yeah. Yeah.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,070
So this guy had a regular hoodie and he
shot himself in the gut with the a nine

11
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,300
millimeter just bang.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,710
While while I was playing this video
with like a regular Hoodie, I was like,

13
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:44,070
this is crazy. And this Hoodie, it
looked like a regular hoodie was,

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,170
but it's some sort of Kevlar or something.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,860
So then it recommends this next thing
and this next video that I watch is on

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,630
whether or not you should carry
with a bullet in the chamber.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,590
So it's this guy who's
just speculating elected.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,990
There's two kinds of people.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,740
There's kind of people that thinks they're
going to have enough time to rack a

20
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:12,540
bullet. And there's a bunch of people
that realize that when something happens,

21
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,990
it's like being in a car accident happens
quickly and you gotta be prepared.

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,610
You're not going to have
enough time to rack a bullet.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,480
And so there was this long discussion
as to whether or not you should have a

24
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,330
bullet in the chamber or
not when you conceal carry.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,030
And he was talking about how
this guy was open carrying,

26
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,840
but he could see that the guys,
the hammer was shut down on the pistol,

27
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,880
which means he was going to have to
cock it cause it was a, a, a row,

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,500
not a revolver, but uh, you know,
whatever. Anonymous Semite what did,

29
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,020
what is it when the church,
what is it, when you call,

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,810
what do you call one of those when
you have to load it like that,

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,780
like a nine millimeter glock. What is
the difference? Well, one's a revolver.

32
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:54,360
A revolver revolves, so it's on a
revolver. It's just a pistol. Anyway,

33
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,620
he was saying because of
the way the hammer was, he
could tell that this guy, uh,

34
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,570
you know, he was going to
have to pull that hammer back.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,560
He was going to use that
gun and I was like, this is,

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,180
this is like next level thinking
like these people, everywhere you go,

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,860
someone's worrying about shooting you.

38
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,780
And then I go on to Twitter
almost like this is synchronicity.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,710
And Eric Weinstein,
who's a friend of mine says,

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,130
is this the the year where the debate
is something that in terms of is it

41
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,190
appropriate to bring a loaded gun into
a place where you worship now to protect

42
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,744
herself?

43
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,710
Because there've been so many attacks on
people and synagogues and churches and

44
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:41,730
mosques and I'm like, fuck man, what?

45
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:46,680
Probably what? What is happening
here? It's, I mean it's bad.

46
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,400
I don't, I'm not, I'm not like
a, there's two guns gun today.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,950
What do you mean there's two more
attacks today at synagogues. It was,

48
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,500
one was in a church. What were
the ones that that happened today?

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,790
There was two smaller ones.
There was no,

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,870
there was the church that was in San
Diego this weekend? No, the, the uh,

51
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,790
the synagogue in San Diego this weekend.

52
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,970
But there was another one like this
morning when I was reading the News Los

53
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,500
Angeles? Yes. What was it for Mary?
26 year old US army soldiers servers.

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,720
Afghanistan has been charged with plotting
terror attacks in Los Angeles area,

55
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,170
a rally in Long Beach.

56
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,570
So I saw it's on the front page of CNN
already got something like it's some

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,110
sounds leaking through the video.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Did he do something or did
he just got caught plot?

59
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,780
It says he was accused of targeting Jews
as they walked to the synagogue police

60
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,230
officers. A military facility in
crowds at the Santa Monica pier.

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,690
I think there was another one too.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,460
There was another one somewhere else
might've been outside the country today.

63
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,810
It's like fuck, like this
shit is ramping up. Yeah,

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,430
just getting worse and worse.
Are you a gun guy? I have guns.

65
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,590
I wouldn't say I'm a gun guy,

66
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,980
but I have them hunting or like I have
hunting guns and I have safety guns.

67
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,450
Like security, guns are private, you
know, personal protection guns. But,

68
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,590
um,
I hunt with a bow and arrow mostly,

69
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,570
but of course I'm not opposed to,
when I say of course being sarcastic,

70
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm not opposed to it. What does this
California synagogue attack latest? Oh,

71
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:24,100
this is the, the, they found
the social media message,

72
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,290
I guess right before it happened.
Of course,

73
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,940
Jesus Christ you're
talking about? No, I dunno.

74
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,160
I think there was another one that I saw.
I believe it was in another country.

75
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,830
That's all right. That's enough.
There's so many. I know. I know.

76
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:44,780
You just numb to it. Well also that their
chart targeting places of worship now,

77
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,250
like what the fuck man?

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,510
Do you have guns? No. Would you ever
want one? They make me uncomfortable.

79
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,230
Like I'm not like against, people want
to have guns. Okay. I'm not done that.

80
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,710
It's not on the hill. I'm gonna die on.
But, uh, I think what's happening with,

81
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:05,210
with the schools and churches is a,
is reprehensible and it's,

82
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,750
we are the only country where this really
happens, you know, as much anymore.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,380
It's happening, you know, uh,
around the world. But it's, it's,

84
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,300
it's much more often here.
Yeah. Yeah. Now there's,

85
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:18,860
there's certainly an argument for that.

86
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,850
The real problem is the guns are
already there. It's like how do you,

87
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:26,840
what do you do when you live in a country
of 300 plus million people with 300

88
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:30,740
plus million guns? Like how do you
ever eradicate that? How do you ever,

89
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,880
how do you shift the path
that we seem to be on?

90
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,150
Like what do you do? I mean
everything is like, you know,

91
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,600
people talk about this and then like, you
know, how do we do what, what's is it,

92
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,560
the culture is,
is this any,

93
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,060
he turned on the TV and it's like a video
game commercial or a commercial for a

94
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:51,260
movie and it's just a supermodel spinning
around in circles shooting everything

95
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,670
she sees you, you're like, you don't
think this has happened in effect, right?

96
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,040
Like they just make it look so cool
that if you want to be the hero,

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,380
you got to have a gun.
Yeah. How about John Wick?

98
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,590
John Wick three coming onto my fucking
favorite thing at her and I'm like,

99
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:08,240
this is the most, the most glorifying
gun shit ever. But I love it. I love it.

100
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,350
It is a problem. I mean, it hasn't
made me turn to guns, you know? I mean,

101
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,200
I wouldn't say that like
video games and you know,

102
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,270
make this video games or making
people more violent. I don't,

103
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,600
I don't believe that. I don't know if
there, there's evidence to back that,

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,310
but I mean, I've always loved, you
know, James Bond movies, you know,

105
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,010
things like where guns are are a,

106
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,440
are a big part of it and it's
never made me want to pick one up.

107
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,971
Well,

108
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:35,971
there's a real argument
that that alleviates some of
the need for violence that

109
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:39,970
people like seeing it and seeing
it and something like John Wick,

110
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:41,410
it actually relaxes people.

111
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,200
There's a real argument
for that and there's a real
argument that you could make

112
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,840
with that, with video games too.
But that is not with everybody.

113
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:50,560
The problem is certain people are
very susceptible to influence.

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,760
They're susceptible,

115
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,440
they're vulnerable to being influenced
or excited in one particular direction,

116
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,790
whether it's,
uh,

117
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,010
excited to become radicalized and become
a white nationalist, want to shoot up,

118
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,990
you know, um, whatever. Figure out that
whatever the group is or whether it's,

119
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,930
you know, there's certain
people that, you know,

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,730
they'll see something in a movie or a
video game and it'll make them want to act

121
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:18,820
that out, but they usually mentally ill.
I mean that's, that's a real problem.

122
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,330
The real problem is mental illness at
the type of person that could go into a

123
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,750
synagogue and just start shooting people.
That's a mentally ill person.

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,100
That's regardless of whether or not they
have a gun or not. That's a sick person.

125
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,370
So we have to figure out like what's
causing this massive amount of mental

126
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,810
illness in this country.
Cause that's a big,

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,040
that's the guy in Aurora is a
perfect example. That guy was,

128
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,980
they knew he was sick then they
knew there was something really,

129
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,530
I mean if you see the photos of that
fucking guy, you look at his eyes,

130
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,810
he was completely bat shit crazy.

131
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,850
Well, I think it's something to,
it's like when they, when they,

132
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,520
now they've started to refuse to show
the guy's face and they won't show it.

133
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,800
Like, this guy's getting glory now,
and the next shooter wants to top that.

134
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,160
But I think they're getting a little
bit smarter about it. But what's the,

135
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:06,350
what's the quote?
No Man chooses evil because it's evil.

136
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,060
They only mistaken for happiness.

137
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,653
Hmm.

138
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,530
Like, I believe that.
Yeah. That's a good quote.

139
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah.
They mistake it for happiness.

140
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,680
Or they want other people
to feel what they feel.

141
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,110
They want other people to suffer
the way they are suffering.

142
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,990
Yeah.
With,

143
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,240
I mean, w when you ever have a
giant country filled with people,

144
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,330
you're going to have a broad
spectrum of people's experiences.

145
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,320
And so you're going to have a certain
number of people that are on the low end

146
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:39,880
of experiences. The worst experiences all
the time, sexual abuse, physical abuse,

147
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:44,530
violence, mental illness,
pills, drugs, this, that,

148
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,843
boom.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,850
[inaudible].
