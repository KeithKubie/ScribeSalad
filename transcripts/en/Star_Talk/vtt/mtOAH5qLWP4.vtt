00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.800
- Hey Einstein fans, you're about to watch

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.330
a special edition of
StarTalk just for you,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.220
all about Einstein.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.053
Now.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.580
This is StarTalk.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm your host, Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.970
your personal astrophysicist.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.050
I got Chuck Nice, cohost.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.663
I got Janna Levin, old time
friend, colleague, physicist,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.960
expert on the universe in
all the ways that matter.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.240
Especially for this conversation,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.560
'cause we're celebrating
the life and times

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.140
of Albert Einstein.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.920
So, Albert Einstein was born in Germany

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.980
on March 14th, 1879.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.830
And Chuck, you know what day that is?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.560
- 1879, March 14th?

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.080
- [Neil] March 14th, any year.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.132
- In any year?

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:48.550
- [Neil] Yeah, what day
of the year is March 14th?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.400
- I believe it's the day that
precedes the Ides of March.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.370
What is March 14th?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.260
I really don't know.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.633
- Before the Ides of
March, there's Pi Day.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.123
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Yes.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.447
- Okay, I didn't know it
was actually March 14th,

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:05.498
but of course, that makes sense, 3.14.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.470
- 3.14, yeah, you get
pi out of March 14th,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.320
when written in the American way,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170
where we put the month
before the day of the month.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.030
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.530
- Exactly.
- So 3.14, that's Pi Day.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.210
Then you get really geeky,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.393
and then add 1:59.

00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:28.430
3.1415, 1:59 and 26 seconds.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.500
Then you get a full on Pi Moment.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.170
- Can I just suggest that that's probably

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.823
the access code to every
physics department in the world?

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:37.554
- That's pretty funny.

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:39.288
That's the one, two, three,
four of physics departments?

00:01:39.288 --> 00:01:44.288
- If you walk up to a sealed
theoretical physics department,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.960
try 3.1415.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.726
- And you'll get it.

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:49.070
Oh, my God, it worked.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.860
- And tomorrow, the missiles got launched,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.053
all because of Janna.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.280
- Yeah, I shouldn't reveal these things.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.303
- So let's talk about this.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.083
Janna, what is the annus mirabilis,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.820
and why do we even say that in Latin?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.540
Why can't we just say it in English?

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.640
His Miracle Year.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.260
- I don't know, why do we say it in Latin?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.170
And that's a different question.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.960
We'll just talk about
the Miracle Year, first.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.010
- It's America, Jack.

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:19.633
- So, 1905?
- Yeah, 1905.

00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:22.570
- 1905.
- How old is he?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.980
- 25.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.980
- So, Einstein was a
clerk in a patent office,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.890
and he couldn't get a job
in a physics department.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.660
His father was desperately writing

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.420
to famous theoretical physicists,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.253
saying, my son's really committed.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.600
- Like any dad.
- And he couldn't get hired.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.660
One of his professors
called him a lazy dog.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.750
And here he is, in this patent
office in Berne, Switzerland,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410
and he has a drawer at
his desk that he calls

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.583
the Physics Department.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.580
And in this drawer he has
these scientific papers

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.530
he's working on in between
finessing other people's patents

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.000
to make them better.
- Wow.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.600
- And in that year, he has
this extraordinary year,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.180
where he publishes a
series of three papers

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.230
that absolutely transform modern physics.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.900
One of them is on the
Special Theory of Relativity,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.500
one of them is on Brownian motion,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.690
which refers to the atomic
aspect of air and molecules.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.990
Like, if you see a little piece of lint,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.950
you notice that it takes
a zig-zaggy pattern,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.770
that's because it's all these
little atoms hanging on to it.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.050
And the photoelectric
effect, which is staggering,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.610
because it probes the
wave-particle duality of light,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.710
that sometimes light acts like a wave,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.921
and sometimes it acts like a particle.

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:41.650
- He, by this time, was 26.
- Yeah.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.240
- Chuck, how old are you?
- And unemployed.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.593
- Verify?
- I'm 22.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.650
- There's still time.
- So, I got time.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.483
- Okay, you got time.

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:49.531
Thank you for verifying that.

00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:52.750
So, you called it an annus mirabilis.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.720
- [Janna] Why do we say it in Latin?

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.540
Because it was all in German.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.790
- Did that get him a job?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.373
- He became, he did become,

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:02.206
to the credit of the scientific community,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.510
even though this outsider
was publishing these papers,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.130
it was very swiftly accepted,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.670
the significance of all these papers.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.503
Very swiftly.

00:04:09.503 --> 00:04:10.670
And that should also be a lesson

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.060
to those many people who
send me their theories,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.600
that when they're transparently correct,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.183
they are grabbed at with glee.

00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:23.300
- All the most amazing, mind-blowing,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.570
earth-shaking scientific research

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.530
was published in legitimate
journals, accepted by peers.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.523
By peer-reviewed.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.760
So as they say, to be a
genius is to be misunderstood.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.593
- Right.

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:39.140
- To be misunderstood
is not to be a genius.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.660
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.350
- So you can't come to me and say,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.200
I have an idea, but the
establishment is not,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.467
they're gonna reject it.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.300
- [Janna] Therefore it's brilliant.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.133
- Therefore, right.

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:49.770
- They don't get this, man.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.610
They just don't understand.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.260
- I'm starting a Facebook
page for everyone to evaluate,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
so you don't have to come to us.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.096
Amongst themselves,
talk amongst yourselves.

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.580
- [Neil] Talk amongst yourselves.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.130
- Now we have Twitter for that.

00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:06.240
- Now, he didn't call it
Special Theory of Relativity.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.530
Who called it Special?

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.620
- That's interesting.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.360
I actually don't know,
specifically, the history.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.893
- Why do we have you on this show?

00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:15.437
- Because I can explain Relativity.

00:05:15.437 --> 00:05:17.610
- Does someone out there know why?

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.610
- I mean, the General
Theory obviously came later,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.500
when he included the
curvature of space-time.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.770
But I don't know who
actually coined it Special.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.430
It was just the Theory of
Relativity at the time.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.650
- Right, because the paper was on

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.000
the electrodynamics of moving bodies.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.890
That's the name of that paper,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.340
of the Special Relativity paper.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.343
- Grabbing title.

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:37.757
But the amazing thing.
- Page-turner.

00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:41.750
So that was, wait, 1905,
then a General Theory

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.583
comes out when?

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:43.416
- 1915.

00:05:43.416 --> 00:05:44.850
- So, that's 10 years,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.380
and he basically pulled
that out of the ether.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.440
- It's probably published in 1916,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.830
but it's 10 or 11 years of
struggling with the mathematics

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.890
to elevate what we now
call the Special Theory

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.860
to the General Theory.
- Working alone.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.930
- Yeah, he was being influenced
by people like Grossmann,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.050
who was a mathematician.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.080
Hilbert was very influential.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.600
So Einstein wrote down several
wrong theories along the way,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.550
and there's actually a
kind of adorable story

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.490
when he was thinking about something

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.480
like gravitational waves,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.510
where he kept changing his mind, in print.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.582
He would write papers, say they're real.

00:06:16.582 --> 00:06:19.560
- You used the word adorable
for a physics story.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.280
- Let the record, adorable
for a physics story.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.900
- Let the record catch that.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.387
Pause for a moment.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:28.465
- And right after this, believe me,

00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:30.883
we're gonna get to some
very darling theories.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.066
- With cheeks you just wanna pinch.

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:38.090
All right, go on.
- He writes a paper saying

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.430
gravitational waves are not real.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.410
Then he writes a paper saying they are.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.980
Then he writes another
paper several years later,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.813
saying that they're not.

00:06:43.813 --> 00:06:46.420
And between acceptance of
his paper and publication,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.320
he sneaks in a draft of a manuscript

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.550
that says that they are.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.810
And one of his colleagues says, Einstein.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.643
You have to be really careful,

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:54.710
your famous name is
gonna be on these papers.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.890
And he just laughs.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.260
He says, my name is on
plenty of wrong papers.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.450
You do not need to worry about that.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.950
So it takes him a long time.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.230
I mean, there's decades of him

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.430
figuring out gravitational waves,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.560
and the General Theory was 11 years,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.970
and he needed help from other people.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.855
He wrote down several wrong theories.

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:11.863
- Ha, no.
- What's hard to hear

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:12.863
is he needed help.

00:07:12.863 --> 00:07:15.613
Deadbeat.
- Einstein, you dumbass.

00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:18.174
- 10 years, damn.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.500
- Is that actually something that is,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.333
did that do anything to?

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:24.780
- In retrospect, that is short order.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.280
Look at String Theory,
where we're decades deep.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.250
- Still in it, for decades
after decades after decades.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.893
- It might be hundreds of years.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.640
- And that's dozens of
leaders in the field.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.810
- [Janna] Really brilliant people.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.250
- And we have one guy, Einstein.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.240
- By himself.
- Basically, yeah.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.590
I didn't mean to take away Janna's point,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.580
that there are others
trying to push things along.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.413
- They're nudging him along.

00:07:45.413 --> 00:07:47.000
- Right, right.
- They're nudging him along

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.590
because he's actually
putting something out there

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.540
to be nudged.
- Good point, good point.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.373
- It was really interesting

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:56.410
that it was really him
on the, I mean, largely,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.243
there were other physicists.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.530
But him largely on the physics side,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.900
and the mathematicians pulling him up.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.100
Because he was not actually

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.460
the most sophisticated
mathematical thinker.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.597
Another one of my
Einstein quotes, it says,

00:08:05.597 --> 00:08:07.717
"You think you have a lot of
difficulty with mathematics?

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:10.930
"You should see my
difficulties with mathematics."

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.100
So, he was a very intuitive thinker,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.000
and he really, originally,
rejected the idea

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.020
that you had to do all of
this differential calculus,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.050
and this really elaborate mathematics.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.710
He thought, that's ridiculous,
it's totally overkill.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.600
- Pure thought should be able to--

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.433
- You could just think it through,

00:08:24.433 --> 00:08:25.780
and it would be like algebra.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.620
And he did that with the Special Theory.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.453
It was stunning,

00:08:28.453 --> 00:08:30.920
but he could not do that
with the General Theory.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.390
He had to step it up to
be differential calculus

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.520
and curved manifolds, no mean feat.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.353
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:08:37.353 --> 00:08:38.186
But it's pretty.

00:08:39.132 --> 00:08:40.700
It's not only adorable, it's pretty.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.936
- What grade did you get
in that class, Chuck?

00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:43.840
- I was gonna say that
what I kinda go with

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.343
is that you don't need that.

00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:47.720
- You say, I will never
need that in my life.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.770
- I will never need that in my life.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.743
Like I actually use that.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.550
- So, he does this, and then in 1921,

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.903
he wins the Nobel Prize.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.270
So, but he did so many things,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.260
what did he win it for?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.390
- Well, he didn't win it for Relativity.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.303
- That ain't right.
- Wow.

00:09:04.303 --> 00:09:05.136
- Which is really interesting.

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:05.969
- That's pretty crazy.

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:07.490
- Yeah, was it the photoelectric effect?

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.120
I think technically, it
was the photoelectric.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.230
Contributions to quantum, I
don't remember the phrasing.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.617
Do you have the phrasing?

00:09:12.617 --> 00:09:13.450
- I might, in my notes here.
- It was something like

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.680
contributions to quantum.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.190
Like, often they're
phrased in a way that...

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.363
- Give you latitude.

00:09:19.363 --> 00:09:20.287
- Moves you from a specific, right.

00:09:20.287 --> 00:09:22.307
But it was not for Relativity,

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:24.610
and that is clearly his
greatest accomplishment.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.410
- Wow, so it's kind of like if,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.550
when an actor never wins an Oscar,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.700
and then they're just like,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.370
all right, we're just gonna
give you a Lifetime Achievement.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.140
- He won it in '21, which
is quite early, in a way.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.613
I mean, it was pretty
soon after he proposed,

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:43.460
it's not staggeringly
late after he proposed

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.480
this revolution of quantum thinking.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.593
And the interesting thing is

00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:49.340
that he never really accepted
quantum mechanics, right?

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.483
So he initiates this revolution.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.586
- What is up with Einstein?

00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:56.305
- I just keep insulting Einstein.

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:57.860
- But wait a minute,
is that his brilliance,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.530
the fact that he was
so self-contradicting?

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.990
He just, no, I can't, it couldn't be,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.940
it just couldn't be that.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.660
- I think there's something to that,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.883
which is his refusal to accept something

00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:10.675
that he didn't actually understand.

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:11.845
- That's a good point.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:15.347
Plus, you gotta remember
the era he came from.

00:10:15.347 --> 00:10:18.200
In the 19th century,
into the 20th century,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.700
this was the towering
achievement of classical physics,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.880
where the world, the
universe, was deterministic.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.450
If you tell me where to stand,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.640
and I measure the
motions and the momentum,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.810
I will predict all
future of this universe.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.560
That was a certain posture the
community of physicists has.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.053
Up comes quantum physics,

00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:40.010
is it a wave, is it a particle,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.263
is that some percent of the time?

00:10:44.073 --> 00:10:44.980
And what was his famous quote,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.300
he was trying to tell God what to do?

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.687
What was it?

00:10:47.687 --> 00:10:50.140
- "God doesn't play
dice", was that the one?

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.296
- [Neil and Chuck] God doesn't play dice.

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:52.980
- Well, telling God not to throw dice.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.290
- Oh, he tells God not to throw dice?

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.123
- I think so.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.527
I think as quoted by
Niels Bohr, or somebody,

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.080
"God doesn't play dice with the universe."

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.610
- No, He plays roulette, instead.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.570
- Roulette.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.490
He plays craps table.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.430
- He plays craps, you know?

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.377
- Then what does Stephen
Hawking say later?

00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:10.267
"God not only plays dice,

00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:12.980
"but He sometimes throws the
die where you can't see them."

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.707
- Yeah, there ya go.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.653
- Sounds to me like God's a grifter.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.340
- And then, Einstein said something else,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.879
at another point about God, and then,

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.557
I think it was Niels Bohr, said,

00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:29.567
"Einstein, stop telling God what to do."

00:11:30.461 --> 00:11:32.260
Just got pissed off.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.483
So, tell me if you agree with this, Janna.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.060
So, this is my measure of why
I think General Relativity

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.010
is a crowning achievement
of the human mind,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.690
greater than almost anything else.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.440
Special Relativity, from 1905,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.940
I think there were enough
people on the tail of that,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.940
on the trail of that, that
if Einstein were not around,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.480
Special Relativity would
have been figured out

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.750
within a few years of that date.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.990
Maybe by 1910.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.830
Whereas General Relativity is so different

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.750
from how anybody was thinking,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.820
it might have gone another 50 years.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.520
And so this, for me,
makes General Relativity

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.410
a greater singular
achievement than Special.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.243
- Wow.

00:12:18.243 --> 00:12:19.100
- I do think that you're right,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.700
it would have been many decades
before it was discovered,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.850
if it had not been discovered by Einstein,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.950
General Relativity,
and that is intriguing.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.620
- That's how I know you
badass among your colleagues.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.430
- I also think it would have
looked totally different.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.120
So Einstein gave us all of this,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.660
the General Theory of
Relativity is a theory

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.240
of curved space-time,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.640
and we follow the natural curves in space.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.530
And all of this elegance of geometry.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.260
But none of it is necessary.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.660
There's a whole bunch of
extra degrees of freedom,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.810
in thinking about geometry,
that are not at all required.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.740
And I think what would have happened,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.930
is that somebody like Richard Feynman,

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.550
who was a particle physicist,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.950
who was thinking about
interactions of particles,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.610
would have discovered General Relativity,

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.220
but would never have hung

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.040
all of this space-time language on it.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.231
It would have just been masses

00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:06.169
exchanging gravitons.
- Would have had

00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:07.752
a different facade.

00:13:08.685 --> 00:13:10.410
- Yeah, it would've
looked totally different.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:11.803
- And a completely different frame

00:13:11.803 --> 00:13:12.636
of reference.
- And completely

00:13:12.636 --> 00:13:13.469
different machinery, yeah.

00:13:13.469 --> 00:13:14.410
- Everything would have been,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.320
wow, that's incredible.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.570
- Yeah, I really think
it would've been like,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.050
oh, particles exchange light,

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.350
and that's electromagnetism.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.973
This would've been,
particles exchange gravitons,

00:13:21.973 --> 00:13:24.050
and that's the Theory of Gravity.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.420
- Gotcha, yeah.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.790
So, was Einstein more of a poetic thinker

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.070
when it came to these things?

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.660
I mean, where do you get
this kind of expanse,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.570
and elegance, that you can attach

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.923
to what you're talking about?

00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:40.510
- I mean, I don't want to presume to know,

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.630
but you do have a sense that
here is a very visual thinker,

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.670
and very intuitive.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.090
And so all the space-time machinery,

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.700
there might be excesses to it

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.970
that are not formally required,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.970
but create such powerful
imagery and tools,

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.190
that in that particular
example, which is often rare,

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.750
it's kind of the contrary
of Occam's razor,

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.380
where the extra machinery actually leads

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.810
to better, clearer intuition,

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.040
than the total, leanest abstraction

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.480
of just particles exchanging gravitons.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.660
- That's beautiful, right there.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.910
- Yeah, you should write
a book or something.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.817
- Yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.817 --> 00:14:18.018
Book in there somewhere, isn't there?

00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:18.851
- Somewhere, man.

00:14:18.851 --> 00:14:21.273
- So Janna, your book
The Black Hole Blues,

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.583
it explored LIGO.

00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:30.580
Not so much LIGO, but the
quest to measure gravity wave.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.413
- Yeah.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.503
- And what effort that would take.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.570
Could you describe to me what's going on

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.080
when two black holes collide?

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.798
And how they're gonna
give us a gravity wave?

00:14:39.798 --> 00:14:41.090
What I think of as gravity
waves all the time.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:45.187
- Yeah, so in principle, they
do give us gravity waves.

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:46.020
- Are we giving off

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.853
gravity waves now?

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:47.930
- Yeah, right now, Chuck and I.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.140
- Okay, right.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.309
- It's just pretty modest.
- Right.

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:53.590
- If you think about how weak gravity is,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.480
the entire Earth is pulling on me,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.786
and with my little arms, I can resist.

00:14:58.786 --> 00:14:59.713
- [Neil] You can lift
stuff away from the Earth.

00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:01.230
- Yeah, whereas if it was charged,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.070
if it was that much charge
pulling on me, I'd be liquified.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.540
So, gravity is incredibly weak.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.006
It takes an entire planet,
- I'm gonna say thank God.

00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:12.340
- To even make it hard for me to walk.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.912
- That's a good thing, then.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:15.650
- You know the quick
calculation you can do?

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.210
Back when we had a Space Shuttle

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.300
that would launch people into space.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.820
If you took all the electrons

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.143
out of one cubic centimeter
of the nose cone,

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.963
just remove the electrons,

00:15:26.963 --> 00:15:28.900
and put them at the
base of the launch pad,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.613
the shuttle wouldn't be able to launch.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.610
- Wait a minute.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.672
- Because the electrons would be--

00:15:34.672 --> 00:15:35.690
- Just the electrons.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.390
- In one cubic centimeter.
- One cubic centimeter.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.830
- At the base of the launch pad.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.610
They would be pulling on
the leftover extra protons

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.510
that are at the top,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.976
they would be attracting one another.

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.049
- Right.
- You would not be able

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:45.930
to launch the, right.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.410
- Oh, wow.
- One cubic centimeter.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:48.450
- One cubic centimeter.
- Right.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.770
- So the difference between
the gravitational attraction

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.420
between an electron and a positron,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.870
and their electromagnetic attraction,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.900
is something like a
trillion trillion trillions.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.455
So, it's that much stronger,
the electrical attraction,

00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:01.982
than the gravitational attraction.

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:03.130
- The gravitational pull.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.750
- It's weak.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.560
So, gravitational waves
are incredibly weak,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.530
so what you need in order
to have any aspiration,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.380
even Einstein didn't think
this would be possible,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.240
because he didn't think
anything in the universe

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.370
could possibly bring space-time

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.669
out enough.
- It's pre-black hole.

00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:17.740
- Pre-black hole.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.350
So, you need something like

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.630
the tremendous radical
concentration of mass and energy

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.670
in a black hole.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.560
Not only that, but you need them to be

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.190
in the final throes of
their orbits together.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.200
So, it's like mallets on a drum,

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.570
when they get closer and closer,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.490
they're getting louder and louder.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.830
And it's like this crescendo.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.770
So when LIGO made its first detection,

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.660
it was the last one fifth of a second

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.950
of the orbits of two black holes,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.670
each one about 30 times
the mass of the Sun,

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.050
a couple hundred kilometers across.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.620
They're going very nearly
the speed of light,

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.380
and they're executing a few orbits

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.350
in the final one fifth
of a second, and boom.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.520
It's finally loud enough,

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.670
that even though it's traveling

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.940
for 1.3 billion years across the cosmos,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.350
by the time it hits the Earth,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.490
if you think about the time it left,

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.750
that just multi-celled organisms

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.035
were differentiating on the Earth.

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:04.967
- Yes, they were.
- You know,

00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:05.800
and then there's this race.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.230
They're building LIGO, you know,
in the final hundred years.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.988
And then boom, when it hits,
it's just barely loud enough.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.217
- And all the while, that
wave is heading towards Earth.

00:17:13.217 --> 00:17:14.050
- That's right.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.640
But it could have been the
previous several billion years,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.770
it's been ringing the Earth,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.890
but there was nothing there
capable of detecting it.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.860
- Now, is there any way that
we could have missed it?

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.210
- Yeah, many ways.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.690
So that actual night that
the first detection was made,

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.290
was supposed to be the first science run

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.480
of the advanced instruments.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.440
It was in September 2015.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.420
And they decided they weren't ready, yet.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.420
So they canceled the science run.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.700
And instead they were
there, it's Sunday night,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.280
Monday morning, in the
middle of the night,

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.370
hammering on the instrument,
trying to mess with it,

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.600
just as tests.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.350
They're literally driving
trucks along the access roads,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.270
slamming on the brakes to see if it screws

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.380
with the instrument.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.060
And then in the middle of the
night, they get exhausted,

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.090
they put their tools down, they go home.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.530
The same thing happens
in Washington State,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.720
this was in Louisiana.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.260
And within the span of an hour,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.880
this thing that's been
traveling 1.3 billion years

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.430
smacks the instrument.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.800
- Doesn't that tell you
that this is happening

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.080
more frequently than we think?

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.100
- Way more frequently,
because everyone told me,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.540
with the exception of Kip Thorne,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.150
that black holes would be years on.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.260
That we would detect all
kinds of things first

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.240
that we predict existed,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.770
but black holes were
far off in our future.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.870
And they were not only the

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.650
first thing detected--
- The first thing.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.770
- It was beautiful black hole signature,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.060
but it was the first
four things we detected,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.717
were all black hole collisions.

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:33.550
- Wow, look at that.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.880
- Black holes all the time.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.260
- All black holes, all the time.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.153
- Exactly.

00:18:38.436 --> 00:18:40.260
- So, what's the future of this?

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.370
- Well, a wonderful thing
happened not too long ago,

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.830
they made an announcement
that they detected

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.550
the first neutron stars colliding.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.580
So neutron stars are dead stars

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.220
that aren't quite big enough
to become black holes.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.130
They're under two times
the mass of the Sun,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.880
and they're dense dead stars.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.430
They're often highly magnetized.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.060
But the interesting thing,
see, black holes are empty.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.820
They're just darkness, empty space.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.960
There's nothing there.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.160
So when they collide, it's in darkness.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.720
The black hole collision--
- Just to be clear,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.550
when we say that a black
hole has a certain size,

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.980
that's not a physically occupied volume.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.357
Describe the size of a black hole.

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:14.870
- The size of a black hole is really just

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.500
the extent of the shadow
it casts on the sky.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.403
- By convention, that's what we use.

00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:20.660
- Yes, by convention, it's
the region beyond which

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.630
light cannot escape.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.300
And so it is literally just
the shadow cast on the sky,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.822
if you were to--
- Three-dimensional shadow.

00:19:27.822 --> 00:19:28.655
That cool?

00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:29.988
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:31.662
- Did you know you can have
a three-dimensional shadow?

00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:34.637
- Yeah, you should call it
black ball, not black hole.

00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:35.470
- Yeah.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.460
- What could go wrong?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.567
The French already objected to black hole.

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:42.370
- Did they?
- Yeah.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:46.350
Trou noir, it's offensive
in French, apparently.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.390
- What do they call it?

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.940
- A black hole.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.203
They gave in, you know?

00:19:50.203 --> 00:19:51.036
- They gave in.

00:19:51.036 --> 00:19:52.580
- Couldn't resist forever.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.850
So, that's the fascinating
thing about a hole.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.160
When we think of a hole,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.540
we think of a circle
in a horizontal surface

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.710
that you go through in a plane.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.550
Whereas this is a hole in
three-dimensional space

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.723
you can fall into from any direction.

00:20:08.723 --> 00:20:09.556
- Whoo!

00:20:09.556 --> 00:20:11.580
- And walking into the
shadow should be as harmless

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.040
as walking into the shadow of a tree.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.730
Nothing's there, you
wouldn't notice anything.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.660
You'd cross right over.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.130
There's no dense material there,

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:19.380
there's just nothing there.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.010
So when black holes collide,
it's truly a dark event.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.090
Which, even though this,
the first collision

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.340
was the most powerful event ever detected

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.160
since the Big Bang,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.940
none of it came out as light.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.780
None of it.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.390
- So can I ask you this?

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.490
- If it did, it would
be the brightest thing

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.656
in the night- and day-time sky.

00:20:35.656 --> 00:20:38.350
- It would have outshone all the stars

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.170
in the observable universe, combined.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.380
- So, okay.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.723
If we don't see what's colliding,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.560
what is colliding?

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.180
- Space-time itself.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.011
So the black holes blob together.

00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:53.490
- Damn.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.411
- And the shadow distorts.
- Hold on for a second.

00:20:55.411 --> 00:20:56.806
Wait, just hold on.

00:20:56.806 --> 00:20:58.300
Ah, my head!

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.400
- A bout of existential angst.
- Oh, God!

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.387
Ah, space-time itself!

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.800
- Space-time colliding, yes.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.330
- Then, this blobby thing,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.300
it sheds off all its imperfections,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.310
and it settles down to
be one bigger black hole.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.400
So there's a black hole out
there, as far as we know,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.040
a little bigger than 60
times the mass of the Sun,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.710
that's just wandering
the cosmos aimlessly,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.807
completely dark and completely quiet.

00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:23.390
- I'm just a hole.
- But the fantastic thing

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.297
is they settle down.
- Yes, I'm only a hole.

00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:29.610
- Don't get in my way.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.033
- That's amazing!

00:21:31.033 --> 00:21:33.080
- Yeah, you see it, I mean you hear it,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.740
in the recording that LIGO makes.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.480
You hear it ring down.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.420
You hear it settle down
to a final black hole.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.420
- So, tell me how 1.3
billion light years away,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.880
we can know it's two black holes,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.900
one 28 times the mass of the Sun, one 36,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.420
what is getting modeled there,
to give us that confidence?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.590
- There's an old-fashioned
mathematical problem,

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.430
can you hear the shape of a drum?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.000
And it's very similar.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.660
If I bang a drum--
- That's beautiful.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.400
- Yeah.
- That's beautiful.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.660
- I think that'll be
the title of my memoirs.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.527
- Can you hear the shape of a drum?

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:10.220
- Can you hear the shape of the drum?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.500
- We all recognize sounds.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.900
Our phones go off, and we're
like, that's my ringtone.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.850
So, it's kind of similar.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.150
We have a prediction for how
the mallets, the black holes,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.220
bang on the drum of space
time, creating a sound.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.450
And it's a very specific prediction,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.890
it's not a whole range of possibilities.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.120
We can literally hear, if I
played for you our predictions,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.503
the difference between black holes

00:22:33.503 --> 00:22:35.640
that were extremely disparate in size.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.070
It sounds different.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.450
If the black holes were on
wildly eccentric orbits,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.110
it sounds different.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.110
So, you can reconstruct the
motion, size, behavior, spins,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.240
of the mallets.
- With high confidence.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.710
- With some things, less
confidence than others.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.620
So, like, the spin of the black
holes is hard to determine.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.400
They're both probably spinning.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.070
Some things with less confidence.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.680
But that they were two black holes,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.820
with a pretty good degree of confidence.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.830
- And with the masses
that they were ascribed.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.110
- Right, with the masses
they were ascribed.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.330
So you can tell how big they are, too,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.730
because you can hear the orbits, again,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.690
just like how you can
hear mallets on a drum.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.910
And even knowing--
- But that's a weaker signal,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.743
though.

00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:18.780
- Well, it is, but it's .7
times the speed of light,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.470
and you can tell when
it's done one full orbit,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.727
and that tells you how big the system is.

00:23:22.727 --> 00:23:26.650
And that means you've
got these two black holes

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.610
summing to a little more than
60 times the mass of the Sun,

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.410
in a region only of a couple
hundred kilometers across.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.760
And so how are you gonna do that?

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.090
- Yeah, there's only one way.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.040
- So, are there any
black holes tiny enough

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.460
that they spin and collide,

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.623
and create the sound of a triangle?

00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:42.458
Ding.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.820
- Well, it is fantastic that black holes

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.240
that are just a few times to
10 times the mass of the Sun,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.710
something in that range,

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.610
actually ring space-time in
the human auditory range.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.306
- What?
- Yeah.

00:23:56.306 --> 00:23:57.306
LIGO is an instrument--

00:23:57.306 --> 00:23:58.370
- You told me that once, and I said,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.993
what are you talking about?

00:23:59.993 --> 00:24:02.220
There's no sound in space.
- LIGO is an instrument

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.260
sensitive to the range of the piano.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.920
So, it's true, there's no sound in space,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.320
because there's no air.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.720
And anyone who sees somebody
screaming outside a space ship

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.400
is gonna write complaints on Twitter

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.970
that they don't know what
they're talking about.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.160
But if you were near enough
those two black holes,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.850
really near enough, your
ear could technically ring

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.645
in response to the gravitational waves.

00:24:21.645 --> 00:24:22.478
- What you're saying is,

00:24:22.478 --> 00:24:24.390
your eardrum that is
normally set into vibration

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.000
by vibrating air molecules,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.830
in this case would be set to vibrate

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.530
by vibrating fabric of space-time.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.660
- Yeah, it would pluck it like a string.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.280
- Yeah, like a harp string.
- Yeah.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.170
- Ooh.
- Wow.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.452
- That's weird.
- That is weird.

00:24:37.452 --> 00:24:38.438
- I don't even wanna...

00:24:38.438 --> 00:24:39.271
- That's really wild, I like it.

00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:41.533
- If you heard that, like, get out.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.433
Move away.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.720
Like imagine, you would see nothing.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.190
- Oh no, if you heard that,

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.325
it's too late.
- You would see nothing,

00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:50.476
but you would hear.

00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:51.425
- Right.

00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:53.093
Too bad it doesn't, actually,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.840
maybe that's what it
says when you hear it.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.970
- It's a warning sign.
- Instead of a boom,

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.420
it's just like a ha, ha, ha,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.253
you're cooked.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.450
- So what would, hold my eardrums aside,

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.810
what would my body feel if
a wave went across my body?

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.970
- So, presumably, right now,

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.210
there are black holes colliding
all over the universe.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.560
We're being squeezed and stretched,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.740
but again, it's so weak,
that we don't even notice.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.340
- If it's strong, will I
say, "Ooh, I felt that"?

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.370
Or, if it's reshaping the
fabric of space and time,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.390
and I occupy that coordinate,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.900
wouldn't I just shake with
it, and I wouldn't even know?

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.960
- Yeah, probably most of these--

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.763
- Get that, Chuck, what I was just saying?

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.690
If I draw a stick man on a rubber sheet,

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.650
and I bend the rubber sheet,
the stick man goes with it.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.350
- Without even knowing
that he's being bent.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.350
- This is just how I'm doing it.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.750
- The difference with the stick man,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.640
is that we're bound together.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.090
So, for instance, your head is
harder to squeeze and stretch

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.080
than your eardrums.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.450
- Speak for yourself.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.390
- If you were there, your
ear would start resonating

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.400
more willingly than your head would.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.690
So, the fact that we're
bound means we're resisting

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.523
to some extent.

00:26:03.523 --> 00:26:05.560
So the whole Earth, when the wave passes,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.680
doesn't really notice it.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.280
It's just so atomically bound to itself.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.230
- It would just be so
funner if, in fact, we did.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.930
- Yeah, I think it's gonna be more like,

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.440
for these long waves,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.040
it's gonna be more like
bobbing on an ocean.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.480
You know, just kind of what the mirrors

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.950
in the LIGO instrument do.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.420
When the wave passes,
they bob on the wave.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.450
It's not that the mirror itself

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.910
is being squeezed and stretched,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.610
it's that it's starting to swing.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.443
- Okay.

00:26:28.443 --> 00:26:29.700
- And that's what you're looking for.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.693
You're looking for the
motion of the mirror.

00:26:31.693 --> 00:26:35.270
- This opened a whole new way
of observing the universe.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.680
Any way to bring LIGO to
bear on the Big Bang itself?

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.670
- Definitely gravitational
wave experiments,

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.770
but probably not LIGO.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.620
LIGO can put limits on the Big Bang.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.160
So the Big Bang might've
actually made a bang.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.430
When the universe was created,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.750
gravitational waves
probably really cacophonous.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.320
It probably sounded like noise.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.720
But, it's outside of really the range

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.360
LIGO's optimally designed to detect.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.910
It's much more likely that
a space-based instrument

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.260
like LISA, the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.100
if it ever launches, that
LISA would be able to detect

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.280
the sound of the bang.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.270
- It would be a cacophony.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.260
- Yeah, noise.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.297
Just like (whooshing).

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.600
So you asked me, how do
you know it's black holes?

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.060
Those two things sound really different.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.750
- Different, yeah.
- Wow.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.698
- Black holes sound
like (ascending trill).

00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:25.431
- That was good.

00:27:25.431 --> 00:27:26.917
Let me hear that again?

00:27:26.917 --> 00:27:28.242
- I don't know if I can do it again.

00:27:28.242 --> 00:27:29.307
(ascending trill)

00:27:29.307 --> 00:27:30.620
- It's a black hole.
- It's called a chirp.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.260
- Black hole colliding.
- Black hole colliding.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.300
- Those are two black holes colliding.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.100
Much less, I don't know,
macho, than most people expect.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.210
It has this sort of sweet little chirp.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.313
- Has anyone thought about how you get

00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:42.360
a 30 solar mass black hole?

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.020
- That's a really excellent question.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.620
So not only was the first--

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.530
- I don't know how you make one of those.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.500
- Right, and not only did they detect

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.570
the first gravitational waves,

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.810
but they actually started
probing new astronomy.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.470
We had no idea there were
black holes that big.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.170
The projections were
for much smaller ones.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.120
And now we know there's
one 60 solar masses,

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.240
so maybe there are hundred,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.073
or hundred and fifty.
- Maybe there's some

00:28:00.073 --> 00:28:01.093
that are bigger than that.

00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:03.650
- Right, so did those already
collide with other black holes

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.483
to get that big?

00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:06.990
Or were they formed by direct collapse?

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:10.060
Did they skip the death star state?

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.893
We don't really know.

00:28:10.893 --> 00:28:13.270
So that's, already people are working on--

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.103
- Yeah, because normally,

00:28:14.103 --> 00:28:14.936
if you wanna learn about black holes

00:28:14.936 --> 00:28:16.710
in your astrophysics class,

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.510
what did you get in your astrophysics?

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.323
- My astrophysics...

00:28:20.323 --> 00:28:21.259
- He's taking it with me next semester.

00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:22.759
- Okay, excellent.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.120
- No, I got an incomplete.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.560
I got an I, I got an I in astrophysics.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.970
- So, you learn that one
way to get a black hole

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.690
is the end point of a high-mass star.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.540
But, high-mass stars are
20, 30, 40, 50 solar mass,

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.990
but they lose a lot of mass en route.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.240
So by the time it's done,

00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:45.190
you don't really have 30, 40, 50, 60--

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.490
- Solar mass.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.520
And so, but now we know for
a fact that we do have one,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.660
because we've watched them collide.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:50.493
- LIGO picked them up.

00:28:50.493 --> 00:28:52.480
- There are some people that
think they're pure dark matter.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.138
That they don't form
from stellar collapse,

00:28:54.138 --> 00:28:55.712
that they're not the
death state of a star.

00:28:55.712 --> 00:28:57.280
That they're an example of dark matter.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.423
- I'll tell you this,

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.300
just as a vote for science here,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.760
any time we have a new instrument

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.550
that takes us into a parameter space

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.790
where we have not previously looked,

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.750
you discover stuff that nobody ordered.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.583
- [Chuck] Right.

00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:17.306
- Now, a well-designed experiment

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:21.759
is thought up to test for something

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:24.380
that you have an idea about, right?

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.870
So, we think we will detect
colliding black holes.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.920
You do it, and oh my gosh,
it's a kind of black hole

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.873
we never even thought was there.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.360
Good science is that
which shows that maybe

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.457
you were on the right track to begin with,

00:29:38.457 --> 00:29:40.780
but then opens up whole new places

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.613
that you never even knew.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.900
So now the next generation LIGO,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.170
you're gonna know how to...

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.690
how to be better at what
it is for the new stuff.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.540
- And they'll discover
60 solar mass black holes

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.863
that will collide, and
say, damn, look out.

00:29:57.219 --> 00:29:58.320
Watch where you going.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.520
- It wouldn't be the 60s,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.580
because the 60s would be
more powerful than the 30s.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.413
- Oh, right.

00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:05.450
- It would detect lower mass black holes,

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:06.807
or the 30 mass black holes farther away.

00:30:06.807 --> 00:30:08.120
- Father away.
- Right?

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.720
- Also, what about something

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.420
we've never even thought of before?

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:12.300
And when you think of the time

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.070
Galileo first pointed
the telescope at the sky,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.780
he's looking at Saturn, and
he's looking at the Sun.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.530
He's not thinking quasars and black holes,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.280
those things aren't
even conceivable to him.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.120
And what we all really hope, secretly,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.130
is that we're gonna discover
stuff in gravitational waves

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.060
that we couldn't possibly see in light.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.838
After all, 95% of the
universe is completely dark.

00:30:31.838 --> 00:30:32.880
- Right.
- Right, exactly.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.230
So, maybe there's something out there

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.020
that we have not even thought of,

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.173
and that is what everyone
hopes for, to be honest.

00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:40.999
- Have to think about that.

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:41.832
- [Chuck] It's very cool, man.

00:30:41.832 --> 00:30:43.110
- [Janna] Some crazy noise.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.370
- Yeah, 'cause the stuff we
had no idea even existed,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.170
so we opened up new windows of observation

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.560
onto the universe.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.460
Stuff that only talks
to us in ultraviolet,

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.290
or in infrared.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.760
Until we had ultraviolet
or infrared telescope,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.610
it was not there.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.448
The birth call of the universe itself.

00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:07.281
- Hacaw!

00:31:08.358 --> 00:31:09.809
Hacaw!

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:11.020
- The cosmic microwave
background, is microwaves.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.310
- Right.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:15.304
- That was a non-thing--
- You gotta see them, now.

00:31:15.304 --> 00:31:16.800
- Until we had microwave detectors.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.857
Nobody even talking
about the early universe,

00:31:18.857 --> 00:31:20.260
until you could do that.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.233
- Now, thanks to them,
we have Hot Pockets.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.540
- So, can you give us just
some final reflections

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.360
on Einstein's life, so
that if we wanna think,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.690
if we wanna live,

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.014
you know how a religious person would say,

00:31:32.014 --> 00:31:33.536
I wanna live the way Jesus lived?

00:31:33.536 --> 00:31:34.880
And so, in the geek world, you say,

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.770
I wanna live the way Einstein lived.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.210
Is there anything that you can tell us?

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:42.860
- I really admired, above all else,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.160
Einstein's independence
of mind and spirit.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.870
So, when everyone else was saying,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.620
oh, there's something
wrong with this supposition

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.930
that speed of light is a constant.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.023
That just makes no sense whatsoever.

00:31:57.086 --> 00:31:57.919
- Still doesn't really make sense.

00:31:57.919 --> 00:31:59.570
- It's really challenging.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.210
But Einstein accepts,

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.620
and this is something
that's often misunderstood

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.570
in the idea of relativity.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.250
He accepts the rigidity of the constraint.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.740
That's what he does.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.680
And then around that constraint,

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.690
he sees where he's free to
move, and it's very limited.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.280
But from this tight
constraint, he makes this,

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.900
it's like squeezing a
balloon in one direction,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.660
and it blows out in the other direction.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.140
It leads to things that were
so much more magnificent

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.010
than just allowing the speed
of light to not be a constant.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.753
- You know, it's interesting
that you say that.

00:32:26.753 --> 00:32:28.893
I just thought of this now.

00:32:28.893 --> 00:32:32.010
The worst thing you can
tell an engineer is,

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.920
build this, and there are no constraints,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.169
and spend as much as you want.

00:32:35.169 --> 00:32:36.002
- Right.

00:32:36.002 --> 00:32:37.750
- It's like, oh, my gosh,
I don't know what to do.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:42.670
But if you say, it's
gotta be 30 kilos in mass,

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.750
and it's gotta use this much power,

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.100
and it's gotta fly in this way,

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.910
and it's gotta be made
of theses materials, go.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.590
Then, that's where the creativity--

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.020
- Absolutely.
- And so, for example,

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.780
how do you get a telescope

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.256
bigger than the width of
your rocket into orbit?

00:33:00.256 --> 00:33:01.206
How do you do that?

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.000
And people say, oh, okay,
you just tell the engineers.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.300
They invent a telescope that--
- Unfurls.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.652
- [Neil and Janna] Unfurls.

00:33:08.652 --> 00:33:10.657
- Who would've ordered that?
- I didn't think of that.

00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:11.863
- Who would've thought of that?

00:33:11.863 --> 00:33:13.421
- Necessity is the mother of invention.

00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:14.750
- You think of it because I didn't let you

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.630
do something else.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.210
I loved your reference to
Einstein in that context.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.496
It didn't constrain him, it liberated him.

00:33:21.496 --> 00:33:22.360
- That's right, exactly.
- So, I wanna ask you

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.200
something, 'cause you
just sparked a question--

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.369
- Make it quick, 'cause
we're running out of time.

00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:26.202
- Out of time.

00:33:26.202 --> 00:33:28.320
Okay, so you said about Einstein,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.120
and light being a constant.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.833
So, when LIGO detected the pulsar,

00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:35.523
the neutron star--
- Oh, the neutron stars.

00:33:35.523 --> 00:33:37.000
- The neutron star.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.470
When they detected that,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.150
did they make the
detection and see the light

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.320
at the same time, since
light is a constant?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.270
- This is why everyone
was incredibly excited.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.370
It might be, at the end of the day,

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.090
the most highly studied
astronomical event in history.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.260
Basically, some huge fraction

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.560
of the entire international
astronomical community

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.890
turned telescopes, satellites,
all kinds of instruments,

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.653
in the direction of the collision.

00:34:01.653 --> 00:34:02.960
- We do that.
- Yeah.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.170
It was a network.
- We good about that.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.220
- Astrophysicists.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.534
- We good that way.
- Just imagine.

00:34:06.534 --> 00:34:08.560
- Yo, I got your back.
- We got your back.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.727
It's a very important thing.

00:34:09.727 --> 00:34:11.650
I'm in the middle of my
own research program,

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.890
then, in the old days, it
would've been a telegram,

00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:18.220
now it's that, oh, my gosh,
there's an event over here,

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.610
and I have my detector,

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.390
which is different from your detector.

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:26.040
Now we have 9,200 different
kinds of detectors

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.126
getting different aspects--

00:34:27.126 --> 00:34:28.197
- Of that one event.
- One event.

00:34:28.197 --> 00:34:29.890
- Yeah.
- And you look at this part,

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:31.020
and I look at that part,

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.190
and I look at this wavelength,

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.023
and you look at that wavelength.

00:34:33.023 --> 00:34:37.910
And you put that all together,
all eyes, all hands on deck.

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.500
All telescopes, check it out.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.520
- It was really remarkable.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.640
So LIGO caught about a
minute in the recording,

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.526
but all of these telescopes
combined caught a month.

00:34:47.526 --> 00:34:49.190
- Wow.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.720
- And it kept spiking in
different wavelengths.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.130
It would go in the
infrared, in the gamma ray,

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:54.963
in the x ray.

00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:58.030
And so all these different
instruments had their time.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.920
- Wow.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.943
- Yeah, so that's how we roll.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.253
- Collaboration.

00:35:04.253 --> 00:35:06.997
International collaboration.
- Got each other's back.

00:35:06.997 --> 00:35:08.930
All right, guys, we
gotta shut it down, here.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.460
But, Chuck, always nice to have ya.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.293
- Always a pleasure.

00:35:11.293 --> 00:35:12.760
- Janna, even more nice to have you.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.297
We'll find some excuses
to talk about Einstein

00:35:16.297 --> 00:35:18.120
and the universe just to get you back.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.630
- Love it.
- All right.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.270
You've been watching, and
possibly only listening,

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.270
to StarTalk.

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.630
I'm your host, Neil deGrasse Tyson,

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.600
your personal astrophysicist.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.363
And as always, I bid
you to keep looking up.
