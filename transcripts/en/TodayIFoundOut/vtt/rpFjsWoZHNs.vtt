00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:09.071
Why Sideburns are Called That

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:18.390
Have you ever wondered why sideburns are called
that?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.789
Well, wonder no more:
It turns out, despite this particular brand

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.500
of facial hair style being around as far back
as at least 100 BC (with one of the earliest

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.489
known instances being in a mosaic of Alexander
the Great), sideburns were named after a specific

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.410
man in the late 19th century.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.110
The man was politician, businessman, and Union
Army General, Ambrose Burnside.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.270
Burnside sported a slightly unusual facial
hair style with particularly prominent “mutton

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.460
chop” sideburns connected to a moustache,
while keeping his chin shaved perfectly clean.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.880
Burnside was an extremely poor General, something
he himself was well aware of.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.680
For instance, because of his own ineptitude
as a military commander, he twice refused

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.240
to take command of the Army of the Potomac
before ultimately giving in and accepting.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.630
Nevertheless, Burnside’s popularity as a
General and later politician, in combination

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
with the fairly unique formation of his whiskers,
helped start something of a new facial hair

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.060
trend.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.270
Around the 1870s-1880s, this gave rise to
this facial hair style being named “burnsides”.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.090
Within a few years of this, the facial hair
down the side of one’s cheeks, rather than

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.509
being called “mutton chops” as it was
at the time in some regions, began being called

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.420
a modification of “burnsides”- “sideburns”,
with the first documented instance of this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.640
being in 1887.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.700
Presumably the shift was from the fact that
this part of the “burnsides” facial hair

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.170
style was on the sides of the face- and of
course, leaving the “burns” part in in

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.640
homage to the aforementioned style.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.020
Shortly after “sideburns” popped up, an
alternate “sideboards” also made its debut,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.119
with “boards” thought to have been shortened
from “border”, so essentially “side-boarder”,

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.049
which is a fitting description of the style.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.529
Bonus Facts:
• An old 19th century slang term for a man

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:04.389
who liked to frequent brothels was “beard-splitter”,
presumably coming from the fact that people

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:09.070
used to commonly refer to not just a certain
style of facial hair, but other bushy hair

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.050
as well, as a beard (starting around the 17th
century).

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.390
• Mutton chops, besides being a slab of
rib meat cut somewhat perpendicular to the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.060
spine, also refers to a style of sideburn
where the facial hair tends to grow larger

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.900
as it extends down towards the chin, with
the chin then being shaved.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.760
The first known instance of this style of
sideburn being named such was around the mid-1860s

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.860
and is presumed to have been called this due
to the shape somewhat resembling the mutton

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.280
chop cut of meat.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.200
The meat itself was first called such in the
early 18th century.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.371
• Although examples can be seen all over
the map throughout recorded history, sideburns

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:50.850
weren’t a terribly popular form of facial
hair until around the early 19th century,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.620
particularly being popular then in Western
Europe among members of the military.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.480
From here, the style began to spread throughout
the world.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.510
Sideburns declined in popularity in the early
20th century, but saw a resurgence with a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.940
much more conservative version of them popping
back up in the mid-20th century thanks to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.930
the likes of James Dean and Elvis Presley.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.720
This new version tended to be shaved close
to the face, rather than the formerly common

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.280
mutton-chop version.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.900
In stark contrast to sideburns in the 19th
century, most often worn by respected military-men,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.120
sideburns post-1950s began being seen as a
facial hair style of rebels.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.850
• The English word “moustache” comes
from the French word of the same spelling,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.300
“moustache”, and popped up in English
around the 16th century.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.650
The French word in turn comes from the Italian
word “mostaccio”, from the Medieval Latin

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.850
“mustacium” and in turn the Medieval Greek
“moustakion”.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.410
We now finally get to the earliest known origin
which was from the Hellenistic Greek “mustax”,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.010
meaning “upper lip”, which may or may
not have come from the Hellenistic Greek “mullon”,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.480
meaning “lip”.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.920
It is theorized that this in turn came from
the Proto-Indo-European root “*mendh-“,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.069
meaning “to chew” (which is also where
we get the word “mandible”).

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.090
• The longest moustache ever recorded was
in Italy on March 4, 2010, and measured in

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.480
at 14 ft. long (4.29 m).

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:28.760
The proud owner of that magnificent moustache
was Indian Ram Singh Chauhan.
