I think role models are absolutely essential
especially in this part of the world, especially

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:18.450
in the Middle East. I think for the most part
there are major success stories to talk about

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.680

00:00:56.054 --> 00:00:57.054
provide a lot of global inspiration for a
large segment of the population in the other

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:58.054
world but people need to hear about them,
people need to know about them and I think

00:00:58.054 --> 00:00:58.068
they can inspire the youth to aspire to become
whatever they want to be[inaudible].
