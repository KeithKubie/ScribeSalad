00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.670
There’s an invisible, magnetic force field
surrounding our planet, protecting us from

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.330
harmful solar wind that could annihilate Earth.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.460
But, this protective blanket is also a swirling ring full of deadly radiation.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.070
And to leave Earth’s atmosphere, astronauts
have to pass through it.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.300
The Van Allen belts are rings of energetically
charged particles that have been captured

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.779
by Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.730
They got their name from this physicist, James
Van Allen.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.069
Back in the 1950s, Van Allen launched a rockoon,
a rocket lifted by a balloon above the atmosphere,

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.760
and it detected the first hint of radiation
at higher altitudes.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.329
Then, Explorer 1, the first American satellite
to orbit Earth, launched in January 13, 1958.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.670
Explorer 1 confirmed that Earth’s magnetosphere
was trapping the subatomic particles.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.209
The Van Allen belts were the first major scientific
discovery of the early Space Age, and they

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:00.320
posed a serious challenge for space travel.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.690
High speed subatomic particles can tear through
DNA, increasing the risks of cancer and other

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.860
diseases.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.050
So sending astronauts through these particles
is not ideal, and even though they’re flying

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.980
in a shielded spacecraft, doses of radiation
can still seep through.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.130
But there’s no way around the Van Allen
belts.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.660
In order to reach space, astronauts have to
travel through the inner belt, which is comprised

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.780
of protons, and then through the outer belt,
which has mostly high energy-electrons.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.670
One solution, proposed by Mr. Van Allen himself,
suggested detonating a nuclear bomb in the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.990
inner belt to clear out radiation.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.880
While Van Allen’s plan wasn’t executed,
in 1962, the United States did carry out a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.980
nuclear test in space, dubbed Starfish Prime.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.820
They wanted to see if detonating a 1.4 megaton
bomb in low-Earth orbit could augment and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.100
expand the Van Allen Belts, but the explosion
actually ended up adding more radiation around

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100
our planet.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.690
So, for the Apollo missions, NASA had to create
a radiation barrier within the spacecraft

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.819
and figure out a trajectory that avoided the
thickest, most radioactive part of the belts

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.540
while traveling as fast as possible.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.360
Scientists determined that if the speed of
the apollo spacecraft was about 25,000 kilometers

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.090
per hour, it would take a spacecraft about
52.8 minutes to pass through the belts.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.560
Scientists found that the radiation dose received
during that amount of time would be, at most,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.519
11.4 rads and that’s without the protection
of a spacecraft.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.540
A lethal radiation dosage for a human is 300
rads in one hour, so NASA deemed the missions

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.540
a go.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.769
After all that, it turned out, that during
the Apollo missions, the average radiation

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.769
doses on the skin of the astronauts came out
to be 0.38 rad which is about the same radiation

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.859
you would receive getting two CT scans of
your head.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.029
So while the Van Allen belts are lethal, they
could really only kill an astronaut if they

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.859
were to spend several days in their radioactive
vicinity.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.730
And despite the challenges the belts create
when leaving Earth, we should actually be

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:19.709
thanking them for protecting life on our planet
from utter annihilation.
