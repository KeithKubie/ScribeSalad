00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. Now let's start working on some real code here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're going to do an extended example.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is going to reflect what you'll be doing in your homework

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for this Unit quite closely.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're going to be using the Google App Engine Datastore

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and this is the database provided by App Engine

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that is actually pretty cool to use.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A couple things that are worth pointing out:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What we've been referring to as tables

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
are known as entities,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in the Google App Engine Datastore.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They serve, basically, the same purpose,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which is how you organize things of the same data type together.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Instead of having a table for links, you would have an entity called Link,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then you would have a bunch of links.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A couple things about entities:

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The columns are not fixed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That is, in a table, you had to have a fixed number of columns

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that you define when you define the table

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and in the Google App Engine entity

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you can have whatever columns you want--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
even entities of the same type don't have to have the same columns.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This makes development, actually, a lot easier.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When you're working with tables, often

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you build your table and you add a feature,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and then you realize--oh, I needed this column,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and then you have to add that column.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And sometimes adding a column to a database with

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
millions of rows can be quite troublesome.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In Google, we don't have that problem; you can have whatever columns you want.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can actually change the columns while you're developing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's very handy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Entities all have an ID,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and this ID can either be assigned automatically by the Datastore,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
which is what we'll do in most cases--or you can make up your own ID.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So if you want to use integers or if you want to use

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
strings--you can use whatever you want, but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
every entity has an ID field.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And another important thing that will be a factor, going forward,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is that entities have this notion of parents and ancestors.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And this is a relationship to other entities

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that has a couple of very specific use cases.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So--keep going with our link example--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
if we had an entity called a Link,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
it might have a parent that is Reddit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Then we can do queries to say get me all of the links

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that are a child of Reddit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And this has some interesting notions

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
with regard to consistency

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in the App Engine database.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So it's not something we need to understand deeply,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and to be honest, I'm just learning how to use the Datastore myself.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So I am, by no means, an expert in how the Datastore works.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But something that's important is that if you give your

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
entities a parent, you can get around some limitations on consistency,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which is one of the things I'll talk about.
