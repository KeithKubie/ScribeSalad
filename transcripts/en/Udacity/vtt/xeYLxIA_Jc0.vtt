00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
And the answer is:

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
None of them.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is more than just a trick question.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The point I'm trying to make is that all of these browsers are a little different,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and if you've used more than one of them,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you'll know that that's obviously true.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
However, none of these browsers are perfect,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and in fact, it's not even clear, when we're doing web development,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what perfect is.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's a very imperfect art--web design is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And so, while you may have a preference for one of these browsers,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it is not necessarily true that your users agree.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You know--you may like Chrome,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and your users may prefer Internet Explorer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Or--more realistically--you may like Chrome

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and your users are forced to use Internet Explorer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, you need to have in mind that all of these browsers are different,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they all behave differently, and you need to keep that in mind

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.384
as you develop and test in--as many browsers as you can.
