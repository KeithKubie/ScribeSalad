00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.330
What I want to do in this
video is talk a little bit

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.860
about seismic waves.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.330
One, because they're
interesting by themselves,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.580
but they're also really
useful for figuring out

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.690
what the actual composition
of the Earth is.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.070
You've seen my video on the
actual layers of the Earth,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.940
and seismic waves are
crucial to actually realizing

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.190
how people figured out what the
different layers of the Earth

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.810
are.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.546
And just to be
clear, seismic waves,

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:28.420
they're normally associated
with earthquakes,

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.619
but they're any waves that
travel through the Earth.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.890
They could be due to
an earthquake, or just

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.890
really any kind of a large
explosion, or anything

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.130
that really essentially
starts sending energy

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.890
through the rock on Earth,
really through Earth itself.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.980
Now, there's two
fundamentally different types

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.174
of the seismic waves.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:56.340
And we're going to focus
on one more than the other.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.500
One is surface waves.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.251
And the other is body waves.

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, surface waves are
ones that literally

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.050
travel across the
surface of something.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.925
In this case, we're
talking about the surface

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:09.680
of the ground.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.330
And this right here is a
depiction of surface waves.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.790
And these really are more
analogous to the type

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.430
of waves we normally associate
with the surface of water.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.110
And there's two types of
surface waves, rally waves,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.770
and love waves.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.010
We won't go into
a lot of detail,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.509
but you can see
that rally waves are

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.260
kind of the ground
moving up and down.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.980
Right here the
ground is moving up.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.090
Here it's moving down.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.080
Here it's moving up.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840
Here it's moving down.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.210
So you can kind of view it
as kind of a ground roll.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.360
The love waves are
essentially the ground

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.300
shifting left and right.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.870
So here it's not
moving up and down,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.470
but here it's moving,
if you're facing

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.640
the direction of the wave
movement, to the left here.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.990
Here it's moving to the right.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.090
Here it's moving to the left.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.340
Here it's moving to the right.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.250
In both cases, the movement
of the surface wave

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.080
is perpendicular to the
direction of motion.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.505
So we sometimes call
these transverse waves.

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:00.130
And these are
essentially analogous to,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.680
as I said, kind of what
we see in water waves.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.460
Now, the more interesting
thing are the body waves,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.700
because the body waves,
first of all, they're

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.210
the fastest moving waves.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.610
And these are also
the waves that

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.910
are used to figure out the
structure of the Earth.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.560
So the body ways come
in two varieties.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.740
You have your P-waves,
or Primary waves.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.290
And you have your S-waves,
or Secondary waves.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.470
And they're depicted
right over here.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.200
And this is actually
energy that's

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.120
being transferred
through a body.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.680
So it's not just moving
along the surface of one.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.130
And so here in
this diagram that I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.550
got from Wikipedia, which I
think Wikipedia got from the US

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.750
Geological Survey, we have a
hammer being hit on some rock

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.274
or whatever.

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:49.190
And what you see is right
when the hammer gets

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.480
hit at this end of the rock,
and I can zoom in a little bit--

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.260
so let's say I have
this rock over here

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.030
and I hit it right over here
with a hammer or something.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.060
What that's
immediately going to do

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.240
is it's going to compress the
rock that the hammer comes

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.220
in touch with.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.260
It's going to
compress that rock.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.990
But then that energy,
essentially the molecules

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.400
are going to bump into
the adjacent molecules.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.982
And then those
adjacent molecules

00:03:14.982 --> 00:03:17.440
are then going to bump into
the molecules right next to it,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.970
and then they're going to
bump into the molecules

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.761
right next to it.

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:22.260
So you're going to have this
kind of compressed part of rock

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.680
moving through the wave.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.590
So these are compressed,
and those molecules

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.330
are going to go bump into
the adjacent molecules.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.980
So kind of immediately
after that the rock will be

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.084
denser right over here.

00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:35.500
The first things
that were bumped,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.120
those will essentially bump
into the ones right above them,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.690
and then they will kind of
move back to where they were.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.670
And so now the compression will
have moved, and if you fast

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.720
forward it will have moved
a little bit forward.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.360
So you essentially have
this compression wave.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.340
You hit the hammer here,
and you essentially

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.550
have a changing
density that is moving

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.800
in the same direction
of the wave.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.080
In this situation that is
the direction of the wave,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.620
and you see that
the molecules are

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.840
kind of going back and
forth along that same axis.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.840
They're going along the
same direction as the wave.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.830
So those are P-waves.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.080
And P waves can
travel through air.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.279
Essentially sound waves
are compression waves.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.680
They can travel through liquid.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.710
And they can obviously
travel through solids.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.630
And, depending, in air
they'll travel the slowest.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.171
They'll essentially
essentially, move

00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.380
at the speed of sound, 330
metres per second, which

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.100
isn't really slow by
every day human standards.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.480
In a liquid they'll move
about 1,500 meters per second.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.610
And then in granite,
which is most

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.580
of the crustal
material of the Earth,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.102
they'll move at around
5,000 meters per second.

00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:46.060
Let me write that down.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.940
So 5,000 meters per
second, or essentially

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.700
5 kilometers per second if
they're moving through granite.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.440
Now, S-waves are
essentially-- if you

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.470
were to hit a hammer on
the side of this rock--

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.840
so let me draw another diagram
since this is pretty small.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.920
If you were to hit a
hammer right over here what

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.860
it would do is it would
temporarily kind of

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.462
push all the rock over here.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:13.170
It would deform it a
little bit, and that

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.660
would pull a little bit
of the rock back with it.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.200
And then this rock that's
right above it would slowly

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.500
be pulled down, while this
rock that was initially hit

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.620
will be moved back up.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.630
So you fast forward maybe
a millisecond, and now

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.950
the next layer of
rock right above

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:35.490
that will be kind of
deformed to the right.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.080
And if you keep
fast forwarding it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.490
the deformation
will move upwards.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.560
And notice, over here, once
again, the movement of the wave

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.600
is upwards.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.530
But now the movement
of the material

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.720
is not going along the same axis
that we saw with the P-waves,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.980
or the compression waves.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.750
It's now moving perpendicular.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.010
It's now moving along
a perpendicular axis,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.660
or you could call this
a transverse wave.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.710
The movement of the
particles is now

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.860
on a perpendicular axis to the
actual movement of the waves.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.570
And so that's what an S-wave is.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.865
And they move a little bit
slower than the P-waves.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:12.740
So if an earthquake that
were to happen you'd

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.650
see the P-waves first.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.870
And then at about 60% of
the speed of the P-waves

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.460
you would see the S-waves.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.287
Now, the most important thing
to think about, especially

00:06:22.287 --> 00:06:23.870
from the point of
view of figuring out

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.930
the composition of the Earth,
is that the S-waves can only

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.455
travel through solid.

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:36.480
And you might say, wait,
I've seen transverse waves

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.050
on water that look like this.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.890
But remember, that
is a surface wave.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.224
We are talking about body waves.

00:06:41.224 --> 00:06:43.056
We're talking about
things that are actually

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:44.570
going through the body of water.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.400
And one way to
think about this is

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.280
if I had some water
over here-- so let's say

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.500
that this is a pool.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.245
I'll draw a cross
section of water.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.880
I could have drawn
it better than that.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.932
If I have a cross section
of water right over here,

00:07:04.932 --> 00:07:06.640
let's think about it,
and hopefully it'll

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.584
make intuitive sense to you.

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.000
If I were to compress some of
the water, if I were to kind

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.512
of slam some part of the
water here with like a big,

00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:15.220
I don't know, some
type of-- I would just

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.950
compress it really fast.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.202
A P-wave could transmit, because
those water molecules would

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:23.160
bump into the water
molecules next to it, which

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.201
would bump into the water
molecules next to that.

00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:27.770
And so you would have a
compression wave, or a P-wave,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.426
moving in the
direction of my bump.

00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:31.550
So P-waves waves it makes
sense, and the same thing

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.057
is true with air or sound
waves, that it make sense

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:35.640
that it could travel
through a liquid.

00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:40.100
And remember, we're
under the water.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.260
We're not thinking
about the surface.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.676
We're thinking about moving
through the body of the water.

00:07:43.676 --> 00:07:46.620
Let's say that you
were to kind of take

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.070
that hammer and kind of slapped
the side of this little volume

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.750
of water here.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.570
Well, essentially
all that would do

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.730
is it would send a compression
wave in that direction.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.350
It really wouldn't do anything.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.400
It wouldn't allow a transverse
wave to go that way,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:13.050
because the water doesn't have
this elastic property where

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.830
if something bounces
that way it's

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.760
going to immediately
bounce back that way.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.830
It's being pulled back
like a solid would.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:25.490
So S-waves only
travel through solids.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.940
So we're going to
use essentially

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.255
our understanding of P-waves,
which travel through air,

00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:31.600
liquid, or solid, and our
understanding of S-waves

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.071
to essentially figure out what
the composition of Earth is.
