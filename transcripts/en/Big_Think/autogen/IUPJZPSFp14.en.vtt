today in many cases and it will be more

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740
today in many cases and it will be more
 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.590
today in many cases and it will be more
available that you have an implantable

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600

danger with it of course is that you'll
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.630

more treatment when that happens because

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990
more treatment when that happens because
 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.750
more treatment when that happens because
they will wake up thinking oh my God

run contrary to one enough a lot of
 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120
run contrary to one enough a lot of
people talk about which is how do we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130
people talk about which is how do we
 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.350
people talk about which is how do we
reduce overall cost of healthcare I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
reduce overall cost of healthcare I
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.490

had the technological ability to

had the technological ability to
actually identify them so that is this

actually identify them so that is this
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.160
actually identify them so that is this
vicious cycle which in fact becomes a

everybody says reduce the cost at the

everybody says reduce the cost at the
same time they will identify more and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000
same time they will identify more and
 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.460
same time they will identify more and
more things that people can get treated

more things that people can get treated
