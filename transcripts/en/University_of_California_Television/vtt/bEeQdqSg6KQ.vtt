00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:15.525
- Sherri Sager joined Lucille
Packard's Children's Hospital

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.710
at Stanford in 1994 and
she continues to serve

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.820
as the Chief Government and
Community Relations Officer.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.930
She has more than 30 years of experience

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.150
in government having worked
as staff for elected officials

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.520
on all levels of government.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.420
She's managed political campaigns.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170
Wait and talk with her
at the intermission,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.790
as well as having served as a volunteer

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
on city and county task
forces and commissions.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.740
And Sherri's title is Children's Hospitals

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.460
and the Importance of Health Insurance

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.640
and Medicaid for Children
with Disabilities

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.133
and Special Care Needs.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.720
Welcome to the podium.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.970
(applause)

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.930
- Thank you, I was just whispering to Lucy

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.720
that the most difficult task for me today

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.780
will be to stay on point with my slide

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.943
because I wanna work off
of what Amy was just saying

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:20.050
and I kept thinking of all these things

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.883
I wanted to say.

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:24.783
But I should let you know ahead of time,

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.620
I tend to do that.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.890
Because I think those
are important things.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.640
And so I'm really
grateful for the privilege

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.790
of speaking here today,
and I thank Lucy so much

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.880
for thinking of us and me and my colleague

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.800
Lisa Chamberlain who will follow.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280
But I wanna start before
I start my formal slides

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.203
with a couple of sort
of preliminary comments.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.360
Way back when, when I worked for a member

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.640
of the state legislature, one of the most

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.610
organized and informed
groups were the Developmental

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.110
Disabilities Group, and
I was a District Director

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.690
for a state legislator, and they'd come in

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.070
and they'd say, teach
us all about advocacy.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.030
How do we get some changes
because at that time,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.580
not unlike now, state
budget was in trouble

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.380
and there were threats
to funding programs.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.560
So I've always found the
developmentally disabled

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.450
community willing to step up to the plate,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.820
tell their stories, share it and say

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.271
this is important to us.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.773
You need to talk to us, you know we vote.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:42.310
And if I were writing this,
I would put it in bold.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.950
I'd highlight it and I'd underline it.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.833
We vote, it makes a difference.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.170
The other preliminary
comment is it's always

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.000
very discouraging to me when I'm talking

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.393
to somebody in Washington DC especially,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.240
and they're an elected
official or they work

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.980
for an elected official
and they confuse the terms

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.953
Medicare and Medicaid.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.100
And it happens way more than it should

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.460
since it shouldn't happen at all.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.460
The key is Medicare is funded by all of us

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.720
who work, through payroll taxes.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.083
Medicaid comes from the general fund.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And it is not only the
safety net for folks

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.320
who are low income, but
it is the safety net

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.682
for anyone who has high
medical bills with the idea

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:42.480
that you don't go broke
because of high medical costs.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.493
So part of my job is stereotype breaking.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.230
I won't let people get away with saying

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.390
oh those poor people,
they're just on welfare

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.440
and they don't do anything to deserve it.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.240
That's baloney.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.710
And part of what we
have to do is put a face

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.570
on who's on Medicaid or
in California, MediCal.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.570
The one other point I would
make is that the formula,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.370
Amy went through and talked
to you about the formula

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.390
and the FMAP, it's an antiquated formula.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.643
But we can't change it.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.770
It's antiquated because it's based

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.240
on both the state's poverty level

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.360
and a per capita.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.384
Well California has one of the highest

00:04:31.384 --> 00:04:33.730
poverty rates in the country.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.610
So you would think that our rate would be

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.170
so much higher.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.230
Well we have a little
problem in that we've got

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:42.623
the Bay area.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.740
More specifically we've got Silicon Valley

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.350
and San Francisco, drives
up the per capita income

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.140
for the entire state.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.120
So while we have one of
the highest poverty rates,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.490
we also have the highest per capita,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.680
which keeps us at that 50%.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.750
It's problematic but we're never gonna get

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.530
that changed unfortunately
because there are

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.133
more states than us and
they have the votes.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.020
The other big difference between Medicare

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.020
and Medicaid and it comes
in here, is that Medicare

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.020
is a federal program that
says here are all the things

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.290
you have to do.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.520
It may be implemented on
a state-by-state basis

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.610
or a region, but there are
clear federal guidelines.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.360
It is a federal program.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.030
Medicaid has a federal umbrella who says

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.050
you have to do these kinds of things

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.127
but beyond that, you can do what you want

00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:46.710
and it's really, thank
you, as I lose my voice.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.410
Which is probably not a bad thing.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.310
There are 54 different Medicaid programs

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.770
in the country.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.370
One Medicare program,
54 Medicaid programs.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.250
It makes a huge difference
when you're trying

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.530
to advocate, when you're
trying to make changes,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.853
when you're trying to protect the program.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.733
But neither Lisa or I
have anything to disclose.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.250
And so I wanna talk more deeply about

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.020
who are the children that are covered

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.570
by Medicare and CHIP?

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.460
CHIP stands for the Children's
Health Insurance Program

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.720
and when congress first
passed CHIP they said,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.430
okay, we've taken care of kids.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.140
We don't have to worry about that anymore.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.003
Let's move on.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.783
Mm, not quite true.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.580
Almost half of the children
with special healthcare needs

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.440
are covered by either Medicare and CHIP

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.440
and in 2008, the last
recession with a big R

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.970
in California, we
combined the CHIP program

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.010
into the MediCal program.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.040
So even within our MediCal
program in California,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.800
we have two different FMAPs.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.693
Because the kids on CHIP,
it's a 65-35% match.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.825
So the federal government
pays 65% of the cost.

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:15.400
The state pays 35%.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.180
But it's all blended together to create

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.663
our Medicaid program.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.410
As each day is different,
so the cost or share

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.000
of children with special
healthcare needs can vary

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.260
from 23% to 67%.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.650
You heard Amy say they might
have all the eligibility

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.290
requirements but they cap
how much the funding is

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.400
so that limits.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.580
I talked to my colleagues
at Texas Children's

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.140
all the time who are
lamenting that the state's

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.810
already run out of money and there's kids

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.740
on waiting lists who are eligible

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.123
but the state has no money.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.490
75% of Medicaid CHIP children with special

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.580
healthcare needs live
in families below 200%

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.030
of the federal poverty level.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.150
The federal poverty
level is roughly $16,000

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.060
for a family of three.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.960
So you're talking about $32,000.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.440
I don't know that you are
surviving very well anywhere

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.510
in the state of California,
but definitely not

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.473
in the bay area.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.193
This is Tyler.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.010
Tyler's one of my advocates.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.120
I took Tyler back to Washington DC with me

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.480
two years ago when he was four.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.070
He's now six.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.560
And when I called mom,
'cause I actually have

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.484
written permission and I called mom to say

00:08:45.484 --> 00:08:48.790
is it okay if, I'm doing this conference,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.100
I wanna show the pictures
from DC and with Tyler

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.370
and show his care map, which you'll see

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.240
in a little bit.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.870
She said here, let me give
you his updated photo.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.283
So I think it's okay for
me to talk about Tyler.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.123
Tyler was born with half a heart.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:11.260
And his parents were told he
had, they had two options.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.980
They could bring him home.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.976
He was 32 hours old at this point,

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:17.190
and they could bring
him home and say goodbye

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.195
or they could have him
airlifted to Packard.

00:09:20.195 --> 00:09:24.680
Now this is a family
that plans everything.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.726
They dated for a long time and say okay,

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:28.970
we've saved up money, we can get married.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.803
They got married.

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:32.080
Saved up money said okay,
we could buy our house.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.100
They bought their house.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.481
Saved up money and said okay,
we could start our family,

00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:36.910
started our family.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.450
And they did something
that most of us don't

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.520
even think about.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.358
They bought helicopter
insurance, life flight insurance

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:44.690
in their health plan.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.040
'Cause you know, just never know.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.540
(laughter)

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.540
And then mom went into labor prematurely.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.950
Tyler was born, that was their option.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.480
They said life flight him to Packard.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.960
He got to Packard before,
well mom was still

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.160
in the hospital, before dad got there.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.090
He was already into surgery
before dad even got there.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.080
Turns out though their
helicopter insurance

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.030
was for the wrong helicopter company.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.823
And so it didn't cover.

00:10:22.653 --> 00:10:26.780
But we take care of things like that.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.610
It's one of the things
that children's hospitals

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.730
tend to do.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.440
And we don't want families
to go broke either.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.090
And so we actually, through
our financial counseling,

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.017
took care of it.

00:10:36.017 --> 00:10:38.310
And I have to tell you
this family also has

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.970
primary health insurance
through dad's job,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.090
secondary health insurance
through mom's job

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.320
and Medicaid to cover all
of the ancillary services

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.830
and wrap around services.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.330
They could not survive without that.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.300
Dad makes choices about where he works

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.630
because of the health insurance.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.430
So he makes the commute from Scotts Valley

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.300
to San Jose every day
in order to make sure

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.903
that Tyler gets the
coverage that Tyler needs.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.962
For me, that's a red
flag, something we need

00:11:11.962 --> 00:11:14.080
to do something about.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.130
That's not okay.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.690
They should be just able to
focus on doing the right thing

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.340
for their family and
having dad working closer

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.840
to home would sure help a lot.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.080
So what are the demographics?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.630
Who are the kids who
are on Medicaid or CHIP

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.403
and have special healthcare needs?

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.530
Well, 7% of them have
incomes that are 400%

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.473
of the federal poverty level.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.423
This is throughout the US,
so it's not just California.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.838
43% are less than 100% of
the federal poverty level.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:58.260
As any of you who work
with or are somebody

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.870
with a developmental disability, you know

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.020
that it's hard to hold
down a full-time job

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.780
even when you want to,
whether you're a caretaker,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.550
caregiver, it's just tough to do that.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.130
And we don't make it any easier.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.300
So it's really important that we continue

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.380
to be able to provide Medicaid
so that at least families

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.283
know that they have health coverage.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:27.010
Their race, ethnicity, 40%
are non-Hispanic white.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.703
29% are Hispanic.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.850
22% are non-Hispanic African American.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.540
So if you start looking
at how our population

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.020
in the country breaks down,
this is pretty similar.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.410
So again, we're gonna bust a stereotype.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.653
It's not all people of color.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.160
It is everyone.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.713
It can hit anyone's family.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.860
Now we're gonna start
seeing this age change.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.320
It used to be you had a lot higher numbers

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.490
of the zero to five, higher percentages,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.890
and then as they got
older, they got smaller

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.260
the percentages.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.680
Well one of the good things
is that through medical

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.160
research and technology,
we're saving, not only

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.490
are we saving a lot of
children and families,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.230
but we're giving them a quality of life.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.880
Because we often hear, oh
well there's an ethical issue.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.340
You know you're saving these children

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.300
but now there's this huge cost to society

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.380
for taking care of them.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.948
Well guess what, when we
save children's lives,

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:38.320
when we give them a productive life,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.840
they give back and we get those back

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.240
in all sorts of ways.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.310
So it's a good thing to be doing,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.593
but it changes our age breakdown.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.560
The other myth is, oh,
all this money's going

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.360
to all these kids.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.300
Two-thirds of Medicaid
spending is for elderly

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.210
and then people with disabilities.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.320
And a lot of the elderly
who have disabilities

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.510
and if they're low income, they qualify.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.320
You hear them referred to as medi medi's.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.090
They have Medicare and Medicaid.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.600
So Medicaid covers their
premiums and other services

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.513
that are not covered by Medicare.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.900
It makes a difference.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.790
Children are 43%.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.740
We usually add in pregnant
women 'cause they're covered

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.090
if they're low income by Medicaid as well.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.550
And as a children's
hospital that actually has

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.280
a pretty robust labor and delivery,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.470
we're as interested in that number.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.360
So about 50% of the people on Medicaid

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.303
are women and children.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.110
And most of those children
are healthy children.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.063
And there's some children in
the disabled bucket as well.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.030
The expenditures, this
is the one that's key.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.570
Only 19% of expenditures go to children.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.570
40% of the Medicaid
expenditures go to folks

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.333
who are disabled.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.900
So what does Medicaid mean for children?

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:20.820
Medicaid and CHIP, it
benefits the entire family,

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.723
not just the child.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.170
It provides access to care.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.160
They're cost-effective programs.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.990
When children are healthy,
they're less likely

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.490
to miss school.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.570
They're healthier into adulthood.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.860
They can earn higher wages.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.870
And then guess what?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.233
They can pay more taxes
and keep the cycles going.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.330
I'm doing a lot of work these days

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.810
on adolescent mental health.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.110
And I have a lot of frustration
because everybody wants

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:57.110
to solve the folks who
are mentally ill coming in

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.240
to the emergency rooms, and
I'm like that's important

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.110
but if we would put some money into kids

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.570
and into prevention, we might be able

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.810
to reduce those costs
when they get to adulthood

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.893
because we will have solved the issue.

00:16:14.187 --> 00:16:17.850
And let's put more
dollars into prevention,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.260
into caring for children and teens,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.760
whether it's physical
health and mental health

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.930
and please, please, please,
please, let's get rid

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.170
of the silos.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.340
Let's encourage integrated healthcare.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.853
It's better for everyone.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.660
Medicaid enables low-income
children to receive

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.020
that needed care without co
payments and deductibles.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.360
I often hear people say, and legislators

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.870
or legislative staff saying
well if people would buy

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.300
into the system, you know a co-pay, $50,

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.683
it's no big deal.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:59.158
I wanted to ask them if they
would spend a week living

00:16:59.158 --> 00:17:02.320
either as someone with a disability

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.460
or on a limited budget that
would qualify for Medicaid

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.943
and then tell me that $50 is no big deal.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.115
I want them to have to make that decision.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:16.410
I have $50, my kid's healthy
this week, this month.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.360
Do I pay for a health
premium that we don't need?

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.730
Do I make a rent payment or do I buy food

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.240
for my kids?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.590
I could tell you which
one comes out on bottom.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.053
It's an inexpensive way to cover children.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.410
And when parents are
covered, which is what

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.520
the Affordable Care Act allowed us to do,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.530
children are more likely to receive

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.640
the preventative healthcare.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.480
Because parents and kids
are doing this together.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.490
And it increases access to prenatal care

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.290
which reduces infant
mortality and morbidity

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.730
and we saw it with the passage

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.430
of the Affordable Care
Act for three years,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.893
from 2014 til last year, we
were seeing those numbers.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.150
And then as Lisa knows,
Dr. Chamberlain knows,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:09.130
my favorite sentence is
Medicaid is the underpinning

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.913
of the entire healthcare
system for children.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.280
And I wanna repeat that.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.190
Medicaid is the underpinning
for the entire healthcare

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.490
system for children.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.180
That means (laughs) thanks Lucy.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.873
See, she's always being a caregiver.

00:18:28.526 --> 00:18:32.020
I don't care how much money you make,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.210
how good your health insurance is,

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.300
if your children's
hospital, whether it's part

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.100
of a large system like the UCs or part

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.000
of a independent non-profit like Packard,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.840
if we haven't been able to
hire the right specialist,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.249
one because they are few and far between,

00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:52.330
or two because we don't have enough volume

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.000
to guarantee that they have an expertise,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.390
not only is that care
not there for a child

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.470
on Medicaid, that care
isn't there for any child.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.713
So to have a healthy
children's health system,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.893
you need Medicaid.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.120
Volume equals expertise.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.240
There is a reason why, and
I hope that anybody here

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.930
at UCSF doesn't take offense,
but there is a reason

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.500
why Packard is the number one
pediatric transplant program

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.670
in the country.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.720
It's because it's able to have the volume

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.380
and it takes care of children on Medicaid

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.223
from multiple states.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.930
What Medicaid means for
children's hospitals is

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.340
that children's hospitals by in large see

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.810
more Medicaid patients
that the vast majority

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.490
of other hospitals.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.677
Your first response is gonna say, oh,

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.690
I don't think so Sherri.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.150
What about those public hospitals?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.100
You've got public hospitals
all through the state.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.800
They take care of low-income children

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.930
and they take care of Medicaid.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.150
You're right, they do.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.720
And they take care of Medicare,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.060
and they take care of uninsured.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.370
And when you look at the percentage

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.397
of Medicaid, it's actually
higher in children's hospitals.

00:20:07.397 --> 00:20:09.513
Because we don't take care of Medicare.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.460
So Packard is on the low end.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.023
We're only 43% Medicaid.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.230
Children's Hospital
Los Angeles is hovering

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:24.860
between 75 and 80% as is
Children's Hospital Oakland

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.713
or now as it's known UCSF Benioff Oakland.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.173
Valley Children's
Hospital, the same thing.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.230
So Medicaid is really the foundation

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:40.230
and when you cut Medicaid,
there isn't anyplace to go.

00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:47.020
And what this does as I said is it allows

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.403
for that much-needed pediatric expertise.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.310
It's also the foundation
of financial sustainability

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.823
for children's hospitals.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.010
We depend on those supplemental programs

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:07.010
what again, if you're a
public hospital is called DSH,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.990
disproportionate share,
but for private hospitals

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.900
and children's hospitals, it's
called supplemental payment

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.950
or its DSH lookalike.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.220
It's identical rules to qualify for DSH.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.750
It's just not called DSH
because of funding streams

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.010
which is all back of the room.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.610
Graduate medical education,
the provider fee.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.440
Sometimes adult hospitals get really upset

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.015
because children's hospitals
get the biggest proportion

00:21:35.015 --> 00:21:37.563
of the provider fee in
the state of California.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.270
Well there are two reasons.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.640
We have the most beds covered by Medicaid

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.440
and we hay the highest provider taxes.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.560
So the formula is, you get back based

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.810
on how many MediCal patients you serve

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.543
and what the utilization is.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.450
I can tell you for Packard,
that's about $65 million

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.000
a year, the provider fee.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.700
We don't qualify for DSH.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.130
We're in the absolute worst
place you could possibly be.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.030
We missed qualifying by about 1%.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.253
Missing by 1% costs us $10 million.

00:22:22.912 --> 00:22:24.963
But it is what it is.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.080
So we are very dependent and appreciative

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.363
of the provider fee.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.608
Some of my colleagues are
at children's hospitals

00:22:34.608 --> 00:22:38.950
where they're receiving
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.880
and it literally is the
only way they're able

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.230
to keep programs operating.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.020
And people say, well but it's a tax.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.513
So we should cut all taxes.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:52.590
This is a tax that we, I'm not
sure gladly is the right term

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:57.610
but we gladly pay ourselves
and have voted ourselves

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.170
to self tax ourselves in order to be able

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:05.040
to draw down these federal
dollars because these are dollars

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.630
that the state of California
was leaving on the table.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.520
California was eligible
for these dollars based

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.740
on the federal government's formula,

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.590
but there wasn't enough money
in the state general fund

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.580
to be able to draw the dollars down.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.233
So by taxing ourselves as hospitals,

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:24.310
we give that money to the state to be able

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.910
to bring those dollars down
from the federal government.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.520
So don't let anyone tell you
that California is getting

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.090
more than its fair share.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.690
It's not, and California even with this,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.623
is still a donor state to
the federal government.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.650
And I wanted to tie it in,
because I can't do a presentation

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.720
like this without at least touching

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.060
on the Affordable Care
Act, and then I will try

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.530
to wrap it up so I leave enough time

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.920
for Dr. Chamberlain, because
the Affordable Care Act,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.180
especially for kids and
especially for folks

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.720
with disabilities is a life saver.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.050
It means no annual caps, no lifetime caps,

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.160
and you couldn't be discriminated on with

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.430
buying health insurance
because of that disability.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.890
That was important.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.640
It's important to our
patients, and we will continue

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.173
to strongly advocate for that.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.742
The future of Medicaid, the challenges,

00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:20.500
Amy touched on some.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.470
There will be attempts
to continue to repeal all

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.720
of the Affordable Care Act, especially

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.150
the Medicaid expansions, to
cut eligibility requirements,

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.243
to cut benefits.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.470
Make no mistake, if you do block grants

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.610
or per capita, it's cutting funding

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.900
because then they put it in a block grant,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.743
they don't see anybody's
face, and then they cut.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.030
And most serious again, is a
non-realistic understanding

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.003
of what Medicaid is and
does by a significant number

00:24:51.003 --> 00:24:53.593
of elected and appointed officials.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.420
So I talked about Tyler.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.050
This is Tyler's care
map, and mom said she has

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.920
to get me an updated
one because they've got

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.380
more appointments than this now.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.650
For him to go back to DC with me, he had

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.650
to get approval from 18
different pediatric specialists.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.420
And he had to bring his oxygen and we had

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.570
to have backup batteries for his oxygen

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.120
on the airplane.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.550
And this is Tyler talking
to Congresswoman Anna Eshoo

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.560
and showing her that above all else,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.560
he is a kid, and he is a child
just like any other child.

00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:34.227
Thank you.

00:25:35.264 --> 00:25:37.514
(applause)

00:25:48.518 --> 00:25:50.410
- That was great.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.567
After all these years I
understand Medicaid and Medicare

00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.223
and all of that, thank you.

00:25:57.017 --> 00:25:58.943
Or at least understand it better.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.657
Why do they wanna do away with it, uh.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.570
So our next speaker, also from Stanford

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.647
but previously with UCSF, where she was

00:26:11.647 --> 00:26:15.820
in fellowship in a joint
UCSF Stanford program

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.820
and I had the opportunity to
work with Lisa Chamberlain

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:26.230
on a number of advocacy
projects including things

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.910
that we did with the Academy of Pediatrics

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:33.630
in establishing the
California Advocacy Committee

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.130
that involves all of
the residency programs

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.790
throughout our state.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.130
But that's not what she's
gonna be talking about today.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:45.130
So let's get back to basics,
and Lisa will continue

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.010
to enlighten us on the
importance of health insurance

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.960
and Medicaid for children
with disabilities

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.390
and special healthcare needs.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.933
Welcome to the podium Dr. Chamberlain.

00:26:58.354 --> 00:27:00.604
(applause)

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.050
- Good morning, thank you
very much for the invitation.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.300
And I need to say that
this is kind of coming

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.230
full circle for me because I would not

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.647
be able to do the work that I'm about

00:27:14.647 --> 00:27:17.760
to share with you that I
do without the two women

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.063
in this room, Lucy Crane and Sherri Sager.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.570
As a resident, I was so
overwhelmed with I saw

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.002
taking care of these kids and frustrated

00:27:28.002 --> 00:27:31.410
that I couldn't get kids
that I cared for eyeglasses.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.480
It was actually a 17-year-old girl

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.160
who I'd taken care of for a long time,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.420
a real bright, bilingual,
bi cultural immigrant girl

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.530
who came to my clinic with headaches,

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.410
and headaches that were
worse at the end of the day.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.750
This is a kid who had straight As.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.690
She was awesome.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.420
And headaches at the ends of
the day, probably squinting.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.900
That's the first thing
you do, check her vision.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.530
Sure enough, she needs glasses.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.410
And this was the day before
the Healthy Kids Program,

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.170
and I could not get her glasses.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.520
That's what she needed,
a pair of eyeglasses.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.840
I spent months trying to figure out.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.160
Because all she had was
EPSDT which meant she

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.290
could be seen on intervals to be cared for

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.080
but she was out of interval.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.300
And I called the Lion's Club,
and they had a waiting list,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.540
and I spent my own time
calling different providers.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.950
I finally found someone in Burlingame.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.210
And I remember the day I called her.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.350
I was so excited.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.790
I found an optometrist
that's gonna get you glasses.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.710
And she was like, oh okay, where is it?

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.020
I said, Burlingame.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.543
And she said, oh, how will
I ever get to Burlingame,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.880
'cause she was down with
us in East Palo Alto.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.360
And I just remember, so
overwhelmed and feeling

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.500
like how can I practice medicine.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.840
How can I do this?

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.880
I know I'm drawn to care
for underserved patients

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.460
but how can I do this and
not completely burn out.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.257
Because as physicians we
inherit failed social policy.

00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:59.230
It was a failed social policy that put me

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.940
in that situation.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.450
And there was no way I
could sustainably practice

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.720
and care for this
population unless I started

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.400
to figure out how to change these policies

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.730
and get activated around that.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.740
And that's been a bit part of my career

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.344
and what I'm gonna talk to
about in our last 15 minutes

00:29:14.344 --> 00:29:15.933
for this session.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.200
But medical school had not
prepared me to do that.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.313
Not even slightly.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.840
I went to Berkeley and
got a public health degree

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.700
because I knew I needed those skills,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.220
and then I was graced with Sherri Sager

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.930
and Lucy Crane coming
into my life, both of whom

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.820
took me to Sacramento.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.210
I spent many, many evenings
in Lucy's living room

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.650
planning and strategizing
and building capacity

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:42.370
in pediatrics to address the policies

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.909
that create the problems.

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:46.620
So I'm not gonna show you any statistics.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.230
Like I've learned a lot just listening

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.100
and I thought I knew a lot about Medicaid,

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.860
but I'm gonna tell stories
about how we are working

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.870
in pediatrics and how I hope we can start

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.770
creating trans disciplinary
action together

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.523
with other fields to improve
the health of children.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.360
So the story I wanna tell
first is what happened

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.460
in the fall of 2016.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.930
So we'd come through
an interesting election

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.100
and we're hit with a series of headlines

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.570
that threatened a lot
of what we care about,

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.790
headlines around repealing the ACA

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:23.180
and changes around immigration policy.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.510
And the pediatric residents
that I work with at Stanford

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.740
came to me an said we are really worried

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.940
about our families.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.240
We are hearing from our
families that they are scared,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.700
that they don't want to come to clinic,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.670
that they're gonna lose
their healthcare coverage.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:37.890
What could we do about this?

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.980
And part of my job there is to talk about

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.210
the social determinants of health

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.630
and to teach them about health policy.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.060
And so I said well, I
don't know, let's think.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.430
Let's throw it open.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.550
We got to talk to Sherri.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.080
So that's my first call all the time.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.149
And she said well why
don't we have a town hall.

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:54.760
So we opened up a town hall and not just

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.050
to our physicians at
Packard but to all staff.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.400
Emails went out to everyone
saying if you're concerned

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.430
about the changing kind
of prevailing wisdom

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.020
coming from the east coast
right now, come talk to us.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.410
And so we held a town hall, and had three

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.340
quick presentations on the
changes around Medicaid,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.850
around immigration and about funding

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.150
for pediatric research.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.780
And then just opened it up and said what,

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.050
it was a group about this size,
said what do you guys want

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.883
to do about it.

00:31:21.883 --> 00:31:23.780
You're people who came
out on a whatever it was,

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.730
Tuesday night, to talk about this.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.650
What are you interested in?

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.060
And we brainstormed
together for about an hour.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.700
And this group of people
said what we want to do

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.110
is have a strong, coherent voice together

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.650
to fight for our families
and to fight for our kids.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.090
And that was the beginning of what we call

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:43.310
our Policy Response Team that now exists

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.030
down at Packard.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.660
And we kinda came together
and had two main goals.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.930
One was to organize and
strengthen our local

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.190
professional community
so that we could better

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.510
advocate together in a
real time sensitive way

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.260
when different issues came forward.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.930
And we also wanted to educate ourselves.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.720
We wanted to educate the next generation

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.240
of pediatricians as well
as everyone around us

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.590
about the important
impact that these things

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.343
were having on our families.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.130
So over the last year
and a half we've taken

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.490
a lot of action together.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.500
You can see some signs here
around different issues,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.420
DACA and CHIP being a couple big ones.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.880
And the ways we've done that,
a lot of teaching sessions.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.182
So we went from having a
couple policy updates a year

00:32:30.182 --> 00:32:32.010
to closer to 12.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.650
So almost every month we're
having a different topic

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.383
and teaching the residents
about these issues.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.520
And then the importance
of letting, we said,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.450
go into those town halls.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.120
Our legislators come home.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.930
They have town halls,
and we not only have them

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.300
on our calendar, we send
emails out to everyone,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.010
there's a town hall, who can go.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.970
Who wants to go together?

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.010
Let's carpool, let's get down there.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.030
And you can see we wear our white coats.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.040
We stand up.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.900
We talk about kids.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.820
We talk about the
importance of these issues.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.380
Sometimes when it's Anna Eshoo's town hall

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.130
for instance, we thank her.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.540
Thank you for being a
champion for children.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.560
We appreciate that.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.560
You have to shore up those
who are your champions

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.760
in Washington and who
consistently are a voice

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.113
for the families that we care about.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.700
And it's interesting, when you stand up

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.877
and talk at these things,
the media follow you out

00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:27.060
and say excuse me, excuse
me, can we get a quote?

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.110
And so our residents
and our faculty have had

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.560
many opportunities to talk and get our

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.240
voice out even further.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.860
And one thing I've noticed,
I think it can feel

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.210
intimidating to go by yourself.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.230
This idea of I'm gonna look it up,

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.890
and I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna speak to people.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.840
But as a group, people seem to love it.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.380
Like okay, who can go
this Saturday afternoon

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.930
and we'll all go grab
lunch and we'll think

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.180
about what's happening, and then lets

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.320
just all go together.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.180
And if it's your first one,
you can just sit there.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.623
You don't have to say anything.

00:33:58.479 --> 00:34:01.840
You know so this idea I
think that we're not alone.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.410
We're in this together and we really need

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.537
to start getting more organized I think

00:34:06.537 --> 00:34:08.490
in working together with this.

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:11.020
And we would certainly
welcome our colleagues

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.100
who are again, in different
fields, joining us on these.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.550
Because I think we can all
tell those powerful stories.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.450
We are getting very organized
about letter writing.

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.000
We have lots of opportunities.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.930
Every single teaching
conference that we do

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:28.784
is accompanied by an opportunity
to send letters, to tweet.

00:34:28.784 --> 00:34:31.030
I'm gonna get to that in a minute.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.273
To get our voices out,
to make phone calls.

00:34:33.273 --> 00:34:35.530
But the letter writing,
if for instance we have

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.070
a grand rounds that has a policy angle,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:43.070
we had one recently on the
increasing price of insulin

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.420
and just how crazy that
is, what's going on.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.430
And so where there's something that again

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.442
that failed social policy
that we are all inheriting,

00:34:51.442 --> 00:34:54.480
we have out, kind of
like where we signed in

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.050
and got our badges, at
grand rounds we have

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.883
a similar table.

00:34:57.883 --> 00:35:00.830
There are letters out there
to make it easy for you.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.740
Grab one of these.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.940
Take it in, write it while
you're sitting in grand rounds.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.790
Drop it off at the end or do it at the end

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.270
and we'll get that sent for you.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.910
So just putting it in front of people.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.670
Operationalizing, we could
have an advocacy letter today,

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.820
right, we could take advantage of the time

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.470
that we're together to
raise our voice together,

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.740
make it easy for people to address

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.283
these policy issues.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.420
We've coordinated greatly with the

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.120
American Academy of
Pediatrics where Lucy was

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.800
enormous leadership role for many years

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.270
to raise our voice even more broadly

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.513
and to coordinate things nationally.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.810
So one of our opportunities in California

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.070
and Lucy eluded to it is that years ago

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.850
we built a collaboration
between the 14 training programs

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.710
in California, and I did that with Lucy,

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.059
with Dr. Andequo and
Gina Lewis, both up here,

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:57.680
and reached out to the
other training programs

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.190
and said hey we really could
have a much more powerful

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.920
voice in Sacramento if
we organized ourselves

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.050
and if we spoke together in
a much more coherent way.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.300
And so we've reached out
on these American Academy

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.170
of Pediatric days of
action because that kind of

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.700
is an umbrella across all of our campuses.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.750
We're all parts of the AAP.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.250
And so we take action when they have days

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.390
to take action together, we make sure

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.829
that every single program in
California is participating,

00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:27.730
and the voice roaring out of California

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:30.683
has not been small I'm very proud to say.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.840
And because of all this, I'm
not a social media person

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.082
my daughters will tell you, I'm hopeless.

00:36:38.082 --> 00:36:41.920
But I have joined Twitter.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.300
And it is a part of my job.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.130
It is a really important way to advocate.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.190
And I asked Lucy, I said
what's your Twitter handle

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.350
for this meeting.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.740
Because I took pictures of
Lucy and Amy standing after.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.150
I would be tweeting about this.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.000
And people across the
country who follow me

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.320
would be hearing about this.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.280
I've wanted to thank
Kaiser for that great slide

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.720
I used, that slide you used all the time.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.170
I was gonna write, I
already know the tweet

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.950
I'm gonna send, thank you
@Kaiser Family Foundation,

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.670
you know we continue to use your site.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.153
But Kaiser will see that.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.870
There's somebody at Kaiser
watching that today,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.080
their Twitter feed.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.560
It is a really powerful way,
and this is the very first

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.040
tweet I sent up there on top.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.650
It says #Firsttweet, so your first tweet

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.073
is always followed.

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:25.300
But it's interesting because
at the morning conference

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.610
and we were getting the residents ready

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.510
to do this Twitter storm, I said okay,

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.630
everyone get out and log on to Twitter.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.280
And they all looked at me.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.578
And I'm like, you are
all on Twitter, right?

00:37:35.578 --> 00:37:37.725
And they're like, no.

00:37:37.725 --> 00:37:38.840
(laughter)

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.838
and I was like oh my, really?

00:37:40.838 --> 00:37:42.497
And they're all on Instagram and Snapchat,

00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:45.323
which I'm aware of because
I have teenage daughters.

00:37:46.183 --> 00:37:49.506
And they're like, Twitter's
like for grown ups.

00:37:49.506 --> 00:37:51.756
(laughter)

00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:56.539
Which explains why I like
it and I'm not on Snapchat

00:37:56.539 --> 00:37:57.706
and Instagram.

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:01.240
It is actually work.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.170
The people on Twitter
are having conversations

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.098
about policy, about guns, about taxes.

00:38:08.098 --> 00:38:12.760
It is not social in the same way

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.690
that I had thought of the Facebooks

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:15.690
and everything else.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.120
This I really have shifted
in the last six months.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.800
This is a part of my job.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.660
It is my job to get it out there.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.640
It is my job to stay on for it.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.310
And the people who make decisions listen

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.080
to this conversation.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.550
And that's why we have to be on it.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:31.830
So I would encourage you, maybe set a goal

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.810
to at least talk to someone
about getting on Twitter.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.210
It's really not hard at all.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.563
I was surprised.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:43.376
So as an example of the power of Twitter,

00:38:43.376 --> 00:38:46.400
the American Academy had
a day of Stand for CHIP

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.000
because we were just so
unbelievably frustrated

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.960
with that situation.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.230
Took a lot of action that day.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.420
We had good media coverage,
not just at Packard

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.863
but across the state.

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.630
And here are the numbers.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.980
We used two different hashtags.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.350
It's kinda how Twitter
organizes their conversations.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:03.193
So one hashtag was #DontCapMyCare.

00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:07.150
It had about 6,000 posts
snatched nationally

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.963
which means we reached four
million individual people.

00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:13.990
#KeepKidsCovered was the
other hashtag we used.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.520
8,000 posts, almost nine million people.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.090
And having spent two
years working part time

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.660
in Sacramento 'cause
I wanted to understand

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.770
this policy better, I
can tell you the staffers

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.410
who report directly to the legislators

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.570
sit in front of screens
with the Twitter feed

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.720
over here, and they watch
what's called trending.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.640
What's trending?

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.660
What's everyone talking about?

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.493
What is this?

00:39:34.493 --> 00:39:35.920
What is this don't cap my care?

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.550
What is this keep kids covered?

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.540
And they will click
through and they will look

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.970
at our conversation.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.320
So on both on this day when we did this,

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.090
we trended all day long.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.230
We know we reached every
single staffer on the hill

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.950
with these messages that day.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.670
And that's why this is important.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.870
That's why this matters.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.520
Because of this, because
our residents have just been

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.272
unbelievably inspiring,
Sherri asked if she

00:40:00.272 --> 00:40:02.880
could take them to Washington with her

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.910
on one of her trips.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.460
There's a couple of them over
here on right, Lee and Jen.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.620
So they got to go to
Washington, walk the halls

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.700
with Sherri, which is
where I got my education.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.163
So it was real pleased that
they were able to do that.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.690
We've also created a story
bank because the power

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.360
of stories is so
important and what this is

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.040
is a secure Google doc in our hospital

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.540
that our residents and
others if they have stories

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.570
if they are feeling
frustrated and they want

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.383
to put their story down they can.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.527
Here's one somebody put in.

00:40:35.527 --> 00:40:38.297
"A mother of two school-age
children with terrible oral

00:40:38.297 --> 00:40:40.667
"sores was afraid to come to the doctor

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:42.332
"or the emergency room because she has

00:40:42.332 --> 00:40:45.587
"an electronic bracelet is
worried about getting deported.

00:40:45.587 --> 00:40:47.327
"She was so scared to
come in that by the time

00:40:47.327 --> 00:40:50.730
"they arrived, both children
were severely dehydrated."

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.680
So we get stories all the time.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.900
It is a way for the physicians
and the caregivers to vent,

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.620
to put their story down, to
share what they're seeing.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.710
We have tons and tons and daily examples

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.480
of people delaying coming in because

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.450
of fear of immigration.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.960
We have people who
delayed, the worst is a kid

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.485
who got delayed getting a
really important diagnosis

00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:15.750
that probably changed his course.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.860
And so Sherri takes these stories

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.130
and she takes them to
Washington and she shares them.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.120
And she says this is what's happening.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.970
So we take that voice and we take it right

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.930
to our policy makers.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.360
So the story bank has been something

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.070
that's been both therapeutic I think

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.713
and effective as an advocacy tool.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.980
So how did we do this?

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.980
We got ourselves organized,
incredible support

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.070
from our institution.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.943
And no matter where you work
I just would encourage you

00:41:40.943 --> 00:41:44.140
to try to do something similar.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.850
We have great support
from our CEO across the,

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.947
without question he supports us.

00:41:50.947 --> 00:41:54.390
We send out weekly emails to everyone

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.720
on our Policy Response Team each week

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.950
to tell them kinda what's going on.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.458
Here's the update from DC, et cetera.

00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:02.223
Here's how you can take action.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:03.920
We have these meetings.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.380
We use an app called Slack
to keep ourselves organized.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.623
Sherri hates it but it
does work, I promise.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.164
And I think going forward
this could really be

00:42:12.164 --> 00:42:15.270
more powerful in an interdisciplinary way.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:18.280
And that's what I'm excited
to be here about today,

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.100
to join forces with other voices,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.740
with our parents and our patients.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.300
Because I think at that point we really

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.260
would be unstoppable.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.240
And I'll just finish to say that quickly,

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.110
this is something that
I've been working on

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.777
for about the last 10 years
building things in California.

00:42:32.777 --> 00:42:36.310
There's the original group in California

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.060
and just a shot there of
how we are in Sacramento.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.730
We'll be in Sacramento mid
April, taking our voices.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.950
But we're also, this
model of coming together

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.290
across the state is something
that's kinda caught on

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.660
and it's been really fun.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.950
I'm now leading different
statewide collaboratives

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.610
in other places and
different academic programs

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.020
from across states are coming together

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.440
to build their voice.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.750
And so right now we have collaboratives

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.020
in California, Missouri,
North and South Carolina

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.853
and New York.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.600
I was just in Illinois last week.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.960
They're getting on board.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:11.810
New Jersey's actually already
started and next up is Texas.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.860
These are the states that are interested.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:18.520
And so the vision by 2020
is that we will have 114

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.150
out of about the 200 training programs

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.440
in the United States advocating in the way

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.960
that I've shown you that
we're doing in California.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.170
Because unless we engage in the policy,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.530
we are not going to be
able to really stand

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.020
and care for our children in the way

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.140
that we know that we can.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.200
So I invite you all, if
this kinda sparked anything,

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.330
to please reach out.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.500
Medicaid, as Amy and Sherri
have said, is so vital.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.450
It's super important for
children with medical complexity

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.305
and we are really at an
all hands on deck moment.

00:43:50.305 --> 00:43:53.510
It's time to unify and speak up for kids.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.830
So this is how you can reach Sherri and I,

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.100
as well as if you're on Twitter, yay.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.340
You can follow us.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.290
And thank you again so much, not just

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.350
for the invitation but for about 20 years

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.610
of mentoring me, Lucy and Sherri

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.513
and happy to take any questions
that you all might have.
