when you implement back-propagation for

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070
when you implement back-propagation for
 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.649
when you implement back-propagation for
your neural network you need to really

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659
your neural network you need to really
 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.900
your neural network you need to really
compute the slope or the derivative of

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
compute the slope or the derivative of
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.540
compute the slope or the derivative of
the activation functions so let's take a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
the activation functions so let's take a
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.430
the activation functions so let's take a
look at our choices of activation

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
look at our choices of activation
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830
look at our choices of activation
functions and how you can compute the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
functions and how you can compute the
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.110
functions and how you can compute the
slope of these functions can see

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
slope of these functions can see
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.870
slope of these functions can see
familiar sigmoid activation function and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
familiar sigmoid activation function and
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.290
familiar sigmoid activation function and
so for any given value of Z maybe this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
so for any given value of Z maybe this
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.660
so for any given value of Z maybe this
value of z this function will have some

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
value of z this function will have some
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570
value of z this function will have some
slope or some derivative corresponding

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
slope or some derivative corresponding
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429
slope or some derivative corresponding
to if you draw a rule line there

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
to if you draw a rule line there
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980
to if you draw a rule line there
you know the height over width of this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
you know the height over width of this
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.450
you know the height over width of this
little triangle here so if G of Z is the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
little triangle here so if G of Z is the
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880
little triangle here so if G of Z is the
sigmoid function then the slope of the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
sigmoid function then the slope of the
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.709
sigmoid function then the slope of the
function is d DZ G of Z and so we know

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
function is d DZ G of Z and so we know
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.740
function is d DZ G of Z and so we know
from calculus that this is the slope of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750
from calculus that this is the slope of
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.330
from calculus that this is the slope of
G of X and Z and if you are familiar

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
G of X and Z and if you are familiar
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220
G of X and Z and if you are familiar
with calculus and know how to take

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
with calculus and know how to take
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410
with calculus and know how to take
derivatives if you take the derivative

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
derivatives if you take the derivative
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869
derivatives if you take the derivative
of the sigmoid function it is possible

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
of the sigmoid function it is possible
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599
of the sigmoid function it is possible
to show that it is equal to this formula

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609
to show that it is equal to this formula
 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520
to show that it is equal to this formula
and again I'm not going to do the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
and again I'm not going to do the
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709
and again I'm not going to do the
calculus steps but if you're familiar

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
calculus steps but if you're familiar
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750
calculus steps but if you're familiar
with calculus feel free to pause the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
with calculus feel free to pause the
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760
with calculus feel free to pause the
video and try to prove this yourself

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
video and try to prove this yourself
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.130
video and try to prove this yourself
and so this is equal to just G of Z

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140
and so this is equal to just G of Z
 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.330
and so this is equal to just G of Z
times 1 minus G of Z so let's just

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
times 1 minus G of Z so let's just
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.600
times 1 minus G of Z so let's just
sanity check that this expression makes

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
sanity check that this expression makes
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.160
sanity check that this expression makes
sense

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170
sense
 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.590
sense
first if Z is very large so say Z is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
first if Z is very large so say Z is
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.600
first if Z is very large so say Z is
equal to 10 then G of Z will be close to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
equal to 10 then G of Z will be close to
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940
equal to 10 then G of Z will be close to
1 and so the form that we have on the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
1 and so the form that we have on the
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.710
1 and so the form that we have on the
Left tells us that D DZ G of Z does be

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
Left tells us that D DZ G of Z does be
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.719
Left tells us that D DZ G of Z does be
close to G of Z which is equal to 1

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729
close to G of Z which is equal to 1
 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.510
close to G of Z which is equal to 1
times 1 minus 1 which is therefore very

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
times 1 minus 1 which is therefore very
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.539
times 1 minus 1 which is therefore very
close to 0 and this isn't D correct

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
close to 0 and this isn't D correct
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.160
close to 0 and this isn't D correct
because when Z is very launched the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
because when Z is very launched the
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.490
because when Z is very launched the
slope is close to 0 conversely of Z is

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
slope is close to 0 conversely of Z is
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190
slope is close to 0 conversely of Z is
equal to minus 10 so there's no way out

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
equal to minus 10 so there's no way out
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.149
equal to minus 10 so there's no way out
there then G of Z is close to 0

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
there then G of Z is close to 0
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.190
there then G of Z is close to 0
so the following on the left tells us d

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
so the following on the left tells us d
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.639
so the following on the left tells us d
DZ G of Z will be close to G of Z which

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
DZ G of Z will be close to G of Z which
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.700
DZ G of Z will be close to G of Z which
is 0 times 1 line is 0 and so it is also

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
is 0 times 1 line is 0 and so it is also
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.680
is 0 times 1 line is 0 and so it is also
very close to 0 or Sakura

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690
very close to 0 or Sakura
 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.610
very close to 0 or Sakura
finally a Z is equal to zero then G of Z

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
finally a Z is equal to zero then G of Z
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.980
finally a Z is equal to zero then G of Z
is equal to one-half as a sigmoid

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
is equal to one-half as a sigmoid
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.020
is equal to one-half as a sigmoid
function right here and so the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030
function right here and so the
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.150
function right here and so the
derivative is on equal to 1/2 times 1

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
derivative is on equal to 1/2 times 1
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.900
derivative is on equal to 1/2 times 1
minus 1/2 which is equal to 1/4 and that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910
minus 1/2 which is equal to 1/4 and that
 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.140
minus 1/2 which is equal to 1/4 and that
actually is turns out to be the correct

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
actually is turns out to be the correct
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.550
actually is turns out to be the correct
value of the derivative or the slope of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
value of the derivative or the slope of
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.710
value of the derivative or the slope of
this function when Z is equal to 0

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
this function when Z is equal to 0
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.170
this function when Z is equal to 0

this thing the shorthand for the
 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.350
this thing the shorthand for the
derivative is G prime of Z so G prime of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.300
respect to the input variable Z um and
then in a neural network we have a

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310
then in a neural network we have a
 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.550
then in a neural network we have a
