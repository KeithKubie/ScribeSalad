00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:02.783
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone,
what I wanna talk about here

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:05.503
is how to interpret the
directional derivative

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:07.079
in terms of graphs.

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.031
I have here the graph of a function,

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.051
a multivariable function,

00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:14.884
it's f of xy is equal
to x squared times y.

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:18.804
In the last couple videos I talked

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:21.104
about what the directional derivative is,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.404
how you can formally define it,

00:00:22.404 --> 00:00:24.404
how you can compute it using the gradient.

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:28.328
Generally the setup
that you might have is,

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.765
you have some kind of
vector, and this is a vector

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:33.108
in the input space so in this case

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:35.438
it's gonna be in the xy plane.

00:00:35.438 --> 00:00:39.021
In this case I'll just
take the vector 1 1.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.580
Okay? And the directional
derivative, which we

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.764
denote by kind of taking
the gradient symbol,

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:50.060
except you stick the name of
that vector down in the lower

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.028
part there, the directional
derivative of your function,

00:00:55.028 --> 00:00:56.376
it'll still take the same input.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.884
This is kind of a measure
of how the function changes

00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:00.992
when the input moves in that direction.

00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:03.844
So I'll show you what I mean, I mean

00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:08.011
you could imagine slicing this
graph by some kind of plane

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.701
but that plane doesn't
necessarily have to be parallel

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.513
to the x or y axes.

00:01:13.513 --> 00:01:15.601
That's what we did for the
partial derivative, we took

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.945
a plane that represented
the constant x value or

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.990
the constant y value, but
this is gonna be a plane that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.777
kind of tells you what
movement in the direction of

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:25.657
your vector looks like, and
like I have a number of other

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:29.808
times I'm gonna go ahead and
slice the graph along that

00:01:29.808 --> 00:01:33.942
plane, and just to make it
clear, I'm gonna color in where

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.034
the graph intersects that slice.

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.914
This vector here, this little
v, you'll be thinking of it

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:44.418
as living on the xy plane and
it's determining the direction

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:47.066
of this plane that we're
slicing things with.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.946
On the xy plane you've got this vector,

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.454
it's 1 1, it kind of points
to that diagonal direction,

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:54.848
and then you take the whole
plane and you slice your graph.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:58.935
And if we want to interpret the
directional derivative here,

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.523
I'm gonna go ahead and
fill it an actual value,

00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:04.856
so let's say we wanted to do it at -1 1,

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:08.054
- 1, -1

00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:08.887
'cause I guess I chose a
plane that passes through the

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:11.958
origin, so I've got to
make sure that the point

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.046
I'm evaluating actually
goes along this plane,

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.370
but you could imagine one that
points in the same direction,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.666
but you kind of slide it back and forth,

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:22.918
if we're doing this, we can
interpret this as a slope,

00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:25.446
but you have to be very careful,
if you're gonna interpret

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:28.166
this as a slope, it has to be
the case that you're dealing

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.974
with a unit vector, that
the magnitude of your vector

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:32.830
is equal to 1.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.526
I mean, it doesn't have to
be, you can kind of account

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:36.802
for it later but it makes
it more easy to think about.

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.126
If we're just thinking of a unit vector.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.002
When I go over here instead
of saying that it's 1 1,

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.954
I'm gonna say it's whatever
vector points in the same

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:48.574
direction but has a unit
length, and in this case that

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.804
happens to be square root of 2 over 2,

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.312
for each of the components.

00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:54.588
You can kind of think about
why that would be true

00:02:54.588 --> 00:02:58.491
by diagonal but this is a
vector with unit length,

00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:03.435
and its magnitude is 1, and
it points in that direction.

00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:06.859
If we're evaluating this
negative point like 1 1,

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.192
we can draw that on the graph,
see where it actually is,

00:03:09.192 --> 00:03:12.444
and in this case it'll be,
oops, moving things about when

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:13.852
I had a point.

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:17.201
It'll be this point and if
you kinda look from above,

00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.034
you see that's -1, -1,

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:22.964
and if we want the slope at that

00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:25.704
point, you're kinda thinking
of the tangent line here.

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.840
Tangent line to that curve,
and we're wondering what its

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.276
slope is, so, the reason that
the directional derivative

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:36.876
is gonna give us this slope,
is because, another notation

00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:39.012
that might be kinda helpful
for what this directional

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:42.949
derivative is, some people
will write partial f,

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.116
and partial v.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:49.624
You can think about
that as taking a slight

00:03:49.624 --> 00:03:53.504
nudge in the direction of
v, so this would be a little

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:57.220
nudge, a little partial
nudge in the direction of v.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.216
And then you're saying
"what changed in the value

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:02.604
of the function that's then resulting?"

00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:04.556
"The height of the graph, does
it devalue the function?".

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.248
As this initial change
approaches zero and the resulting

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.688
change approaches zero as
well, that ratio, the ratio

00:04:10.688 --> 00:04:14.144
of the partial f to partial
v, is going to give the slope

00:04:14.144 --> 00:04:15.864
of this tangent line.

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:19.208
Conceptually, that's kind
of a nicer notation, but the

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:22.484
reason we use this other
notation is nabla sub v 1,

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:25.152
is it's very indicative
of how you compute things

00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:27.439
once you need it computed.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.559
You take the gradient of f,
just the vector value function

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.726
gradient of f, and take the
dot product with the vector.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.429
Let's actually do that,
just to see what this would

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.797
look like, and I'll go ahead
and write it over here,

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:43.909
use a different color.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.481
The gradient of f, first of
all, is a vector full of partial

00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:52.757
derivatives, it'll be the
partial derivative of f with

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:56.425
respect to x and the partial
derivative of f with respect

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:57.258
to y.

00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.065
When we actually evaluate
this, we take a look, partial

00:05:03.065 --> 00:05:06.771
derivative of f with respect
to x, x looks like the variable

00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:10.893
y I just a constant, so its
partial derivative is 2 times x

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.413
times y.

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:14.471
2 times x times y.

00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:15.730
but when we take the partial with

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.597
respect to y, y now looks
like a variable, and x looks

00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:21.637
like a constant, derivative of
a constant times a variable,

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:24.554
is just that constant x squared.

00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:30.372
And if we were to evaluate
this at the point -1, -1,

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:34.539
then you can plug that in, 2
times -1 times -1 would be 2,

00:05:35.423 --> 00:05:38.756
and then negative 1 squared, would be 1.

00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:42.421
So that would be our gradient
at that point, which means

00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:46.833
if we want to evaluate gradient
of f times v, we could go

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:49.829
over here, and say that's 2 1,

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:54.437
'cause we evaluate the gradient
at the point we care about.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:58.091
And then the dot product,
with v itself in this case,

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.841
root 2 over 2, and root 2 over 2.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.104
The answer that we get, we
multiply the fist two components

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:11.124
together, 2 times root 2
over 2, then square it to 2,

00:06:11.124 --> 00:06:14.280
and then here we multiply the
second components together,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.047
and that's gonna be 1 times
root 2 over 2, root 2 over 2,

00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:21.248
and that would be our answer,
that would be our slope.

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:25.404
But this only works if your
vector is a unit vector,

00:06:25.404 --> 00:06:27.656
and I showed this in the last
video where we talked about

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:30.860
the formal definition of
the directional derivative.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.088
If you scale v by 2, and I
can do it here if instead of v

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:37.084
you're talking about 2 v, so
I'll go ahead and make myself

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:38.334
some room here.

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:48.556
If you're taking the
directional derivative along 2 v

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:51.690
of f, the way that we're
computing that, we're still taking

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.857
the gradient of f, dot product
with 2 times your vector,

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.069
and dot product, you
can pull out that too.

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.597
This is just gonna double the
value of the entire thing.

00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:08.825
V, this started with v, it's
gonna be twice the value,

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:11.193
the derivative will become
twice the value, but you don't

00:07:11.193 --> 00:07:13.397
necessarily want that because
you'd see this plane you

00:07:13.397 --> 00:07:16.809
sliced with, if instead of
doing it in the direction of v,

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:20.085
the unit vector, you did in
the direction of 2 times v,

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.893
it's the same plane, it's
the same slice you're taking,

00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:24.893
and you'd want that same
slope, so that's gonna mess

00:07:24.893 --> 00:07:25.749
everything up.

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:27.793
This is super important if
you're thinking about things in

00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:30.311
the context of slope, one
thing that you could say is

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:34.433
your formula for the slope of
a graph in the direction of v,

00:07:34.433 --> 00:07:37.593
is you take your directional
derivative, that dot product

00:07:37.593 --> 00:07:40.751
between f and v, and you just
always make sure to divide it

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.955
by the magnitude of v,
divide it by that magnitude.

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:47.555
That will always take care
of what you want, that's

00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:49.599
basically a way of making sure
that really, you're taking

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:51.827
the directional derivative
in the direction of a certain

00:07:51.827 --> 00:07:52.987
unit vector.

00:07:52.987 --> 00:07:56.307
Some people even go so far
as to define the directional

00:07:56.307 --> 00:08:00.487
derivative to be this, to be
something where you normalize

00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:02.255
out the length of that vector.

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:06.179
I don't really like that, but
I think that's because they're

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:10.147
thinking of the slope context,
they're thinking of rates of

00:08:10.147 --> 00:08:12.747
change as being the slope of a graph.

00:08:12.747 --> 00:08:15.559
One thing I'd like to
emphasize as always, graphical

00:08:15.559 --> 00:08:18.903
intuition is good, and visual
intuition is always great,

00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:21.039
you should always be trying
to find a way to think about

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:22.919
things visually, but with
multivariable functions,

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.659
the graph isn't the only way.

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:28.537
You can kind of more generally
think about just a nudge

00:08:28.537 --> 00:08:31.857
in the v direction, and in
the context where v doesn't

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:35.085
have a length 1, the nudge
doesn't represent an actual size

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:39.284
but it's a certain scaling
constant times that vector,

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:41.164
you can look at the video on
the formal definition for the

00:08:41.164 --> 00:08:43.788
directional derivative, if
you want more details on that.

00:08:43.788 --> 00:08:46.460
But I do think this is actually
a good way to get a feel for

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.923
what the directional
derivative is all about.
