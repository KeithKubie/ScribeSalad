Hey, want your baby to grow into a brilliant
and successful adult?

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.110
Then stop texting,
Parents!

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.370
Hey guys, Amy with you today on DNews.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.160
For most of us, smartphones are an extension
of our bodies, connecting us to people around

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.780
the world and managing every element of our
lives.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.669
But some studies say they aren’t healthy
for us, and a new study says damage can start

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.140
long before we can even use the device.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.949
Translational Psychiatry published results
from University of California Irvine researchers

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.520
who found interrupted attention from mothers,
like a caregiver constantly checking her phone,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.910
can lead to emotional damage in babies.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.230
Ok, so upfront it must be said that this study
was done with rodents focussing on maternal

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.230
care of young.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.830
But the authors do say the findings may be
applicable to other mammals, namely humans.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.760
The study looked at rhythms and patterns in
maternal care and found that consistency from

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.810
a parent has a hugely positive impact on the
developing brain by ensuring the growth of

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.600
robust neural networks.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.210
And this is something that can only happen
in infancy.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.720
The brain is the most immature organ at birth.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.720
In newborns, all the wiring between brain
cells is basically in place to support physiological

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.140
survival functions like breathing and heart
beat.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.920
But the connections made in the baby’s brain
in the first five years of his or her life

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.530
are the ones that lay the foundation for a
well rounded adult, things like emotional

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.640
maturity and social behaviour.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
Studies show that to raise the best baby they
can, parents need to actively engage with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.240
their baby via physical touch, social interaction,
and speaking directly to their baby maintaining

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.350
eye contact.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.670
This creates far more neural connections than
adults need, so as the child grows, the unused

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.220
or unneeded connections are pruned away, leaving
the child with the skills they need to thrive.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.680
Unresponsive parents who are on their cell
phones may only be passively engaging with

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.840
their baby, and may be inadvertently telling
the baby's brain they don't need those active

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.840
responses.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.159
Research suggests that infant brains thrive
best in a safe environment.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.299
In this case, a baby will feel safe when their
caregiver respond immediately to his or her

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.299
needs!

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.130
If a parent responds immediately to a baby’s
cries for food or attention, the child will

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.600
figure out that they're safe and can focus
their attention on exploring the world around

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600
them.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.590
On the other hand, if their basic needs for
food aren’t met, the infant will feel unsafe

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:29.760
and focus on making sure those needs are met,
not with exploring the amazing world!

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.610
For full disclosure, the damage to infants
comes from fractured attention, not specifically

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.730
from cell phones.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.560
The researchers looked specifically at inattentive
and distracted maternal care, and a major,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.790
modern source of distractions for both mothers
and fathers is undoubtedly cell phones.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.599
So put down your cell phones, parents.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.709
That text can wait.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.090
Your child’s future as a stunning success
can’t.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.260
And besides, you’ll be way happier in a
few years when you can text your friends about

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.700
how awesome your kid is.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.109
And if you think answering a quick text isn’t
a distraction, check out this video about

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:17.340
how focussing really hard on something makes
you go deaf.
