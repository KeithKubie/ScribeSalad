00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
Vsauce!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.340
Kevin here.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.329
Rollercoasters may have originated from Russian
Mountains built in the 17th century - these

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:12.520
were large ice hills held with wooden supports
and we've been innovating amusement rides

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.050
ever since like this 1919 concept that shot
passengers out of a cannon in a bullet-shaped

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
capsule to land in a giant waterslide and
end up in the lake below.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939
What the FAK!?

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.089
The facts and knowledge on Roller Coasters.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.820
People take 1.7 billion amusement park rides
every year in the U.S. alone and the chances

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.160
of being injured while riding is only 1 in
24 million but riding on roller coasters can

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.870
be extremely scary because of cognitive dissonance
where part of you understands there's no real

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.510
danger while the other part experiences genuine
fear.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.730
Located in Abu Dhabi, The Formula Rossa is
the world's fastest roller coaster clocking

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.060
in at 240 km per hour.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.440
It accelerates to top speed in less than five
seconds using a hydraulic launch system that

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.640
generates the velocity similar to aircraft
carrier steam catapults.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.570
Riders are required to wear protective eyeglasses
because of the risk of impact with airborne

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.740
objects like insects.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.070
The Kingda Ka in Jackson New Jersey holds
the record for tallest roller coaster with

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.810
the main top hat tower reaching 456 feet.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.850
After a 90 degree roll to the right it reaches
the peak and then drops 418 feet down through

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.120
a 270 degree right-handed spiral.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.190
The ride lasts 28 seconds and in 2009 it was
shut down for 3 months after suffering damage

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.970
from a lightning strike.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.040
But U.S. Thrill Rides is planning to take
the tallest record away with the Polercoaster.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.840
It is slated to open in 2016 in Florida it
will send riders down 520 feet at more than

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.700
60 mph.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.810
The Steel Dragon 2000 opened in Japan in the
year 2000, which was "The Year of the Dragon".

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.649
It holds the record for the longest track
length at 8,133 feet and 2 inches.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.170
Because the construction required so much
steel for earthquake protection it cost over

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.390
50 million dollars to build.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.720
Also located in Japan, The Takabisha is known
for having a drop angle of 121 degrees making

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.160
it the steepest roller coaster in the world.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.840
The world's tallest vertical loop stands at
160 feet during the Full Throttle roller coaster

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.230
in California.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.200
There are 18 riders per train and each ride
is under a minute long, giving it the capacity

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.090
to have 800 riders per hour.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.710
Full Throttle also features the first top
hat over a loop.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.750
A top hat is a common element in roller coasters
where there is a hill with a 90 degree ascent

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.290
and descent.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.010
But if you want to go on the roller coaster
with the most inversions you'll have to head

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640
to the United Kingdom to ride the Smiler.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.000
It has a world record of 14 total inversions
that are supposed to make you laugh, not barf.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.220
A wing coaster is a type of steel roller coaster
where pairs of riders sit on either side of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.270
the track and there is nothing above or below
them.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.400
The Gatekeeper, the fifth wing coaster in
the world, is located in Sandusky, OH.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.269
Opened in 2013 and has the highest inversion
in the world measuring 170 ft. and in the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.460
wing coaster category it holds the record
for the longest, fastest, longest drop, and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.900
most inversions.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.140
When riders experience a moment of free falling
with at least a 90 degree drop it is considered

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.280
a Dive Coaster.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.261
And the Griffon roller coaster in Virginia
is the tallest and the fastest dive coaster

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.640
to date at 205 feet tall and 71 mph.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.060
There are also no other dive coasters that
feature floorless trains and it's the only

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.940
roller coaster of its kind to have more than
one inversion.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.989
The Tatsu is a flying roller coaster that
gives riders a flight sensation.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.330
They're suspended in a horizontal position
where the cars are secured under the track

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.890
and the rider's backs are parallel to it.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.100
It holds records for the highest (170 ft),
fastest (62 mph), and longest of its kind.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.650
It's the only one to feature a zero gravity
roll and had the world's highest pretzel loop.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.590
I'm gonna leave you with this.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.330
What's the name of this roller coaster and
what's its significance?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.940
Before we go here's last video's winner.
