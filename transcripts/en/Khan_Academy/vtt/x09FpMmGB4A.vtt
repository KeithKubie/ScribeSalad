00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:02.557
- [Voiceover] So we have g(x) being equal

00:00:02.557 --> 00:00:04.735
to x to the fourth minus x to the fifth,

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.452
and what we wanna do
without having to graph g,

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:09.528
we want to figure out at what x values

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:12.111
does g have a relative maximum?

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.612
And just to remind us what's
going on in a relative maximum,

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:21.560
so let me draw a hypothetical
function right over here,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.884
so a relative maximum is going to happen,

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:25.990
so you can visually inspect this,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.998
okay that looks like a relative maximum.

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:30.806
That's kind of a top of a
mountain or top of a hill,

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:33.861
these all look like relative
maximum and what's in common?

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:36.987
Well the graph, the function is going from

00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:40.282
increasing to decreasing
at each of those points.

00:00:40.282 --> 00:00:42.948
It's going from increasing to decreasing.

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:46.855
Increasing to decreasing
at either of the points,

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.114
or you could say that the first derivative

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:52.014
is going from positive to negative.

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:54.219
So if you look at this
interval right over here,

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.246
g prime is greater than zero,

00:00:57.246 --> 00:00:59.314
and then over the next interval
when you're decreasing,

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:01.981
g prime would be less than zero.

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.281
So what we really need to think about

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.281
is when does g prime, so let me see,

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:13.761
relative, we care about
relative maximum point,

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.860
and so that's essentially asking

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.277
when does g prime

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.018
go from positive to negative?

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.608
From,

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:27.441
from,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.131
I wrote fror.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:32.714
From g prime greater than zero,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.277
to g prime less than zero,

00:01:37.308 --> 00:01:40.192
and the values that we
could look at or the points

00:01:40.192 --> 00:01:42.852
are our critical points
and critical points

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:47.019
are where g prime is either
zero or it is undefined.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:49.744
So let's think about it,

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:52.389
where is g prime of x equal to zero?

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.497
g prime of x is equal to zero

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:57.747
when well let's just take g prime of x.

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:00.137
We're gonna leverage the
power rule right here,

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:03.941
four x to the third power,
four x to the third,

00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:06.581
minus five x to the fourth.

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:10.498
Minus five x to the
fourth is equal to zero.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.323
Let's see, we can factor
out an x to the third.

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:16.800
So we have x to the third times four

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.792
minus five x is equal to zero.

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:24.754
So this is going to happen
when x is equal to zero.

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:26.377
Let me not skip steps.

00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:27.792
So this is going to happen when

00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:30.188
x to the third is equal to zero,

00:02:30.188 --> 00:02:33.944
or four minus five x is equal to zero.

00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:35.613
For x to the third equaling zero,

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.122
that's only gonna happen
when x is equal to zero,

00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:39.808
and four minus five x equaling zero,

00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:41.421
we'll add five x to both sides,

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:43.444
you get four is equal to five x,

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:47.611
divide both sides by five,
you get 4/5 is equal to x.

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.115
So here these are the two places,

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:54.994
where our derivative is equal to zero.

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:58.245
Now are there any places where
our derivative is undefined?

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.500
Well our function right over here

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.801
is just a straight up polynomial.

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.764
Our derivative is another polynomial,

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:07.543
it is defined for all real numbers.

00:03:07.543 --> 00:03:10.325
So these are our two critical points,

00:03:10.325 --> 00:03:12.636
or we could even say critical values.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:15.382
Now let's think of what g
prime is doing on either side

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.124
of these critical values,

00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:18.733
and I'll draw a little number line here

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.566
to help us visualize this, and so.

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.963
So there we go, little
bit of a number line.

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:29.122
Let's see we care about
zero and we care about 4/5.

00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:32.512
So let's say this is negative 1,

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.679
this is zero, this is one,

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:40.376
and so we have one critical point at,

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.068
let me do this in magenta,

00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:46.072
we have one critical point
here at x equals zero,

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:48.145
and then we have another critical point.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.949
I will do this at x equals 4/5.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.655
So 4/5 is right around there.

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:57.011
So that is 4/5 and let's just think about

00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.428
what g prime is doing in these intervals,

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:03.632
and these critical points
are the only places

00:04:03.632 --> 00:04:07.642
where g prime might switch
sides, switch signs.

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:10.550
So let's first think about this,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.516
let me pick some colors
I haven't used yet.

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:13.894
So let's think about the interval

00:04:13.894 --> 00:04:16.755
from negative infinity to zero.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:20.630
So this is the open interval
from negative infinity to zero,

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.435
and we could just plug in a value,

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.463
let's try negative one,
negative one is pretty

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.605
straight forward to evaluate.

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:29.005
So let's see you have four,
you're gonna have four

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:31.232
times negative one to the third power.

00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:33.829
So that's gonna be four
times negative one,

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:37.996
minus five times negative
one to the fourth power.

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:41.347
So that's just gonna be one.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:45.514
So let's see this is going to
be negative four minus five.

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:50.709
Which is negative nine,
so right over here,

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:52.714
g prime is equal to negative nine,

00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:54.192
and so we know over this whole interval,

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:56.341
since it's to the left
of this critical point,

00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:00.258
we know that g prime
of x is less than zero,

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.753
and so our function itself is decreasing

00:05:04.753 --> 00:05:08.113
over this interval and
so we know we need to go

00:05:08.113 --> 00:05:10.156
from increasing to decreasing,

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:12.903
so you can already say well
we can't go from increasing

00:05:12.903 --> 00:05:15.055
to decreasing at this critical point,

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:17.688
because we're already
decreasing to the left of it,

00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:18.712
but anyway let's just think about

00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:20.634
what's happening at the other intervals.

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:24.669
So in the interval between zero and 4/5,

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.209
so that interval right over there,

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.482
so it's between zero and 4/5,

00:05:29.482 --> 00:05:31.366
well let's just sample a number there.

00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:35.231
Let's say the number, I don't know, 1/2?

00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.493
Might be fairly straightforward.

00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:41.660
So we can evaluate g prime
of 1/2, g prime of 1/2,

00:05:43.462 --> 00:05:46.661
is equal to four times
1/2 to the third power.

00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.499
1/2 to the third power is 1/8.

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:52.666
So it's 4/8, or it's just 1/2 minus five

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.956
times 1/2 to the fourth so
that's 5/16 minus 5/16 and

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:03.666
so this is equal to 8/16

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:08.461
minus 5/16 which is equal to 3/16,

00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:11.562
but the important thing is
it's equal to a positive value.

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:14.422
So in this blue interval right over there,

00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:16.520
and actually let me put
4/5 in a different color

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.237
so we see that it's not
part of that interval.

00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:23.027
So in this light blue interval right here

00:06:23.027 --> 00:06:26.349
between zero and 4/5, g prime,

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.837
g prime of x is greater than zero.

00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:31.834
So we know our function is increasing,

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:34.134
and so let's see what's
happening to the right of this,

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:39.087
and the easiest value to
try out would just be one.

00:06:39.087 --> 00:06:42.182
So let's try out x equals one.

00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:43.745
It's in that interval.

00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:46.096
So when x equals one, I'll just write

00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:49.679
g prime of one is equal
to four minus five.

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:53.732
Four minus five, which
is equal to negative one.

00:06:53.732 --> 00:06:56.509
So g prime of x is less than zero,

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.996
g prime of x is less than zero.

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:04.163
So our function, so we could
say g is increasing here.

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.951
It is decreasing, oh
sorry let me be careful,

00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:11.381
g is decreasing here.

00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:12.853
The function itself is decreasing

00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:14.741
cause our derivative is negative.

00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:16.879
Then our function is increasing here

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.391
cause our derivative is positive,

00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:20.739
and then our function is decreasing here.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:24.645
So at what critical
point are we going from

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.629
increasing to decreasing?

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:29.121
Well we're doing that at x equals 4/5.

00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:33.288
So we have a relative
maximum at x equals 4/5.

00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.453
4/5, if they said, "Well where do we have

00:07:37.453 --> 00:07:38.977
"a relative minimum point?"

00:07:38.977 --> 00:07:41.038
Well that's going to be
happen at x equals zero.

00:07:41.038 --> 00:07:43.592
We're going from decreasing to increasing,

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:44.701
but we've answered their question

00:07:44.701 --> 00:07:47.878
of where do we find a
relative maximum point.
