00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.582
Welcome to the presentation
on the Level 2 exponents.

00:00:03.582 --> 00:00:06.480
In Level 2 exponents, the only
thing we're going to add to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.740
the mix now is the concept
of a negative exponent.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.180
So we learned already that 2
the third power, well, that

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.140
just equals 2 times 2 times 2.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.110
Hopefully, by now, that's
second nature to you,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.320
and that equals 8.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.960
Now I'm going to teach you
what 2 to the negative

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630
third power is.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.490
I know a lot of you are going
to say, oh, no, that's negative

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.100
8, but whenever you see
exponents, you always have to

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.260
remind yourself, exponents
are not multiplication.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650
I know there's that temptation
to say, well, 2 times negative

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.720
3 is negative 6, so maybe 2 to
the negative third power

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.300
is negative 8, but
that's not the case.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.920
And I'll explain in a future
module why we use this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.220
convention, but 2 to the
negative third power, it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.580
turns out, is equivalent to
1/2 to the third power.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.280
So it turns out that the
negative exponent, what it does

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.440
is it means to take the inverse
of the base-- we'll call the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760
number 2 as the base-- and
take that to the positive

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.070
version of the exponent.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.020
And 1/2 to the third power?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.336
Well, we already learned that's
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:19.170
and that equals 1/8.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.600
So we say 2 to the
negative third power.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.040
That didn't come out right.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.300
2 to the negative third
power is equal to 1/8.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.810
Let's do another one.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.530
Let's say 3 to the
negative 2 power.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.300
Once again, immediately when
we see that negative in the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.420
exponent, the easiest thing to
do is just immediately take

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.882
the reciprocal of the base.

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:46.780
So we take 1/3.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.910
And we raise that to
the positive 2 power.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.040
And that's easy enough.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.261
1/3 squared, well,
that's equal to 1/9.

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:56.700
Let's do some more problems.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:12.270
What if I had 2/3 to the
negative third power?

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.960
Once again, just to make it
simple, whenever I see that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.900
negative in the exponent,
I want to get rid of it.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.100
So I immediately take the
reciprocal of the base.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.430
The reciprocal of 2/3 is 3/2,
and I raise that to the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.180
positive third power.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.495
So what changed between the
left and the right side?

00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:33.300
The 2/3 I flipped, and
I turned the negative

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.530
3 into a positive 3.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.510
And now this just becomes
a Level 1 exponent.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:52.710
This equals 3/2 times 3/2 times
3/2, and that equals 27/8.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.970
So that's interesting.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.150
2/3 to the negative
3 is equal to 27/8.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.090
Let's do some more.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:12.190
Let's do 4/7 to the negative 1.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.870
Once again, we have a negative
number in the exponent.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.700
That's the same thing as taking
the reciprocal of the base

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.720
and raising it to the
positive exponent.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.425
Well, 7/4 to the 1, any
number to the first power

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:27.570
is just the same number.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.380
It's equal to 7/4.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.770
So when take it to the negative
1 power, all you're essentially

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.490
doing is getting the
reciprocal of the number.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.440
Let's do some more problems.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.400
2 to the negative 5.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.120
Once again, we take the
reciprocal of 2, and we say

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.680
1/2, and now that can be raised
to the fifth power, and that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.520
equals 1/2 times 1/2 times
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.750
and that equals 1/32.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.030
Another way we could have
viewed 2 to the negative fifth

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.040
is that, 2 to the negative
fifth, we could have said that

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.210
equals 1 over 2 to the fifth.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.000
And we know that 2 to the
fifth is 32, so that would've

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.380
been the same thing.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.380
Two ways to do it, pretty much
just changing the order of when

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.180
you flip versus when you
actually calculate

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.210
the exponent.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.110
Let me do two or
three more problems.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.360
And after I write down each of
these problems, you might just

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.780
want to pause it and see if you
can do the problem yourself,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.100
and then compare your
answer to mine.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.760
So let's say I had negative 4
to the negative third power.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.090
Immediately, I like to get rid
of the negative in the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.120
exponent, and I know that that
equals minus 1/4 to the third

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.500
power, and that equals minus
1/4 times minus 1/4

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.110
times minus 1/4.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.630
The negative times a negative
is a positive, but then we're

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.810
multiplying that times another
negative, so we get a negative.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.680
1 times 1 times 1 is 1.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.360
4 times 4 is 16 times 4 is 64.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.340
So it equals negative 1/64.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.340
Let's do another problem.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.100
Let me think of a good number.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.150
8/9.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.270
Let's make it negative.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.230
Negative 8/9 to the
negative second power.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.750
Well, once again, that
equals negative 9/8.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.560
Notice, I immediately just took
the reciprocal of the base to

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.630
the positive 2 power, and now
that equals negative 9/8

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.480
times negative 9/8.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.180
A negative times a negative
is a positive, so we

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.230
get 9 times 9 is 81/64.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.260
I think you get the point now.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.730
The only new thing we've
learned, really, is that when

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.790
you have a negative exponent,
it's the same thing as taking

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.710
the reciprocal of the base
and raising it to the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.250
positive exponent.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.150
Hopefully, that last statement
didn't confuse you more, did

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.630
more good than damage, but
I think you're ready to

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.620
try some problems now.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.150
Have fun!
