00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.950
Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.500
My name is Eyal.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.350
I'm managing the marketing
and the business development

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.310
activities in PlayScape.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.090
And today, I'm going to
talk about strategies

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.820
for distributing
games on Google Play.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.360
And I'm going to wrap things
up by providing a few tips

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.300
and tricks that we have
been using at PlayScape

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.090
and hopefully you
can use yourself.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.670
But before I start,
I do want to say

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.619
that all the information
that I'm going to talk about,

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410
all the data that you're
going to see here,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.870
is based on our own experience.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.800
So if you have
contradicting data,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.639
if you have a different
point of view,

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:37.930
just come to me after the talk.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.170
And you can tell me
how much I was right.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.440
But seriously now, I think that
we do live in an environment,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.790
work in an environment that
is changing really fast.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.760
And I think that the
only way we can keep up

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.600
with all the major changes
is to talk about them.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.440
And on a different note,
since everything around us

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.930
is changing so rapidly,
I think that we

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.900
tend to get caught in
the day to day tasks.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.370
And it's hard to keep track
on the bigger picture.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.540
So instead of talking about
marketing tactics and numbers

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.840
and figures, I want
to start by talking

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.350
about something a
little bit different.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.261
I want to talk about soccer.

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.260
I mean, everybody's talking
about the World Cup.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.060
Why can't we?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.280
So I want you to
imagine yourself

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.980
standing in a soccer stadium.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.800
And you're standing there.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.520
And you're given a task.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.940
And the task is to make everyone
listen to what you have to say.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.950
What do you do?

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.800
So one way to go
and that's probably

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.870
the most obvious approach is
to start making some noise.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.250
But the problem with the
most obvious approach

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.730
is that it is the
most obvious approach.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.020
And some other people that are
also fighting for attention

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.930
might be a little
bit louder than you.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.150
So games marketing is
just a bit like that.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.930
And instead of the soccer
stadium, we have Google Play.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.160
And in Google Play, there
are more than one million

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.600
applications.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419
I mean, think about
this amazing number

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.570
for just a second-- one
million applications.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.420
If I start playing
those applications today

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.450
and I'm going to dedicate
five minutes to try and test

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.710
each one of those,
it's going to take me

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.120
decades to use them all.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.720
If I plan to sleep, it can
take me up to 20 years.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.250
So people don't
really get excited

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.150
about new game launches.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.840
I mean, nobody's going to open
Google Play and say, hey, look,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.650
a new game.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950
Games are invisible.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.070
And that's why 99%
of them disappear.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.420
So discovery is a big
challenge in the mobile space.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.310
And I think that, as a result,
a lot of game developers

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.390
resort to using advertisements
as their main strategy

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.690
for distributing their game.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.590
The way that every
advertising strategy goes

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.150
is follows-- you buy some ads.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.550
You make some noise.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.010
You use the ads to
create distribution.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.630
You take the distribution
and you generate revenue.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.170
You take the profit.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.990
You invest it back to ads.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.680
And the process goes
on and on and on.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.280
And the thing is that this
strategy does not always

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.040
work for a few reasons.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.540
First of all, going back
to the soccer analogy

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.110
where some people might have
been a little bit louder

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.710
than you, in the game space,
there are other first tier game

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.340
publishers like DNA and king.com
that have marketing budgets

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.890
that you probably do not have.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.040
So if you want to be able
to compete with these guys,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.970
you cannot do what they are
doing because they can do

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.230
a much better job than you will.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.330
If you want to complete
examples for the games space,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.290
you can look at two type
of games in Google Play--

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.310
first of all, games
that monetize using ads,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.690
and other games that monetize
using IAP inner purchases

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.540
by selling virtual
items in their game.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.720
Now, although those
two categories of games

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.750
fall within the
games category, they

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.660
are essentially very
two different products.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.410
So a game that
monetizes using ads

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.800
is going to generate about $0.02
for every daily active user.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.660
A game that monetizes
using IEPs--

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.860
I'm talking about games that are
doing an amazing job monetizing

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.960
the users-- can make about $0.12
per day per daily active user.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.930
Now, this is six times more.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.710
And although it's not 10
times more or 100 times more,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.420
it is sometimes the difference
between making money and losing

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.490
money.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.450
So if king.com can afford
themselves to buy users,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.690
for instance, for $1.00
and still make a profit,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.980
a game that monetizes using
ads is going to lose money

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.380
for every user they buy.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.060
And if you think
about it, it also

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.890
goes back to the nature
of the way we think

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.680
and the way we act
when you see ads.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.630
So the best example
I have is about me

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.160
buying gummy bears,
which I really like.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
So when I want to
by gummy bears,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.970
I'm going to the supermarket.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.920
And there's a wide
variety of gummy bears.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.650
So I don't want to see
ads about gummy bears

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.600
because I don't have
a gummy bears problem.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.980
And I think this is the way
people look at ads generally.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.730
To be honest, I think that
people don't care about ads.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.120
But they also don't
care about your product.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.000
I mean, they simply don't
care-- at least, some of them.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.450
We are living in a
me, me, me world.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.620
And I think this is
partly because people

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.630
think that they
have way less time

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.720
than they used to
and way more choices.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.090
And in a world where people have
way too many choices and way

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.240
too little time, the
most obvious thing to do

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.410
is simply to ignore stuff.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.960
So if you want to
market your game,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.640
you don't want to use
mass marketing and talk

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.690
to all of these
guys, because they

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.130
have become really good
in ignoring your ads.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.380
And I think that what we
have to do is to find a way,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.730
instead of talking
to everybody we can,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.440
to get our ideas to spread.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.450
And it doesn't matter to me if
you're running a coffee shop,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.320
if you're an artist, or if
you are distributing games.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.710
I think this stuff
applies to everyone

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.580
regardless of what they do.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.970
And the people who know how
to spread their ideas win.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.350
Now, in order to
do that, I think

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.230
you have to have
two key components.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.050
The first one is
having good content.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.630
And I think that you have
to do your proper marketing

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.080
research in order to
find the right content.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.350
And you also need to use the
right marketing tools in order

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.620
to get to the core
group of users

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.010
and create a snowball effect.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.950
Now, this slide, I think,
represents the dynamics

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.080
between content and marketing.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.650
So if people say that content
is king, marketing can be queen.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.870
And some people who say that
she is wearing the pants.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.460
However, to market
the product, to market

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.750
an idea or a game that
doesn't stand out,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.060
that is not unique,
that is not remarkable

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.930
is always impossible.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.500
And I think that everybody
that works in marketing

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.410
is going to tell
you the same thing.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.190
The thing that's going to
decide what gets discussed, what

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.310
gets done with it, and
possibly what gets purchased

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.690
is whether your
game is remarkable.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.690
And remarkable is
a really cool word

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.790
because we think it means neat.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.160
But it also means worth
making a remark about.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.710
And that's in the
essence of getting people

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.210
to talk about our games.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.700
"Don't Tap the White Tile"
is a remarkable game.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.510
For those of you
who don't know it,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.840
it's a "Tap Tap Revolution"
game for mobile.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.420
What you have to
do in the game, you

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.790
have to touch the black tiles.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.610
You have to avoid
the white tiles.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.510
And if you manage to do
it, the game plays music.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.560
And the game is beautiful
and ugly at the same time.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.740
And when came out
to the market, it

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.480
was the only one of its kind.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.470
"Dumb Ways to Die" is
a safety announcement

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.510
by Metro Trains in
Melbourne, Australia.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.360
It's a safety announcement.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.000
And you've got more than
10 million downloads, only

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.620
in Google Play.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.410
And you have to trust me
when I say they did not

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.440
invest $10 million in
promoting this app.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.950
And I think what they did
is to game-ify the safety

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.510
idea of what they
wanted to portray.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.559
And also, they present it in a
very graphical but very amusing

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:38.090
way, the way you can die.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.919
"Flappy Bird" is
not a very good game

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.580
if you look at game practices.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.450
I mean, people cannot play it.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.120
And even those
people who can, they

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.420
want to smash their
device into little pieces

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.320
after a short while
of playing it.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.570
But you all know the
result of the game.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.440
"Ninja Chicken" is
one of the games

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.410
that we've published
in PlayScape.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.700
It's about a chicken
who thinks it's a ninja

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.060
and lays eggs wherever it goes.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.179
And what it came
out to the market,

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:09.720
people didn't
understand whether it's

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.100
a female chicken
or a male chicken

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.450
or why exactly it lays eggs.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.750
But the game stood out
and they talked about it.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.870
And for us, it was
an amazing success.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.640
It reached the top of the
charts all over the world.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.640
"Monster Smasher" is
another game by PlayScape.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.910
And it had solid gameplay
and really nice graphics.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.660
But I couldn't market it.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.770
So how do we explain when things
don't go according to plan,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.380
or even better, when others
manage to achieve things that

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.910
defy the fundamental
assumptions-- why

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.320
some games make it to the top
and other games, developed

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.350
by developers that are better
funded and more experienced,

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.690
do not.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.900
Why some games downloaded
by millions and millions

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.096
of the players and other games
are buried in the land slide.

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:06.220
So to be honest, I don't
think that a lot of people

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.440
can really tell and can really
explain why some games succeed

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.910
and some games fail.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.830
But I think that if you look
at the top of the charts,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.510
there's something really
clear that is happening.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.000
Every month, there
is a new game that

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.710
is leading the
top of the charts.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.760
And it's never the best game.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.630
It's never the best funded game.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.740
It's never the game that has
the biggest marketing expense.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.550
But those games are there
because they're unique.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.190
They're fresh.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.480
And they provide something
new to the target audience.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.330
And I think that our
industry, in a lot of ways,

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.170
is led by trends.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.640
And this year's
collection of games

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.000
is nothing like next years.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.690
We ware working in
the fashion business.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.150
No matter what game you
develop, no matter what genre it

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.750
is, it's the fashion business.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.300
And this thing is
that people who

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.010
work in the fashion business,
they know how it's like.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.920
But the rest of us, we have
to start thinking their way.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.420
And we have to
realize that it's not

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.010
about presenting the users
with a full page ads.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.880
But it's an entirely
different process

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.620
of getting people to
talk about our games.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.260
Now, you could not be reassured
that people will do that.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.220
But I think that
innovation is key.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.220
You can innovate by
creating a new concept,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.250
like the guys of "Don't
Tap the White Tile."

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.600
You can innovate by
using a slick design

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.580
or crazy creatives, like we
did with "Ninja Chicken."

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.755
Or you can use technology.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.130
And I think that
the Dirtybit bit

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.690
is doing a really good job
with their game "Fun Run",

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.060
which is the first
real time multiplayer

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.190
[INAUDIBLE] game for mobile.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.140
However, if you
think that you're

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.240
going to launch your game and
then people will magically

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.870
gravitate toward it, you're
heading to a surprise.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.800
And I think that once you
have something that is worth

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.400
talking about, you
have to be able to find

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.110
the core group of people that
will care about your product.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.820
And they will listen
because it's not about you.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.914
It's about them.

00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:10.580
And if you're lucky
enough and if you're

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.100
doing your job properly, they
will talk to their friends.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.790
And they will talk
to their friends.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.980
And your idea will spread.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.430
It to spread to the
rest of the curve.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.740
At the heart of finding
the right people,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.930
there's targeted marketing.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.250
Now, targeted marketing
was not even an option

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.870
up until a few years ago.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.020
I mean, some brands did use
the geolocation of the device

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.380
in order to create
targeted campaigns.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.110
But to be honest, I
think that this option

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.890
was rarely available.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.660
And marketeers had no idea
what to do with it anyway.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.430
What we're seeing today
is that ad networks

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.100
that manage to take the
geolocation of the device,

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.090
and they translate into
user profiles and segments.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.500
So according to where
the device lives

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.180
and the type of people
that visit those places,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.630
they can draw conclusions
and bucket them

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.950
into demographics, [INAUDIBLE],
and other user profile

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.990
segments.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.820
And with social
media, social networks

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.360
today, we can even get a better
understanding of our users.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.060
So the technology
is definitely there.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.440
And we can use it in order
to get to the right people.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.000
But now, we have to form
a strategy around it.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.350
So I want to guide you through
what we're doing in PlayScape

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.950
and how we launch our games.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.030
So I think when we first
launched our games to Google

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.920
Play, it was very important
for us to understand how now we

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.530
can [INAUDIBLE] margin
between the money we spend

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.630
and the money we earn.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.210
And in order to do that,
we had to learn Google Play

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.090
and to understand how it works.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.140
So there were a few
things that we used,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.600
a few methods that
we used in order

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.757
to lower the user
acquisition costs.

00:13:54.757 --> 00:13:56.590
So first of all, we
used targeted marketing.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.080
We talked about that.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.730
We also used cross promotion.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.300
And cross promotion
is a great way

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.310
of getting a few downloads
at a price of one.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.930
So you acquire one user.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.770
And then if you
have other games,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.460
you can cross promote them to
the next game, the next game,

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.450
and generate a few
downloads out of it.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.910
Using the charts is a
great way of getting people

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.580
to discover your app from
looking at Google Play.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.250
You have to know exactly
how many users you

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.720
have to drive to your game in
order to get to a specific rank

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.030
and how many users
you have to continue

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.000
to drive in order to
sustain your rank.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.160
But if you know how
much you have to do

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.210
and how many you get
in return, that's

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.320
a great way of generating
organic traffic.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.600
Word of mouth is not
something you can rely on.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.290
But we definitely have to
start thinking that way.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.450
If you have a game that
is worth talking about,

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.560
it's important to understand
how we communicate

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.610
it using your marketing assets
to your potential players.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.210
Search is another
great tool that

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.470
can allow you to
make your game pop up

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.530
when people are looking
for specific keywords.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.200
So for instance,
"Ninja Chicken" pops up

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.240
when people are just searching
for ninja games, which

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.800
drives a lot of
organic traffic for us.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.250
Now, we can't start
off by doing search

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.500
because you have to have a
critical mass of downloads even

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.430
to pop up in key words
that are not very popular.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.320
But once you do get
that critical mass,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.930
that's a great
way of scaling up.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.084
And of course, there's press.

00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:29.750
The main thing I want
to say about press

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.710
is that if you're using it
as a way for getting users

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.760
to play your game, you should
not use it as a way for people

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.880
to play your game.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.840
But it is a great way
for getting recognition

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.300
and to talk to the
key decision makers.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.540
So if you're looking
to form partnerships,

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.880
this is a tool you should
definitely consider.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.900
So what you see
here is a graph that

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.270
shows the launch of
one of our games.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.880
And it shows you
the exact number

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.920
of downloads we got every
day from day one to day 30.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.400
And the color represents
the traffic source.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.480
So the blue colors stands
for the organic traffic

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.840
that we generated.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.860
And as you can see, in the
first day of the launch,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.200
we drove a lot of traffic.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.950
But then, very fast,
we started getting

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.250
a lot of organic
traffic, which means

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.590
word of mouth,
charts, or search.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.720
What might be interesting
for you to see here

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.230
is that although we drove a lot
of traffic in the beginning,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.180
after that, we used
specific and very targeted

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.120
promotional spikes only whenever
the game needed the support

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.080
in order to continue to grow.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.100
And that can save
you a lot of money

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.900
if you are able
to work that way.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.260
Now, it's not an exact science.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.684
But it is almost
an exact science.

00:16:44.684 --> 00:16:46.725
And if you want to be able
to understand the data

00:16:46.725 --> 00:16:49.960
and to analyze it, you
have to stay data drive.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.190
We invested a lot of
resources in creating

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.070
both the infrastructure and also
recruiting the right personnel

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.840
in the company in order to
be able to track the data

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.130
and to analyze it.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.690
And one cannot do
without the other.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.050
And it allows you not only
to operate efficiently

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.130
in Google Play,
but it can also let

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.390
you do something else
that is very important,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.579
which is to test everything.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.839
Now, I know that a lot of people
are talking about A/B testing

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.410
and how important it is.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.880
It's not just a slogan.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.069
It really is true.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.859
I mean, I wish I
had some more time,

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.269
so I can so you the
different ads that we

00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:30.856
are using for the games and how
surprising the result can be.

00:17:30.856 --> 00:17:31.980
But we don't have the time.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.267
So you have to trust me.

00:17:34.267 --> 00:17:35.600
But testing is really important.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.641
And I think that if you
want to work efficiently,

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:39.160
you have to make
your assumption,

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.270
create the respective
segments, and then test, test,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.910
test everything against
each other and other.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.640
And another guideline
that follows us

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.030
and that we follow in
everything that we do

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.320
is that we try to remember
that marketing does not

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.580
equal advertising.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.930
I mean, advertising
is really important.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.610
It's an important part
of every marketing plan.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.640
But I think that
sometimes, we just tend

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.820
to forget that there's
so much more we can do.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.920
And we tend to look at the
users as numbers and figures.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.840
And I think that the industry
is doing an amazing job

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.220
in dehumanizing our users,
calling them whales.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.390
It's not only unethical.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.575
I think it's also
counterproductive and not true.

00:18:25.575 --> 00:18:27.860
And I think that if you
want to be truly successful,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.700
we have to go back to basics.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.390
And we have to
realize that it's not

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.840
about presenting our
users with a full page ads

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.480
and grabbing them by the throat.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.970
But it's an entirely
different process

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.210
of getting our idea to spread.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.121
And people who know how
to spread their ideas win.

00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:48.120
Thank you for listening.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.300
And I hope you have a good
and fruitful conference.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.080
Thank you.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.530
