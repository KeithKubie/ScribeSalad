00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:07.444
Ok so the universe is probably infinite, and
there’s stars in every direction, and stars

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:08.685
are super bright.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:13.645
so why isn’t it basically daylight all the
time?

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:18.354
Hey there my bright spots, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:18.354 --> 00:00:21.745
It’s an interesting question, “why is
space black?”

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:26.165
Well fortunately, Fraser Cain, who is brilliant
and follows me on twitter and I am not worthy,

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:29.345
recently discussed why we’re not wearing
shades 24/7.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:33.024
Cain explains that the question was first
asked by German Astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.185
Olbers in 1823.

00:00:34.185 --> 00:00:39.625
It’s known as Olber’s Paradox, and states
that if the universe is infinite, static,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.724
and timeless, then the night sky should be
lousy with stars.

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:47.115
Obviously though our night sky is more connect
the dots than pointillism.

00:00:47.115 --> 00:00:49.945
Edwin Hubble solved the paradox in 1929.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:53.605
He observed that everywhere he looked in the
universe, the spectrums of all the stars were

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:58.105
slightly red, meaning the light coming from
them was being stretched out, meaning the

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.605
space itself light was traveling through was
expanding.

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:06.695
Ergo, the universe isn’t static and there
must be stars that are so far away their light

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:08.825
just hasn’t had time to reach us yet.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:12.805
So if we give it billions more years will
we eventually be able to tan at midnight?

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:17.375
Don’t hold out too many hopes, because Hubble’s
discovery of universal expansion also means

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:21.985
that the farther away something is, the faster
the space between it and us is stretching

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:22.985
out.

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:26.475
After a huge enough distance, space will be
stretching out faster than light can close

00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:27.475
the gap.

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:29.125
There’s another facet to the paradox though.

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:33.035
Well, if the universe is all expanding away
from everything else, it stands to reason

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:35.845
that if you go far back enough, it was all
clumped together.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.585
This is where the theory of the big bang comes
in.

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:42.935
But if there was a bright instantaneous flash
of existence that happened literally everywhere,

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:44.935
shouldn’t we be able to see that too?

00:01:44.935 --> 00:01:48.585
Again, the riddle is solved by the expansion
of space.

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:53.125
In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were
working on a totally unrelated experiment

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:57.345
with a radio telescope and they couldn’t
shake this weird, unwanted static.

00:01:57.345 --> 00:02:00.475
After making sure everything was functioning
correctly, even cleaning the inside of the

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:05.215
antennae for bird droppings for hours, they
realized that the signal was coming from everywhere,

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:07.235
and you can’t stop the signal.

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:12.265
They concluded that the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation must have been the light from the

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.815
big bang, but had been stretched out after
billions of years until it was low-energy

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:19.435
microwaves that our eyes can’t see.

00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:21.415
Boom, and the universe makes sense again.

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:25.665
If you want to hear more possible evidence
of the big bang, trace and Dr. Ian O’Neill

00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:29.355
talk about gravitational waves and how they
play into that over here.

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.495
What are some other implications of expanding
space?

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:35.015
I think it’s a great excuse to not visit
relatives, because, oh no, you’re just getting

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:37.165
farther away, awww dang.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:39.935
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
