00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.639
Besides the Sun, the Moon is the most obvious
object in the sky. Bright, silvery, with tantalizing

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.279
features on its face, it’s been the
target of imagination, poetry, science,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.760
and even the occasional rocket.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.800
If you pay even the most cursory attention
to it, you’ll see that it changes every

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.920
day; sometimes it’s up in the day, sometimes
at night, and its shape is always changing.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.260
What causes this behavior?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.890
The Moon is basically a giant ball of rock
3500 kilometers across hanging in space. Its

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.260
surface is actually pretty dark, with about
the same reflectivity as a chalkboard or asphalt.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.080
However, it looks bright to us because it’s
sitting in full sunlight; the Sun illuminates

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.620
it, and it reflects that light down to us
here on Earth.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.559
And because it’s a sphere, and orbiting
the Earth, the way we see it lit by the Sun

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.250
changes with time. That’s what causes its
phases: geometry.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.710
The important thing to remember through all
this is, because the Moon is a ball and in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.020
space, half of it is always illuminated by
the Sun!

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.250
This is true for the Earth, too, and every
spherical object in space; half faces the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.920
Sun, half faces away. We call the part facing
the Sun the daylight or bright side, and the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.460
half facing away the night or dark side.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.759
The phase of the Moon refers to what shape
the Moon appears to us; how much of it we

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.149
see illuminated from the Earth. The key to
all this is this line, dividing the lit day

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.110
side from the unlit night side. We call that
line the terminator.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.070
If you’re facing the moon, with the sun
behind you, you’re seeing the half of the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.100
moon that is fully illuminated by sunlight
and it looks full. If you’re off to the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.399
side you see half of the lit side and half
of the dark side and we say the moon is half

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.799
full. If the sun is on the other side of the
moon, you’re look at the unlit half, and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
it looks dark. Now, mind you, I haven’t
moved anything except our point of view here,

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.030
so at all times the Moon is always half lit,
and half dark. Remember that.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.330
The phase of the Moon we see depends on from
what direction the sunlight’s hitting it,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.300
and the angle we see that from Earth.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.310
The Moon orbits the Earth roughly once per
month. In fact, that’s where the word “month”

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.760
comes from; “month” and “Moon” are
cognates, words that have similar etymological

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.350
histories, and in most languages, including
English, the two words are very similar. The

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.870
length of time we call the month is derived
from the length of time it takes the Moon

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.860
to go through all its phases -- 29.5 days.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
So. To describe the phases, let’s start
at the beginning: New Moon.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.860
New Moon happens when the Sun, Moon, and Earth
are all more or less in a line. The Moon’s

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.800
orbit is actually tipped a bit to the Earth’s,
so sometimes new Moon happens when the Moon

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.910
is “below” the Sun, or “above” it.
But at some point in its orbit, at some point

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.930
in the month, it appears to be as close to
the Sun as it can.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.400
What does this look like from Earth?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.340
The Moon is between the Earth and the Sun,
so from our perspective we only see the dark

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.470
half, the unilluminated half, of the Moon.
The other side, the far side, of the Moon

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.350
is lit, but we can’t see it. It makes sense
then to call this the beginning of the Moon’s

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.340
cycle, hence the term “New Moon”.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.510
Now think about this for a sec: Because the
Moon is near the Sun in the sky, it travels

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.810
across the sky with the Sun. It’s up during
the day! You can only see it from the part

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.680
of the Earth that’s lit, which is when it’s
daytime. It’s a very common misconception

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.120
that the Moon is only up at night, but it’s
up during the day literally just as often.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.640
At New Moon, the Moon stays near the Sun,
so it rises at sunrise, and sets at sunset.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.800
This makes it extremely difficult to see;
it is, after all, sitting next to the brightest

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.580
object in the sky, and only a little bit of
it is lit from our perspective.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.380
But not for long. Because the Moon is orbiting
the Earth, after a couple of days it’s moved

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.490
a bit to the east. Now we’re seeing it along
a slight angle, and we can see a little bit

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.470
of the illuminated half of the Moon on its
side toward the Sun.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.200
The terminator, the day/night line, appears
curved around the Moon, so what we see is

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.700
a thin illuminated crescent Moon. At this
point the crescent is still very thin, with

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.260
the horns of the crescent pointing away from
the Sun.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.700
Note that the Moon is still pretty close to
the Sun in the sky, just a bit to the east,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.740
rising maybe an hour or two after sunrise.
But this means it’s up all day, and then

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.080
sets after the Sun does. This is the best
time to see the crescent Moon, when the Sun

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.660
has already set and the sky starts to get
dark. The Moon will be low over the western

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.080
horizon, and it will set soon after the Sun
does.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.280
Let’s wait a couple of days.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.500
OK, now the Moon has moved a bit more in its
orbit around the Earth, and is farther from

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.140
the Sun in the sky. We see a little more of
the illuminated part, and the crescent is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.940
wider. Since it’s getting thicker, we say
this is a “waxing crescent” Moon; waxing

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.670
means growing or getting bigger. It’s also
well away from the Sun now, so it’s easier

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.920
to spot, even during the day before sunset.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.000
Seven or so days after new Moon we get to
our first milestone: the Moon is now one-quarter

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.210
of the way around its orbit. It’s 90° away
from the Sun in the sky, which means we’re

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.410
looking straight down on the terminator, the
Moon’s day/night line. It cuts right down

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.500
the middle of the visible face of the Moon,
so it’s half lit, with the sunward side

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.480
of the Moon visible and the other side dark.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.920
Confusingly, this phase is properly named
“first quarter” because the Moon is ¼

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.500
of the way through its cycle, ¼ of the way
through its orbit around the Earth, even though

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.280
it looks half full. So it’s not really the
half-full moon -- astronomers prefer “first

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.260
quarter,” so if you want to sound all astronomery,
then you should call it that.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.600
But time marches on. The Moon continues on
its gravitational dance with Earth, swinging

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.000
around its orbit. Now more than half full,
we say its shape is “gibbous”, which means

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.380
swollen or convex. Since it’s getting wider,
this is actually the waxing gibbous phase

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.200
of the Moon. It rises in the late afternoon,
and is up most of the night.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.380
Our next big step comes two weeks after new
Moon, when it’s moved halfway through its

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.800
orbit. It is now opposite the Sun in the sky,
180° around. The Earth is between the Moon

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.390
and Sun, so we’re looking at the fully-illuminated
half of the Moon. This is the full Moon.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.300
Because it’s opposite the Sun, it rises
at sunset and sets and sunrise; it’s up

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.040
all night shining down on the Earth.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.930
But again, wait a couple of days and things
change. When the Moon is full it’s 180°

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.810
around the sky from the Sun, so as it continues
to move around the Earth in a circle the distance

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.680
between it and the Sun is now starting to
decrease, even as it continues on in the same

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.389
direction. As before, it keeps rising and
setting later, but now it rises after sunset,

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.490
and sets after sunrise. If you get up early
in the morning as the Sun is just rising in

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.460
the east, you’ll see the nearly-but-not-quite
full Moon setting in the west.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.020
Not only that, but we’re about to go through
all the phases again, but in reverse order.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.670
A few days after full Moon the lit side is
shrinking. It’s in the waning, or shrinking,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.480
gibbous phase.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.520
Then, three weeks or so after new Moon, and
a week after full, the Moon is once again

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.350
half lit, the terminator splitting the Moon’s
face in two even halves. This is the “third

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.490
quarter” Moon, because the Moon is ¾ of
the way through its cycle. It’s a lot like

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.590
the first quarter, but the side that was lit
is now dark, and vice versa. It’s 270°

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.190
around the sky from the Sun. It rises at midnight
and sets at noon.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.700
A few days later and the Moon is a crescent
again, getting thinner. It’s now a “waning

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.020
crescent.” It rises just a couple of hours
before sunrise, and sets a couple of hours

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.930
before sunset.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.850
Then, finally, we’re back where we started.
One month after new Moon, the Moon has traveled

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.860
360° around the sky, and is once again as
close to the Sun as it can get. It’s new

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.380
Moon, and the cycle starts up again as it
has for time immemorial.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.110
An interesting thing happens if you move your
perspective from the Earth to the Moon. The

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.760
phases of the Moon we see from Earth depend
on the angle of the Moon and Sun in the sky.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.680
But on the Moon, the angles are exactly 180°
reversed; at new Moon, when the

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.760
Moon is between the Earth and Sun, the Earth
is opposite the Sun as seen from the Moon.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.960
It’s full Earth!

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.800
All the other phases are opposite too, so
when we see a full Moon, a Moon-dweller would

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.919
see a new Earth, and so on.

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.139
Have you ever looked at the thin crescent
Moon and seen the ghostly face of the rest

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.430
of the unlit side? That’s because it’s
not really unlit: the nearly full Earth is

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.120
reflecting sunlight on the Moon, lighting
up the otherwise dark part.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.889
The Earth is bigger and more reflective than
the Moon, so it’s actually 50 times brighter

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.430
than a full Moon! This glow is called Earthshine,
a term I quite like. Even more poetically,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.020
it’s been called “the old Moon in the
new Moon’s arms”, referring to the unlit

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.280
part surrounded by the crescent new Moon’s
horns.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.550
That’s lovely, isn’t it?

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.780
The Moon is one of the most beautiful and
most gratifying objects in the sky to observe.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.889
It’s different every day! Yet it’s also
the same, because we see, more or less, the

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:32.310
same half of it, the same face all the time.
It’s big and bright, and the features on

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.640
its surface discernible by eye (and even better
with binoculars or a small telescope).

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.110
As the phases change, inexorably, day after
day, the angle of sunlight hitting the surface

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.250
changes, bringing new things into our view.
The motions become comforting, even familiar.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.050
It’s a reminder that the Universe may seem
strange and complicated and forbidding at

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:57.390
first, but over time, as you get outside and
experience it, it becomes your neighborhood.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.260
Welcome home.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.400
Today you learned why the Moon has phases:
It’s a sphere, and it orbits the Earth,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.220
so the angle at which we see its lit side
changes. It goes from new, to waxing crescent,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.380
to half full, waxing gibbous, full, waning
gibbous, half full, waning crescent, and then

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.740
the cycle starts all over again. This also
affects when it rises and sets, and what we

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.760
see on the surface.
