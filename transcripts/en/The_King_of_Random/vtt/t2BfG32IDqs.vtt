00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.990
Escape rooms are popping up everywhere if you haven't been to one yet. I highly recommend it

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.309
I've been to four personally and I absolutely love them if you've got the kind of mechanical mind the likes

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.120
Solving mechanisms solving challenges and deciphering codes escape room is probably for you, which brings me onto this project today

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.010
Which is inspired by Lowe's home improvement, Lowe's sponsored this collaboration and spent three months building an amazing escape room that has an incredible twist

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.840
rather than just solving clues and unlocking locks you actually have to put your DIY skills to the test and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.189
Build your way out

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.808
I've never seen anything like it before and they turn it into a video that you can go see right now by clicking the link

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.179
at the top of the description and on the theme of

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.779
Mystery DIY escape rooms and puzzle boxes we have created this paint stick puzzle box

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.719
For about three dollars. This is one that I want you to try at home

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.179
It's so much fun and even though this thing looks really simple. There's much more to it than meets the eye

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.698
I'm going to give you a couple seconds just to look at this box

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.119
You can see all the different aspects of it, and you get a feel for it

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.988
Okay, if you shake that you can hear there's something inside of it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.750
No obvious way in you may have noticed. There is something here, right?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.710
If we try moving latches everything seems pretty solid for the most part there's a screw on the back there

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
But no obvious way to open it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.560
Okay, so what do you guys want to try first? I'm gonna give you about five seconds to decide

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.969
what's the first thing you want to try leave your comments down below

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.100
And my guess is you're gonna go for this thing right here first because it stands out

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.760
There's nothing else on the box that looks like it. So let's give that a little wiggle

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.340
If you tug that look at that we found a little makeshift screwdriver there

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.279
So have you seen anything on the box that might need a screwdriver?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.389
Okay, you're probably telling me that the screw on the back is the screw on the back something that can be unscrewed well. Let's see

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.719
Yeah, looks like it can

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.270
I'm gonna start unscrewing that at this point we can get into our fingers and just give it a little

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.949
Backwards motion look at that little drawer popped out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.050
That drawer actually comes out. It's got a key in it. Now that key is just for props

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.999
We don't need it for this puzzle box, but just to demonstrate that there is something you could put in there

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.669
But there's a message at the bottom. It says to flip it over. So let's flip that over what we find is a design

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.949
And it looks like a domino or a dice. It's got five holes. What could that mean?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.929
Is there anything on the box anywhere? Oh if we look inside there we can see almost a little target sign a little circle

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.160
And there's a hole there as well, that's interesting

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.330
So you can see that okay, so as that slides out that dowel goes into that hole right very cool

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.119
All right, so what is the five main? Let's focus on that

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
Oh did you notice this right here

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.449
All these look like they have finishing nail holes this one has five so what could that mean?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.940
We take that and give it a little wiggle

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.369
Okay, there's a secret compartment there with a dowel. It's also got a little circle in the back here

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.370
Have you seen that circle anywhere else?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.439
We've seen that on the inside right, so what could that mean well if we touch that circle and give it a little push

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.709
We get access to the large compartment what you can see has some tools in it. We have a wrench. We have an allen wrench

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.929
Again, those are just props showing that you can put other tools in there. You can put candy, plus there are a couple of pictures

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.569
What are these?

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.059
Okay there you have the guys the first reveal. This is a selfie I took at the loads DIY escape room remember

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.640
There's a link at the top of the description you can go watch the video we made

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.400
Going through that

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.180
And here's a picture of the team

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.709
I went through with you can see Bob from the I like to make stuff YouTube channel and

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.619
This puzzle box wasn't used in the escape room

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.280
But you could use it in one of your own

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.520
And of course to pack this thing back up

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.329
It's as easy as just pushing the pieces back together. Did you notice that on the front there?

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.540
There's pieces of that panel that prevents that from sliding too far back

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.480
Which is really cool

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.317
When we put in the second mystery compartment the dowel locks that one into place that it can't slide around

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:15.790
This little piece down here

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.019
Acts as a secondary lock to prevent you from getting into that large compartment too early and once that's in place it blends right in

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.220
Then we can take our screwdriver and screw the screw back into place

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.230
The cool thing about this is as it tightens down it actually pulls the panel in so

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.719
Even people who are trying to wiggle the sides aren't necessarily gonna find it right away because it's locked down pretty tight

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.010
And then the screwdriver itself pops right into the side and your box is now

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.700
Self-contained and ready for your next victim

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.380
Now like I said guys these boxes can be used just to hide

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.040
random stuff in your room, or you could actually use them as part of your own mystery escape room

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.220
the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.760
Imagination is the limitation guys I want you to have fun with this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.272
I want you to think outside the box as it were to create something inside the box

00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:00.609
This box is a ton of fun

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.600
It's not too difficult to make I'm going to show you in the next video how to build this thing step by step what measurements to use

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.350
What materials to use and what order to follow to end up with something that looks exactly like what we have here

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.499
Took me about three weeks to prototype this and the escape room with Lowe's they literally spent three months building it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.279
And they only let one group of people go through at one time all that

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.299
For the video that you see in the link in the description so go check it out is a fun experience

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.960
I think you're gonna enjoy it as much as we did. Thanks for joining us project guys

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.540
We'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.820

And I take on the Lowe's Black Friday

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.500
DIY escape room it was an amazing experience we had no idea what to expect once we got locked inside

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.140
So did we make it out in time you can go see for yourself by clicking right here
