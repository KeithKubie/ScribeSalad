00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.540
- [Instructor] So we have a question here

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.080
from the 2015 AP Calculus AB test,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.050
and it says consider the
curve given by the equation

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.300
y to the third minus x y is equal to two.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.660
It can be shown that the
first derivative of y

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.450
with respect to x is equal to that.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.020
So they solve that for us.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.660
And then part c of it,
I skipped parts a and b

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.070
for the sake of this video.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.950
Evaluate the second derivative
of y with respect to x

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.180
at the point on the curve
where x equal negative one

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.470
and y is equal to one.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.630
So pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.090
All right now let's do it together.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.090
And so let me just first write
down the first derivative.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.570
So dy, derivative of y,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.310
with respect to x is equal to

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.360
y over

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.670
three y squared minus x.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.090
Well if we're concerning ourselves

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.090
with the second derivative,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.220
well then we wanna take the
derivative with respect to x

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.620
of both sides of this.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.250
So let's just do that.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.150
Do the derivative operator

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.260
on both sides right over here.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.650
Now on the left hand side,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.590
we of course are going to get
the second derivative of y,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.030
with respect to x.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.610
But what do we get on the right hand side?

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.730
And there's multiple
ways to approach this.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.760
But for something like this,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.360
the quotient rule probably
is the best way to tackle it.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690
I sometimes complain
about the quotient rule

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.440
saying hey, it's just a
variation of the product rule.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.470
But it's actually quite
useful in something like this.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.700
We just have to remind ourselves

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.400
that this is going to be equal to

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.430
the derivative of the numerator

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.640
with respect to x.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.610
And so that's just going
to be derivative of y

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.010
with respect to x

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.690
times the denominator,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.110
three y squared minus x

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.230
Minus the numerator, y,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.180
times the derivative of the
denominator with respect to x.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.080
Well, what's the derivative

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.530
of this denominator with respect to x?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.760
Well the derivative of three
y squared with respect to x

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.880
that's going to be the
derivative of three y squared

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.270
with respect to y,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.390
which is just going to be six y.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.380
I'm just using the power rule there.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.290
Times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.430
All I did just now is I
took the derivative of that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.050
with respect to x.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.680
Which is derivative of
that with respect to y

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.540
times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.250
Comes straight out of the chain rule.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.720
Minus the derivative of
this with respect to x,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.100
which is just going to be equal to one.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.210
All of that over, remember,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.280
we're in the middle of the
quotient rule right over here.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.980
All of that over

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.830
the denominator squared.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.830
All of that over three y
squared minus x, squared.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.190
Now lucky for us,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.090
they want us to evaluate this at a point,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.510
as opposed to have to do a bunch

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.570
of algebraic simplification here.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.650
So we can say,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.800
when,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.270
let me do it over here.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.490
So when, I'll it right here.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.323
When

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.700
x is equal to negative one,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.070
and y is equal to one,

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.530
well first of all, what's the,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.640
what's dy dx going to be?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.760
The derivative of y with respect to x,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.970
let me scroll down a little bit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.130
so we have a little bit more space.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.770
The derivative of y with respect to x

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.770
is going to be equal to one
over three times one squared,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.770
which is just three,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.750
minus negative one.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.580
So that's just going be plus one.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.680
It's going to be equal to 1/4.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.930
And so this whole expression over here,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.340
so I can write the second
derivative of y with respect to x

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.910
is going to be equal to,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.520
well we know that that's
going to be equal to 1/4.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.960
1/4 times three times one squared,

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.640
which is just three,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.610
minus negative one,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.440
so plus one,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.490
minus one,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.960
so I'll just leave that minus out there,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.710
times six times one,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.320
times 1/4.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.153
Let me just write it out.

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:57.280
Six, six times one

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.700
times 1/4

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.770
minus one

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.340
all of that over

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.670
let's see this is going to be

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.180
three times y squared,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.000
y is one, so is just gonna be three,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.980
three minus negative one,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.253
so plus one,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.030
squared.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.230
Now what is this going to be?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.360
And this is just
simplifying something here.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.670
1/4 times four

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.490
that's going to simplify to one.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.180
And let's see, this is
going to be 1 1/2 minus one

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.280
so that's going to be 1/2.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.520
And then we're going to be
have all of that over 16.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.660
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.890
we get a mini drum roll here,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.700
this is going to be
equal to one minus 1/2,

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.400
which is equal to 1/2.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.790
Over 16,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.210
which is the same thing as one over 32.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.603
And we are done.
