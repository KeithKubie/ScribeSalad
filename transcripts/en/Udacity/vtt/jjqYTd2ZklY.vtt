00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's look at another example of pixel operations.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.190
Here I actually want to now up the ante a little bit and look for

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.110
some fun examples, and see what we can learn about how we can

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.470
actually make progress by just combining a bunch of images of the same scene.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.206
Again, taking my example, in my office one day,

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.738
you know, Charles Darwin shows up.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.527
Another time, Albert Einstein is there, and

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:26.253
another day, Leonardo Da Vinci is present.

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:28.146
Now what I'm interested in,

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:33.930
is I want to actually have these three giants of science actually be together.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.240
Well how would I go about doing that?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.830
Well one simple way would be is, again these three pictures are all of course,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.420
of the same size same information, same colors and everything else.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450
That is the same color range and everything.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.540
What I could just do is simply add them.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.810
Well, let's see what happens if that's what we do.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.520
This is simple addition of all three images.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.760
Now if you notice, and now you must have guessed this will happen,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.850
if I just do simple addition, all of a sudden a whole lot of values, and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.950
I do this again, at three different layers of RGB and their intensity values,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.610
and I combine it together, of course a whole lot of values go over 255.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.840
When a whole lot of values go over 255, and I've not done any rescaling here

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.050
majority of the image, of course, becomes white.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.940
What's the best way of analyzing an image like this and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.790
seeing what the dynamic range of an image looks like?

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.180
Remember, we have values that go from zero to 255.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.780
In this case we can imagine the range is between zero and 255, and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.332
most of the pixel intensity, pixel bucket, some around middle.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.480
Same thing is true here, same thing is true here.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.270
But for this one, there are a lot more whites.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
Of course, the best way to analyze this would be to look for a histogram.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.770
The original histogram of this image basically shows that if zero, this is zero,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.970
this is 255, most of the information is in the middle.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.080
Similarly, Albert Einstein, same case here.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.910
Alot of the information, intensities are in the middle.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.180
In this case the same thing is true.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.710
Alot of the intensities are in the middle.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.100
But what happens when you look at this?

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.740
If you notice, a lot of the values are here, but the peak is right here.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.710
And majority by a long shot are the pixels are, of course, white.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.280
That basically tells us yes,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.280
this addition would have required us to do some sort of scaling.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.440
Now of course I could do the scaling now, but most of the information would have

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.730
been lost if, unless I do it at the right time.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.690
One of the ways of doing this,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.520
of course, would be to figure out how to do the combination of these three

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.340
images a bit differently.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.820
One proposal would be to be able to combine the three images, CD, AE and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.130
LD, with a different weighing function in front of it.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.040
So in this one,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.599
I'd do a multiplication of all of the elements individually with 0.34.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.699
The other one with 0.34, and also the third one with 0.34.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.770
And this is what I get.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.798
An interesting thing to note here now,is the three giants of science are,

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:04.298
of course, now transparent a bit.

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:08.301
You know, maybe more appropriately also have a little bit of a ghostly effect,

00:03:08.301 --> 00:03:13.000
to showcase that they are now together, but they are only partially visible.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.500
So how, how can we actually understand what happened here?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.780
So what really happened here was, that by combining these and giving it

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.735
different ratios and the same ratio of 0.34 here, we now merge these things and

00:03:24.735 --> 00:03:28.280
giving it a little bit of mixtures of these intensities.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.980
Now of course let's look at the histogram of this image.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.620
The histogram basically looks, of course,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.330
much similar to the three images that we used to construct this.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.650
Most of the information is in the middle.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.708
There's a little bit more white showing up, but otherwise, it's you know,

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.410
a decent image.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.480
Of course, the artifact does remain.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.540
The three personalities here are a little transparent.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.930
That's the word I was looking for here.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.100
They're a little transparent, because you can see through them.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.000
So that's the thing that we wanted to get out of this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.340
By doing these pixel operations, and by combining them with a number like 0.34

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.900
before I do any of the additions, I've added a little bit of transparency.
