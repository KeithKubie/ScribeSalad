00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.044
Enchant me. Simplify my life. 
Make me amazing.

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:07.270
They're incredibly 
one-sided wedding vows,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.450
and the three key principles
underlying the Android team's

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.860
creative vision for the platform
and the apps that run on it.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.410
As engineers, it can sometimes
be difficult to see past

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.520
our own delight at harnessing 
the power of an SDK

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.710
to bend a machine to our will.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.090
But ultimately, our goal must be
to create that same empowering experience

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.776
for our users.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.822
And we do that by creating apps
that are as aesthetically pleasing

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.410
as they are functional and easy to use.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.240
Users judge the quality of your app
within the first 30 seconds.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.480
It may not be fair, but,
a disproportionate amount

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.733
of that judgement will be based 
not on the functionality,

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.856
but on the visual aesthetics.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:47.280
Does it look polished? 
Does it look professional?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.360
How easy is it to use?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.535
More than just looking pretty, 
the entire user experience

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.330
is critically important.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.505
With 30 seconds to win users over, 
it's critical that that onboarding process,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.680
that time and effort required 
to go from downloading your app

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.720
to performing it's main function,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.960
should be as short 
and frictionless as possible.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
Not only that, but a well designed app 
should evoke a visceral reaction

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.830
that speaks to the subconscious.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.380
It should be fun to use.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.150
It should surprise in delightful ways 
through subtle animations

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.200
and smooth transitions that contribute
to a feeling of power and effortlessness.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.280
It should let users touch 
and interact with objects directly

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720
rather than having 
to use buttons and menus.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.090
And it should use rich imagery 
and pictures in place

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.300
of lots of words and long sentences.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.440
It allows users to customize your app, 
to make it theirs while providing

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.770
beautiful and sensible defaults.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.100
Create something that works like magic,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.910
learning your preference in the context 
provided by the device,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.990
so it never asks users for information
that they've already provided.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.860
Provide simple shortcuts 
to complete complex tasks,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.800
and remember data settings 
and customizations

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.400
making them available 
across every device.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.480
While it's good practice to create 
a familiar and welcoming experience

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.770
by creating a look and feel
that's consistent

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.860
with the platforms, styles and themes,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.140
it's just as important 
to remember that this,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.800
and all the other principles 
I've discussed here,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.870
are really just a starting point 
for your own creative vision.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.100
Deviation from the guidelines 
is encouraged, but when you do so,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.850
deviate with purpose.
