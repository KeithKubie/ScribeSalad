hello and welcome back this week you
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.869
hello and welcome back this week you
learn about object detection this is one

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879
learn about object detection this is one
 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.550
learn about object detection this is one
of the areas of computer vision that's

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
of the areas of computer vision that's
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.919
of the areas of computer vision that's
just exploding and it's working so much

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
just exploding and it's working so much
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.230
just exploding and it's working so much
better than just a couple years ago in

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
better than just a couple years ago in
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.930
better than just a couple years ago in
order to build up to object detection

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
order to build up to object detection
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029
order to build up to object detection
you first learn about object

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
you first learn about object
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130
you first learn about object
localization let's start by defining

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
localization let's start by defining
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.490
localization let's start by defining
what that means you're already familiar

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
what that means you're already familiar
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040
what that means you're already familiar
with the image classification task where

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
with the image classification task where
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990
with the image classification task where
an algorithm looks at this picture and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
an algorithm looks at this picture and
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.419
an algorithm looks at this picture and
might be responsible for saying this is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
might be responsible for saying this is
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.610
might be responsible for saying this is
a car so that was classification the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
a car so that was classification the
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440
a car so that was classification the
problem you learn to build a neural

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
problem you learn to build a neural
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.510
problem you learn to build a neural
network to address later in this video

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
network to address later in this video
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030
network to address later in this video
is classification with localization

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
is classification with localization
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280
is classification with localization
which means not only do you have to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
which means not only do you have to
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.190
which means not only do you have to
label this as say a car but the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
label this as say a car but the
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110
label this as say a car but the
algorithm also is responsible for

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
algorithm also is responsible for
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.110
algorithm also is responsible for
putting a bounding box or drawing a red

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
putting a bounding box or drawing a red
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.720
putting a bounding box or drawing a red
rectangle around the position of the car

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
rectangle around the position of the car
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.939
rectangle around the position of the car
in the image so that's called the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
in the image so that's called the
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.880
in the image so that's called the
classification with localization problem

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
classification with localization problem
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.029
classification with localization problem
where the term localization refers to

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039
where the term localization refers to
 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.130
where the term localization refers to
figuring out where in the picture is the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
figuring out where in the picture is the
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.770
figuring out where in the picture is the
car you've detected later this week you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
car you've detected later this week you
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.109
car you've detected later this week you
then learn about the detection problem

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
then learn about the detection problem
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.230
then learn about the detection problem
where now there might be multiple

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240
where now there might be multiple
 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.060
where now there might be multiple
objects in the picture and you have to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
objects in the picture and you have to
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.359
objects in the picture and you have to
detect them all and localize them all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
detect them all and localize them all
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399
detect them all and localize them all
and if you're doing this for an

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
and if you're doing this for an
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980
and if you're doing this for an
autonomous driving application then you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
autonomous driving application then you
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870
autonomous driving application then you
might need to detect not just other

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
might need to detect not just other
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.359
might need to detect not just other
cause but maybe other pedestrians and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
cause but maybe other pedestrians and
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.910
cause but maybe other pedestrians and
motorcycles and maybe even other objects

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
motorcycles and maybe even other objects
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520
motorcycles and maybe even other objects
so you see that later this week so in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
so you see that later this week so in
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.819
so you see that later this week so in
the terminology we'll use this week the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
the terminology we'll use this week the
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.069
the terminology we'll use this week the
classification and the classification of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
classification and the classification of
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.240
classification and the classification of
localization problems usually have one

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
localization problems usually have one
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.789
localization problems usually have one
object usually one big object in the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
object usually one big object in the
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139
object usually one big object in the
middle of the image that you're trying

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
middle of the image that you're trying
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090
middle of the image that you're trying
to recognize or recognize and localize

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
to recognize or recognize and localize
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910
to recognize or recognize and localize
in contrast in the detection problem

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
in contrast in the detection problem
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.300
in contrast in the detection problem
there can be multiple objects and in

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
there can be multiple objects and in
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550
there can be multiple objects and in
fact maybe even multiple objects of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
fact maybe even multiple objects of
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.219
fact maybe even multiple objects of
different categories within a single

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
different categories within a single
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139
different categories within a single
image so the idea is you've learned

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
image so the idea is you've learned
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359
image so the idea is you've learned
about for image classification will be

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
about for image classification will be
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.980
about for image classification will be
useful for classification with

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
useful for classification with
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020
useful for classification with
localization and then the idea is you

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
localization and then the idea is you
 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570
localization and then the idea is you
learn for localization will then turn

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
learn for localization will then turn
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.119
learn for localization will then turn
out to be useful for detection so let's

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
out to be useful for detection so let's
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.990
out to be useful for detection so let's
start by talking about

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
start by talking about
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.750
start by talking about
with localization you're already

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760
with localization you're already
 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000
with localization you're already
familiar with the image classification

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
familiar with the image classification
 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.790
familiar with the image classification
problem in which you might input a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800
problem in which you might input a
 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.400
problem in which you might input a
picture into a confident with multiple

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410
picture into a confident with multiple
 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.580
picture into a confident with multiple
layers so there's a confident and this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590
layers so there's a confident and this
 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.450
layers so there's a confident and this
results in and this results in a vector

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460
results in and this results in a vector
 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.510
results in and this results in a vector
features that is fed to maybe a soft max

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520
features that is fed to maybe a soft max
 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.280
features that is fed to maybe a soft max
unit that outputs the predicted class so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290
unit that outputs the predicted class so
 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.350
unit that outputs the predicted class so
if you are building a self-driving car

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
if you are building a self-driving car
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.380
if you are building a self-driving car
maybe your object categories are they're

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
maybe your object categories are they're
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.690
maybe your object categories are they're
following where you might have a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
following where you might have a
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.620
following where you might have a
pedestrian or a car or motorcycle or

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
pedestrian or a car or motorcycle or
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.240
pedestrian or a car or motorcycle or
background this means none of the above

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
background this means none of the above
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.640
background this means none of the above
some of this no pedestrian your common

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
some of this no pedestrian your common
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.680
some of this no pedestrian your common
no motorcycle then you may have an

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
no motorcycle then you may have an
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.440
no motorcycle then you may have an
output background so these are your

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
output background so these are your
 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.530
output background so these are your
classes they have a soft max with four

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540
classes they have a soft max with four
 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.830
classes they have a soft max with four
possible outputs so this is the standard

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
possible outputs so this is the standard
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.280
possible outputs so this is the standard
classification pipeline how about if you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
classification pipeline how about if you
 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.850
classification pipeline how about if you
want to localize the car in the image as

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860
want to localize the car in the image as
 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.150
want to localize the car in the image as
well to do that you can change your

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160
well to do that you can change your
 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.720
well to do that you can change your
neural network to have a few more output

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730
neural network to have a few more output
 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.140
neural network to have a few more output
units that output a bounding box so in

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150
units that output a bounding box so in
 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.490
units that output a bounding box so in
particular you can have the neural

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500
particular you can have the neural
 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.699
particular you can have the neural
network output for more numbers and I'm

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709
network output for more numbers and I'm
 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.699
network output for more numbers and I'm
going to call them B X B Y B H and B W

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709
going to call them B X B Y B H and B W
 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.140
going to call them B X B Y B H and B W
and these phone numbers parameterize the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
and these phone numbers parameterize the
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.320
and these phone numbers parameterize the
bounding box of the detected object so

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330
bounding box of the detected object so
 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.570
bounding box of the detected object so
in these videos I'm going to use the

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580
in these videos I'm going to use the
 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.789
in these videos I'm going to use the
notational convention that the upper

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799
notational convention that the upper
 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.370
notational convention that the upper
left of the image I'm going to denote as

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380
left of the image I'm going to denote as
 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.729
left of the image I'm going to denote as
the coordinate 0 0 and the lower right

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739
the coordinate 0 0 and the lower right
 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.870
the coordinate 0 0 and the lower right
is 1 1 so specifying the bounding box

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880
is 1 1 so specifying the bounding box
 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.979
is 1 1 so specifying the bounding box
the red rectangle requires specifying

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989
the red rectangle requires specifying
 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.440
the red rectangle requires specifying
the midpoint so that's the point

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450
the midpoint so that's the point
 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.350
the midpoint so that's the point
B X comma B Y as well as the height that

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360
B X comma B Y as well as the height that
 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.479
B X comma B Y as well as the height that
would be B H as well as the width B W of

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489
would be B H as well as the width B W of
 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.420
would be B H as well as the width B W of
this bounding box so now if your

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430
this bounding box so now if your
 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.390
this bounding box so now if your
training set contains not just the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
training set contains not just the
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.729
training set contains not just the
object class label

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739
object class label
 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.260
object class label
which union that took us trying to

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270
which union that took us trying to
 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.749
which union that took us trying to
predict up here but it also contains

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759
predict up here but it also contains
 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.090
predict up here but it also contains
four additional numbers giving the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100
four additional numbers giving the
 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.430
four additional numbers giving the
bounding box then you can use supervised

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
bounding box then you can use supervised
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.469
bounding box then you can use supervised
learning to make your algorithm outputs

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479
learning to make your algorithm outputs
 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.680
learning to make your algorithm outputs
not just a class label but also the four

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690
not just a class label but also the four
 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.050
not just a class label but also the four
parameters to tell you where is the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060
parameters to tell you where is the
 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.150
parameters to tell you where is the
bounding box of the object you detect it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
bounding box of the object you detect it
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.320
bounding box of the object you detect it
so in this example the idea px might be

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330
so in this example the idea px might be
 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.140
so in this example the idea px might be
about 0.5 because this is about half way

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150
about 0.5 because this is about half way
 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.600
about 0.5 because this is about half way
to the right to the image B Y might be

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610
to the right to the image B Y might be
 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.310
to the right to the image B Y might be
about 0.7 since that's about you know

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320
about 0.7 since that's about you know
 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.100
about 0.7 since that's about you know
maybe 70% of the way down to the image B

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110
maybe 70% of the way down to the image B
 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.730
maybe 70% of the way down to the image B
H might be about 0.3 because the height

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740
H might be about 0.3 because the height
 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.060
H might be about 0.3 because the height
of this red square is about 30% of the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070
of this red square is about 30% of the
 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.850
of this red square is about 30% of the
overall height of the image and BW might

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860
overall height of the image and BW might
 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.510
overall height of the image and BW might
be about 0.4 let's say because the width

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520
be about 0.4 let's say because the width
 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.540
be about 0.4 let's say because the width
of the red box is about 0.4 of the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550
of the red box is about 0.4 of the
 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.050
of the red box is about 0.4 of the
overall width of the entire image so

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060
overall width of the entire image so
 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.089
overall width of the entire image so
let's formalize this a bit more in terms

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099
let's formalize this a bit more in terms
 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.600
let's formalize this a bit more in terms
of how we define the target label Y for

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
of how we define the target label Y for
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.050
of how we define the target label Y for
this as a supervised learning task so

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060
this as a supervised learning task so
 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.240
this as a supervised learning task so
just as a reminder these are our four

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250
just as a reminder these are our four
 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.240
just as a reminder these are our four
classes and the new network now outputs

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250
classes and the new network now outputs
 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.230
classes and the new network now outputs
those four numbers as well as a class

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240
those four numbers as well as a class
 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.890
those four numbers as well as a class
label or maybe probabilities of the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900
label or maybe probabilities of the
 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.529
label or maybe probabilities of the
class labels so let's define the target

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539
class labels so let's define the target
 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.219
class labels so let's define the target
label Y as follows

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229
label Y as follows
 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.890
label Y as follows
it's going to be a vector where the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900
it's going to be a vector where the
 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.459
it's going to be a vector where the
first component PC is going to be is

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:53.469
first component PC is going to be is
 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:57.980
first component PC is going to be is
there an object so if the object is

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990
there an object so if the object is
 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.709
there an object so if the object is
classes 1 2 or 3 PC will be equal to 1

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719
classes 1 2 or 3 PC will be equal to 1
 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.649
classes 1 2 or 3 PC will be equal to 1
and if is the background class so if

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659
and if is the background class so if
 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.060
and if is the background class so if
it's none of the objects you trying to

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070
it's none of the objects you trying to
 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.230
it's none of the objects you trying to
detect then PC will be 0 and PC you can

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240
detect then PC will be 0 and PC you can
 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.240
detect then PC will be 0 and PC you can
think of that as standing for the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250
think of that as standing for the
 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.969
think of that as standing for the
probability that there's a object

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979
probability that there's a object
 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.920
probability that there's a object
probability that one of the classes

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930
probability that one of the classes
 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.409
probability that one of the classes
you're trying to detect is there so

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419
you're trying to detect is there so
 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.360
you're trying to detect is there so
something other than the background

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370
something other than the background
 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.770
something other than the background
class next if there is an object then

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780
class next if there is an object then
 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.920
class next if there is an object then
you wanted to output B X B Y B H

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930
you wanted to output B X B Y B H
 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.790
you wanted to output B X B Y B H
and BW the bounding box for the object

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800
and BW the bounding box for the object
 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.150
and BW the bounding box for the object
you detect it and finally you if there

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160
you detect it and finally you if there
 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.150
you detect it and finally you if there
is an object so if PC is equal to one

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160
is an object so if PC is equal to one
 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.890
is an object so if PC is equal to one
you wanted to also output c1 c2 and c3

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900
you wanted to also output c1 c2 and c3
 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.520
you wanted to also output c1 c2 and c3
which tells it is it the class 1 class 2

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530
which tells it is it the class 1 class 2
 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.129
which tells it is it the class 1 class 2
or class 3 so is it a pedestrian a car

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139
or class 3 so is it a pedestrian a car
 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.610
or class 3 so is it a pedestrian a car
or a motorcycle and remember in the

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620
or a motorcycle and remember in the
 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.770
or a motorcycle and remember in the
problem we're addressing we assume that

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780
problem we're addressing we assume that
 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.890
problem we're addressing we assume that
your image has only one object so and

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900
your image has only one object so and
 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.469
your image has only one object so and
most one of these objects appears in the

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479
most one of these objects appears in the
 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.390
most one of these objects appears in the
picture in this classification with

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400
picture in this classification with
 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.480
picture in this classification with
localization problem so let's go through

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490
localization problem so let's go through
 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.540
localization problem so let's go through
a couple examples if this is a training

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550
a couple examples if this is a training
 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.360
a couple examples if this is a training
set image so that is X then Y will be

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370
set image so that is X then Y will be
 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.490
set image so that is X then Y will be
the first component PC will be equal to

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500
the first component PC will be equal to
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.659
the first component PC will be equal to
1 because there is an object then b XB y

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669
1 because there is an object then b XB y
 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.300
1 because there is an object then b XB y
bh + BW will specify the bounding box so

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310
bh + BW will specify the bounding box so
 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.439
bh + BW will specify the bounding box so
your label training set

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449
your label training set
 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.659
your label training set
we'll need bounding boxes in the labels

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:31.669
we'll need bounding boxes in the labels
 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.240
we'll need bounding boxes in the labels
and then finally this is a car so it's

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.250
and then finally this is a car so it's
 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.750
and then finally this is a car so it's
close to so C 1 will be 0 because it's

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760
close to so C 1 will be 0 because it's
 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.330
close to so C 1 will be 0 because it's
not a pedestrian C 2 B 1 because it is a

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340
not a pedestrian C 2 B 1 because it is a
 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.360
not a pedestrian C 2 B 1 because it is a
car C 3 will be 0 since it's not a

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370
car C 3 will be 0 since it's not a
 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.260
car C 3 will be 0 since it's not a
motorcycle

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270
motorcycle
 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.610
motorcycle
so among C 1 C 2 C 3 at most one of them

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620
so among C 1 C 2 C 3 at most one of them
 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.700
so among C 1 C 2 C 3 at most one of them
should be equal to 1 so that's if there

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710
should be equal to 1 so that's if there
 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.640
should be equal to 1 so that's if there
is an object in the image 1 of this no

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.650
is an object in the image 1 of this no
 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.320
is an object in the image 1 of this no
object in the image whether we have a

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.330

training example where X is equal to
 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:04.390
training example where X is equal to
that in this case PC will be equal to 0

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400
that in this case PC will be equal to 0
 

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.560
that in this case PC will be equal to 0

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.570
and the rest of the elements of this
 

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.110
and the rest of the elements of this
will be don't cares so I'm going to

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120
will be don't cares so I'm going to
 

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.050
will be don't cares so I'm going to
write question marks in all of them so

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.060
write question marks in all of them so
 

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.649
write question marks in all of them so
this is a don't care because if there is

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:17.659
this is a don't care because if there is
 

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.839
this is a don't care because if there is
no object in this image then you don't

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:19.849
no object in this image then you don't
 

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:21.640
no object in this image then you don't
care what bounding box the neural

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:21.650
care what bounding box the neural
 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.980
care what bounding box the neural

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.319
finally next let's describe the loss
function you use to train the neural

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:53.329
function you use to train the neural
 

00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:55.900
function you use to train the neural
network so the ground truth label was y

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:55.910
network so the ground truth label was y
 

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.480
network so the ground truth label was y
and in your network outputs some Y hat

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:58.490
and in your network outputs some Y hat
 

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.689
and in your network outputs some Y hat
what should be the law speed well if

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:01.699
what should be the law speed well if
 

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:04.660
what should be the law speed well if
you're using squared error then the loss

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:04.670
you're using squared error then the loss
 

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:11.860
you're using squared error then the loss
can be y1 hat minus y1 squared plus y2

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:11.870
can be y1 hat minus y1 squared plus y2
 

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.480
can be y1 hat minus y1 squared plus y2
hats minus y2 squared plus dot dot plus

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.490
hats minus y2 squared plus dot dot plus
 

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:21.220

y8 hat minus y 8 squared notice that Y

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.230
y8 hat minus y 8 squared notice that Y
 

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.569
y8 hat minus y 8 squared notice that Y
here has 8 components so that goes from

00:09:24.569 --> 00:09:24.579
here has 8 components so that goes from
 

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:26.949
here has 8 components so that goes from
sum of the squares of the difference of

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959
sum of the squares of the difference of
 

00:09:26.959 --> 00:09:31.509
sum of the squares of the difference of
the elements and that's the loss if y1

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519
the elements and that's the loss if y1
 

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:34.930
the elements and that's the loss if y1
is equal to 1 so that's the case where

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:34.940
is equal to 1 so that's the case where
 

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.829
is equal to 1 so that's the case where
there is an object so y1 is equal to PC

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839
there is an object so y1 is equal to PC
 

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:41.499
there is an object so y1 is equal to PC
right so PC is equal to 1 that is if

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:41.509
right so PC is equal to 1 that is if
 

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:44.019
right so PC is equal to 1 that is if
there is an object in the image then the

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:44.029
there is an object in the image then the
 

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:45.999
there is an object in the image then the
loss can be the sum of squares over all

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:46.009
loss can be the sum of squares over all
 

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:49.480
loss can be the sum of squares over all
the different elements the other case is

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:49.490
the different elements the other case is
 

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:55.990
the different elements the other case is
if y1 is equal to 0 so that's if this PC

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000
if y1 is equal to 0 so that's if this PC
 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.199
if y1 is equal to 0 so that's if this PC
is equal to 0 in that case the loss can

00:09:59.199 --> 00:09:59.209
is equal to 0 in that case the loss can
 

00:09:59.209 --> 00:10:05.230
is equal to 0 in that case the loss can
be just y1 hat minus y1 squared because

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240
be just y1 hat minus y1 squared because
 

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.410
be just y1 hat minus y1 squared because
in that second case all the rest of the

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:08.420
in that second case all the rest of the
 

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.650
in that second case all the rest of the
components are don't care us and so all

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:11.660
components are don't care us and so all
 

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.740
components are don't care us and so all
you care about is how accurately is the

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:14.750
you care about is how accurately is the
 

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.280
you care about is how accurately is the
neural network outputting PC in that

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.290
neural network outputting PC in that
 

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.900
neural network outputting PC in that
case so just a recap if y1 is equal to 1

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:21.910
case so just a recap if y1 is equal to 1
 

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.759
case so just a recap if y1 is equal to 1
that's this case then you can use the

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:24.769
that's this case then you can use the
 

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:26.590
that's this case then you can use the
squared error to penalise squared

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600
squared error to penalise squared
 

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.920
squared error to penalise squared
deviation from the predictor than the

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:29.930
deviation from the predictor than the
 

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.379
deviation from the predictor than the
actual outputs for all eight components

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:32.389
actual outputs for all eight components
 

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.670
actual outputs for all eight components
whereas if y1 is equal to 0 then you

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680
whereas if y1 is equal to 0 then you
 

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.470
whereas if y1 is equal to 0 then you
know the second to the eighth components

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480
know the second to the eighth components
 

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.329
know the second to the eighth components
that don't care so all you care about is

00:10:40.329 --> 00:10:40.339
that don't care so all you care about is
 

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.540
that don't care so all you care about is
how accurately is your neural network

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.550
how accurately is your neural network
 

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:48.160
how accurately is your neural network
estimating y1 which is equal to PC and

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.170

like the logistic regression loss

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:18.529
like the logistic regression loss
 

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:20.679
like the logistic regression loss
although even if you use squared error

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:20.689
although even if you use squared error
 

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:23.650
