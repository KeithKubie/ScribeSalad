00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is my answer, I call row plays on the row and that gives me a set of results

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which are of the form i--index into the row--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and a word, and I can't just add that into my results set,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because that doesn't tell me what row number I'm in.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Instead, I want to add the tuple i and j. I've already got the row number j.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Add the tuple of the position i, j along with the word into the results.

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's all we have to do.
