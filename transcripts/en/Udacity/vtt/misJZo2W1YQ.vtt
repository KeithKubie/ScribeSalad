00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.000
For the first of these, a of F equals F over 10, the name of the function is a,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.640
the input is the letter capital F, and the output is F over 10.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.820
This function may look a little bit funny because we haven't seen anything in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
this form, really, or with these letters as variables. But this function does

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.750
describe something really important. This describes how the acceleration of

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.430
an object depends on the force that's been exerted on the object.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.100
Now let's look at the last function down here. The name of the function is P,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.520
the input is the variable c and the output is negative 10c squared plus 100c.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.940
This looks pretty reminiscent of the one of the equations we used to the grant

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.490
where profit depended on cost. Or rather, the price that he charged customers.
