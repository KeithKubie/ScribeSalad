1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,063
Okay.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,160
So last time we were talking about
exponents and how statistics gives rise to

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:10,530
them. And we looked last time
that the Boltzmann factor,

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,570
that e to the minus h over our
tea or Delta h over our tea,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,340
which tells you the, uh, the temperature
dependence of the equilibrium constant.

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,250
It gives you the equilibrium constant.
You mean remember at room temperature,

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,930
three fourths, a Delta, h
and kilocalories, right.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,140
And we saw last time that that comes
from counting arrangements of a fixed

9
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,290
number of energy bits. And the
important thing is that they're random,

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,650
that all of them are equally likely.
Let's see, I get to get there. Okay.

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,650
Uh, that has interesting
philosophical implications.

12
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,760
I think you remember at the start of the
course we were talking about types of

13
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:54,630
authority. Uh, and in
particular, I remember in Hamlet,

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,820
a act five scene too.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,660
He says there's a divinity
that shapes our ends.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,200
So this was a traditional view in society.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,540
But then this guy came along in 1851,
you might know who that is,

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,230
Charles Darwin with the
origin of the species.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,670
So there was conflict between the
religious fundamentalists and Darwin's

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,190
Darwinists that continues to this day.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,290
But I think they really missed the point
because Darwin had the idea that things

22
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:30,240
were developing and getting better all
the time, right? So there's a certain,

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,010
uh, compatibility between that and the
sensibilities of the fundamentalist,

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,980
but also not too long from them.

25
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,680
This guy came along Boltzmann and he said,

26
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,860
everything is driven just by randomness.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,360
There's no goal for everything that
should be the real conflict between

28
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,970
religious fundamentalists
in science is Boltzmann.

29
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:54,890
But so few people understand what
Boltzmann did that there's no, uh,

30
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,620
reason for the conflict.
At any rate,

31
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,130
we saw where the Boltzmann factor
came from in terms of statistics.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,760
Then there's the entropy factor,
which we saw last time.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,680
And notice that as I've written it
here in the top, the top equation,

34
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:14,430
the one with Boltzmann, there's an
r and the one on the bottom has a k.

35
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,070
Sometimes you see ours
and sometimes seem ks.

36
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,810
They're actually the same thing thatK is,

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,810
if you measure the energy
per molecule and are,

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,390
is if you measure the energy per mole.

39
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,860
So all you have is Avogadro's number
is included in one of them and not the

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,360
other. They're really the same thing,
these two exponentials. But at any rate,

41
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,350
we can cancel the teas and know that that
e to the s over k is accounting number

42
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,880
w the number of molecular
structures being grouped.

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,080
And we saw that at the end of the last
time in terms of Gauche versus anti

44
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,370
butane.
And remember that s equals log k,

45
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,870
which is the same equation,

46
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,350
just the on each side
is on Boltzmann's tomb.

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh, but let's look at one more
example in terms of cyclohexane.

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,740
You remember the Cyclohexane con farmers?

49
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,770
I need to turn this light out and this
one on there. That one's on. Okay.

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,880
Remember the cyclohexane con farmers.
If it's a chair,

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
it's very rigid. Why
is it rigid? Remember,

52
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:29,870
why is it hard to twist with
respect to the molecular model?

53
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:31,010
Why is it hard to twist?

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,433
Eric?

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,270
What ma?

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,970
Why does this particular model in which
rotation around bonds is completely free?

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,350
Why is it hard to rotate, to go
like this? Why is there a click?

58
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,443
Pardon me.

59
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,910
Oh, it's the, it's the bending angle
that has to flatten out when you do this.

60
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:58,970
Remember we talked about that. But
anyhow, this one is very rigid,

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,940
but if you click it into the boat,

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,920
then it's actually a twist boat that
turns to all sorts of structures ever so

63
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:07,754
easily.

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,240
So there are many more accessible
structures for a boat than there are for a

65
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:19,100
chair. The chair, you have
this one and you have this one,

66
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,010
right? But for a boat or a twisted or
the flexible form, as it's often called,

67
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,500
you have lots and lots
of accessible structures.

68
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,420
What's that going to
mean in terms of entropy?

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,050
That there are many more structures.

70
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:35,120
You're going to account
for the flexible form,

71
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,670
then you count for the chair
form the rigid form. Okay.

72
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,500
So if we look at, this is a picture
of the, of the energy with the,

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,600
the chair at the minimum of energy.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,500
The twist boat is five and
a half kilocalories above,

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,120
but it has very small barriers
among different twists, boat forms.

76
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,860
So we would say there are few
structures that are Cyclo that our chair

77
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:05,240
cyclohexane,
but many structures that are the boat.

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,780
And furthermore, if we look at
it in terms of quantum mechanics,

79
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:12,590
which is the real way to do it,
we noticed that when there's a steep,

80
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:17,180
stiff valley, there are very few
energy levels that are accessible,

81
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,800
right? But if the, if the barriers
are low, then there are many,

82
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,030
many quantum levels.

83
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,620
So you count many more quantum levels
for the flexible form than you do for the

84
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,454
chair form.

85
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,420
What that means is from whether they're
red classical view or the green quantum

86
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:38,840
view, there's a big statistical
factor and entropy factor,

87
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,080
which turns out to be about seven fold
favoring the twist boat over the chair.

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,700
The chair is still favored.

89
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,030
It's favored because of
energy that Boltzmann factor
III to the delta h over t,

90
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,210
but this reduces that bias in favor of
the by witches would otherwise be 10 to

91
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,710
the three fourths of 5.5 right?

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,330
It reduces it by about a factor of 2000
so the equilibrium constant is only

93
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,790
14,000 instead of 14,000.

94
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,560
It reduces it by a factor of
seven to make it 2000. Okay,

95
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:16,394
so that's,

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,110
but so we've been talking about
entropy here in statistical terms,

97
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:25,100
but remember earlier we talked about
the fact that physical chemists actually

98
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:29,360
measure entropy is something experimental,
not just accounting exercise.

99
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,920
Uh, and they do it beginning
with something that's as
close as possible to zero

100
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,870
Kelvin. Because if you have a perfectly
ordered crystal at zero Kelvin,

101
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,890
then there's only one structure
you're talking about, right?

102
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,890
So the entropy is the log of one,

103
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,300
which is zero or log of
one over r times R. Okay?

104
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,300
So it's zero or, but then
as you warm it up, you,

105
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,740
you, you put, as you put heat in,

106
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,840
you measure the increase in this thing
called entropy by how much heat you put

107
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,500
in at each temperature as you warm up.
And we talked about that already.

108
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,070
And you'll notice how qualitatively how
this works is that floppy molecules like

109
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:17,630
the flexible form of cyclohexane that
have many closely spaced energy levels

110
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,780
absorb more energy and they absorb it
at lower temperatures and thus they have

111
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,130
more entropy when they get warmed.

112
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,110
So whether you do it experimentally by
measuring the heat that gets absorbed or

113
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,570
whether you measure it by
counting quantum states,

114
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:36,920
you get the same result that a floppy
molecule is favored. In terms of entropy,

115
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,070
we talked about that too when we were
talking about the barrier to ethane

116
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,170
rotation.
Okay,

117
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:47,171
so we've looked at the Boltzmann factor
and this entropy factor that come from

118
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:53,240
counting, noticed it in the second
case where truly we should be counting,

119
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,120
not structures but quantum states.

120
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,590
How many states are there that count and
if you want to be really, really picky,

121
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,520
you say the weighted number of quantum
states cause ones that are higher in

122
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,490
energy or not as populated as
ones that are lower in energy,

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,850
but we don't have to worry about that.
Now at any rate,

124
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,390
those two factors taken together are
what gives the equilibrium constants,

125
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:18,050
which was we said before is is uh,

126
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,140
e to the minus Delta g free energy.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,040
That means it's both an vow be heat
and entropy, this counting thing,

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,560
but there's more to it than that.

129
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,650
There's also the statistics involved in
the law of mass action and that comes

130
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,880
from counting molecules per
volume that is concentration.

131
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,400
So you can count energy,

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,500
you can count quantum states and
you can count molecules per volume.

133
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,990
This is very easily understood.

134
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,050
The way it developed experimentally is
that in the late 17 hundreds there was an

135
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:01,290
attempt to assemble a hierarchy of
affinities that some elements had more

136
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,520
affinity than others.

137
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,750
So if you had a compound that involve
one element and mixed it with an element

138
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,910
that had higher affinity,

139
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:12,690
that one with higher affinity would take
away molecules from the one with lower

140
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:13,524
affinity.

141
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,650
But then it was found in the early 18
hundreds that it's doesn't always go in

142
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:24,510
that direction because concentrations
can change and make things go the wrong

143
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:28,140
way towards something
that's a very low affinity.

144
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,410
If it has very high concentration and
by the middle 18 hundreds this was

145
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:38,421
formulated as an equilibrium constant
k which was understood as the balance

146
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:42,210
between forward reactions
and reverse reactions.

147
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,670
You've seen that k one over k minus
one is the big equilibrium constant.

148
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,370
So concentration comes into it in this
thing called the law of mass action.

149
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,710
If you have two ways that can go to a two,

150
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,450
then you have this equilibrium constant
written as the concentration of a two

151
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,780
divided by the concentration of a squared.

152
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,250
Now why the exponent?

153
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,350
Where does that exponent to come from?
And sometimes it's three. Remember again,

154
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:18,130
it's statistical and very, very
easy to see. Here I used the uh,

155
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,180
Xcel to place a bunch of circles
randomly on a two dimensional plot.

156
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,790
So it put 50 of these circles down and
we're going to count as dimers things

157
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,970
where they overlap, where they
touch one another. Okay? So there's,

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,380
if you have 50 particles,

159
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,430
this particular realization
of randomness gave one dimer,

160
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,270
but suppose we add another 50 right
now in addition to the original dimer,

161
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,780
there are eight more.
Okay?

162
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,080
And now suppose I add another 50 now
there are 19 dimers or another 50 now

163
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,670
they're 35 dimers or another
50 and now they're 59 dimers.

164
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Now let's make a plot of how many
dimers there are compared to how many

165
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:08,330
particles there are.
Undying one.

166
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,180
So there's a number of particles and the
number of dimers plotted the data there

167
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,100
and you see what it is.

168
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,400
It's a parabola that the number of diapers
is proportional to the square of the

169
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:24,660
number of monomers. Now
why should that be? So

170
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,580
it's because as you
increase the concentration,

171
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,290
you increase the number of units there.
Obviously that's by definition,

172
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,890
but you also increase the fraction of
the units that have a near neighbor that

173
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:44,100
are touching. So not only do you
increase the number that could be dimers,

174
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,250
you increase the fraction that are dimers.

175
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,260
So there are two ways in which increasing
the concentration increases the dimer,

176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,900
right? So it's a square. That's
where the exponent comes in.

177
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,750
It's purely statistical
for random distribution.

178
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,980
And then of course an energy can
enter in entropy can enter in.

179
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,160
That will change the k.
But the but the,

180
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,490
but the exponent on p right is due
just to this accounting procedure.

181
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,660
So you increase both the number
and the fraction that are dimers.

182
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,300
Okay. So now we know about equilibrium
statistics and exponents. Uh,

183
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,510
we have particle distribution,
that's the law of mass action.

184
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,410
That's that square we just talked about.
We have energy distribution,

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,780
Delta h,
the Boltzmann factor,

186
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,730
and we have counting of quantum
states, which has to do with with, uh,

187
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,920
entropy.
Okay,

188
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,270
so free energy determines what
equilibrium is. What can happen,

189
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,450
right? And that Delta g remember,
includes both entropy and energy,

190
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,340
but it doesn't tell you at all
how quickly it will happen,

191
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,540
what the kinetics of the reaction
are. So we'd, for that purpose,

192
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,350
we're going to try visualizing reactions
to see if we can get a picture of what

193
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,110
determines rates. And we're going
to look at two kinds of things.

194
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,330
We're going to look at classical
trajectories and at the potential energy

195
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,350
surface and collective concepts.
So first,

196
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,990
let's start with the
potential energy surface.

197
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,270
Here's a very simple
potential energy surface.

198
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:22,630
It's just the two dimensional diagram.
So we've seen it before.

199
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,420
We plot the distance
between two atoms, a, B,

200
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,940
and the potential energy as
a function of the distance.

201
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:32,110
So this is a more type curve. Uh, okay.

202
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:37,111
So we put a ball on it and let that ball
roll to map out different distances is

203
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:39,430
it moves.

204
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,360
That's the horizontal axis and the
energy corresponding to that distance.

205
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,510
So it rolls back and forth,
right?

206
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,220
Mapping out the change in geometry
horizontally and the change in energy

207
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,780
vertically. Now we're gonna look
at a three dimensional surface,

208
00:13:55,781 --> 00:14:00,781
or actually two geometrical dimensions
plus the third dimension coming out at

209
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,180
you.

210
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,130
The contours have to do with potential
energy of three particles now,

211
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,250
but in order to describe the
position to three particles,

212
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,360
you need three distances, one to two,
two to three and three to one, right?

213
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:15,670
So that's too many
dimensions to plot this way.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,490
So we're going to assume
that they're all on a line.

215
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,660
So we only have the distance between
one and two and the distance between two

216
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,494
and three.

217
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,950
So two coordinates will tell you what
the arrangement of those three atoms are,

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,030
if, if they're in just one
dimension. Okay? So linear,

219
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:37,030
try atomic ABC.
On the horizontal distance,

220
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:41,830
we have the distance a to B
on the vertical axis, axis
B to c, and the contours.

221
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:46,630
Tell us how low the energy is. The
darker the lower the energy. Okay.

222
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,810
Uh, so, uh, this specifies the structure.

223
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:54,050
So the position of a specifies
not the position of an Adam,

224
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,850
but the position of a set of Adams,
right? So as we move one point around,

225
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,150
we're moving to Adams are
changing to distances,

226
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,310
but we can denote it with one point
here into geometric dimensions. Okay.

227
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,120
So let's look at several regions.
Let's look at that valley on the right.

228
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,650
What is that valley? What does,
when the point is in that valley,

229
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,270
what's it describing?

230
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,390
It says that the distance
between a and B is large, right?

231
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,250
So a, as far away from B, what
does it say about the BC distance?

232
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,610
It's short.
It's the normal distance for IBC molecule.

233
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:39,800
So what is it when a point is in that
valley, what geometry is it describing?

234
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,580
It's describing a BC molecule with an
a Adam at a great distance from it.

235
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,800
Depending on how far
out we go to the right.

236
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,120
Does everybody see that one position
of the point tells us where both all,

237
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,610
where all three atoms are, as long
as they're on a line. Okay. Now,

238
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,410
how about up there on that plateau?
What's happening there?

239
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,900
What's the physical system?
Maria, what do you say?

240
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,070
Yeah, the atoms are all
separate from one another.

241
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,560
Be is c as far from B and a as far from B.
So there are,

242
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,850
the atoms are separated
and it's high in energy.

243
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,430
You're not surprised that it
takes energy to pull them apart.

244
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,530
And there is a cliff, right?
If this were a hiking map,

245
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:30,030
that would be a cliff. What does that
cliff mean? Why is there a cliff there?

246
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,553
Okay,

247
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
Greg,
what do you say?

248
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,780
Why is there a cliff shown there?
What's the geometry that,

249
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,880
that that points in that region described?

250
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:43,710
Yeah.

251
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,570
What's close together is a close to be

252
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,420
a close to be.
I couldn't hear no,

253
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,500
here's the distance ab it's way out
there where that cliff is. Right?

254
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,810
So a is far away,
but what's happening,

255
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,650
B and c are getting very
close to one another,

256
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:05,640
so that's a collision between B and c
much shorter than their bond distance.

257
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,970
Right there being scrunched together in
that region and that's why the energy

258
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:13,050
goes up very rapidly because they're
running into one another closer than they

259
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:13,770
liked to be.

260
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,390
There's a ridge right
as you go down there.

261
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:19,141
If you are hiking,

262
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:22,740
that would be a ridge and there's a
special point on the ridge which is marked

263
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,400
by the Red Cross. What would you
call that if you were hiking,

264
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,690
if you are in this yet,

265
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,570
the valley that's labeled yellow and
you were thinking of getting the other

266
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:34,410
valley, what would you call
that cross if you are hiking,

267
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,210
not a peak, right? It comes,

268
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,840
he gets high as it gets close to me here
and it gets high out on the plateau.

269
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:46,840
It's actually low as we go along the line,

270
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,080
but it's high as we go to the line. What
would you call that if you were hiking?

271
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,190
Some of you must hike.

272
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:56,463
Pardon me?

273
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,740
It's a pass between one valley.
On the other valley.

274
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,350
That's the way you would go
if you were hiking. Right?

275
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,660
So you don't have to climb so high.
Okay,

276
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,020
so it's a pass or in chemistry we call
it a transition state or a transition

277
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,560
structure and it's like a potato chip,
right?

278
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,010
It's a minimum in one
direction along the ridge,

279
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,350
but it's a maximum in the aisle in the
path between the two valleys. Okay,

280
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,570
so that's a very special point. Okay.
Now let's look at this a little closer.

281
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:32,150
Suppose we sliced the surface.

282
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,500
We took a knife and slice that along
the red line there horizontally and then

283
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:40,790
folded it back to look at
the cross section. Does
everybody see what I'm saying?

284
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,830
What would the cross section look like?

285
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,730
It's exactly that one we looked at before.

286
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,480
So that involves stretching a and B
with c so far away that it's irrelevant,

287
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,550
right? So it's just stretching a
diatomic molecule or if we sliced,

288
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,230
so that's vibration of Ab with
the distant spectator of c.

289
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,120
Okay. Now suppose we sliced it that
way and folded back. Now what is it?

290
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,653
All right,

291
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,330
it's a vibrating BC
molecule with a far away,

292
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,750
right? So again, by
choosing points on this,

293
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:23,950
we can describe any geometry of these
three points we want as long as they're on

294
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:26,740
a line.
But a single point is a whole structure.

295
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,490
Okay?
Now let's look at a trajectory.

296
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:36,970
We roll a ball on this surface
and it rolls up toward the past,

297
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:39,070
but it doesn't make it
and comes back like that.

298
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,520
So that's a trajectory
that was unreactive.

299
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,540
It didn't make it into the product of
alley, it didn't get across the ridge.

300
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,390
And physically what it means is that a
gets closer to BC while BC is vibrating,

301
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,250
it's moving up and down,
right?

302
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:02,251
So BC is vibrating a comes in
and then bounces off again,

303
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,221
right?

304
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:08,221
So it was an unsuccessful attempt
of a to take be away from C

305
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,620
or suppose we do this one,

306
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,630
hey approaches and now see
flies away from vibrating ab.

307
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,280
Does everybody see that? Want
me to say it again? Right?

308
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,540
So as it comes along, B and c are standing
still. It's not moving vertically,

309
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,550
right? So the BNC or at
their normal distance, their
standard distance a comes in,

310
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,090
Watson into it, gets really
close, runs into that cliff,

311
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,500
really close to be. This
is the distance Ab, right?

312
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,710
And then it starts a B is vibrating and
see as getting far away as it goes down

313
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,600
the product valley.

314
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,830
So that's a reactive trajectory where the
first trajectory was unreactive notice

315
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:02,431
that this is classical rolling a marble
on the thing because a was approaching a

316
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,770
non vibrating BC.

317
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,350
We know from quantum mechanics that
BC can't just sit there, BC vibrates.

318
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,690
So that's not a realistic trajectory.

319
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,410
It's a classical model of a
quantum mechanical system.

320
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,970
Now people have made surfaces like
that for real systems like h three one

321
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:30,190
hydrogen atom attacking a
hydrogen molecule and taking
one of the hydrogens away.

322
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,750
Here it is.
This was drawn.

323
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:35,010
This is the first surface that
was drawn that I know of, uh,

324
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,050
by Henry ironing at Princeton in 1935
and it had some that has crazy angles.

325
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:46,381
And the reason it has that angle is so
that a marble rolling on it will behave

326
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,350
according to the way the masses of the
thing so that the kinetics kinematics are

327
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:57,850
exactly right. So that it really
does do the proper classical thing.

328
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:02,620
If you roll a marble on here, it will
trace Newton's laws of motion for this.

329
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,590
Uh, this, uh, h three system.

330
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,210
One thing that's unrealistic about it is
that there's a minimum at the near the

331
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,080
transition state.

332
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:14,680
There's a little lake up there that's
just an artifact that came from the

333
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,980
equation. He used to approximate
the surface. It's not real.

334
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,060
There actually is a potato chip,
not a lake up there at the past.

335
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,140
Some people have called it lake ironing.
Okay.

336
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,770
But here's a more
complicated surface that was,

337
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:34,771
it says it was done by c par in
his Phd thesis at Cal Tech In 1969.

338
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,920
This is for h h br.

339
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,630
Again linear but hydrogen atom attacking
Hbr to take away it's hydrogen.

340
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,850
And this,

341
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,030
this describes the construction of a
model based on that surface and actual

342
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:56,320
physical model on which you can
roll marbles. Right? So here it is.

343
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,520
And then the dimensions,

344
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:01,960
that one inch corresponds to 1.4
inches is an angst drum and so on.

345
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,820
So they actually constructed physical
models to do this. And as it happens,

346
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,680
we have that physical model here.

347
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,253
Uh

348
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,830
Oh here.
Yeah,

349
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,943
right.

350
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
This is it. And let's see,
I've got to change the

351
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,123
excellent.

352
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,530
Okay. And we have some marbles. So
notice what's different about this one.

353
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:32,940
Here's, I'll hold it up so you can
see it. There's the surface, right?

354
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,510
And here's a crow, a
slice through one, right?

355
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,690
That's h two with this
valley is h two with the BR.

356
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,360
Adam. This valley is
HBR with an h at, right?

357
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,020
So we can try rolling balls
and see what happens here.

358
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,413
Okay.

359
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,560
So here I am far away the h
atom as far away from Hbr.

360
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,720
And I do that and it's vibrating,
but it doesn't succeed. Right?

361
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,650
I can do it a little bit more.
Most reactions aren't,

362
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,810
aren't, uh, successful.

363
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,260
Oh, hellos. All right.

364
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,940
And is it comes out,

365
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:22,080
it may be vibrating when it comes out
or it may not be vibrating when it goes,

366
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,320
Ooh. What's the, what's the cross?

367
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,530
The cross is that transition structure,
right? Or the transition state.

368
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,783
Yeah.

369
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,310
Right. So the, so you could
do every possible trajectory.

370
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:46,311
You could have different velocities at
which a is colliding with BC and you can

371
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:51,690
have different, uh, amounts of vibration
and different phases of vibration.

372
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,840
I could start it going this way,
or I can start it going this way.

373
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,690
And if I did every possible one of those,

374
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,100
then I could average over all of them
and see how many of them succeeded.

375
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,410
Right. In reaction. And that would allow
me to predict the rate of this process.

376
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:10,680
We'll turn off the wrong light.
Okay.

377
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,600
So people have done that kind of thing.

378
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,540
But studying lots of random
trajectories provides too much detail.

379
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,040
No one really cares about all
those individual trajectories.

380
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,540
What you care about is
what fraction succeed.

381
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,350
And if you could do that in a simpler
way than rolling it a zillion times and

382
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:34,230
averaging,
then that would be a better approach.

383
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,530
So it's better to summarize this thing
statistically using collective terms,

384
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:42,090
not individual pads,

385
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,050
but collective terms such
as enthalpy and entropy.

386
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,110
And you can do it in this way.
Okay?

387
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:53,310
You have a steepest
descent path from the past.

388
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,260
Suppose you slice this surface with a
knife perpendicular to the screen along

389
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:02,640
that path and then fold it out to make
it flat and look at the Cross section of

390
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:07,050
it. Okay? And now we'll tip
it up and it looks like that.

391
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,680
Does everybody see how it looks like that?
Hey,

392
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:14,670
we sliced along the path that goes
up over the transition state. Okay,

393
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:18,150
so we have potential energy as a
function of distance along the reaction

394
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:22,470
coordinate. But of course we're trying to
summarize a whole bunch of things here,

395
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:26,700
not nothing roles exactly along that path,
right?

396
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:30,510
So we're going to lose some of
the specificity of the reaction.

397
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,710
Coordinate by grouping things.
We're not going to take a trajectory,

398
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:37,350
but a sequence of three species.

399
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,020
The first species is
the starting material.

400
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,740
The second species is the transition state
and the third species is the product.

401
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,060
And now instead of having an explicit
meaning for every geometry along that

402
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:55,350
path, what we're going to do is associate
each of those starting materials,

403
00:26:55,351 --> 00:27:00,351
transition state and products with a
certain end therapy and a certain entropy

404
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,490
that is a certain free energy.

405
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,710
So we have instead we're going to plot
free energy vertically, incorporate,

406
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,670
uh,

407
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,670
incorporate entropy as that is how loose
these things are as well as an therapy,

408
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:18,090
their energy. And now we just
have three values of free energy,

409
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:20,340
the free energy of the starting material,
three energy,

410
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:25,140
the transition state free energy of
the product. And now we can use those.

411
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,700
And so, but we've lost a
lot of specificity in what
the reaction coordinate is.

412
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,040
It's just a sequence.
Now have three species,

413
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,270
but we can now use free energy
to determine what can happen.

414
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,030
We already could do that.
But how rapidly,

415
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:43,710
and you do that with the theory that I
already made up when he drew that surface

416
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:46,860
at 1935 called transition state theory.

417
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,050
You assume that the rate constant,

418
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,120
and we talked about this before in
units per second, is 10 to the 13th.

419
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,180
So it had things happen 10 to the 13th
per second times the concentration of the

420
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,800
transition state.

421
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,880
So the idea is that things that are in
the transition state are moving at the

422
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,040
rate 10 to the 13th per second.

423
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,560
So if you know how many are
at the transition state,

424
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,580
then you know how many are
going to product 10 to the
13th times that per second,

425
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,330
right? And you know how to do an
equilibrium. We already do that.

426
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540
All we do is use that special double
dagger to mean that the two mean the

427
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,330
transition,

428
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,530
the difference in energy going from
the starting material to the transition

429
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:30,300
state,
the difference in free energy.

430
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,520
Now we can calculate that
equilibrium constant.

431
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:35,910
If we know how much starting material
there is the law of mass action,

432
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,360
we know how much transition that state
there is an equilibrium with that

433
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,950
starting material,
right?

434
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:45,900
So that e to the minus Delta g over rt
is the equilibrium constant for getting

435
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:49,650
the transition state. Multiply it by the
concentration of the starting material.

436
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,870
You have the concentration
of the transition state,

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,530
multiply it by 10 to the 13th and
you know how fast it's going. Right?

438
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,580
So it assumes that there's a universal
rate constant for transition states going

439
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:06,120
to the product 10 to the 13th per second.
That's about how fast things vibrate.

440
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,510
So things won't stay on the
potato chip there roll off.

441
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,870
And the rate at which they roll
off is 10 to the 13th per second.

442
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,440
This is of course an approximation.

443
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:21,420
It isn't correct because there's not
true equilibrium between the transition

444
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:24,060
state in the starting
material for true equilibrium,

445
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,000
the same number must be going in and out,
right?

446
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:29,700
But when things get to the transition
state, often they keep going.

447
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,300
They don't come back. So it's not really
a rigorous theory, but it's a very,

448
00:29:33,301 --> 00:29:36,090
very helpful theory for
approximate purposes.

449
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,290
And that's what I say here.
Okay,

450
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,320
so using energies to predict
equilibria and rates for one step,

451
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:47,260
reactions free radical Halogen Asians,
and let me look,

452
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:50,800
we do have time to go through this stuff.
I think at least most of it,

453
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,060
we've already seen this,

454
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,310
that you break a chlorine atom into to
chlorine molecule into two Adams than you

455
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:00,340
do single electron,
curved arrows,

456
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,110
take the hydrogen away from methyl
from methane to give methyl,

457
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,100
and then it attacks chlorine.
We seen this before and the chlorine,

458
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,830
Adam comes back to constitute
a chain reaction. Okay,

459
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:15,760
so it's catalytic and radical.
Okay,

460
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:19,420
now we break and make bonds in this.

461
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,430
So we've already seen average
bond energies that might
tell us how hard it is to

462
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,890
break a bond, right? If,

463
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,260
if that's what we have to do
to get to the transition state.

464
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,450
So we may be on the way
to get getting rates,

465
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,520
but are these average bond energies,

466
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:38,290
real bond energies or are they
just a trick for reckoning?

467
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,101
The nth Albi,

468
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:43,090
the total energy heat of formation
or whatever of a particular molecule.

469
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,990
And we talked about this before and
saw that mostly it is a trick that

470
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,570
individual bond energies change,
right?

471
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:53,320
So average bond energies are not what
you want to use for this purpose,

472
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,410
although they might be in the
ballpark of the right numbers.

473
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,070
But they're not the right numbers.
What you really need. Our Bond,

474
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,080
dissociation energies, the actual energy
it takes to break a specific bond.

475
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,320
And we've talked about how you
could get that from spectroscopy.

476
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,630
Those are real.

477
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:14,410
The average bond energies are just a
way of calculating molecular energy.

478
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:18,810
So appendix two of the straight
razor and Hedgecock book, uh,

479
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,910
shows various specific bonds between the
groups in column a and the Adams in or,

480
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,180
or groups in, in a row, a,

481
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,570
they're in the top row.
And those were the best value.

482
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:33,370
Those were when that book was published.

483
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:38,200
The best values as of 2003 are a little
bit changed from that and were tabulated

484
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:42,460
by Barney Ellison, who's picture
I showed you time before last.

485
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,290
So here's a table from Blacksburg and
Ellison that shows a bunch of these things

486
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:48,310
and how well they're known.

487
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:53,311
The H two bond association
energy as 104.206 plus or
minus 0.03 kilocalories per

488
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:58,870
mole. So it's very well known.
So some of them are very,

489
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,720
very well known and some of them
are known only approximately.

490
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,750
Let's look at a few of
them. Uh, so h two 104.2 HF,

491
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,690
136 HCL, 103 Hbr, 87, Hii,

492
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,240
71. So as you go down the halogens,
the bonds get weaker and weaker.

493
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,860
Why should that be?
Why do larger halogens give weaker bonds?

494
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:24,730
It's because they have poorer overlap
with hydrogen because at normal bond

495
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:27,400
distances,
because their orals are very diffuse,

496
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,980
they don't have high numbers
where the in the region,

497
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,070
where the hydrogen is and you
have the electron, the uh,

498
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,130
energy match also is unfavorable.

499
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:40,100
So if you have h f with good
overlap and a very low f,

500
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,250
then you get lots of stabilization.
Those,

501
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,350
some of those two red arrows as
big a strong bond. And if it's Ahi,

502
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:53,650
there's the overlap isn't so good
and the energy match is uh, is,

503
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,710
is better but,

504
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,090
but still the amount by
which the electrons go down
is not as much as with Hf.

505
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,390
So we can see qualitatively why that is.

506
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,440
So less electron stabilization
means a week or bond.

507
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,560
And we're going to talk about
this more next semester.

508
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:13,460
This is just to give you a flavor of it.
And you hear in the table too,

509
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,730
we see there's the same trend in bonding
with methyl groups that the halogen

510
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:20,330
methyl,

511
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,330
the fluorine methyl bond is 115 but the
fluorine or but the IOD and methyl bond

512
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:27,870
is only 58.
And,

513
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,510
but if you go across hydrogen
with the different Al,
Kiehl's methyl, ethyl, propyl,

514
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,051
t beautiful,

515
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:37,460
they're all very close to a hundred
kilocalories per mole but not the same.

516
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:42,110
And that will turn out to make an x a
difference as we'll see next summit early

517
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,590
next semester.

518
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,770
And if you look at some of the other
kinds of radicals you see there are

519
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:50,570
differences there. Special
cases for vinyl. Allie, ill
remember Alli allow alcohol,

520
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,530
uh,
fennel and Benzel and uh,

521
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,360
I'll show you just a
little bit about that.

522
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,450
Are these unusual bond associate bond
association energy values due to unusual

523
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:05,120
bonds or unusual radicals?

524
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,500
That is standard. We have, here's the
starting material, here's the bond,

525
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,860
here's the product. Is
the bonds broken, right?

526
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:17,890
For making the radicals so we can
get a strong bond either by lowering,

527
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,510
by making the bond strong,
or by making the radicals bad.

528
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,950
Either way increases the
barrier, right? Similarly,

529
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,910
we can make a small one either by making
the bond week or making the radical

530
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:35,600
stable. Is this something that is
meaningful to talk about? Well,

531
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,850
let's look at it in the
case of these special cases.

532
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,750
So vinyl you see is 110
kilocalories per mole. It's, uh,

533
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,920
the, the bond to age. So
it's a very strong bond.

534
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,550
Why is there something special
about the vinyl radical?

535
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,650
There's no special stabilization.

536
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:54,770
There's no overlap between
that singly occupied orbital,

537
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,340
which is a sigma orbital and the
double bond, which is a Pi orbital.

538
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,040
There's nothing especially
stable about the vinyl radical.

539
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,030
But if you look at the bond in the
starting material, the Ch bond,

540
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,160
it has sp squared hybridization of the
carbon. So that one's a strong bond.

541
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,790
That one's hard to break because
the bond is unusually strong,

542
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:17,510
not because the radicals are
unusually unstable. Okay.

543
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,560
Or if you look at a fennel,
it's the same deal.

544
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,980
You have a sigma Somo and the Pi Bonds,

545
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,220
the low lumos that might stabilize that
singly occupied orbitals electron are

546
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:34,670
perpendicular orthogonal to it. So
again, it's hard to break that bond.

547
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,790
On the other hand, the allium,
and remember Alli allow alcohol.

548
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:43,350
We were talking about here's an elk
keel radical. Now there's overlap.

549
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Pi Overlap between the SOMO
and the Pi Star in the pie.

550
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,080
It turns out, and we'll talk about
this more next time, that that,

551
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,730
that when you mix those two,

552
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,450
the Pi Star on the left on the
right and the Somo in the middle,

553
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
you get stabilization,

554
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,450
you'd get the same stabilization
by mixing the pie with the Somo.

555
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,630
And if you mix both of them with the Somo,
you get that structure.

556
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,670
But this isn't the time to talk about
that. But at any rate, the normal,

557
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:15,330
the starting bond is normal.
It's an s p cubed ch bond and normal bond.

558
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,600
But in this case,
the radical is unusually stable.

559
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,690
So it's easy to break that
one 10 kilocalories easier
than for normal ch bonds.

560
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,260
And the same for Benzel. Okay. Now,

561
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,260
possibility of how of
doing a halogenation.

562
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:34,590
Let's look first from the point of view
of the equilibrium constant from this at

563
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:37,770
the difference in energy between
starting material and product.

564
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,940
So we look at what bonds are
broken and what bonds are formed.

565
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,330
The red bonds are broken,
the green bonds are formed.

566
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,580
So there'll be a cost for breaking the
red bonds and there'll be a return for

567
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:53,790
making the green bonds. And
let's see how big it is. Okay,

568
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:57,750
we're going to do it for fluorine and
chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Okay?

569
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,950
In every case, we're breaking a
ch bond 105 kilocalories per mole,

570
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,040
and we're breaking a halogen halogen bond.

571
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,350
But those are different
for the different halogens,

572
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,200
although interestingly not monotonic, it's
not as smoothly as smooth progression.

573
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:16,380
It goes up and then down again.
And the cost is the sum of those two.

574
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,530
What it's gonna cost to break those bonds.
How about making bonds?

575
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
We're going to make the CX bond and
we're going to make the HX bond.

576
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,400
So the returns will be that.

577
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,580
And now we see whether we
could make a living doing this.

578
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,230
What will the profit be?
Right?

579
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,440
So in the case of fluorine to 51 is much
greater than the cost of one 42 so it's

580
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:41,700
a big energy. It's really
exothermic, right? Chlorine,

581
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:46,701
it's only 19 bromine is only nine and
I had done is minus 12 what does that

582
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,950
mean? It means you can't do
this reaction with iodine.

583
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,020
The equilibrium advised
in the wrong direction.

584
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,150
Okay,
so already that,

585
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,180
that the equilibrium constant and how
energy relates to it tells you that

586
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:08,820
something is impossible to do,
but the others seem to be possible.

587
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,270
But will they happen?
How fast will they be?

588
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:15,840
Do you have to wait until the end of the
universe in order for this to happen?

589
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:21,150
Well, let's look at that. How the rate,
which will depend on the mechanism,

590
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,000
the equilibrium constant,
it doesn't depend on the path,

591
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,120
it's just how high the starting
material is and how high the product is.

592
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,930
But how fast you get depends on
the barriers you have to go across.

593
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:35,070
So let's suppose let's just
try breaking two bonds,

594
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,010
changing partners and forming two bonds.
Okay?

595
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,000
Then we have to get to the barrier.
We have to break to bonds.

596
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:47,080
So those that costs we're going to have
to spend in order to get to the barrier.

597
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,940
So is this a plausible mechanism?

598
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,690
How fast would the reaction
be if we use that mechanism?

599
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,930
Well at room temperature,
say 300 Kelvin,

600
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,880
then it's 10 to the three fourths
of how high it is to get there.

601
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,040
Then Times 10 to the 13th per second.

602
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,460
But notice that tend to the 13th times
10 to the minus one oh six which is three

603
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:13,630
fourths of 142 is 10 to
the minus 93 per second.

604
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,820
10 to the 93 seconds is a long, long time.
I don't know how old the universe is,

605
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,720
but I suspect that's longer. Right.
So what about this mechanism?

606
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:26,110
Plausible implausible.
How could you make it happen?

607
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,320
Shy.
Pardon me?

608
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,920
Change the temperature because we can
change that three fourths to something

609
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:39,060
else by to the much smaller number
by increasing the temperature.

610
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,720
So no way to do that one.
But if we go to 3000 Kelvin,

611
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:47,190
then it's 10 then it's
250 reactions per second.

612
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,120
So that's quite feasible.
As long as nothing else happens,

613
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,730
something else might be even faster,
right?

614
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:56,670
But at least this mechanism could
work if you were in a flame,

615
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,860
say or in Professor Chupp because
oven that we talked about last time.

616
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,540
Okay,
now let's look at IRA's h plus h two here.

617
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,450
So we want to get from this valley
to the other valley. How do we do it?

618
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,840
This mechanism would be to break a
bond and then so dissociation and then

619
00:40:16,021 --> 00:40:19,380
association, but a, it's very
slow to get up there, right?

620
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:21,540
To get up to that plateau
of breaking a bond.

621
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,470
There's a much easier way to get from
one valley to the other. What is it?

622
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,190
Go through the past,
right?

623
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,130
So instead of doing that slow reaction,

624
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,310
you can do this much faster reaction
making a new bond as you break the old one

625
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,200
so you don't have to pay all the cost of
breaking the old one and you're getting

626
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,280
something back for it.

627
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,470
So you can have a free radical chain
substitution where you have an x Adam,

628
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,510
and we've talked about this before,
take the Hoa from our than the r group.

629
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:58,530
Takes away x from x to,
and it can just go round and round.

630
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:02,970
There's this machine very much like the
machine that professor Sharpless talked

631
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:04,260
about that goes round and round.

632
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,620
You feed in starting material and
the products come out and you don't,

633
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:08,490
it's a catalyst.

634
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:11,910
You don't have to go to such high
energies as you normally would have to do.

635
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,040
Uh,
so the possibility of halogenation here,

636
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,960
we looked at it that
equilibrium and saw that,

637
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,990
forget it with I and the others look okay
and w four mechanisms with reasonable

638
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,940
rate,
we could change those two columns,

639
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,060
exchange them so that we make
the Hx as we break c h three h.

640
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,300
So x, Adam helps you do that. And
that generates then a ch three group,

641
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:41,960
which helps the reaction on the right.
So now step one,

642
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:44,630
how much energy do you
have to put in your,

643
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,690
you're paying 105 but you're
getting back a 136 so that's great,

644
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,800
right? The first step is,
is seems plausible. Now,

645
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,280
although you don't know how high the
barrier is that you have to get from

646
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:02,110
starting material to product. But at
least it's much easier. So the top one,

647
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,680
it looks good all around the chlorine
and bromine will be a little touchy on

648
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:10,730
those first two steps because
there uphill and energy.

649
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:15,530
But, but step two is
good in all cases. Okay?

650
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,610
So what we need to do is be able
to predict activation energy.

651
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,560
But Rome wasn't built in a day.

652
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,740
And that's going to happen next semester
to get into this and to talk in more

653
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:27,680
detail about these catalytic reactions.

654
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,730
Notice that this is exactly
the kind of thing, uh, uh,

655
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,440
Sharpless was talking about,

656
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,710
if you could find a way of
lowering one of these barriers,

657
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,380
then the catalytic cycle would work.
He was saying,

658
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,760
remember that it was democratic,

659
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,150
that all the steps as you go around
the cycle have to be at the same,

660
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:47,150
go at the same rate or
else everything stops up,

661
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:50,300
stops and waits before it tries
to get over some big step.

662
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,230
So you have to have all the steps be fast.
And that's why he was saying that the,

663
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,870
that, that the dice approachable
ethylamine helped the, uh,

664
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,390
formation of a members all well.

665
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,410
So we've been doing organic
chemistry this semester. Uh,

666
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,330
some people might doubt that.

667
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,110
There'll be no doubt next semester that
everyone will agree that what we do is

668
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:13,010
organic chemistry.

669
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:16,370
We're going to talk about the chemistry
of functional groups and sugars and

670
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:20,900
amino acids and all carbon eel groups
and esters, all of these things.

671
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,040
Uh, but there's a reason that it's
been a little different this semester.

672
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,780
We've talked mostly about physical,

673
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:31,490
organic chemistry and the reason is
because of where I came from that I did my

674
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,091
phd.

675
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:35,780
And in fact I took a course
as an undergraduate with
Paul Bartlett at Harvard.

676
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:40,781
And as you've seen from our common
ancestry that he was a physical organic

677
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,530
chemistry. More interested in how
reactions work than in what you can make.

678
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:47,721
Okay.

679
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:52,250
So there's this book that came out in
1939 went through at least three additions

680
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,520
I have, I have the second
and third additions here,

681
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,520
which is called the nature
of the chemical bond.

682
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,940
And this was a fabulously
influential book,

683
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,320
even if it is the one that
said it was 126 kilocalories,

684
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:11,321
promoted to take carbon away from
graphite when we know it's 171.

685
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,670
Uh,

686
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,670
so Pauling was arguably the
most influential chemist of the,

687
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,240
of the 20th century. He
got two Nobel Prizes, uh,

688
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,040
[inaudible] I think that was

689
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,050
really too
much.

690
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,800
But this tennis you facts and
recipes and does very little thought

691
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,330
intellectual and home to look,

692
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,700
uh, um, can,

693
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,730
she was sort of the continuum.

694
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,860
Okay. So that's what we've been doing
the first semester is this kind of thing.

695
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:15,330
Thinking about the chemical bond.
We started with wandering with Newton,

696
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,360
whether there was an atomic force law
and then we look to see if we could see

697
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:21,990
bonds or feel them.

698
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,870
And then we tried to understand bonding
and reactivity through the Schrodinger

699
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:28,411
equation,

700
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:32,370
which most people believe
is the fundamental way to
understand things properly.

701
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,450
And then we learned how chemists
learned to treasure the molecular model.

702
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,770
Things like this, right? That turned
out to be really, really useful tools,

703
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,990
right?
Composition,

704
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,650
constitution configuration
and con formation.

705
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,990
And finally energy.

706
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,150
So I hope that we've,
this semester,

707
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:02,230
if we haven't done as much
organic chemistry as some
people would care for that

708
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:04,480
at least we've raised
some big questions like

709
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,800
how does science know things,
right?

710
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,630
Or compared to what,
those are the really big questions,

711
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:18,440
but even if we're only focusing on
the specific content of the course,

712
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,340
interested in bonds here.
Two questions for you to think about.

713
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,700
We're chemical bonds discovered
or where they invented.

714
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,330
To what extent are chemical bonds real
or to what extent are they a figment of a

715
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:36,650
chemist imagination?

716
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,610
This is the kind of thing we've
been aiming at all semester,

717
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:45,611
so you should be in a position to think
about this now or would we even have

718
00:46:46,761 --> 00:46:51,761
chemical bonds without our own chemical
forebearers so we've looked at how the

719
00:46:52,461 --> 00:46:55,580
idea of bonds and these different
properties of bonds developed,

720
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,590
but suppose chemistry was developing
in some other solar system,

721
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,203
right?

722
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,020
What would happen there?

723
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:09,021
Suppose people discovered the Schrodinger
equation before they had the idea of

724
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:13,530
bonds.
Would bonds have been necessary?

725
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,570
Is Chemistry going to evolve such that
all you need do is put stuff into a

726
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:22,500
computer, solve quantum
mechanics and forget about bonds.

727
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,683
Okay.

728
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,880
The answers to these questions aren't
obvious, but there are good ones to think.

729
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,210
So, uh, this is the end
and good luck on the final.

730
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,500
Are you fired up?
You're ready to go?

731
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,250
Good.
Thanks.
