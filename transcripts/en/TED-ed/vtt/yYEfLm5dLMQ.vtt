00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:18.813
The first 10 amendments
to the U.S. Constitution --

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.613
also known as the Bill of Rights --

00:00:20.637 --> 00:00:23.820
were ratified or passed
over 200 years ago.

00:00:24.185 --> 00:00:27.230
But even though they're a bit, well, old,

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:30.976
these first 10 amendments are still
the most debated and discussed section

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.690
of our Constitution today.

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.025
So, can you remember what they are?

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:36.480
Let's take a look.

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:38.729
The First Amendment
is the freedom of speech,

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.515
press, religion, assembly and petition.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.549
This may be the most revered
of the amendments.

00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:48.644
The First Amendment protects our rights
to say and write our opinions,

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:51.731
worship how we please,
assemble together peacefully

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.392
and petition our government,
if we feel the need.

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.117
The Second Amendment
is the right to bear arms.

00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.228
The original intent
of the Second Amendment

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:02.288
was to protect colonists
from the invading British soldiers,

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.535
but it now guarantees
that you have the right

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.137
to own a gun to defend
yourself and your property.

00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:10.324
The Third Amendment is called
the "Quartering" amendment.

00:01:10.348 --> 00:01:12.982
It was written in response
to the British occupation,

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.324
and as a result of the colonists
having to house -- or quarter --

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.764
soldiers in their homes
during the American Revolution.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.070
Because of this amendment,

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:24.587
our government can never force us
to house soldiers in our home.

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:27.634
The Fourth Amendment
is the right to search and seizure.

00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:30.491
The police can't come into our home
without a search warrant

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:32.087
and take our personal property.

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:36.711
Today, many concerns have arisen
about our rights to privacy in technology.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:40.312
For example, can the government track
your location with your smartphone,

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:43.242
or can social media postings
such as on Facebook and Twitter

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.988
be used without a warrant?

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:48.122
On to the Fifth:
It's all about due process.

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:51.127
You've probably heard the phrase
"I plead the Fifth"

00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:52.985
in movies or on TV.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.049
They're talking about the Fifth Amendment,

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.549
which says that you don't have to take
the witness stand against yourself

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:00.970
if you may end up incriminating yourself.

00:02:00.994 --> 00:02:03.094
OK, we're halfway done.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:06.657
The Sixth and Seventh Amendments
are about how the legal system works.

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.110
If you're accused of a crime,

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:11.895
you have the right to a speedy
public trial and an impartial jury.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.649
You also have the right to a lawyer,

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:15.840
and the right to take
the stand if you choose.

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:19.927
This is important because it will prevent
the accused from sitting in prison forever

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.623
and insists that the prosecution
proceed with undue delay.

00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:27.091
The Seventh says you have
the right to a jury trial,

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:31.275
where 12 impartial peers decide
your innocence or guilt in the courtroom,

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.522
as opposed to a judge doing it all alone.

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:36.474
The Eight Amendment prohibits
cruel and unusual punishment.

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:39.584
Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual?

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.596
It's hard for Americans to agree
on the definitions of cruel and unusual.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.839
The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
are called the non-rights amendments.

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:50.547
They say that the rights
not listed in the Bill of Rights

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:52.563
are retained by the people in the states.

00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:55.706
We have other rights
that are not listed in the Constitution,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.446
and the states have the right
to make their own policies,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.903
like instituting state taxes.

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:01.736
So now you know all 10 amendments.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.054
Can you remember them all?

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:04.946
If not, remember this:

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.093
the Bill of Rights is a crucial piece
of American history,

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:10.306
and though society
has undergone many changes

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.293
these past 200 and some years,

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:16.116
the interpretation and application
of these amendments are as vital today

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.224
as they were when they were written.
