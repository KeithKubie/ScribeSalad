Hi there, I’m John Green, this is Crash
Course: World History and today we’re going

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.740
to talk about Islam, which like Christianity
and Judaism grew up on the east coast of the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.409
Mediterranean but unlike Christianity and
Judaism is not terribly well understood in

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.400
the West. For instance, you probably know
what this is and what this is, you probably

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.110
don’t know what that is. Google it.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.760
Mr. Green Mr. Green why do you think people
know so little about Islamic history?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.450
Did you just ask an interesting non-annoying
question, me from the past? I think we don’t

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.020
know about early Islamic history because we
don’t learn about it, me from the past,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.780
because we don’t learn about it, because
we’re taught that our history is the story

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.540
of Christianity in Europe, when in fact our
history is the story of people on the planet,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.300
so let’s try to learn something today.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.860
[theme music]

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.960
So in less than 200 years Islam went from
not existing to being the religious and political

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.639
organizing principal of one of the largest
empires in the world.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:05.100
And that story begins in the 7th century CE
when the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.840
a 40-ish guy who made his living as a caravan
trader and told him to begin reciting the word of God.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.540
Initially, this freaked Muhammad out, as,
you know, it would—but then his wife and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.800
a couple of other people encouraged him and
slowly he came to accept the mantle as prophet.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.290
A few things to know about the world Islam
entered: First, Muhammad’s society was intensely

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.820
tribal. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe,
living in Mecca and tribal ties were extremely important.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.090
Also, at the time, the Arabian peninsula was
like this crazy religious melting pot. Like

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.370
most tribal Arabs worshipped gods very similar to the
Mesopotamian gods you’ll remember from episode 3.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.000
And by the time of Muhammad, cult statutes
of many of those gods had been collected in

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.040
his hometown of Mecca in this temple-like
structure called the Kaaba.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.690
But Arabia was also a home for monotheisms
like Christianity and Judaism, even a bit

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.840
of Zoroastrianism. So the message that there
was only god wouldn’t have been like as

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.000
surprising to Muhammad as it was, for instance,
to Abraham.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.530
Also, and this will become very important,
the northern part of Arabia was sandwiched

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.030
between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian
Sassanian Empire—and you’ll remember,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.080
those guys were always fighting. They were
like snowboarders and skiers, or like the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.970
Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.630
At its core, Islam is what we call a radical
reforming religion—just like Jesus and Moses

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.050
sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism after
what they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.200
Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as
the final prophet to bring people back to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.100
the one true religion, which involves the worship of,
and submission to, a single and all-powerful God.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.230
The Quran also acknowledges Abraham and Moses
and Jesus among others as prophets, but it’s

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.360
very different from the Hebrew and Christian
bibles:

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.300
For one thing it’s much less narrative,
but also its

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.110
the written record of the revelations Muhammad
received—which means its not written from

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.209
the point of view of people, it is seen as
the actual word of God.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.640
The Quran is a really broad-ranging text,
but it returns again and again to a couple

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.030
themes. One is strict monotheism and the other
is the importance of taking care of those

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.020
less fortunate than you. The Quran, says of
the good person

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.610
spends his substance—however much he himself
may cherish it—upon his near of kin, and

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.560
the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer,
and the beggars, and for the freeing of human

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.990
beings from bondage.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.790
These revelations also radically increased
the rights of women and orphans, which was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.590
one of the reasons why Mohammad’s tribal
leaders weren’t that psyched about them.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.200
To talk more about Islamic faith and practice,
let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.770
The five pillars of Islam are the basic acts
considered obligatory, at least by Sunni Muslims.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.440
First is the shahada or the profession of
the faith:

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.300
There is no god but god and Muhammad is God’s
prophet, which is sometimes translated as

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.790
“There is no god but Allah and Muhammad
is Allah’s prophet”, which tries to make

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.770
Muslims sound other and ignores the fact that
the Arabic word for god—whether you are

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.280
Christian or Jewish or Muslim—is Allah.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.670
Second, salat, or ritual prayer five times
a day—at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.310
and late evening—which are obligatory unless
you haven’t hit puberty, are too sick, or

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.930
are menstruating. Keep it PG, Thought Bubble.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.989
Third, sawm, the month-long fast during the
month of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.239
eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight
hours.

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.760
Since Ramadan is a lunar-calendar month, it
moves around the seasons, and obviously it’s

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.780
most fun during the winter, when days are
shorter, and least fun during the summer,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.100
when days are both long and hot.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.600
Fourth is zakat, or almsgiving, in which non-poor
Muslims are required to give a percentage

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.470
of their income to the poor,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.680
and lastly hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that
Muslims must try to fulfill at least once

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.660
in their lives, provided they are healthy
and have enough money.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.030
And there’s also more to understanding Islam
than just knowing the Quran. Like Judaism

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.980
with its Talmud, and Christianity with its
lives of saints and writings of Church fathers,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.889
Islam has supplementary sacred texts, chief
among which is the hadith, a collection of

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.230
sayings and stories about the Prophet.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.670
Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh, it’s time for
the open letter?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.560
Magic.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.460
An Open Letter to the 72 Virgins. Oh, but
first let’s check what’s in the Secret

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.520
Compartment. Huh, it’s Andre the Giant.
Did you know that Andre the Giant died a virgin-

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.840
is a fact that I made up?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.100
Dear 72 Virgins,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.400
Hey there, it’s me, John Green. Did you
know that not all hadiths were created equal?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.320
Some sayings of the Prophet are really well
sourced. like for instance, a good friend

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.669
or a relative heard the Prophet say something
and then it ended up as a hadith.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.410
But some hadiths are terribly sourced like,
not to be irreverent, but some of it is like

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.270
middle school gossip; like Rachel told Rebekah
that her sister’s brother’s friend kissed

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.410
Justin Bieber on the face.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.199
And the vast majority of Muslims don’t treat
terribly sourced hadiths as scripture.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.870
And the idea that you go to heaven and get
72 virgins is not in the Quran; it’s in

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.020
a terribly sourced hadith so it is my great
regret to inform you, 72 Virgins, that in

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.100
the eyes of almost all Muslims you do not
exist.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.630
Best wishes,
John Green

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.320
One more thing about Islam: Like Christianity
and Judaism, it has a body of law. You might

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.169
have heard of it - it’s called sharia.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.229
Although we tend to think of sharia as this
single set of laws that all Muslims follow,

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.680
that’s ridiculous; there are numerous competing
interpretations of sharia, just as there are

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.229
within any legal tradition.

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.460
So people who embraced this worldview were
called Muslims, because they submitted to

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.919
the will of God, and they became part of the
umma, or community of believers.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.120
This would be a good moment for an Uma Thurman
joke, but sadly she is no longer famous. I’m

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.580
sorry if you’re watching this, Uma Thurman.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.220
Being part of the umma trumped all other ties,
including tribal ties, which got Muhammad

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.780
into some trouble and brings us, at last,
back to history.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.120
So as Muhammad’s following in Mecca grew,
the umma aroused the suspicion of the most

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.600
powerful tribe, the Quraysh.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.729
And it didn’t matter that Muhammad himself
was born into the Quraysh tribe because he

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.070
wouldn’t shut up about how there was only
one God, which was really bad news to the

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.290
Quraysh tribe because they managed the pilgrimage
trade in Mecca, and if all those gods were

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.000
false, it would be a disaster economically.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.919
—although come to think of it, in the end the
Meccan pilgrimage business turned out just fine.

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.270
So the Quraysh forced Muhammad and his followers
out of Mecca in 622 CE, and they headed to

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.460
Yithrab, also known as Medina.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.600
This journey, also know as the hijra, is so
important that it marks year 0 in the Islamic calendar.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.770
In Medina, Muhammad severed the religion’s
ties to Judaism, turning the focus of prayer

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.120
away from Jerusalem to Mecca.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.340
Also in Medina, the Islamic community started
to look a lot more like a small empire than

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.590
like a church. Like, Jesus never had a country
to run.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.250
But Muhammad did almost from the beginning.
And in addition to being an important prophet,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.900
he was a good general and in 630, the Islamic
community took back Mecca.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.180
They destroyed the idols in the kabaa, and
soon Islam was as powerful a political force

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.070
in the region as it was a religious one.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.449
And it’s because the political and religious
coexisted from the beginning, that there’s

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.539
no separate tradition of civic and religious
law like there is in Christianity and Judaism.

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:42.080
very different from Judaism and even from
Christianity—which you’ll remember debated

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.539
very different from Judaism and even from
Christianity—which you’ll remember debated

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:42.580
for generations whether to be inclusive.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.600
—and more importantly than separating Islam
from other monotheisms, that really separated

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.660
Islam from the tribalism in Arabia.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.229
So then when Muhammad died in 632 CE, there
wasn’t a religious vacuum left behind: Muhammad

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:53.400
was the final prophet, the revelation of the Quran would
continue to guide the umma throughout their lives.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.530
But the community did need a political leader,
a caliph. And the first caliph was Abu Bakr,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.560
Muhammad’s father-in-law, who was not without
his opponents:

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.380
Many people wanted Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law,
to lead the community. And although he did

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.560
become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement — to
radically oversimplify because we only have

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.840
ten minutes — began the divide between the
two of the major sects of Islam: Suuni and Shi’a.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.789
And even today, Sunnis Muslims believe Abu
Bakr was rightly elected the first caliph

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:22.400
and Shi’a Muslims believe it should’ve
been Ali.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.880
To Sunnis, the first four caliphs—Abu Bakr,
Umar, Uthman, and Ali— are known as the

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.149
Rightly Guided Caliphs, and many of the conservative
movements in the Islamic world today are all

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:38.300
about trying to restore the Islamic world
to those glory days, which—like most glory

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.409
days—were not unambiguously glorious.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.580
Abu Bakr stabilized the community after Muhammad’s
death, and began the process of recording

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.910
the Quran in writing,

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.140
And started the military campaigns against
the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that within

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.750
116 years would allow the Islamic Empire to
go from this to this.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.860
His successor Umar was both an uncommonly
good general and a brilliant administrator

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.000
but like so many other great men, he proved
terrible at avoiding assassination.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.490
Which led to the caliphate of Uthman, who
standardized the Quran and continued both

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.380
his predecessor’s tradition of conquest
and his predecessor’s tradition of getting assassinated.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.399
Then Ali finally got his turn at caliph, but
his ascension was very controversial, and

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.260
it ultimately led to a civil war.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.220
Which eventually led to the emergence of Uthman’s
tribe, the Umayyads, as the dynasty ruling

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.700
over an ever-expanding Islamic Empire for
more than a hundred years.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.399
It’s common to hear that in these early
years Islam quote spread by the sword, and

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.360
that’s partly true, unless you are — wait
for it —

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.760
the Mongols.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.480
Actually, as usual, the truth is more complicated:Many
people, including the Mongols but also including

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.730
lots of people in Central and East Asia, embraced
Islam without any military campaigns.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.260
And in fact, the Quran says that religion
must not be an act of compulsion, but this

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.800
much is true: The early Islamic empire was
really good at winning wars.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.810
And situated as they were between two very
wealthy empires—the Byzantines and the Sassanians—there

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.100
was plenty to fight for.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.510
First to fall was the Sassanians, the last
non-Muslim successor to the Persian Empire.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.029
They were relatively easy pickings because
they’d been fighting the Byzantines for

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:14.540
like 300 years and were super tired. Also
they’d been recently struck by plague.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.529
Plague, man, I’m telling you; It’s like
the red tortoise shell of history.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.130
But in those early days they did pry away
some valuable territory like Egypt and the

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.970
holy land and eventually they got into Spain.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.380
Where various Muslim dynasties would entrench
themselves until being expelled in 1492.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.040
But as a good as they were at making war,
it’s still tempting to chalk up the Arabs’

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.490
success to, you know, the will of God.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.700
And certainly a lot of the people they conquered
felt that way. Wars in this part of the world

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.709
didn’t just pit people against each other,
they also pitted their gods against each other.

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:49.779
So while the Islamic Empire didn’t require
its subjects to convert to Islam, their stunning

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:54.660
successes certainly convinced a lot of people
that this monotheism thing was legit.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.750
Once again, John Green proving super hip to
the slang of today’s young’ns.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.510
Also, you paid lower taxes if you converted,
and just as taxes on cigarettes lead to people

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:10.130
not wanting to smoke, taxes on worshiping your idols
lead to people not wanting to worship them anymore.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.380
So in a period of time that was, historically
speaking, both remarkably recent and remarkably

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:19.320
short, a small group of people from an area
of the world with no natural resources managed

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.780
to create one of the great empires of the
world and also one of its great religions.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.960
And that very fact may be why people of
Western European descent remain

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.080
largely ignorant about this period.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.920
Not only were the Muslims great conquerors,
they spawned an explosion of trade and learning

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.640
that lasted hundreds of years.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.839
They saved many of the classical texts that
form the basis of the “Western Canon”

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:41.920
while Europe was ignoring them and they paved
the way for the Renaissance.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.830
While it’s important to remember that much
of the world between Spain and the Indus River

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.709
wasn’t Arabized, most of it was so thoroughly
Islamized that these days we can’t think

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:54.839
of the world we now call the Middle East without
thinking of it as Islamic.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:58.339
Perhaps the greatest testimony to Islam’s
power to organize peoples lives and their

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:05.699
communities is that, in Egypt, 5 times a day millions of
people turn away from the Pyramids and toward Mecca.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.100
Egypt, birthplace to one of the longest continuous
cultures the world has ever known, is now

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.140
the largest Arab country in the world.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.960
Next week we’ll talk about the Dark Ages.
Spoiler alert: they were darkest in the evening.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.740
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.630
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.610
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.780
team is Thought Bubble.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.260
Last week’s Phrase of the Week was “They
Might Be Giants”. If you want to guess this

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.570
week’s Phrase of the Week or suggest future
ones you can do so in Comments where you can

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.390
also ask questions about today’s video that
our team of historians will endeavor to answer.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.390
Thank you so much for watching and as they
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
