Speaker 1:          00:00          Travel is a little bit perhaps like music or looking at art on the wall. You kind of have to have somebody teach you how to do it a little bit. Yeah, it's like the fight game, Yo, you know, you, somebody could sit with you and and get really bored with technical boxing. It might be the best you've ever seen and it's not a slug fest or a Braun. You have to explain, well see some jazz, some jazz bitches, brew Conor Mcgregor's bitches brew arguably one of the smell several. It's all over the place and let's say, and some is very contained like the disc jockeys voice. Yeah, yeah. There's some people very mechanized. The jazz thing is a really good analogy because you either into jazz are you not into jazz and I've never, I liked a lichen is background music, but I have a good friend, my friend Alonzo Boden is a jazz efficient natto and he like host jazz tours and stuff and he's a stand up comic.

Speaker 1:          01:02          So he'll do like comedy on these things and he just loves it. I mean he like lives for it. Well, I, she look on your face just because nobody taught you how to taste beer. Beer works in three parts and like it says in the Pickwick papers, you don't taste it with a ship. Wait. Tastes, yeah. Gotta go up. You've got a quaff. You got something. And when you describe, well, there's the finish to the taste of a Cuban cigar. They go, you mean when it's finished in the APP? No, the finish. Okay. Somebody explained these things to me. All right. What's the difference between Scotch whiskey and Tennessee Bourbon? Well, there's an e in the word, Bourbon whiskey. There's an e in, there is no EDD in the war. In whiskey for Scotch. Okay. That simple, short of starts it jazz music. Somebody explains it to you in very simple, digestible, not lofty neck tie terms.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Okay? You begin to understand a little bit of what's going on. How do you get, how do you explain it to them? Okay. How would you explain jazz? I'm gonna, I'll really tighten up for you. Um, excuse me. Wow. At least I've got my health. Go for me. Huh? Um, we'll do it in the Beatles style. Here's the best way to go for somebody new and interested the McCartney note and that Lennon knew. Okay. The Mccartney note is always kind of happy. I've actually bumped into Sir Paul over at Henson Studios and he's really happy. Okay. And here's another, we'll go. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Here. How pretty that sounds. That sounds pretty. I'll do it again. Yep.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Bada Bada Ba Lennon.

Speaker 1:          02:44          He's the salt and the caramel baby. He's got, there's a darkness. There's an edge. There's a shadow. Listen to the last three notes.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Ah, Donna. Ah. Dropoff. And there's a little darkness. It wasn't those last three notes is where you'd get that little, just a little bit of pepper in the chocolate. Yo. Nada. MMM MM

Speaker 1:          03:14          hmm. And it's a little wistful, is a little melancholy and eat life like that. And when you put them together, it doesn't sound like they do. But if I could, I'd sing both parts and it goes together and you go, wow. Bittersweet. Mm. Like my fucking career. Like my last three rules. There we go. So you kind of have to listen to jazz. Like you would taste one ish, k the best for this felonious monk, you know, same thing. The right hand is Paul left his job and he's working these days. You can't tell is it happy? The Shad, right? I Dunno. How was dinner last night? Same, but yet it is a indicative of that's what's around you because snatches dappy that's Disney snatches sad. You know, think of something, somebody who's always tuning his guitar to sad. There are some folks who, Leonard Cohen in his past as well, that sounded more like Bowie, but I know what you mean.
