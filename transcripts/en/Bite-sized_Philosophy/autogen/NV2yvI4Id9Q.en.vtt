and so it's a real mistake it's a barren

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979
and so it's a real mistake it's a barren
 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.800
and so it's a real mistake it's a barren
future without children man I can tell

you that it's a real mistake and so we
 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.749
you that it's a real mistake and so we
do a terrible job of say putting that

do a terrible job of say putting that
 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.790
do a terrible job of say putting that
image forward and saying well yeah now

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800
image forward and saying well yeah now
 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.399

practical problem here it's partly an
 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.360
practical problem here it's partly an
economic problem now because when I was

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370
economic problem now because when I was
 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.730

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.040
except in the upper 1% since 1973 why
well it's easy what happens when you

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050
well it's easy what happens when you
 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.249
well it's easy what happens when you
double the labor force what happens you

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259
double the labor force what happens you
 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.529
double the labor force what happens you
have the value of labour so now we're in

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539
have the value of labour so now we're in
 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.029
