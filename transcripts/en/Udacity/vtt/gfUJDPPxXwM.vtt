The formula for
the area of rectangles seems intuitive.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.780
Trying to find the area of a triangle is
not as straightforward as trying to find

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.740
the area of a rectangle.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.220
However, with the help
of some origami paper,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.940
I think we will be
able to figure it out.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.200
The area is 4x4 equals 16 square inches.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.420
If we take that piece of paper and
fold it in half diagonally,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.240
we have a triangle whose base
is still four inches and

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.070
whose height is still four inches.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.560
Remembering that the area of the whole
square is 16, what is your guess of

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.120
what the area of the triangle might be,
if it's just a folded in half square?

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.640
What is the area of a triangle with
base equals 4 and height equals 4?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.878
Enter your answer here and
don't worry about units.

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:50.269
