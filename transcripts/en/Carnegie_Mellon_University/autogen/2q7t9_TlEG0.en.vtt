goes with that sea change we see when we
 

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.430
goes with that sea change we see when we
move to coal as our primary fuel and

out you know this global problem and
 

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.430
out you know this global problem and
turns it into something that's very much

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440
turns it into something that's very much

kind of something that we can see and in
daily life and so there's these two kind

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.350
daily life and so there's these two kind
 

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.550
daily life and so there's these two kind
of overlapping tendencies that I've been

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560
of overlapping tendencies that I've been
 

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.870

thinking through and it then it like

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880
thinking through and it then it like
 

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.980
thinking through and it then it like
what I've noticed is that there's the

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:47.990
what I've noticed is that there's the
 

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.170
what I've noticed is that there's the
absence of kind of like the way in which

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:50.180
absence of kind of like the way in which
 

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.540

be a part of the way that we we think

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:03.139
be a part of the way that we we think
 

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.079

kind of an example that I thought was on
 

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:21.999
kind of an example that I thought was on
it has a pretty good kind of

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:22.009
it has a pretty good kind of
 

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:24.069
it has a pretty good kind of

oxide they have purified water that then

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:53.660
oxide they have purified water that then
 

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.300
oxide they have purified water that then
they put back into the stream where it

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:55.310
they put back into the stream where it
 

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.059
they put back into the stream where it
came from and then use the iron oxides

00:12:58.059 --> 00:12:58.069
came from and then use the iron oxides
 

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.030
came from and then use the iron oxides
to create pigments that are used in the

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040
to create pigments that are used in the
 

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.269
to create pigments that are used in the
art so you can see a little bit just

00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279
art so you can see a little bit just
 

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:09.340
art so you can see a little bit just
kind of about the process here and so

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:09.350
kind of about the process here and so
 

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.819
kind of about the process here and so
what

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:09.829
what
 

00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:12.069
what
Saburo has done is he kind of has

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079
Saburo has done is he kind of has
 

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.650
Saburo has done is he kind of has
developed a a certain technique where he

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:14.660
developed a a certain technique where he
 

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.309
developed a a certain technique where he
lays out aluminum discs and then mixes

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:18.319
lays out aluminum discs and then mixes
 

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:18.730
lays out aluminum discs and then mixes
this

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:18.740
this
 

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.030
this
mine drainage based pigments with water

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040
mine drainage based pigments with water
 

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.340
mine drainage based pigments with water
and basically starts to kind of put the

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.350
and basically starts to kind of put the
 

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.769
and basically starts to kind of put the
water on like drip the water onto the

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:26.779
water on like drip the water onto the
 

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:29.980
water on like drip the water onto the
aluminum disk to our colors layer and it

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:29.990
aluminum disk to our colors layer and it
 

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.139
aluminum disk to our colors layer and it
creates kind of a bubble of water that

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:32.149
creates kind of a bubble of water that
 

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:34.630
creates kind of a bubble of water that
then drives over the course of weeks to

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:34.640
then drives over the course of weeks to
 

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.480
then drives over the course of weeks to
kind of leave this resulting artwork and

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.490
kind of leave this resulting artwork and
 

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.910
kind of leave this resulting artwork and
so we have an example of this here

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920
 

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.500
there's a way that his art kind of takes

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:44.510
there's a way that his art kind of takes
 

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.900
there's a way that his art kind of takes
something that we would think of as you

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:46.910
something that we would think of as you
 

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.070
something that we would think of as you
know an environment or that's an

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.080
know an environment or that's an
 

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.410
know an environment or that's an
environmental hazard kind of by working

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:50.420
environmental hazard kind of by working
 

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.290
environmental hazard kind of by working
through it kind of you know creates

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:53.300
through it kind of you know creates
 

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.030
through it kind of you know creates
these images that do have a certain

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040
these images that do have a certain
 

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.650
these images that do have a certain
extent of like kind of a natural beauty

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:56.660
extent of like kind of a natural beauty
 

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.150
extent of like kind of a natural beauty
especially kind of in this blues it's

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160
especially kind of in this blues it's
 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.340
especially kind of in this blues it's
something that is a much more kind of

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.350
something that is a much more kind of
 

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.920
something that is a much more kind of
relatable and how we think about

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:01.930
relatable and how we think about
 

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.170
relatable and how we think about
environmental art you can see here as an

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:05.180
environmental art you can see here as an
 

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.360
environmental art you can see here as an
example that's a little bit more cosmic

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.370
example that's a little bit more cosmic
 

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:19.870
example that's a little bit more cosmic
in its colors okay all right so what I'm

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880
in its colors okay all right so what I'm
 

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.949
in its colors okay all right so what I'm
most interested in is how this art on

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959
most interested in is how this art on

doesn't just kind of convey an

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.130
doesn't just kind of convey an
 

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.010
doesn't just kind of convey an
environmental message you don't get kind

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:27.020
environmental message you don't get kind
 

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.420
environmental message you don't get kind
of much meaning by just looking at this

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:28.430
of much meaning by just looking at this
 

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.430
of much meaning by just looking at this
art but instead of interested in how

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440
art but instead of interested in how

and energy humanities I'm a historian
 

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:43.059
and energy humanities I'm a historian
and I'm gonna look at some of the

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:43.069
and I'm gonna look at some of the
 

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:46.989
and I'm gonna look at some of the
materials that I can use as a historian

to do the work of energy humanities to

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:50.029
to do the work of energy humanities to
 

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:51.639
to do the work of energy humanities to
think about humanities and also think

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:51.649
think about humanities and also think
 

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:53.639
think about humanities and also think
about energy and the science and

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:53.649
about energy and the science and
 

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:56.109
about energy and the science and
engineering of it at the same time and

enough about the language of science I

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:01.369
enough about the language of science I
 

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:02.829
enough about the language of science I
think it's really important to know

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839
think it's really important to know
 

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.480
think it's really important to know
what's going on inside the world of

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:04.490
what's going on inside the world of
 

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.429
what's going on inside the world of
science and engineering not to be a

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439
science and engineering not to be a
 

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:08.350
science and engineering not to be a
scientist or an engineer but also to be

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360
scientist or an engineer but also to be
 

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.480
scientist or an engineer but also to be
able to use that language and to

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:10.490
able to use that language and to
 

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.399
able to use that language and to
understand just enough to ask our own

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:12.409
understand just enough to ask our own
 

00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:14.380
understand just enough to ask our own
questions our own humanities questions

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780
can apply a sensitivity to the fact that
 

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.389
can apply a sensitivity to the fact that
different communities have very

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399
different communities have very
 

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:38.970
different communities have very
different worldviews oftentimes and not

00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:38.980
different worldviews oftentimes and not
 

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.310
different worldviews oftentimes and not
just in terms of sort of surface level

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320
just in terms of sort of surface level
 

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.760
just in terms of sort of surface level
cultural differences that were that

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:44.770
cultural differences that were that
 

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.530
cultural differences that were that
we're fairly familiar with but sometimes

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:46.540
we're fairly familiar with but sometimes
 

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.240
we're fairly familiar with but sometimes
at the very fundamental level of like

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.250
at the very fundamental level of like
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.220
at the very fundamental level of like
different ontological assumptions about

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.230
different ontological assumptions about
 

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.310
different ontological assumptions about
the composition of reality and the place

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320
the composition of reality and the place
 

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:57.330
the composition of reality and the place
of humans or sort of communities of

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:57.340
of humans or sort of communities of
 

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.630
of humans or sort of communities of
beings in relation to their landscapes

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640
beings in relation to their landscapes
 

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.680
beings in relation to their landscapes
and to one another so I think it's about

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:03.690
and to one another so I think it's about
 

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.840
and to one another so I think it's about
cultural sensitivity and a sense that

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:06.850
cultural sensitivity and a sense that
 

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.490
cultural sensitivity and a sense that
what's at stake is not just resources

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:08.500
what's at stake is not just resources
 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.280
what's at stake is not just resources
but sometimes something like more

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:11.290
but sometimes something like more
 

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.130
but sometimes something like more
intangible or difficult to measure say

a real science this was a hundred years
 

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.099
a real science this was a hundred years
ago and there were engineers who were

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:35.109
ago and there were engineers who were
 

00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:37.920
ago and there were engineers who were
doing projects they were implementing

doing projects they were implementing
 

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.770

about this to learn that a hundred years

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920
about this to learn that a hundred years
 

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.220
about this to learn that a hundred years

these other social ideals is really

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.030
these other social ideals is really
 

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.120
these other social ideals is really
powerful for engineers to learn about

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:03.130
powerful for engineers to learn about
 

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.000
powerful for engineers to learn about
and to understand because it makes them

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.010
and to understand because it makes them
 

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.070
and to understand because it makes them
reflect on what might be the social

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:08.080

perhaps even realizing it something that

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:21.490
perhaps even realizing it something that
 

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.420
perhaps even realizing it something that
I'd like to add is just I think that

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:23.430
I'd like to add is just I think that
 

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.190
I'd like to add is just I think that
something that the art that I look at it

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200
something that the art that I look at it
 

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.410
something that the art that I look at it
brings to the table is is a way that

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:28.420
brings to the table is is a way that
 

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.550
brings to the table is is a way that
kind of encouraging us to think in a

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560
kind of encouraging us to think in a
 

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.690
kind of encouraging us to think in a
different time scale

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:33.700
different time scale
 

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.000
different time scale
so thinking both at you know we think

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:36.010
so thinking both at you know we think
 

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.589
so thinking both at you know we think
often about like what the life of a

00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599
often about like what the life of a
 

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.480
often about like what the life of a
certain project might be but something

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:39.490
certain project might be but something
 

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.920
certain project might be but something
that I think it's interesting about the

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:40.930
that I think it's interesting about the
 

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.420
that I think it's interesting about the
the acid mine drainage project in

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.430
the acid mine drainage project in
 

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.130
the acid mine drainage project in
particular is how that brings together

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:44.140
particular is how that brings together
 

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.470
particular is how that brings together
you know a century you know at least a

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480
you know a century you know at least a
 

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.039
you know a century you know at least a
century of resource used in the region

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:50.049
century of resource used in the region
 

00:36:50.049 --> 00:36:52.260
century of resource used in the region
that it's it's something that you know

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.270
that it's it's something that you know
 

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.059
that it's it's something that you know
we see this this art that's based and

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:54.069
we see this this art that's based and
 

00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:56.339
we see this this art that's based and
based on this substance that's been in

00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:56.349
based on this substance that's been in
 

00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:58.140
based on this substance that's been in
the process of being created for a

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:58.150
the process of being created for a
 

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.599
the process of being created for a
hundred years and so in not to mention

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:00.609
hundred years and so in not to mention
 

00:37:00.609 --> 00:37:03.270
hundred years and so in not to mention
coal itself so we have just these ways

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280
coal itself so we have just these ways
 

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.799
coal itself so we have just these ways
in which these kind of objects these

00:37:04.799 --> 00:37:04.809
in which these kind of objects these
 

00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:08.059
in which these kind of objects these
cultural objects can just help us think

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:08.069
cultural objects can just help us think
 

00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:12.960
cultural objects can just help us think
more thoroughly about about time yeah I

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:12.970
more thoroughly about about time yeah I
 

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.180
more thoroughly about about time yeah I
would add to that an observation about

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:15.190
would add to that an observation about
 

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.859
would add to that an observation about
time I think something that I found

00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:16.869
time I think something that I found
 

00:37:16.869 --> 00:37:19.049
time I think something that I found
really humbling about thinking about the

00:37:19.049 --> 00:37:19.059
really humbling about thinking about the
 

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:20.579
really humbling about thinking about the
timeline of the relationship between

00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:20.589
timeline of the relationship between
 

00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:23.640
timeline of the relationship between
culture and energy is how short the

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:23.650
culture and energy is how short the
 

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:28.049
culture and energy is how short the
fossil fuel age has been and while we're

00:37:28.049 --> 00:37:28.059
fossil fuel age has been and while we're
 

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:29.579
fossil fuel age has been and while we're
incredibly dependent on these

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:29.589
incredibly dependent on these
 

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:34.109
incredibly dependent on these
technologies now most of human history

00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119
technologies now most of human history
 

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:36.900
technologies now most of human history
has been without the kind of resources

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:36.910
has been without the kind of resources
 

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:41.630
has been without the kind of resources
we take for granted and that we are

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640
we take for granted and that we are
 

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.480
we take for granted and that we are
running out of so a lot of our dystopian

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:45.490
running out of so a lot of our dystopian
 

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.660
running out of so a lot of our dystopian
narratives imagine a world beyond fossil

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:48.670
narratives imagine a world beyond fossil
 

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:51.420
narratives imagine a world beyond fossil
fuels like Walking Dead there's not a

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:51.430
fuels like Walking Dead there's not a
 

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.339
fuels like Walking Dead there's not a
lot of electricity and walking dead for

00:37:53.339 --> 00:37:53.349
lot of electricity and walking dead for
 

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:56.460
lot of electricity and walking dead for
example so I just want us to be humble

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.470
example so I just want us to be humble
 

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.670
example so I just want us to be humble
in our thinking about what is our right

00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680
in our thinking about what is our right
 

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.180
in our thinking about what is our right
to these resources and for and that

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.190
to these resources and for and that
 

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.950
to these resources and for and that
we've had them for a very short time and

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960
we've had them for a very short time and
 

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.599
we've had them for a very short time and
that we may not have them for much

00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:06.609
that we may not have them for much
 

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:15.270
that we may not have them for much
longer it's related to to these how do

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280
longer it's related to to these how do
 

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.059
longer it's related to to these how do
we build curriculum to reflect this

00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:18.069
we build curriculum to reflect this
 

00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:31.109
we build curriculum to reflect this
philosophy curriculum

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119
 

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:33.420
I think that providing accessible

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:33.430
I think that providing accessible
 

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.089
I think that providing accessible
historical examples is one way to relate

00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:36.099
historical examples is one way to relate
 

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:38.160
historical examples is one way to relate
to humans in the past and see how we

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.170
to humans in the past and see how we
 

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.589
to humans in the past and see how we
might be doing things differently or the

00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599
might be doing things differently or the
 

00:38:40.599 --> 00:38:42.749
might be doing things differently or the
same right now it's it's a great

00:38:42.749 --> 00:38:42.759
same right now it's it's a great
 

00:38:42.759 --> 00:38:46.019
same right now it's it's a great
awareness builder I think history I'm a

00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:46.029
awareness builder I think history I'm a
 

00:38:46.029 --> 00:38:48.359
awareness builder I think history I'm a
historian of course is is without

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:48.369
historian of course is is without
 

00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:51.329
historian of course is is without
parallel in that case so I think that

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:51.339
parallel in that case so I think that
 

00:38:51.339 --> 00:38:53.579
parallel in that case so I think that
knowing how we got to where we are and

00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:53.589
knowing how we got to where we are and
 

00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:57.269
knowing how we got to where we are and
also being really conscious about where

00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:57.279
also being really conscious about where
 

00:38:57.279 --> 00:38:59.190
also being really conscious about where
we're at and what our discussions for

00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200
we're at and what our discussions for
 

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.279
we're at and what our discussions for
the future are and seeing that in fact

00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:01.289
the future are and seeing that in fact
 

00:39:01.289 --> 00:39:05.339
the future are and seeing that in fact
we are embedded in some social

00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:05.349
we are embedded in some social
 

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:07.289
we are embedded in some social
assumptions and some mindsets is really

00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:07.299
assumptions and some mindsets is really
 

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:09.749
assumptions and some mindsets is really
important I also think that having

00:39:09.749 --> 00:39:09.759
important I also think that having
 

00:39:09.759 --> 00:39:13.470
important I also think that having
language to cross disciplines is part of

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480
language to cross disciplines is part of
 

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480
language to cross disciplines is part of
this so for Humanities I think having

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:15.490
this so for Humanities I think having
 

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.430
this so for Humanities I think having
the language of science as part of our

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440
the language of science as part of our
 

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.059
the language of science as part of our
discussion not to be a scientist is

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:21.069
discussion not to be a scientist is
 

00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:22.950
discussion not to be a scientist is
important and I think the same for

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960
important and I think the same for
 

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.259
important and I think the same for
science and engineering having the

00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:25.269
science and engineering having the
 

00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:26.460
science and engineering having the
language of humanity's understanding

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:26.470
language of humanity's understanding
 

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.620
language of humanity's understanding
what a close reading is what a critical

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:28.630
what a close reading is what a critical
 

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.859
what a close reading is what a critical
reading is what an image analysis is

00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:30.869
reading is what an image analysis is
 

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.420
reading is what an image analysis is
what is social analysis is I think that

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:33.430
what is social analysis is I think that
 

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.819
what is social analysis is I think that
all of this is really important so

00:39:35.819 --> 00:39:35.829
all of this is really important so
 

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:39.900
all of this is really important so
getting some of each and each yeah and

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:39.910
getting some of each and each yeah and
 

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.569
getting some of each and each yeah and
on that note I also think that issues

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:42.579
on that note I also think that issues
 

00:39:42.579 --> 00:39:44.160
on that note I also think that issues
like energy in the environment or

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.170
like energy in the environment or
 

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.410
like energy in the environment or
something that you know cuts across

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.420
something that you know cuts across
 

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.359
something that you know cuts across
disciplines so well that it's enables

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:48.369
disciplines so well that it's enables
 

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:51.059
disciplines so well that it's enables
students to kind of not just kind of not

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:51.069
students to kind of not just kind of not
 

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:52.829
students to kind of not just kind of not
just think about their you know their

00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839
just think about their you know their
 

00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:54.809
just think about their you know their
immediate work but to how their work

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:54.819
immediate work but to how their work
 

00:39:54.819 --> 00:39:57.450
immediate work but to how their work
connects to you know range of

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:57.460
connects to you know range of
 

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.920
connects to you know range of
disciplines and how they can draw from

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:58.930
disciplines and how they can draw from
 

00:39:58.930 --> 00:39:59.279
disciplines and how they can draw from
that

00:39:59.279 --> 00:39:59.289
that
 

00:39:59.289 --> 00:40:01.499
that
so in teaching first-year writing

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:01.509
so in teaching first-year writing
 

00:40:01.509 --> 00:40:03.720
so in teaching first-year writing
classes based on some of these topics

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:03.730
classes based on some of these topics
 

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:07.440
classes based on some of these topics
it's interesting to see folks who you

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:07.450
it's interesting to see folks who you
 

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.870
it's interesting to see folks who you
know might not you know enter it into

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880
know might not you know enter it into
 

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.279
know might not you know enter it into
the semester wanting to think about

00:40:11.279 --> 00:40:11.289
the semester wanting to think about
 

00:40:11.289 --> 00:40:12.599
the semester wanting to think about
social problems at all

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:12.609
social problems at all
 

00:40:12.609 --> 00:40:14.430
social problems at all
and walk away understanding the way in

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440
and walk away understanding the way in
 

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.009
and walk away understanding the way in
which engineering is you know very much

00:40:17.009 --> 00:40:17.019
which engineering is you know very much
 

00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:20.430
which engineering is you know very much
connected to these these decisions we

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440
connected to these these decisions we
 

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.529
connected to these these decisions we
make as a society as far as how we use

00:40:22.529 --> 00:40:22.539
make as a society as far as how we use
 

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:25.220
make as a society as far as how we use
resources so it's it's a way that we can

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.230
resources so it's it's a way that we can
 

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.229
resources so it's it's a way that we can
just kind of as I said have that common

00:40:28.229 --> 00:40:28.239
just kind of as I said have that common
 

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:30.539
just kind of as I said have that common
language that we can connect all of

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:30.549
language that we can connect all of
 

00:40:30.549 --> 00:40:32.849
language that we can connect all of
these different approaches to problems

00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:32.859
these different approaches to problems
 

00:40:32.859 --> 00:40:37.790
these different approaches to problems
together

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800
 

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.290
yeah yeah and then you know the next

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:43.300
yeah yeah and then you know the next
 

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.200
yeah yeah and then you know the next
class I'm teaching is on waste and so

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.210
class I'm teaching is on waste and so
 

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.480
class I'm teaching is on waste and so
you know that's again something that's

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:48.490
you know that's again something that's
 

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.630
you know that's again something that's
very much a cultural object that we see

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640
very much a cultural object that we see
 

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.480
very much a cultural object that we see
in our everyday lives that that touches

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:54.490
in our everyday lives that that touches
 

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.250
in our everyday lives that that touches
and touches on designed on on

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260
and touches on designed on on
 

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:01.140
and touches on designed on on
engineering on you know all of these

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.150
engineering on you know all of these
 

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:03.930
engineering on you know all of these
kind of problems so it's again this

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:03.940
kind of problems so it's again this
 

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.080
kind of problems so it's again this
common symbol this common something that

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:06.090
common symbol this common something that
 

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.060
common symbol this common something that
allows us all to come together to think

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.070
allows us all to come together to think
 

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:13.230
allows us all to come together to think
about broader environmental issues I'll

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240
about broader environmental issues I'll
 

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.850
about broader environmental issues I'll
just talk very briefly about a class

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:14.860
just talk very briefly about a class
 

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.960
just talk very briefly about a class
that I teach called environmental

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:15.970
that I teach called environmental
 

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.310
that I teach called environmental
literature it's a 19th century

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:17.320
literature it's a 19th century
 

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.610
literature it's a 19th century
literature class and I make the students

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:20.620
literature class and I make the students
 

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.460
literature class and I make the students
go on five nature walks during the

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.470
go on five nature walks during the
 

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.230
go on five nature walks during the
course and that walk has to be at least

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240
course and that walk has to be at least
 

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.140
course and that walk has to be at least
an hour and they can't bring technology

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:28.150
an hour and they can't bring technology
 

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.090
an hour and they can't bring technology
on their walk and students have told me

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.100
on their walk and students have told me
 

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.830
on their walk and students have told me
it's the hardest assignment they've ever

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:31.840
it's the hardest assignment they've ever
 

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.190
it's the hardest assignment they've ever
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think
 

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.110
been given at Carnegie Mellon so I think
what we're all trying to do is really

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.120
what we're all trying to do is really
 

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.880
what we're all trying to do is really
kind of peel things back and take

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:38.890
kind of peel things back and take
 

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:43.110
kind of peel things back and take
students just kind of remove again some

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:43.120
students just kind of remove again some
 

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.400
students just kind of remove again some
of the things we've become dependent

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:44.410
of the things we've become dependent
 

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:47.820
of the things we've become dependent
upon to think about what what was the

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:47.830
upon to think about what what was the
 

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.040
upon to think about what what was the
Rose experience and even if we can't

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.050
Rose experience and even if we can't
 

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.930
Rose experience and even if we can't
recreate it what would it mean to be

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:51.940
recreate it what would it mean to be
 

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:59.040
recreate it what would it mean to be
without our technology for an hour thank

00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.050
without our technology for an hour thank
 

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:00.390
without our technology for an hour thank
you very much to our panelists

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400
you very much to our panelists
 

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.070
you very much to our panelists
fascinating talk thank you

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:03.080
fascinating talk thank you
 

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:10.780
fascinating talk thank you
