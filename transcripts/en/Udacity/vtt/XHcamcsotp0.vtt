00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's go through it together--our parse tree

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is just going to be a list of elements, and here there are three:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
hello, the tag element, and yaga.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And hello is just a simple Word_element

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so it fills in our first blank.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then we've got this tag_element and the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
trick to getting this question right is looking

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
at the order in which we store them up here--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
more or less in order of appearance.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So since this is a &lt;bold&gt; tag,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when this next part here is a (b),

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this empty list means there were no particular arguments to our &lt;bold&gt; tag.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here, I'm seeing arguments: color = "red".

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's nothing like that down here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And then inside, we've got the Word_element, baba--and then we're done.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Baba Yaga was a crone or a witch in Slavic folklore

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who was known for--among other things--

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
riding around in a house supported on chickens' legs--fun stuff!
