00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:04.610
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.260
We have a very special
guest here today

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.650
with us, Toby Carlisle.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.900
Welcome to our Talk at
Google, at Author series.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.070
He's going to be talking about
his new book, "Deep Value: Why

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.790
Activist Investors
and Other Contrarians

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.050
Battle for the Control
of Losing Corporations".

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.260
Toby has a unique perspective
on value investing,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.850
much like Google's.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.040
His approach to
value investing is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.310
data driven, just like Google's
approach to engineering.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.030
In his book he uses statistical
analysis and in-depth research

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.650
to give evidence for a simple,
yet counter-intuitive idea.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.240
Losing stocks with
failing businesses

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.980
and uncertain
futures can sometimes

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.890
offer unusually attractive
investment potential.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.500
His work in this area is
very much like Ben Graham's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.280
classic work in his 1934
"Security Analysis" book.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.220
The funny thing about classics
is everyone's heard about them,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.130
very few people have
actually read the classics.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.880
Toby is one of those rare,
few individuals-- investors,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.200
I would say-- who has
been living and breathing

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
Ben Graham's deep value
investing philosophy.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.021
So please help me
welcome Toby Carlisle.

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:26.943
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:29.410
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Thank you.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.650
Hi folks, thank you very much
for having me here today.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.470
I'm very much looking forward
to speaking to Google.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.470
Just a little bit about me,
my name's Tobias Carlisle,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.800
I'm the managing director of
Eyquem Investment Management,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.350
and I manage the Fund and some
separately managed accounts.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.420
My most recent book
is "Deep Value",

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.600
and before that I published
"Quantitative Value",

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.260
co-authored with a gentleman
who did his qualitative research

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.780
through Booth.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.430
I blog at Greenbackd
and I'm just

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
launching a new site called
the Acquirer's Multiple

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.160
that is yet to go live.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.519
The talk today
proceeds in four parts.

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.060
The first part we're
going to discuss

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.080
is the philosophy of deep value.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.320
What is is, its genesis.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.990
Then we're going to look at
some of the behavioral reasons

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.090
that stocks become undervalued
in Contrarians at the Gate.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.600
Third, we're going
to examine some ways

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.210
that we can avoid making
those behavioral errors that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.510
create undervalued stocks.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.320
And finally, we're going to
examine the simple metric

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.040
for generating outstanding
returns in the market.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.590
In 1927, a 33-year-old
Benjamin Graham

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.360
started teaching a
night class at Columbia

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.110
that he called
Security Analysis.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.010
He offered practical
counsel for the students who

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.810
took the class, but the
thrust of what he taught

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.770
was that a security
had an intrinsic value,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.830
and it was distinct from
its market price, which

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.850
you could observe on the
stock market in any given day.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.210
And he argued that when there
was a sufficient mis-pricing,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.320
either the price
was at a discount

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.280
to the intrinsic value,
or, in some instances

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.150
where the price was at a
premium to the intrinsic value,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.550
you could trade long or
short and rely on the fact

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.800
that there would be
some mean reversion

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.325
to bring the price back
to intrinsic value.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.830
In 1929, the stock market
had its worst crash,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.520
it continues to be the
worst crash to date.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.790
From its peak it to its
trough it fell almost 90%.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.634
In 1932, fully three years
after the bottom of that crash,

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:50.300
the stock market still
hadn't recovered.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.330
Graham authored a series of
articles for Forbes Magazine

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.320
where he pointed out some
research that he had undertaken

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.180
that said that of the 600
issues on the stock market

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.420
at that time, 200 of them traded
for less than their liquidation

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.350
value.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.014
So they traded for less
than what the shareholders

00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:11.680
in those companies
could get out of them

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.380
if they wanted to wind them up.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.860
And then a sizable portion
of those traded at a discount

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.649
to their net cash
backing, which is

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.261
after paying out all of the
liabilities of the company,

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.260
there would still be cash
lift in a bank account

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.580
and you could buy the
entire company for less

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.720
than that amount.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.060
And he said-- he likened it to
corporate gold dollars being

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.580
traded for $0.50 or less
with strings attached.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.030
That sort of enduring iconic
image continues to be the way

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.160
that we think about
value investing,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.230
that it is an attempt
to buy a $0.50 dollar.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.970
Some years later,
John Burr Williams

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.450
added some additional
color to the way

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.460
that we go about
valuing a company,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.910
and that is to look at all of
the cash inflows and outflows,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.990
discount them back
to the present day,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.260
and that gives you
an intrinsic value.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.830
So as you hunt in the market
for these particular stocks,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.880
you can find those
at the greatest

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.880
discount to intrinsic value
will tend to underperform

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.100
and those at the greatest
premium to intrinsic value

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.720
will tend to-- sorry,
will tend to underperform.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.520
So this chart shows, if we rank
every stock in the universe--

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.870
and this is a global universe,
so 22,000 positions-- if we

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.280
give them all a ranking, price
to cash flow, price to book,

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.780
price to earnings, we
take the average of those

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.150
and then we rank them
into five groups.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.490
The glamour quintile, which
is the most expensive,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.690
tends to underperform
on average,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.892
and the value quintile,
which is the cheapest,

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:50.725
tends to outperform.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.350
So when we're seeking to
invest in these companies,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.650
one thing that we can
observe is that price

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.870
tends to fluctuate more
than intrinsic value, which

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.500
only moves much more slowly.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.870
And so when you find these
occasional moments when there's

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.619
a large discount
or a large premium,

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:16.285
you can invest to
capture that discount.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.560
The question that
I'm often asked

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.800
is what is it that causes
the discounted price

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.747
to return to its
intrinsic value?

00:06:28.747 --> 00:06:30.580
And it's a question
that Benjamin Graham got

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.500
when he was appearing before
a Senate committee in 1955,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.760
and the chairman said,
how do you close that gap?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.594
Is it by advertising,
or what happens?

00:06:41.594 --> 00:06:43.260
And Graham gave one
of his great answers

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.030
where he said it's
a mystery, and it's

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.440
as much of a mystery to him
as it is to everybody else.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.630
But we understand it
to mean mean reversion,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.450
and so what this
talk is about is

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.100
what are the actual
mechanics of mean reversion.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.790
What are the things that
make mean reversion occur.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.490
This is actually Graham's list.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.180
He talks about, in
one, that's just

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.680
general improvement
in the industry.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.320
And this is a very
common occurrence

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.820
that the industry
is in a trough,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.290
the business is
in a trough, it's

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.340
got a period of bad luck,
perhaps some bad management,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.620
and either the
incumbent managers

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.060
turn the company around
or external managers

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.180
are brought in.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.930
Less commonly, a
sale or a merger,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.690
or some sort of liquidation.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.780
Some time later, behavioral
researchers DeBondt and Thaler

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.140
examined securities on
the basis of a variety

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.800
of different metrics, but
they're looking, particularly

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.790
in this case, for undervaluation
and overvaluation measured

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.860
by price to book value.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.580
So they found that by
selecting the decile, which

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.540
is 1/10 of stocks that
were most undervalued,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.710
and the decile of stocks
that were most overvalued,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.710
and then examining the
trend in earnings per share,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:13.240
you find this unusual phenomenon
where the earnings for the most

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.970
undervalued stocks have
been falling for the years

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.540
previous to the
portfolio's being formed,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.050
and for the most
overvalued stocks,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.350
they've been increasing.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.452
And that's the reason
that one is overvalued

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:24.660
and the other is undervalued.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.860
But then this very
unusual thing happens

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.220
once the portfolios are formed.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.960
The overvalued
stocks still continue

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.330
to grow but they
slow a great deal,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.960
and the earnings per share
of the undervalued stocks

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.150
begin to improve at this stage.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.110
And four years
hence, on average,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.390
the undervalued stocks which
have been selected simply

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.290
based on their undervaluation
have actually earned more

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.870
and are earning more than
the overvalued stocks which

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.475
had the highest rate of growth.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.680
It's a phenomenon that we
see over and over again

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.050
in the research.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.740
So this is another
interesting study

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.360
subsequent to the
Debondt and Thaler

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.080
research by Lakonishok,
Shleifer, and Vishny.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.570
They said, well, if
it is in fact the case

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.190
that there is this main
reversion in the fundamentals

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.640
of the business, if
there's mean reversion

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.560
in the earnings, if the
undervalued stocks do start

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.270
creating earnings growth and
the overvalued stocks' earnings

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.420
slow, then what if we went
and selected portfolios

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.090
specifically on-- we
could find an undervalued

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.430
portfolio with very slow growth
and an overvalued portfolio

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:35.020
with very high growth, and an
undervalued portfolio with very

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.100
high growth, which would
be the better portfolio?

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.980
So they sorted the universe
into three portfolios

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.880
on the basis of valuation,
from most overvalued

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.204
to the median average, and
to the most undervalued.

00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:51.120
And then they divided
each of those portfolios

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.989
into the highest rate of
growth, the mid rate of growth,

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:55.280
and the slowest rate of growth.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.220
So there were nine
portfolios formed.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.560
I've selected three of them
here to show you the phenomenon.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.490
So the glamour portfolio has
the highest rate of growth,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.985
and you can see an earnings,
cash flow, book value,

00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:10.110
operating earnings, all of
those are growing higher

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.974
than the other two
value portfolios.

00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:13.390
But you can also
see that you have

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.815
to pay a higher multiple
to acquire these stocks, so

00:10:16.815 --> 00:10:21.620
at 19.6 times 10.8 times cash
flow, they're expensive stocks.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.300
On the other end
of the scale, these

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.490
are two of the three
value portfolios.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.490
The high growth value
portfolio is still

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.030
growing at quite a
high rate of growth,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.750
but it's available for
a much cheaper multiple,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.890
and the contrarian
value portfolio,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.660
which is the very
low growth portfolio,

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.790
is growing at a low rate and
available on a low multiple.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.960
So as you would expect,
the value portfolios

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.270
outperformed the
glamour portfolios.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.470
But this is the really
interesting thing.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.810
The low growth
undervalued portfolio

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.079
outperforms the high growth
undervalued portfolio,

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:04.620
and this is something
really unusual,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.578
and I think it's something
that is a little bit

00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:08.440
counter-intuitive
because we sort of like

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.130
to think that high
growth undervalued stocks

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.400
are bargains, gems in the rough.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.080
And it turns out
that mean reversion

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.800
acts on those portfolios as well
to pull the high growth back

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.820
and to improve the low growth.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.930
So this is just that previous
slide with the glamour

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.664
portfolio removed, just so
we can see specifically.

00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:32.830
The thing that I want to
draw your attention to here

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.070
is that the contrarian
value portfolio,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.020
in many of these categories,
is actually a little bit more

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.490
expensive than the
high growth portfolio.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.730
The reason possibly is
that earnings are little

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.630
bit more anemic, cash flow
is a little bit more anemic.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.060
So you can see on
the book value basis,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.240
the high growth value portfolio
is slightly more expensive.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.830
But it's very definitely growing
much faster than the contrarian

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.580
value portfolio.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.050
So the real driver
of returns here

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.914
was the undervaluation and
not the rate of growth.

00:12:03.914 --> 00:12:05.830
And then there was some
mean reversion as well

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.538
which pushed down the
high rate of growth

00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:10.140
and made the high
growth value less

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.550
attractive over a
period of time compared

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.930
to the contrarian value.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:21.290
This was an earlier examination
conducted by Michelle Clayman.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.010
There was a book written
by Tom Peters that came out

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.790
in the early '80s called
"In Search of Excellence",

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.270
and Peter said that he'd
identified the characteristics

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.220
that created
excellent companies.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.240
He looked at a variety of these
quantitative financial type

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.270
elements.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.210
The book has been described
as the book of the century,

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.490
possibly by Tom Peters himself.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.680
I've never read it, but
I've read the research,

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.630
and the research is compelling.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.809
These are his criteria
for an excellent company,

00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:54.350
so they have very high rates of
asset growth, very high rates

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.910
of equity growth,
they're expensive,

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.790
and they have excellent returns
on capital, assets, and equity.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.507
So Clayman said, well, let's
create the opposite portfolio.

00:13:05.507 --> 00:13:07.090
Let's call them
unexcellent companies,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.173
and we're going to find
those with the worst asset

00:13:09.173 --> 00:13:14.060
growth, equity growth, low
valuation, anemic returns

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.627
on capital, equity,
and assets, and then

00:13:16.627 --> 00:13:18.210
we're going to track
their performance

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.130
over a period of time.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.880
The thing that I'll
draw your attention to

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.170
is just the valuation alone.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.799
You can see here,
this is some research

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.840
that appears in the book.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.450
It was conducted by Barry
Bannister at Stifel Financial.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.790
The unexcellent portfolios
have vastly outpaced

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.380
the excellent portfolios.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.057
For an early period
of time, and it's

00:13:40.057 --> 00:13:42.390
difficult to see on this
chart, the excellent portfolios

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.060
did actually
outperform the market.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.660
But not since you get a better
return investing in the S&amp;P 500

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.070
than you do investing in these
very high quality, high growth

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.210
companies, these
excellent companies.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.730
And you get a much
better return investing

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.310
in the ugliest of the ugly.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.350
The question that
naturally people

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.080
ask when they see
that data is well,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.870
is there some
advantage to investing

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.080
in the excellent
portfolios because they

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.680
offer some sort of
risk protection?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.480
Is it a downside
protection phenomenon,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.260
is it that when the world
goes into a recession,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.730
you want to be in
these things that

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.430
generate higher rates of growth?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.920
And the answer is no.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.230
Bannister looked at periods
where the global growth

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.150
was below average
and above average.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
The shaded area is where
global economic growth

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.530
is below average,
and the lighter areas

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.260
are where global and economic
growth exceeds the average.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.660
And you can see quite
clearly, there's

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.710
no real method to
when unexcellent

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.210
outperforms or
excellent outperforms.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.310
It does outperform occasionally,
but it doesn't necessarily

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.210
need a bad state of
the world to do so.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:07.000
I always like to use this motif
to describe the nature of what

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.990
occurs in these
undervalued companies.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.260
Most companies are going
to go through this cycle.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.470
There are a very small
number of companies

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.140
that can avoid this cycle, but
a very small number of them.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.515
This is from a woodcut
from Albrecht Durer in 1494

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:26.140
from a book called
"The Ship of Fools",

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.445
which is about some fools on
a ship to a fool's paradise.

00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:33.570
And they go through, they
have a number of follies.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.200
One of them is hubris about
where they are and disregarding

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.110
the role of luck in their
own lives, good and bad.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.880
So it's the wheel of fortune,
that's Fortuna's hand puppeting

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.580
the wheel in the top
left hand corner.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.510
The ass at the top
is regno, "I reign".

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.110
And you can see that he's
at the very pinnacle,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.020
and he's about to descend
on the other side,

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.880
but instead he reaches
out for the sun.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.790
And this is what, in the
academic financial literature,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.280
they describe as
naive extrapolation.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.300
You imagine that
your current state

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.970
will continue on
when, in actual fact,

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.330
mean reversion is a much
more likely outcome.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.240
So the next,
regnavi, "I reigned".

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.880
He's slowly turning
back into a man

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.530
as he descends down
the other side.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.130
And this is, perhaps,
where deep value investors

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.280
want to stake their claim.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.940
Sum sine regno, "I am
without a kingdom",

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.810
he's not even visible
on the wood cut.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.364
And then back up the other
side, regnabo, "I will reign",

00:16:35.364 --> 00:16:37.280
maybe that's another
good time to invest, too.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.190
If what we're looking for is
fundamental weakness, declining

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.320
earnings, and
undervaluation, the thing

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.830
that makes them difficult
to buy for other investors

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.260
makes it equally
difficult for us to buy.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.007
So how can we avoid making
the behavioral errors

00:16:57.007 --> 00:16:58.340
that other investors are making?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.370
How can we not be the naive
extrapolation investor,

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.000
and become a contrarian
value investor that

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.230
captures that upside performance
from buying companies

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.489
with ugly fundamentals?

00:17:09.489 --> 00:17:11.030
There's been a great
deal of research

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:17.930
into this area of the role of
statistical prediction models

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.740
and experts.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:25.720
It's a counter-intuitive area
of study for this reason.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.540
So a professor went and
studied 1,000 admissions

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.820
to hospital of
depression or psychosis,

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.130
and apparently, on
initial presentation,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.810
they can appear very similar.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.050
Then there's a subsequent
diagnosis several weeks

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.590
or months later where they're
able to determine properly

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.490
whether the patient
who presented

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.480
was in fact psychotic
or depressed.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.510
So he created, by
examining the admission

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.590
records and the
subsequent diagnoses,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.260
he created a simple
questionnaire

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.027
that could be administered
by psychologists when

00:17:59.027 --> 00:18:00.610
these people presented
to the hospital

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.670
and they could make
a determination.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.030
Without the benefit
of the model,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.500
the worst psychologists got it
right about 55% of the time,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.190
on average about 62%, and
the very best psychologists

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.580
got it right 67% of the time.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.020
The simple model in back test
got it right 70% of the time.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.490
The professor distributed
the questionnaire

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.860
to a variety of different
psychologists in the hospital.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.740
There were two
basically inexperienced

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.440
who were students,
and then there

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.190
were clinical psychologists
who were actually

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.200
treating patients,
and they found

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.180
that without the
benefit of the model,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.600
the inexperienced
students got it

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.900
right about 59% of the time,
the experienced clinical

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.330
psychologists got it right
about 64% of the time.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.350
The inexperienced
psychologist, with the benefit

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.655
of the model but the ability to
override the model's output got

00:18:53.655 --> 00:18:57.390
it right about 2/3 of the
time, and the experience

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.040
psychologists, with the
benefit of the model,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.780
got it right 75% of the time.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.800
But this is the really
incredible thing.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.430
The simple model by itself
outperformed all of them.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.870
The reason is that
we make errors

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.090
when we attempt to apply a model
and we don't follow the model's

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.119
output, and that leads
us to underperform

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:19.660
what the simple
model does by itself.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:29.790
The reason that people-- when
people observe this research,

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.510
they often say, if
you have a case that's

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.650
so different from
the base, right,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.180
from the statistical research
that you've conducted,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.030
doesn't it make sense then to
be able to override the model?

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.150
And the example
they always give,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.930
you have some sort of algorithm
that predicts whether John will

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.450
go to the theater on
Friday, and now you

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.540
know that he has a
broken leg, shouldn't you

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.577
be able to factor
that into your model

00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:56.910
to determine whether he will,
in fact, go to the theater

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.860
this Friday.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.190
And the answer is no.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.690
And the reason is that we
tend to find more broken legs

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.160
than there really are.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.260
And particularly in this
type of deep value investing,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.505
all of the stocks have what
appear to be broken legs.

00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:17.240
You might be familiar
with "The Little Book

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.370
That Beats the Market", it's
a book by Joel Greenblatt.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:28.740
He took Warren
Buffett's exhortation

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.810
to buy wonderful
companies at fair prices,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.120
and he translated that
into a quantitative model

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.970
that we'll examine in
detail in a moment.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.720
But for the moment,
you just need

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.860
to know that it meant
high quality, however

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.540
that's defined, and good value.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:52.690
He had an experiment
in his own firm

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.470
where he handed out lists of the
stocks selected by the formula,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.690
and he allowed people to, in
their own separately managed

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.170
accounts, to either choose
the stocks that they wanted,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.490
or to have him apply the
formula automatically.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.590
He found that the automatically
applied formula did, in fact,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.230
outperform the market
over two years,

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.810
and by quite a
substantial margin.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.760
He also found that when
people were allowed

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.990
to manage the
portfolio themselves,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.630
they tended to
underperform, and the reason

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.960
is that they cherry-picked
out the very best stocks,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.530
and they were the stocks
that were the ugliest.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.730
You might say well,
they were not experts,

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.680
they were people who were
relying on his expertise.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.760
But then Greenblatt says, we
attempted to do the same thing,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.850
and he found he had
the same outcome.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.090
He underperformed his own model.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:53.770
So that brings us to the golden
rule of statistical prediction

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.040
rules, and that is that simple
models outperform experts.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.620
That simple models continue
to outperform experts even

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.122
when they have the
benefit of the model.

00:22:02.122 --> 00:22:03.580
When we're thinking
about designing

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.170
a quantitative system,
there are several things

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.060
we need to be aware of.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.680
One of them is that the
rules must be simple

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.087
and they must be concrete.

00:22:13.087 --> 00:22:15.420
They must be simple so that
they're able to be followed,

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.350
and concrete so that they're
able to be understood.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:24.900
This is a picture of a pipe,
this is not, in fact, a pipe.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.240
This is a picture of
a picture of a pipe.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.740
And when we're valuing
companies, in many ways,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.800
this is sort of
what we're doing.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.680
We're using some proxy.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.930
And there are a variety of
different models or proxies

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.760
that we can select.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.330
We can choose the
liquidation value,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.300
we can look at the franchise
value, the growth value,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.550
earnings power value,
the acquirers multiple.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.010
We can use any number of
these simple multiples,

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.260
but we're not really getting
the truth of the company.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.054
And so it's important
that we recognize, first,

00:22:57.054 --> 00:22:58.720
that there are
limitations to the model.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.820
Recognizing that the model
is somewhat imperfect,

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.080
we can recognize
then that we do have

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.200
some tool for making a decision.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.430
So the 80/20 rule does apply to
information in investing, too.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.050
You get 80% of the way
there with a simple model,

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.340
and the urge of
most investors is

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.945
to continue to find that
final bit of information that

00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.360
will remove the
uncertainty that they have.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.244
But often by the
time that occurs,

00:23:31.244 --> 00:23:33.160
the uncertainty has been
removed for everybody

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.380
else as well, and
so those low prices

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.250
that you were
attracted to are gone.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.180
The simplest rule, I think,
and one of the most effective,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.550
is the net current
asset value rule.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.530
Graham wrote about this in 1934.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.580
He described it as a rough
measure of liquidating value.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:59.120
So you can see, you look
simply at the balance sheet,

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.464
you ignore the earnings,
the cash flow statement--

00:24:02.464 --> 00:24:04.880
it didn't exist at the time
that Graham put this together,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.700
but you can ignore it for the
purpose of this analysis--

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.000
and then you treat only the
current assets as having value.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.720
So cash is worth cash,
receivables, there's

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.080
some discount applied
to them, inventories

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.900
would vary depending on whether
it's food that can spoil,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.370
high fashion that will be less
valuable in 12 months time,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.470
or something that's going to
continue to be valuable well

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.300
into the future, and then you
can look at the fixed assets

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.930
and determine whether
they have a value.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.270
The research shows
quite comprehensively

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.460
that net current asset
value massively outperforms.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.830
And it's an extraordinary thing
that is such a simple analysis.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.360
So the market in these
instances is always

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.890
a small capitalization,
micro-capitalization

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:56.370
equivalent to what we're looking
at for the net current asset

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.450
value stocks.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:04.610
You can see in the US, that's
a study from 1970 to 1983,

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.510
the net current
asset value portfolio

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.170
did 29% versus 11.5%
for the market.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.690
This is a study that
I conducted in the US,

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.440
'83 to 2010, just continuing
on the second study.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:23.020
So it was a second 27
years and a similar sort

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.467
of outperformance,
maybe more so.

00:25:24.467 --> 00:25:26.050
Which is surprising,
because you would

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.091
think that with all of
the access to information,

00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:30.790
a lot of these positions would
have been arbitraged away,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.860
but they haven't been.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.400
They continue to exist in the
UK and they exist globally

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.930
as well.

00:25:39.396 --> 00:25:40.770
But there are some
unusual things

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:45.080
that you find when you
conduct this sort of research.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.520
The first one is that the
individual net current asset

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.290
value stock is more
likely to go to 0

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.830
than the rest of the market,
and the rate is about 6%

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.320
for a net current
asset value stock

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.830
versus 2.5% for the average
stock in the market.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.590
But as a portfolio,
there are fewer

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.580
down years than the market.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:09.190
And this is perhaps the most
controversial finding, the most

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.190
counterintuitive, and that's
that loss-making net-nets

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.230
actually outperform net-nets
that are profitable.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.590
Within the profitable net-nets,
those that don't pay a dividend

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.760
outperform the ones
that do pay a dividend.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.610
So your instinct might
be to find a net-net

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.550
that pays a dividend
with positive earnings,

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.530
and that would lead you
to underperform what

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:30.946
you can do just
by net-nets alone.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.230
Many of you will know that
Warren Buffett started out

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.940
as a student of Benjamin
Graham's, then he

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.920
worked with him in his
Graham-Newman Corporation,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.300
and then he went out and he
set up his own partnership.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.841
In the early days
of his partnership,

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:52.160
he was very much a
Graham-type investor,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.239
looking at liquidation value.

00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:56.405
One of the early positions
that he put into the fund

00:26:56.405 --> 00:26:58.540
was Sanborn Map.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.660
You had a portfolio
of securities

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.720
and it was trading at $0.65 on
the dollar of that portfolio

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.150
of securities, with
no value given at all

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.810
to the business, which was
making about $100,000 a year.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.310
He got on the board,
he got control,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.040
he liquidated the security
portfolio, paid it out

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:20.249
in a tax-effective manner, and
so he got a 50% return just

00:27:20.249 --> 00:27:22.290
on the portfolio, and then
the business remained.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.810
And the business
continues to exist

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.770
to this day as a geographic
information system

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.650
business in the US.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.500
He had this evolution after
meeting Charlie Munger,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:39.110
and in 1963, he found American
Express mired in a scandal.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.350
American Express is
a financial company,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:46.670
and it had provided
some warehouse receipts

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.410
to Anthony "Tino"
De Angeles, who

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.980
was a commodities
broker and trader.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:59.730
He had figured out that he could
bring soybean oil to the port,

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:03.390
show the inspectors that his
tanks contained soybean oil,

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.790
and then through
pipes and valves

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:08.450
he could fill up with sea water
what had been soybean oil.

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.240
Then they would check
a new tank and it

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.630
would contain the
old soybean oil.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.980
At one stage, he controlled
almost 10 times more soybean

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.402
oil than there was in existence.

00:28:19.402 --> 00:28:21.360
And that was the secret
to his low, low prices.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.210
Eventually he went bankrupt.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.420
American Express had
said that the warehouses

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.510
did in fact contain
the salad oil.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.672
His broker went bankrupt
when the people who

00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:39.380
had lent against those
warehouse receipts

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.838
came looking for
some deep pockets,

00:28:40.838 --> 00:28:42.460
they found American Express.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.990
And American Express
owed something

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.910
in the order of
$175 million, which

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.680
was 10 times its average annual
earnings of the last few years.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.260
So there was a real risk
that American Express

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.880
would go bankrupt at that stage.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.290
Buffet put 40% of his portfolio
into the stock, it recovered.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.080
He bought $13 million
worth of that stock.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.850
That position today,
if he had held it--

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.183
which he didn't all the way
through because he's changed

00:29:08.183 --> 00:29:10.710
investment entities--
that position today

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:14.150
is worth something in
the order of $14 billion,

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.800
which is an enormous return.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.400
He learned from
that that it wasn't

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.680
necessary for these things
to have a liquidating value.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.300
He could, in fact, buy them
on the basis of a franchise.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.758
He made sure that
people were still

00:29:26.758 --> 00:29:29.040
continuing to use
American Express cards,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.970
and so it taught
him that there was

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.620
a different method of investing.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:40.100
In 1972, he found See's Candies.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.400
It was earning something
like $2 million on $8 million

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.640
of invested capital.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.080
They paid $27 million
dollars for it.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.080
He assessed the value in
the order of $45 million,

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.410
so he got a fairly
substantial discount.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.954
And he said at the time when
someone asked him about it,

00:29:55.954 --> 00:29:57.620
are you still a
Grahamite-type investor.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.890
He said I'm 85% Graham, 15%
Phil Fisher, who recommended

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.460
the scuttlebutt
method of investing,

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.293
which is you go and
find as much information

00:30:06.293 --> 00:30:08.290
as you can about the
quality of the business

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.830
and its ability to grow.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:16.750
So See's Candies, between 1972
to 2011, returned $1.35 billion

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.370
to Berkshire Hathaway, which
they've continued to invest.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.670
And it's required only
something like $70 million

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.460
reinvested in the business
to generate those earnings.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.090
So that's what's
known as a franchise.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.050
The lesson that he took from
investing in See's Candies

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.650
was that you're much better
off with these businesses that

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.290
are able to grow over
a long period of time.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.930
He said, though the cigar butt
might have a single puff left

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.500
in it, and that puff is
pure profit, after you've

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.190
smoke that puff,
there's nothing left.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.910
So he stopped being
a cigar butt investor

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.100
and became an investor
in wonderful companies

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.602
at fair prices.

00:30:57.602 --> 00:30:59.310
Looks at Buffett's
investment methodology

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.810
and says that's
been very lucrative

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.670
for a very long period of time.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.720
Assuming we don't have
Buffet's great mind,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.800
are we just able to create
a quantitative version

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:15.910
of the methodology that Buffet
describes in his letters,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.650
and he wrote a book
about that process.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.170
So he decided that good
quality, as defined by Buffett,

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.370
means a high return
on invested capital.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:28.710
So invested capital
is the money that you

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.210
need invested in
the business to run

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.626
the business, the assets of
the business that are actually

00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:34.130
used to produce income.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.360
The higher the return
on invested capital,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.270
the better the business, the
faster it's able to grow.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.970
And for valuation, he
uses an endings yield,

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.370
earnings before
interest and taxes,

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:51.160
because it's agnostic
to the capital structure

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.779
where interest payments on debt
affect the tax that you pay.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.320
If you back out
interest and tax then

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.130
you get this idea of
the operating earnings

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.546
that are coming
into the business.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.760
We tested this
qualitative value,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.020
and we found that the
magic formula does,

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.270
in fact, beat the market, a
comparable market of stocks.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.530
And quite comprehensively, it's
beaten it by 3.5% each year

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.990
from 1974 to 2011.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:24.460
What is really shocking is
that the earnings yield alone,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.390
what I describe as the
acquirer's multiple,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:32.800
beat the magic formula itself,
and the quality measure

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.260
actually underperformed
the market.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.090
The quality measure actually
led the magic formula

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.990
to underperform the
earnings yield alone.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.200
And it's not just
a performance, it's

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.680
not just a raw return story.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:54.090
It's, in fact, a risk-adjusted
return story as well.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.000
The earnings yield alone
generates a better Sharpe ratio

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.770
and a better Sortino
ratio, which is basically

00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:03.310
the amount of growth relative
to the amount of variability

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.046
in the returns.

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:06.420
So you get better
returns and you

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:13.200
get better risk adjusted returns
just using the earnings yield.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.470
And the reason is that
there is this mean reversion

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.930
in return on invested capital.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.950
Michael Mauboussin
has tested this.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:25.750
He's examined a number of
the thousand largest listed

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.130
stocks in the US, ranked
them in order of return

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.730
on invested capital, and then
divided them into five groups.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.120
So the very highest,
and then he's

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.290
ranked them into very
highest and the very lowest.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.980
And then he's examined those
same companies 10 years hence.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.290
And what he finds is that the
highest return on invested

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:49.600
capital mean reverts
towards the mean return,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.300
and the lowest return
on invested capital

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.170
also slightly improves.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.450
So I think if the highest
return on invested capital

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.770
as being regno, at the
very peak of the wheel,

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.140
and sum sine regno at the
very bottom of the wheel.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:07.970
What is the acquirer's multiple.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.674
Well, it's the
enterprise multiple.

00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.590
The reason it's called
the acquirer's multiple

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.150
is it's the metric used
by leveraged buyout firms,

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.179
private equity firms,
activists, to look through

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.989
into the hidden
value of the business

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:25.489
and, in terms of
the mechanics of it,

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.550
it's market
capitalization plus debt.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.850
Because the business
has to fund the debt,

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:34.850
you're able to use the
cash to pay off the debt.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.800
You're also liable for
the preferred stock,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.620
you're also liable for
any minority interests,

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.620
and underfunded pensions, off
balance sheet liabilities.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.020
So it's the real cost
to buy the business.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.560
And then you get access
to EBITDA or EBIT,

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.440
which is the cash
flow coming in.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.409
It turns out that
it doesn't really

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:58.100
make much difference
which you choose.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:05.190
But when we tested them using
data from 1964 to 2011--

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.960
so we tested a variety of
different possible metrics.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.710
Earnings yield, which is the
inverse of the price earnings

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.250
metric, just to
highlight the two.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.550
The acquirer's
multiple using EBIT,

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.460
the acquirer's
multiple using EBITDA.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.370
Free cash flow on enterprise
value, gross profits

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.200
yield, so that's just
revenues minus cost

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.240
of goods sold to give you
the third line on the income

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.531
statement, and book
to market, which

00:35:31.531 --> 00:35:33.530
is the inverse of price
to books so that they're

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.740
arranged in the same way.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.500
We found that the acquirer's
multiple outperformed.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.960
And again, not just
on a raw return basis.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.640
It outperforms on a
risk-adjusted return basis,

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.450
too, and comprehensively.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.670
The four things I want
to take away from today

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.300
are that the very deepest
undervalued stocks

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:02.740
outperform the highest quality
and the highest growth,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.490
even in the
undervalued portfolio.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.310
So undervalued portfolios
divided into high growth

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:10.080
and low growth, the low
growth undervalued portfolios

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.180
will outperform.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.890
So it's better to be
assuming that there's

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.700
going to be some mean reversion,
positive and negative,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.390
rather than to naively
extrapolate out

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.190
the growth in earnings.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.840
Simple models,
applying these ideas

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.000
will always outperform
expert discretion.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.530
So at the beginning
of your process,

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.810
you decide what is important
in the assessment of value,

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:41.570
and then you rigorously apply
that without fear of failure.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.780
And the acquirer's multiple
is the best multiple.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.430
If you're looking for a very
simple application, a very

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.400
simple rule, this
is a very good one.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.940
This is a plug
for the book, so I

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:59.859
go into these studies in a great
deal more depth in the book.

00:36:59.859 --> 00:37:02.150
Each one of them-- there are
several different versions

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:07.130
of this study, so you can see as
we go through the entire book.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.720
The site Acquirer's
Multiple has a place

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.066
to capture your email
and your details

00:37:14.066 --> 00:37:16.190
if you'd like to learn more
when it's up and going.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.290
It will basically
provide a free screen

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.930
of acquirer's
multiple companies,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:25.610
and some commentary and some
research as it goes along.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.420
So if you have any questions,
I'd be happy to hear them.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.590
AUDIENCE: This question is
about the mean reversion.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.181
Amongst the universe
of companies,

00:37:35.181 --> 00:37:37.180
do you think there are
some particular companies

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.820
or industries that are more
flexible towards mean reversion

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.860
and others that are
not, or did you think

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.445
it's the entire universe that
this mean reverts over there.

00:37:49.445 --> 00:37:51.180
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
There are certainly

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.550
some companies do demonstrate
persistence in their ability

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.020
to maintain a high return
on invested capital.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.729
And the question is that if you
look at a large enough universe

00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:05.520
of stocks, would you
just expect that there

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.630
would be no persistence at
all, would you find some just

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.940
by random chance?

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.860
So it's not entirely
clear whether there's

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.460
a reason for their persistence,
or whether it's just

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.830
the luck of looking
at a 10 year period.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.060
[? Maberson ?] has looked
at that specifically,

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.140
and he found that
pharmaceuticals

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.270
and biotechnology
and another group

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.830
did demonstrate
some persistence,

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.360
so they kept the high
returns on invested capital.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.490
But he wasn't able to
determine the factors that-- so

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.800
prospectively, if you look
at a data set without knowing

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.504
the outcome, can you determine
which ones are going to persist

00:38:44.504 --> 00:38:46.170
and which ones are
going to mean revert,

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.960
and he hasn't been
able to do that yet.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.690
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the EBIT divided by EV

00:38:54.690 --> 00:39:00.110
is actually better than
the magical formula.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.490
Is Joel Greenblatt
aware of that?

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.690
I cannot imagine that he
doesn't know that, right?

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.540
It doesn't make a
lot of sense to me.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.748
TOBIAS CARLISLE: He's almost
certainly aware of that.

00:39:09.748 --> 00:39:12.380
AUDIENCE: But you
think he knows that,

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.430
but he still put
[? RYC ?] into the book.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:18.540
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Well, the
magic formula does outperform.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.020
The magic formula
does beat the market.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
I'm sure that he also

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:30.660
has done the study on the
separate metrics, right?

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.217
Do you think he
hasn't done the--

00:39:33.217 --> 00:39:35.050
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Well,
I'm sure that he has.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.540
AUDIENCE: But, OK, OK.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.040
I guess--

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.340
TOBIAS CARLISLE: So
why do it that way?

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.355
Well, you know there are--

00:39:39.355 --> 00:39:41.040
AUDIENCE: You understand
my question, yeah.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.360
TOBIAS CARLISLE: I do.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.930
There are elements
to the business.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.070
It's a marketing business as
much as it's a return business.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.850
AUDIENCE: But I
have the impression

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.760
that Joel Greenblatt
doesn't really--

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.850
I mean, he has enough
money and he doesn't really

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.290
care about making more money.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.560
I mean, I could be wrong.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.680
TOBIAS CARLISLE: In different
states of the world,

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.230
the magic formula will
outperform the earnings yield.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.620
So when the markets are
racing up, in a bull market,

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.641
it's about even.

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.140
But there are some
periods of time--

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.220
the late 1990s
for example, which

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.720
was an unusual period in the
markets-- but the magic formula

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.320
did outperform the
pure earnings yield.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.520
But the earnings yield has
outperformed the magic formula

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.890
over the last 15 years.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:31.510
So it may be a job
security type Idea

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.260
that if you apply the
magic formula rather

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.759
than the earnings
yield, you'll have

00:40:34.759 --> 00:40:36.200
fewer years of underperformance.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.150
When I test that,
that's not what I find.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.120
Basically, the earnings yield
outperforms the magic formula

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.780
pretty consistently,
and pretty consistently

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.940
over five and 10
year rolling periods.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.260
I think it's the better
metric for the reason

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.190
that I've outlined here, that
return on invested capital,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.590
mean reversion, is a
very real phenomenon.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.390
And it's an easily
explained phenomenon.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.320
When you find companies
that are very profitable,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.355
it invites competitors to
go into those industries.

00:41:01.355 --> 00:41:06.677
In industries that low return,
people leave the industry.

00:41:06.677 --> 00:41:07.760
That happens all the time.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.280
It's happening right now
in the oil and gas industry

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.750
with low rates of return,
because the oil price is

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.050
so low, they'll
stop drilling holes.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.925
So that has a flow on effect.

00:41:18.925 --> 00:41:21.600
AUDIENCE: Joel Greenblatt
talks about the fact

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.400
that a lot of these economical
companies are too cheap

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.700
and don't have enough liquidity
for the fund managers to own,

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.820
and also that a lot
of the fund managers

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.720
just want saleable product.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.140
That's the popular
names, and so on.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.540
So could you comment
on the liquidity issue

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:45.186
and moving in and out of
some of these smaller issues?

00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:48.730
TOBIAS CARLISLE: The
book, "The Little Book

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.440
That Beats the
Market", shows a return

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.760
for the magic formula
that's much higher than you

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.600
can achieve if you adjust
for liquidity and for size,

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.110
but you can still
get outperformance

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.350
applying it in a very large
capitalization universe.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.350
And market
capitalization weighted,

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.060
which means you've sized the
positions in the portfolio

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.850
relative to the market
capitalization of the company

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.520
that you're buying rather
than equally weighting them,

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.840
so that means that
you're putting more money

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.923
into the bigger companies.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.860
That is testing for
precisely that problem.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.630
So the results that
I was showing in here

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.080
were actually a market
capitalization weighted.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.890
So you get slightly
better results, again,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.930
if you equal weight,
for the simple reason

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.800
that you're putting more
money into smaller positions.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.480
So market
capitalization weighting

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.460
sort of adjusts for that.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.980
The problem with something like
the net current asset value

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.990
is that it's really not
an investable strategy

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.420
for anybody other
than an individual.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.720
They're just not
around often enough,

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.964
and they're not big enough or
liquid enough to invest in.

00:42:52.964 --> 00:42:55.130
If you have a million dollars
of investable capital,

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.510
it's probably too small for you.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:01.790
But the magic formula and
the acquirer's multiple scale

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.500
beautifully.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.560
You can take the acquirer's
multiple in an S&amp;P 500

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.430
universe, select
the 5% or the 10%,

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:15.730
so the 25 or 50 stocks in that
universe, roll it once a year,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.220
and you'll find
pretty consistently

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.970
that you get quite a lot of
outperformance doing that.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.990
As a broad problem,
liquidity and size

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.370
are issues that reduce returns,
but these metrics still

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.130
do work in large universes.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.020
You get the incredible
outperformance

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.340
if you're able to invest
in the little stuff, which

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.971
small managers and
individuals can.

00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:41.220
Does that answer the question?

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
a very good answer.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.850
AUDIENCE: So I think your
last statements have answered

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.050
a lot of my questions
I was going to ask.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:52.920
But for the magic
formula backtest,

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.760
I would like to
know more details.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.256
So one is, you said the
rebalance is once per year.

00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:00.130
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Yes.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:00.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.204
So how does the backtest deal
with the survival buyers?

00:44:05.204 --> 00:44:06.870
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
That's a good question.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.140
So the database that
we use, Compustat,

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.770
keeps companies that
have failed in the data.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:19.610
So if it failed in 1975, the
backtester would have bought it

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.060
and could have
bought it in 1974,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.340
because the data
remains in the database.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.800
So we do a number of things.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.700
In quantitative value,
we outline in some detail

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.660
the process we go
through to backtest.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.770
Basically we do a
number of things.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.590
We lag the data, so one
of the problems you have

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.050
is that you have this
look-ahead bias, which

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.800
is the possibility for
trading on information

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.230
that you don't already have.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.480
And in addition to that, you
have this January effect,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.563
which is quite pronounced.

00:44:47.563 --> 00:44:50.154
So there's some tax loss
selling at the end of the year,

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.820
and then if you invest
assuming that you

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.640
can buy your entire position on
the very first day of January,

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.700
you capture quite a
bump in performance.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:02.640
So what we did is we rebalance
the portfolios on June 30,

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.830
and we used data from
the preceding December.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:13.160
So we use the K data and
we rebalanced in June.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.110
So we're avoiding
that January effect,

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.940
and we're avoiding
the look-ahead bias,

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.795
and then we use a
very good database.

00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:25.860
AUDIENCE: So the basket is
about 30 stocks, in the basket?

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.160
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
It varies depending

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.640
on the size of your universe.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.020
The universe, and depending
on the size of how much you're

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.660
investing and how much time
you want to spend doing it,

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.530
the fewest stocks that you
could possibly do it with

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.730
might be 20.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.030
And the most stocks, you
really don't get much benefit

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.030
beyond about 30.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.080
So somewhere
between 20 and 30 is

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.122
the appropriate size for
portfolio, equally weighted.

00:45:53.122 --> 00:45:55.580
That also means that you can
buy them on a quarterly basis.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.040
So you might buy--
if you're buying 20,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.490
you buy five on a
quarterly basis,

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:04.290
and then you rebalance those
five 12 months and one day

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:07.395
to capture the tax effect.

00:46:07.395 --> 00:46:08.270
Does that make sense?

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.811
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:08.811 --> 00:46:09.630
Yeah.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.582
Thank you.

00:46:10.582 --> 00:46:13.840
AUDIENCE: So if more people
use the same strategy,

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.801
wouldn't your strategy just
be equal to the market?

00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:19.220
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Possibly.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.620
But Joel Greenblatt
wrote that book in 2006.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.350
The magic formula doubled the
return of the stock market

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.710
last year.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.790
So the magic formula
has continued to work.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.456
And the reason that
it continues to work

00:46:30.456 --> 00:46:33.360
is that there aren't that many
value investors out there.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.500
It's a new strategy, and
within that new strategy,

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.190
the deep value investment
is a new strategy.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.130
Most guys who are
value investors

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.660
would try to emulate
Buffett, they're

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.950
franchise-type investors.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.465
There are very few guys who
are really deep value guys.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.720
And there's also this
problem that you'll find.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.030
If you look at the data--
I'll give these positions away

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.556
for free on
theacquirersmultiple.com,

00:47:02.556 --> 00:47:05.000
and you can go ahead there
and you'll be able to see,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.750
they're quite
frightening positions.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.030
You'll be buying very cheap
iron ore mining companies,

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.150
you'll be buying very cheap
oil and gas companies.

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.691
A few years ago, you'd have been
buying for profit education.

00:47:17.696 --> 00:47:18.820
They're frightening to buy.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.160
And that's the real thing
that drives returns.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.110
That's why I went through that
part of the presentation that

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.560
says you have to
follow the model.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.040
That's the most important
thing, without fear of failure,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.209
you can't cherry pick.

00:47:30.209 --> 00:47:32.000
Because what you do
when you cherry pick is

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.910
you do what everybody
else does, and you

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.795
avoid the things that generate
the really big outperformance.

00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:37.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.030
I've got a followup question.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.440
Have you tried the same
strategy in different markets?

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.130
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Yes.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:47.260
Yes, so the magic formula works.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.510
And I discuss this "Deep
Value", but the magic formula

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.810
works in Japan, it
works in the UK,

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.880
and it works in
Europe ex the UK.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.550
In each of those instances,
the acquirer's multiple

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.290
alone outperforms.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:05.377
The only place where
that hasn't happened

00:48:05.377 --> 00:48:07.210
for the period of the
data that we examined,

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.043
which was about 14
years, because there just

00:48:09.043 --> 00:48:11.320
isn't that much
international data.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.250
But Japan, the
magic formula seem

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.350
to outperform the acquirer's
multiple alone in that one

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.532
single region over that 14
year period that we examined.

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:22.605
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:48:22.605 --> 00:48:26.050
So I was wondering, what
does your company do then?

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.852
Do you just follow
the model as well?

00:48:28.852 --> 00:48:31.640
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
So basically, we

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.540
have some additional
things that we do.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:37.610
Quantitative value goes
through, quite comprehensively,

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:40.930
a very big model
that you could use.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.410
And we sort of discuss.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:47.060
You can do things like
avoiding companies

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.060
at high risk of
financial distress,

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.620
avoiding fraud, avoiding
earnings manipulators,

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:55.460
looking for financial
strength, looking

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.160
for quality of earnings.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.120
So that's making sure that the
cash flow into the business

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.700
matches the accounting earnings.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.310
All of those things add a little
bit of additional performance

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.640
at the edges.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.475
But the big muscle movement,
the big driver of performance

00:49:10.475 --> 00:49:13.949
is the acquirer's multiple.

00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:14.990
So yes, that's what I do.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.135
That's what I apply.

00:49:16.135 --> 00:49:18.150
AUDIENCE: One question.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.200
Why won't Buffett move
to liquidator to operate.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.490
Is it because he
had too much money?

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.160
And another question
related to the first book

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.200
of Joel Greenblatt.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.990
He's talking about
the spin off and also

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.710
the special certification.

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:37.750
I think his point is that just
buying those would be good,

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.410
but if you can pick your spot,
yeah, that would be better.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.500
I think his
performance in test was

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.590
like 50%, that's the
highest I've ever known.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.340
Then his way is like this is
the area you want to pick from,

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.290
and then you want
to pick the best.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.160
That is kind of not dissimilar
from what you are saying here.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:04.140
You're saying things like
don't involve any human being.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.731
Just buy everything, right.

00:50:05.731 --> 00:50:06.230
Yeah.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.229
Just want to know your--

00:50:07.229 --> 00:50:11.490
TOBIAS CARLISLE: His first
book, "You Can Be a Stock Market

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:14.920
Genius", which is a terrible
name for a really good book,

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.550
the process that he
describes in there

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:20.280
is a reasonably complex
investment strategy.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.770
It's a strategy that really only
a human being could implement

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.630
at the moment,
because it requires

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:30.430
reading unusual filings and
finding spin-offs or companies

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:33.780
about to pay out a big dividend,
special situation investing.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.950
I don't think he
could have invested

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:42.999
as much money in that strategy
as he can in the magic formula,

00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:45.040
and I think that that's
a more difficult strategy

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.740
to implement.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.320
You can certainly get
expertise in an area

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.590
and understand better
than another area.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.340
Spin-offs, special situations
are really a very broad basket

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.130
of potential things
that you can do,

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.110
and you can become
good in an industry

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:05.015
or good at a particular
thing, and that

00:51:05.015 --> 00:51:06.390
might lead to
better performance.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:09.110
I sort of think that the
broader your strategies,

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.897
and the broader your
potential universe of stocks,

00:51:11.897 --> 00:51:13.730
the better performance
you're going to have.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.813
I think to maintain that
very high rate of return,

00:51:15.813 --> 00:51:17.920
he was paying out lot of
the capital that he was--

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.827
so he'd make the profit and pay
it out, and then do it again

00:51:20.827 --> 00:51:21.410
the next year.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:25.960
Whereas the magic formula's
a compounding strategy.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.710
You roll over whatever
you get and you

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.200
reinvest that compounded
amount, and it's

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.690
a strategy that really shows
how good it is over a longer

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:36.650
period of time, because
you get to that point

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:39.040
where you're investing
larger sums of money

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.429
at a higher rate than a special
situation one, which requires

00:51:42.429 --> 00:51:44.470
that you keep on paying
it out and you're sort of

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.530
limited a little bit
in where you can apply.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:50.072 --> 00:51:51.530
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
Why did he change?

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:53.910
Why'd he change?

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.790
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
Possibly the challenge.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.130
Maybe he had too
much money to invest.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.880
AUDIENCE: So one of
the biggest criticisms

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.870
of any model created
looking at backward

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.070
data is you are
fitting data, right.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:10.400
And so the strategy that is
outlined feels a bit like,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.520
well, let's ignore quality and
go for the liquidation value,

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.040
the enterprise value,
buying price of the company.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.500
And that could be kind
of a valid criticism.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.930
What would be your
answer to that?

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:22.388
TOBIAS CARLISLE:
Well, we've looked

00:52:22.388 --> 00:52:24.190
at it in different markets, too.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:30.340
So I certainly didn't go into
it-- it's not a great marketing

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.790
strategy to tell somebody
that what we're going to do

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.600
is buy the lowest quality
stocks that we can find,

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.530
or not really care
about quality.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:39.940
It's a much better marketing
strategy to go and say,

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.750
what we do is we look for
really high quality stocks that

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:44.440
are undervalued, and
that's what we buy.

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.770
Because that sounds like a
really safe strategy to me.

00:52:47.770 --> 00:52:49.820
If you said I'm going
to ignore quality,

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.890
people think you're crazy.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.150
So I've written an
entire book explaining

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.510
why I ignore quality.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:00.210
We didn't set out to find that.

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.606
It was just
something-- it's sort

00:53:01.606 --> 00:53:02.980
of unavoidable in
the literature.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.240
You find this every
single time you read.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.052
I give a sample of the
studies in the book,

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:10.760
there are a lot more
studies in the book.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.980
There's another thing
that looks at admiration.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.496
So what are your positive
or negative feelings

00:53:16.496 --> 00:53:18.620
about a company, and they
rank all of the companies

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.330
on the basis of how
liked or hated they are,

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.010
then they examine their
performance the following year.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.340
The most hated companies
outperform the most admired

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.590
companies.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:30.080
Morningstar gives
rankings to companies,

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:33.550
this is an A company, A plus,
this one's a B, this one's a D,

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:36.530
this one's an E. The
Es comprehensively

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.350
outperform the As.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.210
Every single time
you look at research,

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.241
and it's so counter
to everything

00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:43.990
you see everywhere
else, where everybody's

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:47.200
saying find the really
high quality ones.

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.920
So I didn't go looking for it.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.430
But when you look at this
sort of strategy outside

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.570
of this market, you find
almost the same thing.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.360
The one exception
to that is Japan.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.550
For whatever reason,
the magic formula

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.670
over the period of the
data that we examined

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.860
outperformed the
earnings yield alone.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.500
Japan's an outlier in a number
of different strategies.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.642
Momentum hasn't worked
in Japan, whereas that's

00:54:10.642 --> 00:54:11.975
worked in lots of other markets.

00:54:14.596 --> 00:54:16.720
Even though Japan has sort
of been gently falling--

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.630
this is just an interesting
side comment-- even though it's

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:24.280
been gently falling since
1990, value investing

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.387
strategies in Japan
have worked really well,

00:54:26.387 --> 00:54:28.720
just buying the cheapest
companies on the basis of price

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.210
to earnings, price to
cash flow, price to book

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.760
has done something
like 20% a year.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.890
So the magic formula might have
just captured a little bit more

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:39.447
of that performance.

00:54:39.447 --> 00:54:41.030
But yes, there's
always a risk of data

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:43.340
mining in this sort of stuff.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.600
I think that the acquirer's
multiple is the way

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.830
that value investors
think about investing.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.850
So if you think about
the way that you're

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.330
instructed in "Security
Analysis" or "The Intelligent

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:54.955
Investor" or any of
Buffett's letters,

00:54:54.955 --> 00:54:57.960
he says think about
buying the company,

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.056
and it's think about
buying the entire business.

00:55:00.056 --> 00:55:02.680
You're not buying a share of it,
you're buying the whole thing.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.725
And that's exactly what the
acquirer's multiple does.

00:55:05.725 --> 00:55:08.280
It says, this is what you pay
for the market capitalization,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.960
but don't forget that you've got
preferred stock, debt, minority

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.110
interests, off balance
sheet liabilities,

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.271
underfunded pensions, other
things that you have to fund.

00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:19.020
But you get the benefit
of the cash that's

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.210
sitting in the bank,
all the net cash,

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.780
and then you have
this discretion

00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.250
to spend the operating earnings
as they're coming in on capex

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.740
or paying down debt, or
various other things.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:31.310
So it's looking
at the same thing

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.630
that big acquirers
look at, and I often

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.280
find that I'm in positions
that somebody else has

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.870
been buying right behind me.

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.280
It's a Carl Icahn
or another activist,

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.370
or a private equity firm.

00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:43.530
Something happens in them.

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.680
Because when they
get very cheap,

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.580
there's a little
bit of instability.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.970
It's not a situation that
should persist like that.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:54.550
There's sort of inviting
external managers

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:58.600
to come in and try to
rectify the situation.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.550
Data mining is always
a problem, but I

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.050
think there are a
variety of reasons

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:03.830
why this strategy
should work quite well,

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.410
and it does work quite well
in different time periods

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.865
and in different markets.

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:10.890
AUDIENCE: Buffett talks
about holding stocks

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:12.750
for the long term,
and one of the reasons

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.260
that he likes it is because
of the tax consequences.

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.560
Can you talk a little
bit about the difference

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:19.480
between trying to find
companies that you

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.850
can hold for a long period
of time versus rebalancing

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:23.485
and using the deep
value strategy?

00:56:23.485 --> 00:56:25.360
TOBIAS CARLISLE: This
is one of the arguments

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.280
for-- this is what the franchise
investors are trying to do.

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.890
They want to buy
that company that

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:35.610
can sustain those very high
returns on invested capital,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:40.100
and ideally grow and compound
away, throwing off cash

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.690
while they're doing it so that
10 years or 20 years from now,

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.730
you're getting out
of it in dividends

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:48.290
what you invested
in it, and it's

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.960
a much more valuable company.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.457
So if you think about the
process of going and finding

00:56:53.457 --> 00:56:55.290
one of those companies,
knowing that there's

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:58.667
that mean reversion in
return on invested capital,

00:56:58.667 --> 00:56:59.750
what would you rather buy?

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.710
Do you want to buy one that has
a very high return on invested

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:05.770
capital that might mean revert,
or are you better off finding

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:08.470
one that's very cheap,
that might be at a trough,

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.410
that you can hold
for seven or eight

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:14.670
or nine or ten years
that reverts up.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:17.890
I think you've got as
much chance of selecting.

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.507
The challenge is
not to buy something

00:57:20.507 --> 00:57:22.090
that looks like it's
high quality now,

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.720
the challenge is to
buy something and hold

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.160
something that is high quality.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.010
So we all want to
buy the same stocks.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:29.030
Maybe I haven't made
that clear enough.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:30.860
We all want, I want
to buy, everybody

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.780
wants to buy the really
high-- everybody wants

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.450
to own the really
high quality stock,

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.920
the compounding machine that
has the very high returns

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.280
on invested capital.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.320
But can you use historical
data to identify them?

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:43.260
It's not clear.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.096
But what is clear is
that buying the ones

00:57:45.096 --> 00:57:46.720
with higher returns
on invested capital

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.230
don't necessarily
turn into ones that

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:53.112
have high returns on invested
capital subsequently.

00:57:53.112 --> 00:57:56.070
AUDIENCE: So one thing you
talk about in the book is,

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.900
one of the reasons
this strategy works

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:02.320
is because of activist investors
are kind of arbitraging

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:09.160
into an alternate market where
companies are being traded, not

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.210
because they want the
stock to trade high,

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:14.010
but because they want to
take control of the company.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.390
And so activism is a
pretty important kind

00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:18.510
of catalyst to this strategy.

00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:23.170
What do you think about this
strategy working for companies

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:26.830
where the incumbent management
is an owner operator,

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:28.770
and they have motivations
that are completely

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:32.870
independent of the minority
shareholder motivations,

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.580
and not allowing the
activists to get in.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:37.300
So I'm thinking like
in countries in Asia,

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.530
where a lot of the companies
are owner operator companies.

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:42.590
They really have really
different motivations,

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:45.290
and even though it could
be cheap on the acquirer's

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.330
multiple, what are
your perspectives

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:49.570
on why would it work
in those markets

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.365
when the founders have no
reason to let anyone in?

00:58:53.365 --> 00:58:54.990
TOBIAS CARLISLE: You
might need to look

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:57.700
at what they're doing with the
cash flows when they get them.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:02.010
Are they paying
them out, are they

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:07.310
using them to expand the size
of their kingdom, are they

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.710
investing them in lower
return businesses?

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:19.690
I think that it definitely
does work in the US,

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:22.320
because you have that tension
when somebody comes in.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.450
But I think if
you look in the US

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.770
at the-- and this is
something that I looked at,

00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:29.640
the number of those companies
that are actually taken over

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.640
or have some sort
of activist event

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.640
occur is actually
still quite small.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.520
It's only about 1/20.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.820
And so for the other 19 it's
simply that mean reversion

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.000
in the business that
generates the returns.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.910
So when you're looking at Asia,
if you're looking at Japan,

00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:48.674
for example, where it's
a fairly insular society,

00:59:48.674 --> 00:59:50.090
but there are some
sort of inroads

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:52.911
being made by American
activists there.

00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:54.410
Even though the
period of time where

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.237
there wasn't a lot
of activist activity,

00:59:56.237 --> 00:59:58.570
there still were quite good
returns to those undervalued

00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:01.210
companies, even [INAUDIBLE]
across shareholdings.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.840
And I acknowledge now that they
have been very undervalued,

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.010
and maybe they're less so
now over the last few weeks.

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:08.890
But it still has work there.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:12.230
I don't think it's
necessary for it to work,

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:17.330
but there are always
metaphysical reasons

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:19.810
outside the realm
of the backtesting

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.760
that I can't answer,
and you're sort

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.100
of going on faith a little bit.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.490
Perhaps if those
markets open up, too.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:31.090
They continue to open up and
they adopt more external type

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:34.169
management, because it's
a globalising world.

01:00:34.169 --> 01:00:35.960
They have to sell
outside their boundaries,

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.815
so they need different
types of management.

01:00:37.815 --> 01:00:40.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for your talk.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.640
It was great.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.840
TOBIAS CARLISLE: Thank you.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.390
