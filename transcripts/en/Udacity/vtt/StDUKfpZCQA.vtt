00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.610
The other alternative, or
another big alternative,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.900
is actually top Q-learning
which is what you described.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.400
&gt;&gt; You basically take whichever thing
had the most associated with it.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.970
&gt;&gt; The most value.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.740
Okay, yeah.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.290
Good.
&gt;&gt; The most value.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.910
And that works pretty well, again those
are the kind of things that you would

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.260
probably come up with,
if you just spend a little bit of time.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.120
Just say well what are the obvious
things that you could do,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.510
both of those make sense.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.460
It of course also has a problem and
that problem is that the agent,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.970
well, there are several problems but
one that isn't necessarily obvious, is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.810
the agent that happens to have given the
most Q-value to a particular action may

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.500
also give very nearly the same Q-value
to all the other actions as well.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.700
So it doesn't actually
have a strong preference,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.680
it just happens to put
high value on everything.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940
And so you're not really doing much for
it either.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.890
Meanwhile, make every other agent might,
for example, like the second action.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.350
For that particular agent.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.970
And so it makes a lot more sense to take
the second action but you can't because

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.400
by a quirk of fate the other action
got slightly more value to it for

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.770
just that one agent.pericardial sac
&gt;&gt; So

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.000
it starts to feel a little
bit like a negotiation.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.282
&gt;&gt; Right, which is why there's
something called negotiated W-learning.

00:01:12.282 --> 00:01:16.210
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] W-learning.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.080
&gt;&gt; So,
this is a lot more complicated and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.180
I can't write it down in just
a fancy little equation like that.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.410
But what negotiated W-learning
basically boils down to is,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.230
the agent with the most to loose gets
to figure out what the action is.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.330
So you sort of minimize loss
rather than maximize an average or

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.480
pick the best thing.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.630
So you look at the the subagent that,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.380
basically what you do instead of looking
at the things that everyone thinks might

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.960
be good an average of them are doing a
max over them, if you look at the things

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.660
where the difference between
the maximum choice and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.960
the minimum choice are really large and
let that agent make a decision.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.150
And just sort of weighted
across all of the actions.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.780
It can be arbitrarily complicated but

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.450
basically you don't want any agent to
lose as opposed to having agents win.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.000
And all of these have their strings and
all these have their weaknesses And

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.140
they're all very kind of cool and
under different circumstances.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.060
Greatest mass makes sense,
in other circumstances top makes sense,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390
and negotiated is good for
other situations.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.860
And you can come up with
lots of other things,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.870
the key thing is that you
need to do arbitration.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.580
The problem with all of these though,
all of these methods and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.820
any other methods that you come up with
is that they're terrible, and in fact,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.860
They're impossible.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.250
What does that mean, you say.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.750
&gt;&gt; What does that mean?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.560
&gt;&gt; I'm going to
summarize it simply this.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.190
The very first example you gave,
you said, or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.505
the very first response that you gave
to me when I described greatest mass

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:50.650
Q-learning is you said, what you're
really doing is you're voting.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.770
&gt;&gt; And
voting is definitely not impossible.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.490
But as you know,
there is an impossibility result for

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.750
voting and
that is arrows impossibility result.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.670
And if you don't know what arrows
impossibility result is for voting,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.210
then you need to stop what you're
doing right now and go look it up.
