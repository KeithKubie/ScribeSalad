00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:16.356
This might seem like a far-away place

00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:18.111
in a far-away land.

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:21.472
My house is right there in the middle.

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:23.472
This was 1992 L.A. Riots.

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:24.759
And I remember being 8 years old

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.679
and looking out there

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.292
and thinking to myself,

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:31.810
"This is it, this is game over. I'm done."

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.826
The military came in,

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:33.992
the cops came in,

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.412
and I thought they were going to save us,

00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:38.782
and for some reason they kept on pointing the guns at my people.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.820
So I grew up angry,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.095
I grew up mad.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:46.759
I struggled watching my parents pay rent at the end of the month.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.353
Sometimes they had to take food out of their mouths

00:00:48.353 --> 00:00:52.877
so that we, my two younger sisters and I, could eat.

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:55.484
And the people that I saw taking care of their family

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:59.640
and taking care of business were the gang members.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.324
So I considered that as a career path,

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:03.074
not because they were the ones that,

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:05.681
you know, had the girls, had the cars,

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:09.019
it was because they were the ones who took care of their families.

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:13.387
And I love my family enough to even to consider that as a possibility.

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:15.141
But it wasn't always bad.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.810
If you haven't put two and two together,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.853
I'm a Dodgers fan.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:20.206
I like the Dodgers even more so

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:23.009
because Dodgers Stadium sits in the middle of the Elysian Park,

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.873
one of the biggest parks in L.A.,

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:28.439
and I remember going out on the weekends with my family

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.688
and for la carne asada and sharing our cultura

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:32.946
and them taking me on trails

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:35.815
and showing me all this amazing stuff that they knew.

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:38.595
I grew up, I went to Dorsey High School.

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:39.761
You might not know Dorsey that much,

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.933
but you might know Crenshaw High School.

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.196
Crenshaw and Dorsey are rival high schools,

00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:45.389
but they are more than just rivals

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.608
in the traditional sense of rival high schools,

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.486
they are the birth place of The Bloods and The Crips.

00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:53.752
So I was in 9th grade detention,

00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:55.892
and they gave me an ultimatum:

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:59.617
They said, "Either you stay in detention,

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:01.935
or you go to this thing called Eco Club."

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:05.340
And I said, "What?!? Eco Club?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.724
Forget you!"

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.295
But I took a chance and I went over to Eco Club.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.366
And the first thing that they said was,

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.377
"Grab a bag of seeds and let's go out."

00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:17.026
And I picked jalapeños

00:02:17.026 --> 00:02:20.556
because I wanted to grill salsa for my mom at the end of that.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.587
And they tricked me!

00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:25.746
Then all of a sudden, I started worrying about photosynthesis

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:27.607
and the pH balance,

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:29.827
and the UV radiation,

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:32.610
and all this different stuff that would make my jalapeños grow.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.492
At the end of that semester, they gave me an opportunity

00:02:34.492 --> 00:02:36.692
to go to the Teton Science Schools in Wyoming.

00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:39.016
For a kid who has never been out of South Central,

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:40.794
to see mountains for the first time,

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:43.452
to look up at the night sky and count,

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:45.780
I couldn't even count, the stars.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.626
For the first time in my life at the age of 15

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:51.600
I saw more stars than I could count.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.880
I had to pinch myself and look at that shooting star

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.705
and say, "No, that's not the ghetto bird coming up at me."

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:01.785
And the ghetto bird, you won't find in the Audobon book,

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.544
it's a police helicopter in case you don't know.

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:06.801
And I went back home and I found mentors and friends

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:09.224
and family and people who supported me in this,

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:12.160
and in 2005, this guy named Richard Louv

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.638
wrote a book called &lt;i&gt;Last Child in the Woods&lt;/i&gt;,

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.943
and he coined a phrase called "nature-deficit disorder".

00:03:17.943 --> 00:03:19.225
It's not a medical term, don't worry,

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:20.779
you don't have to take drugs for it,

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.090
it's an easy fix:

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.902
all you have to do is get outside.

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:31.465
Because we have 7 billion people in the world today,

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:33.823
but if you were to put all those 7 billion people

00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:36.195
shoulder-to-shoulder with each other,

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:39.814
they could all fit in the city of L.A.

00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:41.767
It's not necessarily that we are running out of space,

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:44.172
it's how we are using that space up.

00:03:44.172 --> 00:03:45.928
The average U.S. teenager now spends

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:48.625
somewhere between 40 and 65 hours a week

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.399
connected to some type of media device,

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.392
some kind of technology.

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:55.077
That's a full-time job!

00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:56.537
We're not saying that its bad,

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.556
we're just saying get out, have fun!

00:03:59.556 --> 00:04:00.651
And I got together with some friends

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.016
and we created this thing called the "Natural Leaders Network".

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:05.428
And we wanted to find out

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.705
how other people are getting outside all over the world.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.398
We thought it was just us here in the U.S.,

00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:11.754
but no, no, it's all over the world.

00:04:11.754 --> 00:04:14.998
And we started getting amazing things back:

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:15.768
the beaches,

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:16.805
the mountains,

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.680
in the middle of the city,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.696
how people got out,

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:26.942
just the pure joy of celebrating our connection with nature.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.489
And it all started with that one group.

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:33.815
I want to give you this new motivation

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.069
about a new nature movement,

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.320
and 7 reasons for a new nature movement.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.504
You can create your own reasons,

00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:42.387
but these are 7 reasons that we're talking about.

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:44.343
I'm going to speed up a little bit because of time.

00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:48.972
But, take it from these kids, let's go get outside!

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:54.417
Last year I got to climb the grand Teton.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:57.435
I went from being that kid from South Central

00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:59.603
realizing that somehow I was connected to those mountains,

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:03.053
that my community in South Central L.A. was connected to the mountains up there.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.354
And it all made sense,

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:05.638
the world made sense to me.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.561
Science, and math, and history, and English,

00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:09.970
and all the different things that were happening in this world

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.881
made sense to me because of that.

00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:16.271
I went out to be the first one to graduate from my family in high school.

00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:16.814
I'm the first one.

00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:20.360
I'm a National Geographic Explorer today.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.588
I do these amazing talks,

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.453
and I'm not telling you these things so I can brag about it,

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:25.357
or that I can show off,

00:05:25.357 --> 00:05:27.771
I'm telling you these things because if a kid from South Central

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:29.265
who was about to be a gang member

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:31.848
can grow up to be a National Geographic Explorer

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:35.184
and sit here in front of you and address you like I am today,

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:40.138
then don't ever, ever in your life doubt what you can do.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.460
At the end of the day, I do what I do because of my family.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.869
My family means the world to me

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:52.943
and from this day forward,

00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:57.174
each one of you in this room is part of that family.

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.229
I want you go to away with that

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.415
and I'll leave it with this one quote,

00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:06.068
which has driven me to this point:

00:06:06.068 --> 00:06:09.412
"Once social change begins, it cannot be reversed.

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:12.129
You cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.993
You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride.

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:17.551
You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore.

00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:21.613
We have seen the future, and the future is ours."

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.254
It's your future, it's our future,

00:06:24.254 --> 00:06:25.839
so go get 'em!
