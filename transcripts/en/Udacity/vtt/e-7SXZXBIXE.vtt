00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.570
So web.xml defines configurations for web apps.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.375
Lots of web apps use web.xml, not just

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.840
App eEngine apps and not just Maven

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.217
projects. So pom.xml is for your Maven dependencies

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:17.621
in your Maven project. In pom.xml you

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.603
can list all the dependencies for your project,

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:25.510
like which version of JUnit, which version of App Engine SDK you want. And when

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.912
you compile your project, Maven will automatically

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:31.410
get all the dependencies for it. And

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.420
appengine-web.xml is where you configure things specific

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.360
to App Engine. So App Engine configs

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.930
here. And there are more XML files specific to App Engine such as q.xml,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.560
cron.xml and you're going to be learning about

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.170
those as you work through the course.
