00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.567
Raman: Hello, everyone.
I am T.V. Raman.

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:07.901
And this is my office mate.

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.267
Chen: Hi, I'm Charles Chen.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.868
Raman: And this
is our Labrador,

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:11.934
the Web-famous dog.

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:14.200
And we are here
to plug our session

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.834
on EyesFreeAndroid.

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.634
Um, this work
is really focused 

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:21.200
on using your Google Phone

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.133
in environments where
you're either not capable of

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.567
or unable to or unwilling
to look at the screen.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.868
I do not believe a Smartphone
should be used like this.

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:32.834
I believe you should
be able to use it like this.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.467
I want to be one-handed.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.667
I want to be able to use it
in environments

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.467
where my eyes are busy.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:41.033
We've been doing a bunch
of research work

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.133
on using interfaces
that work

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.901
for that modality
of interaction

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:46.434
using the touch screen.

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:48.000
Um, you can see some of this

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.734
on our EyesFreeAndroid
channel on YouTube.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.667
A bunch of research
has gone into this

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.133
in terms of what works

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.601
as far as user interaction
is concerned.

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.801
And, you know, with time,
we've distilled that

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.901
into a few lines of code
that can be culled

00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:02.033
from a [indistinct].

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:04.267
Um, so the goal
of this talk

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:07.501
will be to walk you through
the thought process

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.133
that led to some of these
UI innovations

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.634
and show you how they
actually work in practice.

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:15.701
Chen: Right,
so we'll go through

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.701
both the text-to-speech
library

00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:19.601
as well
as the gesture UI library

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:22.601
that we've developed
and open sourced.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.968
And we'll then go
into a deep dive

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:28.167
through an example
of a music file browser

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.834
that lets you
browse music files

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.334
on your SD card.

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.501
And we will show how,
in about ten lines of code,

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.767
you can add full
text-to-speech functionality

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.400
that enables speech feed--
spoken feedback

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.467
for browsing
and other actions.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.501
And then we will show how,
in a few more lines of code,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:49.100
you can easily add gestures
to the system,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.167
and thus create a complete
eyes-free experience.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.834
Raman: So we hope you can
join us at Google I/O.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.000
It should be a lot of fun.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.701
We have a lot more
good stuff to show you.

00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.234
Won't fit in the student
module, though,

00:01:58.234 --> 00:01:59.234
so you'll have
to make it there.

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:00.267
Chen: See you there.
