00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.387
&gt;&gt;Now that we figured
out the total revenue

00:00:02.387 --> 00:00:04.486
given any quantity,

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:07.374
and we've also been able to
express it algebraically,

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.935
I want to think about what
the marginal revenue is

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:12.004
at any one of these points.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:13.225
To think about marginal revenue,

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:14.679
marginal revenue is just how much does our

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.009
total revenue change,

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.977
given some change in our quantity.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.460
Then later, we can use that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.335
so that we can optimize the profit

00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.081
for our monopoly over here.

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.379
I'm going to try to do
it without calculus.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.849
It actually would be very straightforward

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:29.594
to do it with calculus

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:30.878
because we're essentially
just trying to find

00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:33.353
the slope at any point along this curve,

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:34.822
but I'll try to do it algebraically

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:36.322
and maybe it will even
give you a little intuition

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:39.262
for what we end up doing
eventually in calculus.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.669
The first thing I want to do

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:42.004
is essentially find the slope,

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.689
the slope right over here.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.017
The best way to find the
slope right over here is say

00:00:46.017 --> 00:00:48.983
how much does my total revenue change

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:51.348
if I have a very small change in quantity?

00:00:51.348 --> 00:00:53.817
If I have a very small change in quantity,

00:00:53.817 --> 00:00:56.831
how much does my total revenue change?

00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:58.523
Let me think about it this way.

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:00.298
The other ones I will
be able to approximate

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:02.059
a little bit easier.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.188
Let's think of it this way.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.336
If my quantity is 0,

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:09.106
my total revenue is 0.

00:01:09.106 --> 00:01:10.037
That one's easy.

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:11.535
If I increase my quantity

00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:13.473
very, very, very, very little,

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.843
so let's just make it 0.001,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.983
what is going to be my total revenue?

00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:21.027
We could think about it
in terms of this curve

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:22.003
right over here,

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.863
or we could just use this expression,

00:01:23.863 --> 00:01:26.701
which we derived from
price times quantity,

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:27.959
and we will get,

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.432
I'll get my calculator out,

00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:33.625
if our quantity is .001,

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.848
our total revenue is
going to be negative ...

00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:38.510
Let me turn the calculator on.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.286
Total revenue is going to be -.001²,

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:45.201
squared,

00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.377
so that's that part,

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:49.377
plus 6 times .001,

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:53.855
6 times .001.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:55.816
That's going to be our total revenue.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:59.722
It's going to be 0.005999.

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:05.002
It's 0.00599.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:06.116
Now we can figure out

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:07.794
or get a pretty good approximation

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.018
for that marginal revenue
right at that point.

00:02:10.018 --> 00:02:13.792
Our change in quantity is .001,

00:02:13.792 --> 00:02:18.976
so our ΔQ, this right over here is 0.001.

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:20.536
That's our change in quantity,

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:25.703
and our change in revenue is 0.00599,

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:27.711
and so we just have to divide.

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:31.811
We just have to divide
.005999, that top one,

00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:33.433
our change in total revenue

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:34.982
divided by our change in quantity,

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:38.388
divided by .001.

00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:42.416
We get 5.99999.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.198
If you try it with even smaller numbers,

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:47.756
if you tried this with .00000001,

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:49.018
you'll get 5-point,

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.059
and you'll get even more 9s going on.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.220
The closer that you get,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.004
the smaller your change in,

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:56.018
and this is what you
essentially do in calculus.

00:02:56.018 --> 00:02:58.656
You try to find a super
small change right over here.

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.021
This is essentially going to be 6.

00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:02.718
Our marginal revenue at this point

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.556
is essentially going to be 6.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:05.608
What I want to do is I'm going to plot

00:03:05.608 --> 00:03:08.551
marginal revenue here on
our demand curve as well

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:09.712
or on this axis

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.956
where we've already
plotted our demand curve.

00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:14.190
When our quantity is 0,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.382
our marginal revenue,

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.184
if we just barely increase quantity,

00:03:17.184 --> 00:03:19.511
the incremental total revenue we get

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.131
is going to be 6.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.646
I'll just plot it.

00:03:22.646 --> 00:03:24.000
I'll just plot it right over there.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.299
That makes sense.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.452
The marginal benefit in the market is 6,

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:28.151
right at that point.

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.454
If we were to just sell
a drop of orange juice

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.577
or I guess we're selling
oranges in this case,

00:03:32.577 --> 00:03:33.415
not juice,

00:03:33.415 --> 00:03:35.740
but if we were to sell
a millionth of a pound

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.947
of oranges,

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:39.218
we would get the equivalent of roughly

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.380
$6 per pound for that millionth of a pound

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.833
because that's the marginal benefit

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:47.158
for that very first
incremental chunk of orange

00:03:47.158 --> 00:03:48.087
out there in the market,

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:50.026
so it makes complete sense.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:52.028
Now let's think about the
slope at these other points.

00:03:52.028 --> 00:03:53.312
These, I'm going to approximate.

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:54.622
I could do it this way,

00:03:54.622 --> 00:03:56.519
but I'll just approximate it.

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.343
I'll just approximate it
by using other points.

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:00.565
If I want to find the
slope right over here,

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.535
when our quantity is equal to 1,

00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:03.988
the slope would look like,

00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:05.770
the slope would look like that.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.053
I'm going to approximate it

00:04:07.053 --> 00:04:10.190
by finding the slope
between these two points.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.706
I am going to approximate it,

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:12.588
and actually, it's going to be

00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:13.841
a very good approximation.

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:15.034
I'll do it later with calculus

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.773
to show that it is a
very good approximation.

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:18.241
But I'm going to
approximate it by the slope

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.738
between these two points.

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:21.080
Between those two points,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.107
our change in quantity is 2,

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:28.350
and our change in total revenue is 8.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.081
Our change in total revenue is 8.

00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:31.926
When we produced 2,

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:32.995
or 2,000 pounds,

00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:37.711
our total revenue was $8,000.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.740
So we have a change in total revenue of 8,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.317
or 8,000, I guess we could say,

00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:45.008
divided by a change in quantity of 2,000,

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:47.822
so our marginal revenue at this point

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:50.888
is 8 divided by 2, or
8,000 divided by 2,000,

00:04:50.888 --> 00:04:53.046
which is $4 per pound.

00:04:53.046 --> 00:04:55.065
When our quantity is 1,

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:59.209
our marginal revenue is $4 per pound.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.064
It is $4 per pound, just like that.

00:05:02.064 --> 00:05:04.360
Now, let's think about
the marginal revenue

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.708
when our quantity is 2.

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:07.761
To do that,

00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:09.986
I'm going to find the slope
between these two points.

00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:12.199
We really want to find
the slope of that line,

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.655
but it looks like the slope
between these two points

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.139
is a pretty good approximation.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.732
It's actually almost an exact number

00:05:17.732 --> 00:05:19.674
because of the way that
this is just a parabola,

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:21.364
so we can actually do this.

00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:22.218
But anyway,

00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:23.813
this is fairly straightforward.

00:05:23.813 --> 00:05:24.403
Once again,

00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:26.692
our change in quantity is 2,

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:29.468
and our change in total revenue,

00:05:29.468 --> 00:05:31.122
our change in total revenue is,

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.375
we're going from 5 to 9,

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:33.767
which is 4.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.920
This was 9 right over
here from the last video.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.049
Or you could say it's $4,000
divided by 2,000 pounds

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:45.984
gives you $2 per pound.

00:05:45.984 --> 00:05:48.003
Our marginal revenue right over here,

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:51.050
if we have quantity of 2, is $2 per pound.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.980
Right at that point,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.832
for that incremental millionth of an ounce

00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:55.885
that we're going to sell them oranges,

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.992
we're getting the equivalent of $2 a pound

00:05:58.992 --> 00:06:02.042
of increased total
revenue from doing that.

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:03.741
Let's just do one more point here,

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:04.979
and I think you'll see why

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.672
I'm only going to do one more point.

00:06:06.672 --> 00:06:08.033
If we try to go up here,

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:10.633
and we try to figure out
what is the marginal revenue

00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:12.281
or if we essentially say
what is the slope there,

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:15.681
how much do we get an increase in revenue

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.011
if we just barely increase our quantity,

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.915
and this is actually easier to look at.

00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:21.986
This is a maximum point right over here,

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:23.958
in the calculus terms.

00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.642
The slope up there is 0.

00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:27.708
We can even see that by
approximating the slope

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:29.730
between the slope
between these two points.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.845
We have some change in quantity,

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:32.704
but we have no change in total revenue,

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:33.788
so right at that point.

00:06:33.788 --> 00:06:34.517
Right over here,

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:36.002
the slope is barely positive.

00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:37.594
Right at that point,

00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:38.384
the slope is 0,

00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:39.145
and then right past it,

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:40.800
it becomes barely negative.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.853
But right at that point,

00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:45.014
our marginal revenue is 0.

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.987
When our quantity is 3,000 pounds,

00:06:46.987 --> 00:06:49.738
our marginal revenue is 0.

00:06:49.738 --> 00:06:50.453
Then after that,

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:52.123
our marginal revenue gets negative.

00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:52.791
Over here,

00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.583
our marginal revenue gets
more and more negative.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:55.899
But something very interesting happens.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.387
When we plot our marginal revenue curve,

00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:00.479
or our line, in this case,

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.032
we are getting a line,

00:07:02.124 --> 00:07:04.186
we are getting a line,

00:07:04.386 --> 00:07:08.423
we are getting a line
that is twice as steep,

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:11.023
twice as steep as our demand curve.

00:07:11.023 --> 00:07:12.583
This is actually generalizable.

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:15.058
If we have a linear
demand curve like this,

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:17.021
it can be defined as a line,

00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:19.384
then your marginal revenue curve

00:07:19.384 --> 00:07:20.666
for the monopolist

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:23.996
will also be a linear
downward-sloping curve

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:25.372
or downward-sloping line,

00:07:25.372 --> 00:07:27.041
and it will have twice the slope.

00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:29.051
This slope over here was -1.

00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:31.002
This slope over here is -2.

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:33.976
For every increase in quantity,

00:07:33.976 --> 00:07:35.476
the price goes down by 2;

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:37.739
increase in quantity,
price goes down by 2;

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.417
increase in quantity,
price goes down by 2.

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:43.347
This is marginal revenue.

00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:44.708
Let's remind our self,

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:45.962
we've been doing all of this algebra

00:07:45.962 --> 00:07:47.092
and all of this math here,

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.017
what is marginal revenue telling us?

00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:50.224
This was the demand curve.

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:51.954
It tells us for any given price

00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:53.254
what quantity is demanded

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:54.614
or for any given quantity,

00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:56.699
what is the incremental marginal benefit,

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:57.799
or I guess what's the price

00:07:57.799 --> 00:07:59.696
at which they could sell that quantity.

00:07:59.696 --> 00:08:00.365
From that,

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:02.168
we were able to figure
out the total revenue

00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:04.017
as a function of quantity,

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.363
and from that total revenue,

00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:06.107
we were able to say,

00:08:06.107 --> 00:08:07.008
well, look,

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:08.369
if at any of these quantities,

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:10.877
if we were to increase a little bit more,

00:08:10.877 --> 00:08:13.001
if we were to increase
quantity a little bit more,

00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:16.027
how much is our revenue increasing?

00:08:16.027 --> 00:08:16.541
Obviously,

00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:17.995
we want to keep increasing quantity

00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:20.959
while our revenue is ...

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:25.429
while the marginal
revenue we get is larger

00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:27.068
than our marginal cost.

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:29.929
I'll take that up in the next video.
