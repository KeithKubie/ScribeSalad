PAUL RUSH: Hi, I'm Paul Rush.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.330
I work in Platforms, but when
I'm not working, I do a lot of

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.310
other things, including trying
to see good theater.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.060
I've been a subscriber
with the San Jose

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.560
Rep for many years.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.250
And last year, I joined the
Board of Trustees there.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.280
As a result, I've had a chance
to work with Rick more

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.490
directly than I just
did in terms of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.210
seeing his work there.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.650
I actually got to work with
him a little bit more.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.340
I can't tell you how actually
valuable it is to be on the

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.500
Board and recommend that for
anybody who's interested.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.630
In any case, Rick's been
with San Jose Rep

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.060
for about five years.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.340
I think this is your fifth
season and has been directing

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.160
a number of plays, including
the currently running

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.850
"Disconnect." Rick Lombardo.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.480
RICK LOMBARDO: Thank you.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.330
So I thought I would talk to
you guys a little bit about

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.340
what my journey has been to
becoming an artist and why I

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.580
am an artist and why I think
that theater arts in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.000
particular are going to continue
to prosper and thrive

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.830
in this world we live in which
is so digitally connected.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.770
But where my belief comes from
about that, about the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.200
sustainability of live theater,
goes back to the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.750
roots of why I do it
in the first place.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.270
So, allow me a short story of my
path to being an artist and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.710
specifically a stage director.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.900
When I was young--

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.520
and by the way, what I mean by
that is middle school years,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.250
early teen years--

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.560
I was dabbling in all
sorts of arts.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.980
I put a darkroom in my
parents' basement.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.570
I was acting in high
school plays.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.450
I was getting all the kids
in the neighborhood there

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.160
together, grabbing my dad's
Super 8 movie camera and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.830
making fiction movies of an
invasion of our neighborhood.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.150
I was playing in a rock band.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.930
I was doing all these things.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.580
There was clearly some creative

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.800
spark that was involved.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.510
But I never thought or believed
that my path was to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.810
be an artist.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.710
I came from a working class
Italian-American

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.510
family in New York.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.990
And I was second generation.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.990
And in my family and with all of
my friends who were in like

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.930
situations, you were going to be
some form of professional.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.640
You were going to be a
doctor or you were

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.590
going to be a lawyer.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.900
That was what the path
was supposed to be.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.490
My grandparents had
been immigrants.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.000
They never had a college
education.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.460
So therefore my dad had a
college education and went

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.110
into business.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.840
And therefore I had to go to
graduate school and take on a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.460
profession.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.760
And I just assumed that that was
what was going to happen.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.430
So I was doing all these
creative things.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.110
And at the same time, I
applied to university.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.860
I got into a prestigious
pre-med program.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.380
And that was it.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.460
I wasn't going to do anything
creative any longer.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.830
Now I was going to begin
my life path.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.430
And I stayed true for
about 2/3 of my

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.550
freshman year in college.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.710
And then I got sucked back in.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.890
I got asked if I would
play drums in a band.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.170
And I started to
do that again.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.700
And then the real thing that
happened is that I saw there

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.660
was a notice for an original
musical that was being

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.690
produced by the undergraduate
drama club.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.290
And I guess I'd just gotten a
little bored at that point

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.530
with just doing my studies.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.700
I said OK, I'm going to audition
for this play.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.520
And I'll end my year doing
this original musical.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.790
And I did that, and of course
what happens with theater is

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.730
that you create community, both
with the people who are

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.930
participating in creating and
then with the people who come

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.740
to experience it.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.160
It creates community.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.130
And as often happens with
theater, I found myself

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.770
plopped into a new family
right away.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.160
For some reason, and I will
never really know the reason

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.500
for this, one of the graduating
seniors in the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Drama Club, said to me you know,
we do this production

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.620
every year for incoming
freshmen

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.410
during Orientation Week.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.990
And it's usually something
small.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.780
Would you come back early from
summer vacation and direct it?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.520
And to this day, I don't know
why I was asked to do this.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.440
But I said sure, I'll do that.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.990
I mean, maybe they asked you
because they thought I was the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.100
only sucker who would come back

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.400
early from summer vacation.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.270
I'm not really sure why.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.800
But I did, and I directed
this play.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.690
And many artists speak about
having a moment of epiphany.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.830
Epiphany can be when you're
working on a project.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.170
You're trying to tell a story,
and you get a sudden insight

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.510
or strong intuition.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.210
You get an answer.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.940
Sometimes epiphanies literally
are bigger answers.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.540
Moments where our life takes
a new direction.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.390
And for me, I feel like
everything in my brain lit up,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.620
when I started working
on this.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.750
Everything that I had wanted,
everything that I had been

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.370
dabbling in, my love of
literature, my love of

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.020
thought, my love of
storytelling, my love of

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.360
making pictures, my love
of using music.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.300
As a stage director, it was
about pulling all of these

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.090
tools together and orchestrating
all these tools,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.940
while, also working with other
human beings, while working

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.815
with a family of artists
to create something.

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:46.440
I had this wonderful experience,
and then the next

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.160
day, sophomore year started.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.520
And for me, the beginning of
sophomore year was also day

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.810
one of organic chemistry,
second year of pre-med,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.060
Georgetown University, being
taught by a very, very famous

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.670
internationally-known
biochemist.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.170
And I've already bought about
$250 worth of books and lab

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.920
books and lab materials.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.380
And I sit down in the lecture
room, and this professor is

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.880
talking to a room full of
would-be practicing

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.710
physicians.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.700
He's a research biochemist.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.580
He wants to give the message
that really people should go

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.830
into research and not
into practice.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.090
So he did the standard
"look to your left,

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.810
look to your right.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.530
One of you will be a doctor."

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.360
And then he said I just wanted
you all to know that I believe

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.310
that the only really viable
career for a person of

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.210
intellect is in the
natural sciences.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.575
And I remember writing in my
notebook, writing down that he

00:06:55.575 --> 00:06:56.870
had just said that.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.470
The only viable career for a
person of intellect is in the

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.890
natural sciences.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.060
And I looked at it,
after I wrote it.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.410
And I thought about it
and just thought no.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.490
And I stood up, closed my books,
and walked out of the

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.470
lecture hall.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.300
Walked down to the Registrar
and changed my major.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.710
I did eventually finish with
a psycholog degree.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.800
I realized that why I actually
wanted to be a doctor was more

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.070
that I was fascinated
with human biology.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.416
And for me, that fascination
came down to what we are.

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:38.280
What are we?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.130
What are we made out of?

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.170
I was fascinated with that
aspect of humanity.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.910
When I took this moment, I took
this right turn, and I

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.430
decided I'm going to get
a theater minor.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.010
But I'm going to finish my
science degree, and I became a

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.260
psychology major.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.910
For me, the turn was about
that my fascination is

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.920
actually more than what
we're made out of.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.580
My fascination was really more
about how we are, how we

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:15.450
behave, how we live, how
our mind works, what

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.670
it means to be human--

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.430
on not just a biological
scale, but

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.310
on the mental scale.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.670
And I did finish with a
bachelor of science in

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.060
psychology.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.770
And of course, I learned a great
deal about how the mind

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.280
works and about how we behave.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.130
But in the meantime, I kept
doing lots and lots and lots

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.260
of theater as an undergrad.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.950
I ended up directing
10 or 11 plays.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.280
I ended up acting in maybe
an equal number.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.570
And as I was approaching
graduation, I decided that I

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.310
didn't want to be some type of
practicing psychologist or

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.070
clinical psychologist or
experimental psychologist, but

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.430
I'd now decided I really
wanted to be an artist.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.160
And I wanted to be a director.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.570
And now this new turn, which
was to be an artist, for me

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.710
when I look back on it was--

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.548
I was no longer really
interested in how we are.

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:19.990
I was no longer interested in
just how the mind works.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.980
Now I became really more
interested in why we are--

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.460
for me, the basic existential
question.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.320
Why do we exist?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.000
What does it mean to be human
and to have consciousness in

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.390
this world that we live in.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.260
And this realm, the questions
that are in this realm, for

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:51.690
me, are answered in three
possible ways.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.290
Religion attempts to answer
this question.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.340
So you can choose a life
of spirituality,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.700
which wasn't for me.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.080
Philosophy asks this question
constantly and addresses this

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.885
question in every possible way
that can be done with logic

00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:10.640
and thought.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.860
For me, I found that too dry and
not as passionate and not

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.900
as powerful as the third
way, which is what I

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.670
think artists do.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.090
I think that artists of every
stripe, in whatever the medium

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:34.330
happens to be, whether it's
writing novels, whether it's

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.270
painting, whether it's
composing, whatever it is that

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:43.180
one does, I think the artist is
always nipping away at the

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.200
fringes of the question of
what does it mean to

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.824
be human and why?

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:48.251
Why?

00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:49.520
Why do we exist?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.690
What is this time that we have,
this limited time that

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.140
we have, what is it about?

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.220
What are we to do with it?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.600
And what does it mean that we
do these things together?

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.860
So I chose a life as an artist
and have spent the rest of my

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.700
career never coming to an
answer to that question,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.360
because I don't know that it's
an answerable question.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.380
But every play that I think that
I've done, every story

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:27.510
that I've ever told on a stage,
I know in some way

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.360
frames this question in a
slightly different context, in

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.830
a slightly different world, in
a slightly different cast of

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.660
characters that are thrown
into a situation.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:47.330
But when we sit in a darkened
theater, and we watch a story,

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.100
we watch a story play out, I
think that we're addressing in

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.050
dealing with a very primal
aspect of what it means to be

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:02.790
human, which is a need to
explore our lives and the

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.190
meaning of our lives
through story.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:10.350
I think story is a means that
we understand our humanity.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.180
I think this happens actually
on a DNA level.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.290
For me, there's a reason why,
when we go into the sleep

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:29.610
state, every evening, we must
dream, and we dream in story.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.900
It's another way that we
process our day-to-day

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.610
experiences, our tragedies,
our hopes, our fears, our

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.880
ideals, all of those things
that make up our lives.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.330
We go into the dream
state every day.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.940
And we go into story state.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.210
In our waking lives, what I
think story does is the story

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.880
helps to define our
identities.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.070
And I think this is a
very, very ancient

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.380
part of being humans.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.870
I like to believe--

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.570
and I think I'm writing this--

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:17.550
that probably the very first
artistic act that ever took

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:24.830
place in our evolution as a
species was probably a moment

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:33.420
when some early, early human,
part of some early tribe, at

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:41.540
night around a fire, stood up
and told some kind of story.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.740
Now maybe that story was
about a creation myth.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.320
Maybe that story was about the
flood 10 years previous that

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.400
changed the tribe.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.360
Maybe that story was about
the great hunt.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.760
Maybe that story, whatever it
was about, was a moment where

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:05.390
folks sitting in a circle shared
something that started

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.400
to create for them
an identity.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.100
And I think that as humans we
create our identities through

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.920
our stories, that we're
actually nothing

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.730
without those stories.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:26.590
If I were to ask you how do you
define your family, what

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:31.240
you would start to do is tell me
stories about your family.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.880
And we have fabulous stories.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.710
If I asked you what do you think
it means to be American,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.430
what about a national identity
or a cultural identity, we

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.270
create that through
our stories.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.320
Whether it's the founding of the
country in the Revolution

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.240
or the Founding Fathers
or or-or-or-or--

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.550
whatever our individual points
of view are about national

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.630
identity is based on stories
and our interpretation of

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.860
those stories.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.640
History is a series
of stories.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.580
Our personal identity, how
each one of us defines

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.860
ourselves, is based on the
stories of our lives.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.750
So for me, telling stories is
not something that one does

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.710
for entertainment.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.850
For me, telling stories
is a fundamental

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.100
act of being human.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.120
And theater is a vehicle.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.650
Theater is a model that
we have created for

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.110
a way to tell stories.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.460
Now there are lots of
ways that we tell

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.020
stories these days.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:50.730
Movies do an incredibly
wonderful job telling stories.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.350
Completely different
type of medium.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.040
I'm going to talk about
that in a minute.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.480
Television tells stories.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.340
It borrows almost all
the techniques

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.030
from film, from cinema.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.630
Novels do an incredible
job telling stories.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.350
Theater does its job
telling stories.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.560
I don't think any one is
stronger or better than the

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.370
others, because they
each work on us in

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.220
completely different ways.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.820
When we read the novel, we enter
the world of that story.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.600
We control the pace.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.820
We read the novel
at our own rate.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.500
We read it all at once.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.230
We read it in bits and pieces.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.550
We go back and we
reread sections.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.840
We develop relationships.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.530
We create in our minds' eye what
the world of the novel

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.100
looks like, what those
characters look like, what

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.000
they sound like, because we are
completely left to use our

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.370
imaginations.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.970
Cinema is the complete opposite
of the novel.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.120
Cinema is primarily a
storytelling medium that tells

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.750
a story through picture and
powerful image and some

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.540
dialogue, but more skewed to
powerful image and picture

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.570
than to dialogue.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.760
The difference, of course,
between cinema and the novel

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.260
is that cinema is immutable.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.290
In fact, it doesn't ask
us to bring our

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.119
imagination into it at all.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.480
Cinema is a much more
passive experience.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.220
However powerful it is-- and
it's very powerful--

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.359
It doesn't ask us to engage in
the imaginative way that the

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.950
novel does.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.750
The novel asks us to work.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:35.290
Cinema asks us to receive these
powerful images, usually

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.680
on a massive screen.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.123
So I often think about the
difference in movies-- and I'm

00:17:44.123 --> 00:17:46.180
going to talk in a minute
about theatre--

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.520
by the way people sit
in those seats.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.260
Because they're the
same seats.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.730
In a sense, they're the
same darkened room.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:18:01.490
But in a really good movie, you
still are probably sitting

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.130
back and just letting the
experience and the sensations

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:07.900
take you over.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.680
You want it to transport you.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.740
When we go to see "Avatar," we
want to be taken somewhere.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.570
When we go to see "Gone
With The Wind," we

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.120
want to be taken somewhere.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.260
When we go to great theater, and
when I watch audiences--

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.390
and this is what I do
professionally.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.160
I watch audiences watch plays.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.890
When I watch an audience watch
a really great piece of

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.350
theater, no one is
sitting back.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.710
Usually people are
sitting forward.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.770
Because theater, drops into that
spot between the novel--

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.730
for me.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.910
It drops into that spot between
the novel and cinema,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.350
where we see what the characters
look like because,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.940
they're inhabited
by the actors.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.620
We hear how the characters
speak and sound, because

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.395
they're inhabited
by the actors.

00:19:02.395 --> 00:19:09.240
But theatre still requires us
to engage our imagination.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.980
And some of the greatest modern
theater asks us to

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.350
engage your imagination
quite a lot.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.160
Sometimes it takes place on
bare stages, and it's just

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.020
great words and great
actors, asking us

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.420
to fill in the picture.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.020
This goes back to Shakespeare's
theater.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.220
When an actor walked on the
stage at the Globe Theatre in

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.660
London, there was no scenery.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.800
The stage looked pretty much
the same for everything--

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.040
maybe a chair, maybe a thing,
maybe an extra curtain.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.300
But you were at the
Globe Theatre.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.700
So in "As You Like It," a
character walks on stage and

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:46.020
says "this is the forest of
Arden." There's no trees.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.000
There's no leaves.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.470
There's none of our high-tech
lighting that allows us to see

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.410
ooh, it looks like it could be
lighting through a forest.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.260
It's daylight in the
Globe Theatre.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.210
A character says "this is the
forest of Arden," Shakespeare

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:03.510
give the characters incredible
poetic imagery to speak.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.230
Poetry that contains enormous
visual pictures.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.640
And then we engage
our imagination,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.320
and we see the world.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.410
Theater still works the same
way that it worked for

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.210
Shakespeare.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.320
It still works the same way it
worked for Aeschylus and

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.910
Sophocles in the
Greek theater.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.620
And it probably still works in
the same way it did when that

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.390
early tribal or cave dweller
stood up and

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.800
started telling a story.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.695
It's really not very
different.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.490
So I think of it with what I do
and what theater artists do

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:45.010
as actually being connected to a
very, very, very long thread

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.470
with a very, very, very
ancient art form of

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.030
storyteller and story,
which is really all

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.280
theater ever needs.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.480
A very, very influential modern
director who I respect

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.490
a great deal was Peter Brook.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.890
And did you ever read Peter's
book, "The Empty Space" while

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.440
you were studying?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.960
He wrote a book called "The
Empty Space" that was

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.350
incredibly influential
in the 1960s.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.760
And one chapter starts off
with the question "why a

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:25.550
chair?" And the question meaning
why a chair on a stage

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.630
or why anything on a stage?

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.080
That anything that's there
should be there to help tell

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.120
the story, but you really don't
need anything to create

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.770
an act of theater.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.520
An act of theater could
be created right now.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.510
I could start telling you a
story, and there we go.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.130
And we're off.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.930
It's theater.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.920
A story with a point, a story
with dramatic tension, a story

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:02.940
that in some ways takes the
listener on a journey, which

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.080
ultimately is what the
storytelling of theater is

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.520
meant to do.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:14.910
When theater works best, a
story begins on stage or

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.950
wherever, in a circle, and it
allows the audience-- the

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.690
listeners and the viewers--

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.930
to begin to imagine themselves
walking in the shoes of those

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.280
characters.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.930
That moment of transference
for me is the moment of

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.700
engagement with the play.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.660
That's what theater does.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.580
We begin to walk through
the play with Hamlet.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.640
What would I do at
this moment?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.020
Would I make that choice?

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.990
And when we create that
connection of empathy and we

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.850
begin to walk in Hamlet's shoes,
I think we're doing a

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.540
very similar thing to what we do
in the dream state, because

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.250
as we confront the choices that
that character makes,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:13.140
we're confronting the choices
of our own lives without

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.480
realizing it.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.230
But that's what the moment
of engaging with the

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.660
art does for us.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.490
It's why we crave it.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.610
It's the most powerful form of
entertainment, because we're

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.770
living and breathing
through the story.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.680
Where it's different
from cinema--

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.210
cinema does these incredible
pictures that I wish I could

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.150
do, but I can't.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.310
Because there's no way that
live theater yet can match

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.700
that level of technology
and close-up.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.490
It just can't do it, can't do
close-ups, can't do that level

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.260
of intimacy.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:44.950
Yeah, we do--

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.990
so we can do a spot.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.761
We can do a spotlight.

00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:48.970
Big deal.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.690
So the things that cinema
can do, we can't do.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.490
What theater can do that cinema
can't do is the fact

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.560
that whether the audience
realizes it or not, theatre is

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.050
a much more dangerous
act of art.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:10.060
Because the movie is never
going to change.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.610
No matter what we do as
audience, if we laugh, we cry,

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.270
we gasp, if we stand up and
shout, if we start screaming

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.890
at the stage in protest,
the movie's just

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.080
going to keep spooling.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.000
It's not dangerous that way.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.640
In the live event, there is an
inherent element of danger

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.530
that makes it different.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.480
At any moment, something
new can happen.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.760
And whether the audience
knows it or not--

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.740
I think they understand it
on an intuitive level.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.830
I understand it on the
literal level--

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:59.170
is that their participation and
their presence changes the

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.073
event, that they're actually
a co-creator.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.180
I think this is one of the
lasting aspects of theatre as

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:15.440
an art form that will maintain
its relevance.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.940
Theater has always been an
adopter of new technologies.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.520
So new stage technologies
come along--

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.630
[SWALLOWING SOUND]-- theater
just absorbs it.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.170
New electric and electronic
technology comes along--

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.880
[SWALLOWING SOUND]--
theater absorbs it.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.550
We're getting new digital
technology next.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.040
Theater absorbs it.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.070
They just become tools to
throw in the toolbox to

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.580
telling a story.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.070
Theater will become
very high-tech.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.190
It's pretty high-tech today.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.508
It'll become even
more high-tech.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:51.090
It will remain theater, as
long as there is a live

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:56.740
element and as long as there is
an element of danger that

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.620
the live actor will fall
off the tightrope.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:08.590
That element of danger is what
separates any live act of

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:09.400
performing arts.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.720
And I think that will
never go away.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.450
I'm intrigued by what's
happening

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.980
with music, for example.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.110
These days, not only
is recorded music--

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.760
not only does it sound
spectacular, it's also for the

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.960
most part free.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.620
You don't even have to buy
it anymore really.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.730
You can get live music-- you
can get recorded music

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.590
anywhere you want it, any time,
pretty much for free.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:48.000
Yet live concert sales are
higher now than they've been

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.120
in recent memory.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.390
So what is it that's still--
the sound is inferior.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.430
It never sounds as good.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.270
The venues are kind of shoddy.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.100
I mean, what is it however that
makes someone want to go

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:15.450
in a 14,000 seat arena, 150 feet
away from the performer,

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.770
for their music experience?

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.030
And why will they pay $100
for the privilege?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.680
I believe it's that element of
danger that remains part of

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.740
live performing arts.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.390
Also that element of being part
of a communal experience

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:31.640
and being in community.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.790
I think that we--

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.830
again, I go back to DNA a lot.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:45.060
I think part of the DNA of the
human animal is to be tribal,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.240
is to be communal.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.260
For some people that means going
to church every Sunday

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.900
or going to synagogue every
Saturday or whatever it is

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.960
that they do, is that they come
together in community.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.840
For some people, it's found
through politics.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.240
For some people, it's found
only for family.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.430
For some people, it's
found through music.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.305
Some people, it's found
through sports.

00:28:08.305 --> 00:28:09.780
I mean, let's face it.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.430
I'm a Boston Red Sox fan, and
I know people who go to 65

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.620
games a year.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.830
That's where they would rather
spend 65 summer nights than

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.870
anywhere else was being in that
tribe, with that communal

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.430
experience.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.210
That's quite dramatic,
by the way.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.780
That's a story with a beginning,
middle, and end

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.680
every night.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.830
Very definitive story.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.930
People crave stories.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.405
That's why they love sports.

00:28:35.405 --> 00:28:37.440
They love sports, because
they love stories.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.690
The stories of the players,
the stories of the teams--

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.965
it's all about stories.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:52.170
But that needing to come
together as organisms, as

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.970
organic beings, in a space.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:29:02.040
What theater asks us to do is
come into a room with a room

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.360
full of stranger, sit in a chair
in the dark next to a

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.750
stranger, and then open
our hearts and

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.640
open our minds together.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.890
And over the course of the
evening, if it's a really good

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.370
production, if it's a great
tragedy, if it's a great

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.430
comedy, we began to laugh
as a community.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.725
Or we will grieve
as a community.

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:35.790
When Lear comes out carrying his
dead daughter Cordelia in

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.020
his arms, we will grieve as
a community with him.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.310
And there's something that
happens in that room.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:49.380
After doing it hundreds of
nights a year for almost 30

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.070
years now, I know that there
is something that

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.600
happens in that room.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.080
When you combine all of
those human energies--

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.410
we're just beings of energy.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.600
That's all we are.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.190
When you bring all of our
energies together in a space

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.510
with the energy of the artists
and a powerful and compelling

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:12.610
story takes place, there is some
type of transformation

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.010
that we are hungry for and that
we need and that I think

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.830
is what theater--

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.770
which will sustain theater as
we continue to move forward

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.180
into incredible new realms of
tools and technologies.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.060
I don't know what they're
going to be.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.820
But we're going to
use all of them.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.710
We're going to use 3-D
holographic actors alongside

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.450
living, breathing actors.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.500
We're going to do all that
stuff, all that stuff that

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.500
folks in this building and
others like it in the Valley

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.030
are going to be creating.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.280
We're going to use all of it.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.110
But there's still going to be
this ancient thread, I think.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.620
It has to be dangerous.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.720
It has to be alive.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.940
We have to come together
to do it.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.360
Those three things will
make it theater.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.010
So I want to tell you a little
bit about the Rep, then.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.510
Have you guys been to
the Rep before?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.410
Have you been to San Jose Rep?

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.970
Well, so we're in the middle
of downtown San Jose.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:12.960
We're the flagship regional
theater for San Jose and for

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.670
the Valley.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.470
We have a 500-seat theater,
state-of-the-art

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.980
built in the mid-'90s.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.040
We do seven shows a year.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.870
And we try to lean towards
contemporary work, a couple of

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:31.360
world premieres this season,
interesting new plays.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.650
And we look for actors from
around the country.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.840
So, for example, a play we have
right now on our stage,

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.010
half the actors are from LA.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.620
Half are from New York.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.830
We try to bring in the best
artists from both our region

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.300
and then from around the country
to work with us.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.440
The theater is 32
years old now.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.625
Like Paul said, I've been
there five years.

00:31:53.625 --> 00:31:58.490
The previous artistic director
had been there 22 years, with

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.740
a long, long tenure.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:08.720
And I hope that at some point
you guys will come and check

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.880
out what we're doing.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.500
We should take some
questions, right?

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:13.680
Yeah?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.940
AUDIENCE: So you talk a lot
about storytelling.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.320
RICK LOMBARDO: I could have
just told you why I think

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.650
art's important.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:24.620
But I think by telling you a
story of how I got there, it's

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.650
clearer, right?

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:26.900
And it means more.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.390
I think the challenge is that
it has to be something that

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.290
starts in the early
years in school.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:38.110
And unfortunately, we live in
an era right now where the

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:41.630
things that teach storytelling,
which is

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:49.620
literature, studying more
literature, writing classes,

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.870
art classes.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.130
These are the things that we're
not putting much value

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:01.520
on in early education anymore.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.630
We have this great impetus right
now on science and math,

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.040
science and math, science
and math, which is good.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.220
I studied science and math.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:17.170
But I was very lucky that while
I was studying science

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.630
and math, I also had great
teachers in literature, in

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.730
English and the humanities,
in history.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.940
History tells us the
great stories too.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.210
But I don't think we study
history enough these days.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.900
We don't learn enough
about how we've

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.120
arrived at where we are.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.640
I think unfortunately American
culture is very

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.430
much about the moment.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.110
It's about this moment and the
next moment, very rarely about

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.000
the past moments.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.090
And we learn so much from
the stories of the past.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:48.200
So how to teach people
to tell stories--

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.860
I think it's about exposure
at a very early age.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.605
How you take an adult who has
never studied the humanities

00:33:58.605 --> 00:33:59.960
and literature.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.450
I think it would be a journey of
starting to recommend some

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.950
great novels, starting to
recommend some great movies,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.630
starting to recommend some great
theatrical experiences,

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:13.949
and then asking people
to talk about it.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.949
Because we've also, I think,
unfortunately lost some of our

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.969
ability to talk.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:21.920
And that's where
storytelling--

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.420
storytelling is an
oral tradition.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.239
Something is happening in our
culture and I don't know that

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.590
any of us know what the end
result of it is going to be.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.120
But I saw it happen
in my own family.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.970
I have two stepsons and
a young daughter.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:55.440
My stepsons range in age
from 32 to 27 to--

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.860
our daughter is 16.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:03.290
And just in the course of that
lifetime, I have seen with the

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:08.110
32-year-old, very verbal,
being on the phone with

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.730
friends, talking, face-to-face
talking.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.520
The 27-year-old through high
school, telephone--

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.790
no, telephone's gone.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.750
AOL chat rooms, getting into
a chat room together with a

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.980
bunch of friends with everybody
there and just

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.970
chatting while typing to now--

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.280
with my daughter, it's almost
completely text relationships,

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.310
texting relationships.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.430
Very little, much less
face-to-face absolutely no

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:37.590
phone time--

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.500
all texting.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.740
I'm not saying anything is good
or bad, but I've seen

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.050
this happen culturally
in my own family.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.060
And I wonder what that means,
because I think there's a

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.770
fundamental change happening
in the way human beings are

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.020
going to be interacting.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.220
I make no assumptions over
what's good or bad, but I know

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.645
it's happening.

00:35:57.645 --> 00:36:03.440
I think we have to figure out
what it means for the future.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.540
You have to edit that
part out, because my

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.790
daughter can't see that.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.860
I think that theaters are slow
to evolve as organizations.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.160
Artists are not slow
to evolve.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.870
Any individual production
can change on a dime.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.330
But organizations
and theater is--

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.920
the regional theater movement
in the country has become

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.840
about organizations.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.420
Organizations evolve
more slowly.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.800
And I would say for the last--

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.470
in the last decade, I've run
two different theaters, and

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.580
I've seen it in both
institutions.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:48.420
The grasping at straws to figure
out how to use the new

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.040
technologies that exist in order
to better engage and

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.640
interact with the audience.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.570
So yeah, do we have
a YouTube channel.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.470
Yes.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.600
Do we try to do video teasers
and interviews with actors and

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.890
put them there on our website?

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:03.790
Yes.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:07.940
Do we gather email addresses and
create email newsletters

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.286
with video content?

00:37:09.286 --> 00:37:09.670
Yes.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.190
Do we have a Twitter feed?

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.950
Yes.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.320
Do we tell people what the
hashtag is for our shows so

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.810
they can engage in
conversation?

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.160
Yes.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.880
Do we have a Facebook fan page?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.780
Sure.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.810
Do we try to post there so
that people will see

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.510
interesting comments and content
they want to comment.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.410
Yeah.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:32.560
But is there any great expertise
at the nonprofit

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.765
level compared to what else is
happening in other parts of

00:37:35.765 --> 00:37:36.060
the Valley?

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.310
Probably not.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.690
Nonprofit arts organization
by their nature are under

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.055
resource, underfunded.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.060
And in a traditional theater
marketing, which was about

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.020
buying an ad in the newspaper
and waiting for a review, all

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.800
of those things clearly are
things of the past.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.100
But a huge chunk of the audience
still gets their

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.110
information that way, while
there's this other part of the

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.420
audience that wants to engage in
an entirely different way.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.350
And we learned in fits and
starts about how to do it.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:21.490
I am desperately wanting to find
ways to use all of those

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:28.760
technologies to create a much
deeper artistic experience for

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.520
the audience that's going
to see something.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.470
We try to find ways that the
pre-show show experience and

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.340
the post-show experience through
technology can enrich

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.430
the whole thing.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.300
So it's constantly about
experimentation and

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.750
exploration and then seeing what
actually works for the

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:53.330
theater audience, which remains
a challenge, I think.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:39:04.510
The sad thing remains that
live theater is very

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.660
resource-intensive.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.180
It's extremely expensive,
because there's a lot of human

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.370
capital involved.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:17.130
Actors, designers, directors,
stage managers, stage crew,

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.702
blah blah blah.

00:39:18.702 --> 00:39:20.340
It's a lot of people involved.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.480
It's incredibly expensive.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.850
And our nonprofit theaters
unfortunately are not as

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:31.100
philanthropically supported by
the community as much as I

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.062
would like to see
them support it.

00:39:33.062 --> 00:39:38.820
So it puts those of us who run
these theaters in the rather

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:45.570
unhappy position of having
ticket prices that I believe

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:51.400
create a barrier to some people
in our community.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.460
And I'm very unhappy
about that.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.860
So we do things to try
to mitigate that.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.170
For example, the first preview
of each of our shows, we now

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.230
do what we call
pay-what-you-will performance,

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:07.620
where if you want to pay $5 or
$10 , you can get into see the

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.900
play at that performance.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.250
No reserved seating.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:15.280
And usually we'll get 300 people
or so who will avail

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.050
themselves of that.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:21.870
And they're usually older, on
fixed incomes, younger college

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.690
students or just-out-of-college
students

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.360
maybe still trying to get a job
or they have their first

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.610
start-up job.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.430
And some people have never been
to the theater before,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:37.440
who are just people who look
for cheap entertainment or

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.600
cultural options.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.645
So that's one way that we could
lower that barrier.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.235
So theater in America
has become--

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.230
I hate to say this--

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.700
but I think that the problem is
that it can be perceived as

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.000
being for the elite.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.270
but I don't think it
should be at all.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.730
I think theater is the
most populist art

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.475
form that there is.

00:41:02.475 --> 00:41:04.135
It's not like going
to the symphony.

00:41:04.135 --> 00:41:06.290
It doesn't have to be stuffy.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.850
It's not a stuffy experience.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:14.190
Theater should be a rowdy
populist experience,

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.100
Very often, that's driven
by the programming.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:22.100
When we did "Spring Awakening"
last year, I saw many more

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:22.870
young people.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:27.410
I saw a much broader spectrum
of the community

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.150
was there for that.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.230
Some of the more standard or
traditional plays that we

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:36.750
might do or just even modern
plays that folks don't know,

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.650
it tends to skew older
certainly.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.110
And it tends to skew
more affluent.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.520
And that's a huge challenge.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.780
Because I don't want to
be running a cultural

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.370
organization that's just
for a certain class or

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.090
demographic of people.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.380
Because they have their own
value system I don't want to

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.340
run a theater that that's just
dominated by one particular

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.950
value system in the audience.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.780
The theater audience should
reflect the community

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:06.390
that we live in.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.080
So that's something where we
have to constantly work on.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.440
And to keep ticket
prices low enough

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.210
so that that's possible.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.950
The first is that there is a
segment of our audience--

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:20.870
I don't actually believe that
they drive the artistic

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:21.610
decisions that I make.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:23.560
But certainly there's a segment
of the audience that

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.320
likes big sets and likes
a lot of costumes.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:27.890
They like that.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.270
They like that.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.635
But that frankly doesn't drive
artistic decisions.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.340
The artists do.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:43.140
And as the Artistic Director,
I pick the plays, I pick the

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.200
artists, and I curate
the season.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.050
But I don't tell all the
artists, this is exactly the

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.590
way I want to do your shows.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.210
If I'm directing a play,
that's different.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.510
But if I have a guest
director--

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:57.020
so I want to give the directors
and the designers

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.940
the resources that they believe
they need to tell that

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.620
story in the most
powerful matter.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.890
Sometimes those directors and
designers will say you know,

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:11.620
to tell this story in the most
powerful manner, I think we

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.580
need no scenery.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.100
They rarely say that.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.680
More often than not, they'll
come to me and they say this

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.890
is what we want to
tell the story.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:26.270
And just like enormous moving
scenery and millions of

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.740
costumes and then I have to
say whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.120
Because we don't even have
that kind of budget.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.770
So we have to figure out
a way to cut that down.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.740
So there could be an economic
tension with those kind of

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.010
artistic decisions.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:48.410
But I believe that my job is
to try to provide as many

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:52.270
resources as I can say to those
artists to do the work

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:56.890
in the way that they feel I
really do need this to most

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.050
effectively tell the stories
to the audience.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.600
And sometimes it takes stuff.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:08.930
Great.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:09.230
Thanks.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:15.990
