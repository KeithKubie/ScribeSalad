00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.080
MALE SPEAKER: Today we have
Nathalie Cabrol, who's going

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.860
to be speaking about her work
around extreme environment

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.460
exploration, which I think is
the nice way of saying some of

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.329
the most amazing things
that she's done.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.910
She's a pioneer, actually, in
high altitude diving, which is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.340
not like really tall
diving boards.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.820
So if you have a body of water
that's actually at 10,000

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.880
feet, to dive in it
is different than

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.450
diving, say, in the ocean.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.729
Would that be correct?

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.380
Sort of, kind of,
a little bit.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.150
It's complicated
20,000 meters?

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.870
NATHALIE CABROL: 20,000 feet.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.740
MALE SPEAKER: Because meters
would be a lot.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.075
I mean I'm American.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.250
NATHALIE CABROL: You'd need
an oxygen tank then.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you'd
need an oxygen tank.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.080
But she's here to talk about
her work for eventually

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.580
exploring the lakes of Titan.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.480
So I'm going to give
it to her.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.020
NATHALIE CABROL: Thank
you very much.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.270
MALE SPEAKER: So join me
in welcoming Nathalie.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.580
NATHALIE CABROL: Good afternoon,
and thank you very

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.140
much for the opportunity
talking here at Google.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000
This is my first time, so I'm
extremely impressed by all the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.370
structures and buildings.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.950
And I mean you have a very, very
cool place around here.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.640
So it's a great pleasure to be
here and to be able to talk

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.150
about the Planetary Lake Lander,
which is one of the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.900
projects that we're working on
at Ames, with the Intelligent

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.230
Robotics Group.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.750
And the Planetary Lake Lander is
really about developing and

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.260
testing a technology that will
be relevant for the future

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.750
exploration of alien seas
and lakes on Titan.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.150
But also, it's a mean for
us, because we are doing

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.960
astrobiology research to
investigate the impact of the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.190
melting of ice on
our own planet.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.390
And you will see the
relationship between the two.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.450
So basically, we are building
a robot, a smart robot--

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.560
at least we hope it
will be smart--

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.889
to understand changes
in planetary lakes.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.030
The Planetary Lake Lander
is funded by the NASA

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.920
Astrobiology Science
and Technology

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.980
for Exploring Planets.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.510
It's a three year project, and
it's a collaboration with a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.920
water company in the Andes.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.900
And I will go back later on why
we are in the Andes for

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.210
this project.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.780
And the education and public
outrage is, or maybe should I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.370
say, was supported by NASA.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.350
So we'll see what happens
with that.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.100
PLL is led by the
SETI Institute.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.550
I'm the SETI Institute senior
research scientist, but I'm

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.130
also working at NASA through
a cooperative agreement.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.450
So SETI leads the astrobiology
science on the project and the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.680
Intelligent Robotics Group at
Ames leads the technology

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.300
development and research
associated with PLL.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.940
And we have a number of partners
in this project.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.540
Some of them are in the United
States and they are working on

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.830
instruments and on the science
supporting the project.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.030
The University of Tennessee,
some people at Baylor, the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.570
Channel Islands, so University
of Southern California.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.840
But also partners from Spain,
from Chile, and from Austria.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.780
And we have an incredible
logistical support from people

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.660
in Chile and the US as well.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.990
So why Titan?

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.840
Well, you've probably heard
a little bit about it.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.560
Titan is a moon of Saturn.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.350
And it's barely smaller
than Mars, actually.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.640
It's a fairly, fairly
big moon.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.750
Just for scale here, here is
Tethys, just a more regular

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.550
moon of Saturn.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.340
So it's really more of
a size of a planet.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.510
And what made Titan so
fascinating, it was already

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.060
fascinating.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.680
We knew it from the
past mission.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.970
But recently in 2007, the radar
detected the presence of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.630
lakes on Titan.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.390
And so Titan is the only place
in the solar system we know of

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.920
that has surface buddies
of fluid.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.570
It's not water, it's
methane and ethane.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.640
But it has a menthanalogical
cycle, like the Earth has an

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.120
hydrological cycle.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.540
And so it's a completely new
branch of robotics and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.965
exploration and astrobiology
exploration that we can start

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:37.850
on with Titan.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.270
So the other thing that makes
Titan so very exciting, it's

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.160
because pretty much, you can
consider Titan being like a

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.860
past Earth in the fridge.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.880
It's extremely cold.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.870
It's very, very far away,
two billion kilometers

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.620
away from the sun.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.730
But at the same time, it's the
only other planetary bodies in

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.200
the solar system that has an
atmosphere mainly composed of

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.180
nitrogen like the Earth.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.330
And the other component is
methane and other moleculing,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.250
including ethane and
other things.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.920
So what we are looking at here
is taking the earth in the

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.040
past, but also taking
it in the fridge.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.160
And a number of things happen
in this atmosphere that are

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.730
extremely relevant for the
astrobiological search of life

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.620
in the solar system and
elsewhere than Earth.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.820
But also understand how life may
have originated, because

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.620
we know of a large amount of
organic molecules there.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.720
So what do we don't know of
is did we go from organic

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.610
molecule to life on Titan?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.170
And this is probably one of
the best candidate to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.080
go test that idea.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.860
So speaking of the atmosphere of
Titan, now we have Cassini.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.520
Cassini has been orbiting around
Saturn and visiting the

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.310
moons of Titan.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.240
We had a flyby only last
week, I think.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.090
Very regularly, Cassini's
passing by, and mapping, and

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.580
doing a number of things.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.730
So we've seen that Titan
is very dynamic.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.030
Just like Saturn, because it's
orbiting Saturn, Titan goes

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.390
around the sun in
almost 30 years.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.120
So it's a very long year.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.240
Each days of Titan are about
two weeks on Earth.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.440
And the seasons are about
seven year long.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.330
So tell me about having a
crappy winter on Titan.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.890
That must be long.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.260
And so when the seasons
are changing, then

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.530
you see clouds forming.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.020
And what you see here on the
screen is the polar vortex

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.450
that's forming in the northern
pole of Titan.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.210
Now, what we see from space is
very limited, just because the

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.930
atmosphere of Titan is so thick
that we have to use

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.360
radar to go through it, a
little bit like Venus.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.170
But we want to round this.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.350
And the landing component of the
Cassini Huygens mission,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.280
actually the Huygens probe
landed on Titan

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.390
in January 14, 2005.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.020
And as it went down through
the atmosphere, when the

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.470
clouds cleared, this
is what we saw.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.870
And I really love to put this
slide on the wall the time,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.520
because it really looks like
Bay Area when we are coming

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.550
back on airplane.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.580
You are landing in Oakland or
in San Francisco, it looks

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.200
exactly like that.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.220
So it's a very familiar
landscape,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.060
when you look at it.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.560
And so this was a few thousand
meter above the ground, and

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.620
then this is what we saw when
we were on the ground.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.300
And if you are looking on the
upper right of your screen,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.940
you will see that, as we were
descending, we were seeing

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.590
dendritic systems that
look pretty much

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.720
like rivers on Earth.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.800
So that was very striking.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.810
And once we landed on Titan,
then we discovered what I

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.710
immediately say, oh my god,
we are on the beach.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.420
Because what you see is a very
flat piece of land, and you

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.010
have very rounded pebbles.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:17.770
And so Titan is this place that
if you look at, will look

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.190
extremely familiar.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.890
You will have rivers, you
will have mountains, and

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.480
you will have seas.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.740
And what you see here is not a
landscape on the earth, but

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.440
it's actually on Titan.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.289
And what you see is really an
estuary of many rivers coming

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.549
into a sea.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.190
But the thing is that it's
really a case of it looks

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.010
like, it sounds like, but it's
nothing like the Earth.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.300
Because the rivers are
made of methane.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.330
The rocks that you see around
are made of pure water ice

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.800
that is so hard there, because
it's so cold, that these

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.195
pieces of ice are being
transported in rivers and

00:08:59.195 --> 00:09:00.430
torrents over there.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.910
And they are being eroded
exactly like any type of rock

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.020
on earth would be eroded.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.540
So it sounds like home, but you
don't want to be wandering

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.780
around without a space suit.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.160
And you definitely are not going
to drink whatever is

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.910
running it this stream.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.560
But a very, very interesting,
fascinating world.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.220
So the thing that makes it even
more similar than Earth

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.400
than anything else is the fact
that, we have what we call a

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.500
methane cycle, exactly like
hydrological cycle I was

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.920
talking about earlier on.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.790
So what you have is that
you have bodies of

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.570
methane, lakes and seas.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.710
And then you will have
evaporation, and you have

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.060
condensation, and then
methane precipitates.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.970
And you have methane
rain on Titan.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.310
And so what happens then is that
in the topography, and

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.670
the topography close,
then you will have

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.050
accumulation of methane.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.280
And then you will have lakes
forming, ponds forming.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:09.620
And you can see this in this
image here, where clouds were

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.400
captured in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.670
region of Titan.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:19.270
And then, just after the rain,
then you could see the lakes

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:25.390
forming right at the bottom
right of your screen here.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.040
So what is also all very much
like Earth is that lakes will

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.440
be filling in, but they also
will be evaporating.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.060
And what you see on the left is
what's happening on Titan

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.910
and an analog here on earth.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.370
So it's pretty much looking like
the right foot and the

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.450
left foot, but on
the wrong side.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.660
So it's very much something
we can understand.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.790
What we don't understand, what
we don't know of, is really

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.030
how the methane chemistry
really works for life.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.290
What kind of word is this for
potential for life and for

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.170
habitability?

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.810
Here's another picture after 6
year, which is pretty much a

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.040
season, showing the changes
in those lakes.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.650
All right, what makes it even
better is that very recently,

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:26.470
we had the high suspicion
that there is a

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.080
subsurface ocean on Titan.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.920
So you've heard about
the potential

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.990
subsurface ocean on Europa.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:40.010
You've heard about the pressure
water on Enceladus,

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.920
and a number of icy bodies in
the outer solar system.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.010
But on Titan, it's even
more important at say.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.360
Because there is something
really important that we

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.480
didn't understand before.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.680
It was that in the methane
cycle, methane is not very

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.890
stable at the surface.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.410
And so people wanted to
understand how long those

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.270
lakes were going to last, how
they were going to be

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.890
replenished.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.580
What is the methane cycle?

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.380
And if you have somewhere a sink
of methane, if there is

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.510
really an ocean in the
subsurface of Titan, then you

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.030
have a mechanism now to
have this cycle that

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.540
we are talking about.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.445
MALE SPEAKER: A question
of methane or water?

00:12:19.445 --> 00:12:20.970
NATHALIE CABROL: Well, it's
an interesting question.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.710
Because well, in the subsurface
it's probably, most

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.720
likely methane, I'd say.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.090
But it will have to have some
ethane components as well,

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.530
because we see that in
the surface bodies at

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.220
the surface of Titan.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.100
It's a mixture.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.420
Water is not stable
at the surface.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.260
Now what happens at depth, I
just cannot tell you right

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.530
now, just like that.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.910
So the evidence for the ocean
on Titan is really tidal.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.510
There is a flexing of the
equatorial bulge as Titan goes

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.310
around Saturn.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.400
And this slide is really to
illustrate what I was talking

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.560
about, where now you could have
some very interesting

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.270
salted ocean underneath the
surface crust at Titan.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:17.520
And then a way for methane to be
replenished, to circulate,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.330
and go from cycle to cycle.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.930
And those cycles are over
10,000 to 50,000 years.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.160
So this was an important
discovery in terms of

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.390
astrobiology.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.350
A cycle of life?

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:39.250
Now, we know that those lakes
and seas may be--

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.480
and we don't have a very good
clue about what is the

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.970
potential for life in terms of
the chemistry of the methane?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.810
But if there is a place where
life could be protected from

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.070
cosmic radiation and from
other extreme of the

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.320
environment on Titan, maybe a
body of fluid, just like on

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.270
earth, could provide a shield.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.000
So we really need to maintain,
if we want to have life in the

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.490
longer term on Titan,
we need to

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.390
maintain them at the surface.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:14.775
And so we have this way where
the methane and the molecules,

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.830
the organic molecules that maybe
the bricks of life are

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.580
now falling from the
atmosphere into

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.080
the lakes and oceans.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.240
And they are being kept there.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.170
And then the oceans and seas
are being replenished.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.920
So it's an interesting potential
cycle that has a

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.470
lifetime, as I mentioned before,
of about 50,000 years.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.800
Now I am not a biologist here.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.040
But a microbiologist one day was
asked, what kind of life

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.700
can we have on Titan?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.560
And it would be most likely
strange, because we don't know

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.080
the chemistry of ethane
and methane.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.810
Smelly, because it's methane.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.680
And we know what methane can
smell here, it's not pretty.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.450
And explosive.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.890
I don't know if it meant by
that that you probably

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.730
shouldn't be smoking.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.450
In the first place you shouldn't
be smoking, but if

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.090
you have a Titan friend,
it might be a bad idea.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.170
Or just because of the
difference of pressure of the

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:13.550
atmosphere.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:19.140
The atmosphere of Titan is
1.5 times that of Earth.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.180
And so if you are inviting
that person in your

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.540
spacecraft, or kicking out of
the spacecraft, there might be

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.850
some problem.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:31.530
And so in a more serious way,
there is little solubility,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.000
that chemists know, about liquid
methanes, which means

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
that there will be a lot
of energy spent.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.830
And there is not that
much energy that

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.120
is received by Titan.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.080
So what they're thinking is
that if there is life on

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.910
Titan, you can have small
things, but you probably won't

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.160
have flying dinosaurs.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.800
All right, so that was the
background for why it's very

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.520
interesting to go to Titan
from an astrobiological

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.690
standpoint.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:07.980
And so, as soon as the lakes
were discovered on Titan,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.090
somebody who's working with our
team, collaborates on the

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:17.590
PLL project for the past year
now, wrote a proposal, which I

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.970
think is the most inspired
project that NASA had in a

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.060
very, very long time.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.070
Her vision--

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.230
it's Ellen Stofan--

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:31.280
her vision was to send a robotic
platform on Titan at

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.010
the surface of the lake and
then let the wind and the

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.600
current take over.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.500
And start, for the first time,
exploring an alien sea.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.220
And so they were in a Discovery
program, which is

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.810
very limited, has very
little money.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.190
And so they had limited
bandwidth and limited

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.040
communication.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.320
So very little data, in fact.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:00.220
And when I saw that proposal, I
said, it's interesting that

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.329
we have a good deal of
experience now with Rover at

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.369
the surface of Mars.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.369
We pretty much know
how to do that.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.710
We're improving on this, but
we know how to do that.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.849
But how do you go about
exploring an alien sea?

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.250
How do you robotically
do that?

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:24.329
And this was the start of a
thought process that took us a

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.200
couple of years to write
the PLL project.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.030
And basically PLL
is about that.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.770
About how do you explore
alien seas and lakes?

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.910
You have to explore in a
dynamical environment.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.330
As we saw, there are
precipitation, there is wind.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.640
And you can expect just because
you are in the lake

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.720
and there are changes in
temperature on Titan day and

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.820
night, et cetera, and season,
you will have stratifications,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.630
changes of the temperature in
your lake during the day or

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.130
during the seasons.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.630
And so you will also have
turbidity changes.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.880
Because turbidity is the
murkiness of the water, and

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.120
you know that during the
season this changes.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.420
On earth, it changes because
glaciers, for instance, melt.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.140
And as they melt, they
release a lot of

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.880
sediment in the water.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.720
And there are other reasons
why you could

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.950
have turbidity changes.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.170
You can be an avalanche, there
can be an earthquake, there

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.350
can be all sorts of reason.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.520
But when you are on Titan, and
you have that much limited

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.970
amount of data and
communication, you will

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.110
receive an image now and them.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.080
And you will receive some
data now and then.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.910
How do you put into perspective

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.500
what you are seeing?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.540
It's not like on Mars where
you have regular

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.550
communication, and you can
have a better idea of

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.190
what's going on.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.540
Sometimes you can see things,
you know, data, that you have

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.660
no way of putting into
perspective.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.460
So we wanted to address
those questions.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.430
And this was the focus of the
Planetary Lake Lander science.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:02.480
So now, how do you sail
on an alien lake?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.640
We want to explore the role of
the weather on the lake.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.520
How does weather affect the
lake in terms of surface

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.090
temperature, relative humidity,

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.330
storms, wind, and waves?

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.640
Because this is all
relevant to Titan.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.180
And then how do changes in
temperature affect the

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.460
stratification of the lake,
the mixing and the diurnal

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.360
cycle between the
day and night?

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.990
And also, what is the origin
of those changes?

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.870
These are questions we want
to address there too.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.330
And also, what are the triggers
in the change of

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.170
turbidity in those lakes?

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.520
And also, how do you detect
organics and the lake?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.590
And what are their cycle?

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.960
What kind of analogy
do you have between

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.880
Titan and the Earth?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.050
So our questions were really,
how can we help

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.840
Ellen and the TiME--

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.160
Titan Mare Explorer Mission--

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.190
to really address the critical
question, to get more science

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.330
by being smart, and to put
data into context?

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.010
So, now the technology
side of it.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.050
We really want--

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.570
because a robot on Titan
will be isolated--

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:22.180
we want to produce a robot that
is smart and that has an

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.580
understanding of its
environment.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:30.080
Basically, PLL is a step towards
robotic awareness.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.270
I told the engineering team that
basically I wanted the

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.060
robot to stop short of writing
the science paper.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.120
I want this robot to be able
to understand what is

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.410
important for the science
objectives, learn its

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.800
environment as it goes during
the mission, knows what is the

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.990
norm and what is off norm, and
trigger operation on its own

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.620
without having to wait for
human being in the loop

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.840
necessarily, if something
happens and they

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.120
are not in the loop.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.500
So it's going really
a step forward.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.720
And that requires not only the
body, the robot itself, but it

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.090
also requires that you develop
a number of things, including

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.530
off board and on board autonomy,
and the development

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.580
of what we call adaptive
science.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.610
So basically, a robot that is
aware and that is capable of

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:26.160
making decisions without having
human in the loops.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.990
And one goal as well of PLL
is to develop exploration

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.120
strategy templates.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.290
We do that all the
time with Mars.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:38.520
When you have a specific task
that you do regularly, you

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.640
just build a template.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.950
And instead of sending lone
commands, you just send

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.264
template number x.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.700
Now, the problem is that we did
not have a very nice body

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.260
of methane around here
on Earth to explore.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.920
So we had to work with a working
analogy, and this is

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.470
where the deglaciation
thing comes about.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.700
So we want at lake environment
that's capable of helping us

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.920
characterize the physical
analogy of the processes that

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.170
are going on on Titan, even
if it's not methane.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.780
And we want to understand what
kind of processes will be a

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.420
challenge for our exploration.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.030
Also, we need it because this
is a short project.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.730
It's only three years, and we
are looking at deglaciation,

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.000
and climate change, et cetera.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.290
You cannot expect to have the
final answer about the causes

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.290
and the impact of climate change
in three years, right?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.630
People have been on this
for 40 years now.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.005
So we still want a site where
you have a good deal of change

00:22:36.005 --> 00:22:36.890
in the environment.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.490
And very rapidly, so that we
know that the robot is capable

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.420
of picking up those changes.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.390
And we also want a science
question relevant to

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.820
astrobiology because
this is what we do.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.660
So this is how we ended
up in the Andes.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.460
And we are looking the impact
of the melting ice on the

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.210
habitability of lakes
in the Andes.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.750
Global warming is melting
the ice wall.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.020
And as we know, as deglaciation
forms--

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.190
well, deglaciation forms
lakes very rapidly--

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.400
but the different phases of
deglaciation will do different

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.080
things to lakes.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.740
And deglaciation also alters
the temperature of lakes,

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.190
their transparency,
habitability, and life.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.600
And this is also the
kind of thing we'll

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.180
be looking for Titan.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.300
The reason we are near the
coast in South America is

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.730
because we have very high inter
annual fluctuation of

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.660
climate and also evolution
of glaciers.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.770
And pretty much it's
unpredictable compared to

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.830
other glaciers.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.060
We know that some of them, most
of them, are receding

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.870
very, very fast.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.410
A few of them are actually
increasing

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.570
in the higher latitude.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.030
And some of those, like in the
Andes, well they are going up

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.650
and down because there is this
interaction between global

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.720
warming and El Nino.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.400
And they are closer
to the coast.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.700
So they are getting
sometime more

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.170
precipitation, sometime less.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.730
And it's evolving very,
very quickly.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.110
And also the reason we wanted
to be in the Andes, it's

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:16.280
because this is probably one
of the places in the world

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.400
most affected by
climate change.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.490
But it's a lot less documented
than the

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.640
poles and the Himalayas.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.590
All right, here is a little
slide to show you the

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.390
glacier we are at.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.920
It's the Echaurren Glacier, and
it's the white line here.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.360
You can see it's evolution.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.940
It's nothing really
very straight.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.750
The trend is down like
everybody else.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.320
But it's going up and down,
and up and down.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.300
And as I said, there is this
conflict between El Nino and

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.340
global warming.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.130
So far us, the high variability
of the environment

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.430
was really the key to put
a robot up there.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.900
Here's the lake in question.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.280
The lake we're exploring
is Laguna Negra.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.660
It's located 70 kilometers
south of Santiago.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.790
It's not in the high Andes, but
it's in the central Andes

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.590
at, say, around 2,700 meter
high, which would be around

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.110
9,000 feet elevation.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.660
It's a fantastic site,
as you can see.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.820
It's a very large lake.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.210
It's six kilometer by a little
less than two kilometer wide.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.235
And it was advertised for 12
meter deep when I first saw a

00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:25.020
few publication.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.170
We ended up with a body of water
which is 300 meter deep

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.940
at our latest bathymetric map.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.600
And so that's a lot of water
column to work with.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.910
And we are really happy
about that.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.520
And it throws at us all kind
of weather, but this is the

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.670
joy of working in
the mountain.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.260
Here is to illustrate the
receding of the glacier.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:50.910
You can see the glacial scarring
on the rocks here on

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.390
the lower right in the image.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.760
This is when the glacier
was there.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.520
You can imagine the Echaurren
Glacier actually ended up in

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.580
Laguna Negra, and then year
after year receding.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.190
Deglaciation didn't start
yesterday on this glacier.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.460
Started like everything
else in this area,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.780
20,000 years ago.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.390
But it's accelerating very,
very fast right now.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.870
The immense supply from
Echaurren into Laguna Negra

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.070
comes through that little
stream here.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:24.590
And this very nice aqua lake,
which is about 100 and so

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.570
meter wide, and that we
call Station Lake.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.600
And there is a very important
reason for that.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.380
It's because we have a
station over there.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.870
It didn't have a name before,
so now it's Station Lake.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.530
But this is really where
the water is

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.540
coming into Laguna Negra.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.890
And this is in perspective.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.000
You will recognize the
Google 3D vision of

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.470
the area on the right.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.290
No, on the left.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:49.070
That's the other right.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.310
I was stunned, actually.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:54.990
Because on the left, this is the
Google 3D of Station Lake

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.370
and the water coming in.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.600
As you can see, this is
a hanging valley now.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.850
And so you have a cascade
that links, really, the

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.230
stream to the lake.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:07.010
And you can see a photograph
here of Victoria's Cascade.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.380
This one has a name.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.810
And this is where we want to be,
because this is where the

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.870
stream from the glacier
is entering.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.140
And this is where we are going
to see the changes in the

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.000
turbidity of the water.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.340
Little bit of touristic
images here.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.600
These are the working tents.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.860
They look very small,
but wait until you

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.080
see what we do there.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.040
So these are really big
domes, in fact.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.730
The one on the top left is a
place where we have lunch and

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.200
dinner, but it's also
the working room.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.560
And we can fit 30 people
without too

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.060
much problem in there.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.370
And now on the upper right and
lower left we have what we

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.370
call the RoboDome, where we have
the engineering stations

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.920
and the people working there
who are testing PLL.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.300
And on the lower right, we have
the bio dome, where the

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.980
microbiologists are doing
their work over there.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.400
So looking at the samples,
et cetera.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.270
So when we are there
it's a little city.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.500
Because we have four of those
domes and then we have about

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.870
20 small tents for everybody.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.760
It's a big thing to get there,
about a ton and a half of

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.130
equipment and 20 people
last year.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.090
Now, TiME versus PLL.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.280
TiME is the Titan Mare Explorer

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.850
Mission of Ellen Stofan.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:30.030
And PLL, I just wanted to show
you once again the comparison

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.240
of the science goal.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.030
So TiME mission on Titan would
go there to understand the

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.140
carbon cycle through the study
of the sea and explore the

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.040
limit of life.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.370
And our goal is to understand
the impact of deglaciation on

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.790
the hydrological and carbon
cycle on this lake.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.860
And also lake habitat
and biodiversity.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.810
What is the impact of
deglaciation on life there?

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.360
And then you look at all the
science objectives that are

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.810
listed there, and also some
of technology objectives.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:05.910
And you just basically have to
change methane for water and

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.700
sea for lake.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.010
And we're doing pretty
much the same

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.480
thing as the TiME mission.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.430
So it's in our chart.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.770
I'm not going to read
through that.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.290
And we talked already
about that.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.850
Now the hardware.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:23.720
So the TiME Lake Lander mission
is represented here on

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.410
the upper left.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:33.460
And it's a 26 kilogram
spacecraft that has a number

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.660
of instrument on board.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.600
And the number correspond
to the names that

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.440
I listed down there.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:47.080
Our puppy here on the right is
about a ton or so, everything

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.800
put together.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.210
Liam?

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.370
TREY: About that.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.080
NATHALIE CABROL: About
that, about that.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.570
So it's not exactly the same
scale, but this is really the

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.360
field horse that we are going
to use to do things.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.420
And there are some
differences.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.310
But there are a lot
of common things.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:06.450
The numbers you see on the PLL
side are similar in nature

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:10.790
than the number of instruments
that you do see on the TiME

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.160
Lake Lander.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.150
We don't have a mass
spectrometer on board.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.350
We have it in the lab, which
means that we need to bring

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.210
the samples back.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.390
The same thing for a Raman
spectrometer, which is looking

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.340
at organics.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.710
And the thing that we do have
that the TiME Lake Lander

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:29.370
doesn't have is that we have a
profiler, which is basically a

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.050
multiparameter sonde that goes
up and down along the winch in

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.700
the water and does profile.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.620
Whereas the TiME Lake Lander
will use the propulsion of the

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.640
wind and currents to do profiles
at different depths,

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.000
depending on the depth
of the lake.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.280
So they are pretty much
passive in the lake.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.100
Whereas right now, we are
more in one place.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.560
This year we'll try to actually
release the Lake

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.680
Lander and do profiling
as we go.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.190
But the Lake Lander,
it cannot do that.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.300
Otherwise, we have pretty much
an equivalent payload than the

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.720
TiME Lake Lander.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:08.340
We do also, because we have
some goals that we want to

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.290
achieve for the study of the
climate change on Earth, we

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.060
have a number of other things
that we do have.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.250
First, we have a shore
station that has--

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.910
you see this on the
upper left--

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.160
the shore station gives us
some information that are

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.310
redundant when it comes to
meteorological information.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.080
We do have a met station on
board the Lake Lander, but

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.780
this one is on the shore.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.440
We do have a redundant
multiparameter sonde.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.590
But this one is fixed on the
buoy not too far away from the

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:38.250
Lake Lander.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.360
It's only at one depth.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.710
It doesn't go up and down
in the water column.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:46.720
But it actually record data at
a much higher resolution.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.490
And we also have another
met station.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:51.750
And you will understand
why later we

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.020
have so many of those.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.150
In the valley, in the
glacial valley.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:00.810
In this image here in the
middle, at Lake Station we do

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.790
have a stream gauge that tells
us everything about the

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.540
discharge of the water, the
changes of the water in that

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.470
stream, the temperature
of the water.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.420
And this is the instrument
that you see here.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.760
We have GigaPan, which is an
absolutely fantastic camera

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.490
that gives us huge,
huge panorama.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.600
Really the kind of thing that
would be really difficult to

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.300
get on the TiME mission to
Titan, because you have seven

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.850
gigabytes of data to download.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.200
So pretty much, your mission
is right there, one image.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.420
But we use it in many different
ways to survey the

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:41.310
environment, and also to do some
check on the health and

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.460
status of the robot.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.560
It takes a picture of itself.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.500
And we do have an underwater
camera that's named The MOC.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.350
And this one is there to survey
what's happening in the

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.560
water column right next
to the two PLL.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.850
I'll talk more about
that in a moment.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.110
We do have a few other things.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.840
We're doing some limnology
and ecology, looking at

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.850
what's in the water.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.160
Allergies or plankton,
et cetera.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.320
And when really, really we are
bored and don't know what else

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.140
to do, we change water, several
bottle, into a little

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:21.070
submersible that we fit with a
GoPro camera, and a few HOBO

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.770
data loggers.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.770
And we throw that at
200 meter depth and

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.530
try to record something.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.140
The GoPro didn't like
it, but we got data.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.490
I'll show you some.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:35.980
We also use boats to do the
bathymetry of the lake.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.580
This was something really
important, because bathymetry

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.960
is also something that the
TiME mission will do.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.810
So we record that data to be
able to do some operation

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:52.350
readiness test and have a
database we can choose from.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.910
Now comms and data delivery
system for the project.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:59.720
Here is a little chart
that I prepared.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.390
So on the upper left you see
a satellite that's used.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.290
This is the Earth
orbiting system.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.370
We are monitoring the evolution
of the environment

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:16.449
from the NASA satellite that
are surveying the world.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.150
And this is aqua and terra.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.510
And we are using
ASTER as well.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:23.070
So this goes directly
on the computer.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.610
You can have access to
that, it's public.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.785
You can work with that.

00:34:26.785 --> 00:34:30.870
And we are also using satellites
for communication,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.949
obviously, with the robot.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.190
And there we have
our Lake Lander.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.219
The Lake Lander has different
ways of communicating.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.440
We can communicate with it
through the shore station, and

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.550
the shore station can

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.239
communicate to the Lake Lander.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:50.440
And communicating with the
satellite and get comm to the

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.500
user at NASA Ames through
satellite comm.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.920
So we have this little relay
going around here.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.780
We can talk or phone
to the robot.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.400
We get data daily and
health status daily.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.910
And then the data, the science
data and the health status

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:14.750
data of the probe is archived
on the xGDS.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:20.370
And the xGDS is developed
by IRG as well.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.690
And it's what's called the

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.630
Exploration Ground Data System.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.890
And it's really a place where
all the data that comes in.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.570
But it's not only a place
where the data

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.520
is passively stored.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.720
It's a place where you
can see it live

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.500
as the lake is changing.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.420
So you have this vision
of the lake changing.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.240
But there is also a place, the
analysis notebook, where you

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.650
can get this data and started
working with the data within

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.090
the site itself.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:52.940
So it's really a tool where
everybody can share the data.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.220
All the scientists can get.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:59.670
The microbiologist, the
ecologist, the earth scientist

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.200
can put their data there, and
people can work with them

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.750
within that environment.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.470
And there is also something that
I'm sure Trey will love

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:12.310
to talk more about that later
on, which is this Google Map

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.115
vision of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:14.115 --> 00:36:18.110
We developed this bathymetric
map of Laguna Negra, and Trey

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.220
already built that.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.580
It's wrapped on the
Google Earth map.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.320
And this is extremely useful
because it allows us now to

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.760
not only have those maps, but
when we do samples, have those

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760
samples coregister.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.870
We can go there and really use
them as a working tool.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:41.380
OK, so now the technology
milestone for the project.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.650
The idea was to develop
this robot.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.850
And in 2011, which was our
first year, it was really

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:50.390
hands on trying to understand
what kind of platform we were

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.570
going to use.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.730
And pretty receiving it, and
putting it apart, and trying

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.500
to understand how it worked,
what kind of power,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.800
et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.430
And we took Lake Lander for the
first time in the field in

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.310
2011, and that was pretty
much debugging time.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:07.960
For three weeks, four weeks.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.730
And then we left it
in the field.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.240
We have all sorts of
communication problems.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.810
And we swung at that point
that in 2012, we would be

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.010
smarter than that.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.210
But we already had a little
bit of data that was very

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.250
encouraging.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.310
This year, the engineering team
completely redesigned and

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.420
including some recoding
of the probe.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.150
And they did an incredible
job.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.010
And PLL V2 was really
much improved.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:39.900
It was deployed in Laguna Negra
in December, 2012, and

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:45.190
was put in a permanent mooring
position for all this year, so

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.690
that we can collect data
and see what kind of

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.530
information we have.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.660
And what is the quality of the
information that we have?

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.920
And then we had a little bit
of science and technology

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.360
operation from the field.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.770
And Stofan came, and we showed
her how PLL was working.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.750
And we had her coming to some
realization on the few facts,

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.430
and I'll show some
of them later on.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.470
And this year XGS came online.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.760
So this is live and the science
team can use it.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.050
It is accessible only by the
science team for the science

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:25.200
data, but we do also have a
website, Planetary Lake Lander

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.030
on the SETI Institute website.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.340
All right, a few more photos
to summarize what happened.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.720
On the upper left, you see
pretty much, well, pieces of

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.130
equipment in the backyard
at NASA Ames.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.470
And they seem coming together
day after day.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.610
And on the upper right, that
was what we call the splash

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.150
down, with the pontoon being
released in the water.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.630
And then on the lower images
are really what happened to

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.770
make it happen, which is
calibration of the

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.210
multiparameter sonde
really putting

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.350
together all the pieces.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:05.090
And then on the lower right, you
see Liam spending a good

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:08.450
deal of time in the temporary
mooring position, just going

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.540
back and forth with the
boat and making sure

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.890
this thing was working.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.360
And it did.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.970
December 12 was the day that
I think it went online and

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.460
working for the first time.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.270
So that was the day that Lake
Lander was being moved from

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.240
the temporary mooring
position.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.880
On the left here, you will see
how much that chair that I

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.920
loved really is a very good
analog for planetary

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.950
exploration.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.850
On the upper right and lower
right, you see the Lake Lander

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:46.730
being moored in its
final position.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.140
Right here and right here
is the position of

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.960
the redundant sonde.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.265
This is what it looks like right
now, except that there

00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:00.490
is a lot of snow on top of it.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.940
But you see the instruments
I talked about with the

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.630
communication.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.790
The engineering team added a
wind turbine, just because of

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.270
the winter.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.800
And because we are in a very
steep valley, which means that

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.110
we don't have much sun during
winter over there.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.410
And so we needed some added
on power, and the

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.910
wind turbine did that.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.960
And you see the distribution
of the instruments and

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.700
communication system
right there.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.510
The MOC cam.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.070
I talked to you a little
bit about that.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:33.300
We really do want to understand
what's going on in

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.100
the water column.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.890
And this is something that you
can imagine can be used to

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:43.030
actually look for microbial
life in the water column.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.210
But it can also be used for
ecological purposes if you are

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.880
looking at how turbid
water is.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.600
How murky and what kind of
things are passing through the

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.680
water column at different
time of the day.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.720
So Carnegie Mellon is
developing this.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.640
But it's just not a
passive camera.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.910
It's also a camera that is going
to do adaptive science.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.270
And it's actually
going to track

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.910
whatever passes in front.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.380
And in this case scenario
here, we

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.450
ask it to track copepod.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.960
And copepod is this zooplankton
that you see, the

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.450
little red critter on the
upper part of the slide.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.850
So this is pretty much what
happens when they developed

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.410
their tracking system.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:29.820
So this has been developed and
tested this year off board.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.220
And in the coming years, the
camera will be now connected

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.080
to PLL and will be watching
what's going on.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.800
And will give us some report
about what's going on in the

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.520
water column.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.230
I think this is a really
interesting aspect of adaptive

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.890
science where you can get
a lot more information.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.470
Because now your camera
is taking the picture.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.650
It's segmenting that picture,
trying to understand what's

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:50.810
going on in there.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.390
And basically sends you
only the information

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.440
that is really important.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.760
So you are not only having the
information, but you are

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.910
saving a lot of bandwidth.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.260
Now, for the last part of the
talk I'm going to give some

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.500
results about the science, .
and also what is our vision

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.950
for 2013 for PLL.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:15.780
In terms of the deglaciation
here on earth and the causes

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:23.100
of changes in the lake, what
we've seen is that when you

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.660
look at the data, you look at
average, it would seem like

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.470
nothing is happening on the
glacier at Echaurren.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.630
And that the temperature doesn't
seem to change on

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.720
average, et cetera.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.110
But if you are starting to slice
that time into season,

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.540
you will see that
something really

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.990
interesting is happening.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.050
Summer temperature hasn't
changed that much.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.970
Spring hasn't changed
that much either.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.420
Winter are getting cooler.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.240
But what is changing, really,
is the fall in this area.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.960
And this is the critical point,
because fall is really

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.230
the season where snow
is falling.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.740
So two things are happening.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.150
If the temperature is
too warm for snow,

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:02.170
then snow's not falling.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.390
Water is falling, and goes
directly into the lake or into

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.060
the water reservoir.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.370
Or if the snow is falling, it's
falling on the ground

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.790
that's warmer than
it should be.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.960
So once again, you have more
that goes directly into the

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.270
runoff and doesn't go back into
making ice for the lake.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:23.740
So what you see here, on the
extreme right of the slide, is

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.750
to show you the balance
between snow

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.680
fall and snow melt.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.830
And this definitely
shows an increase.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:31.690
There is a lot more melt
happening right now.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:36.410
So we are looking at this
impact, and also we are trying

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:45.010
to learn, to support a mission
like TiME would be really hard

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.780
from space because of the
thick atmosphere.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.780
But here we are doing it
because, once again looking at

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.780
the climate change here on
Earth, we understand that

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.990
looking at satellite imagery,
and looking at the minerology,

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.100
and looking at the thermal
response of the ground, then

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.090
you can understand the changes
that are going on.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.420
The thermal imagery is going to
give you some idea of the

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.320
size of the grain that
is in your watershed.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.050
So the temperature response of
the ground also depends on the

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.640
size of your sediment.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.510
And we see this changing
year after year.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.730
And then you have an idea of
what kind of sediment, and the

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.840
size of the sentiment, is
going into the lake.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.360
This is in the watershed.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.750
And so this is going to impact
your life and your

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.780
habitability in the
lake as well.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.810
So if we were going to do that
on Titan, we would need to

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:36.580
have an airplane.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.480
We couldn't do that from orbit
just because we cannot see

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:39.930
through it.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.570
But this is definitely using
thermal imagery, is definitely

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.960
something that is a tool as well
to understand the causes

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.760
of changes in the turbidity
of a lake.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.080
And the nature of the sediments

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.120
that's going into it.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:57.350
In terms of the lake itself and
how you go about sailing a

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.110
planetary lake lander on an
alien sea, one very important

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.990
parameter is the wind,
of course.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.930
All right, so there are
winds on Titan.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:09.950
And we know that winds can form
waves when they pass one

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.510
meter per second.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.520
And so what we did here was to
study the wind at Laguna

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.420
Negra, and try to see
what kind of effect

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.980
they had on the lake.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.960
So obviously, one of the first
effect are the waves.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.380
And this lake, which is only 16
kilometer, it's not a sea.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:32.560
But it's very deep, 300 meter
deep, can generate waves that

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.540
are about a foot and
a half in no time.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.170
In no time.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:41.010
We saw that coming at us in
within minutes, I'd say.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:43.120
And the weather can change
very rapidly.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.750
So we don't know what will
happen on Titan.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.680
Because at the time where the
mission would be supposed to

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.130
land, if it had been selected,
the wind would start to pick

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.980
up because of the
seasonal change.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.130
So they would have wave.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.720
But we're not expecting
wave that would be a

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.080
foot and a half high.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.880
Still, wind is definitely
something you need to take

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.040
into account.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.820
Then you need also
to understand,

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.640
what it the lake effect?

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.390
If you want to understand Titan,
what is the lake effect

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.370
on temperature and relative
humidity?

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.330
So we have been studying this
too, and you see this in the

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:21.770
different color line that
are here on this graph.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:28.450
Now, Trey put this slide
together today, because this

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.140
data we received today.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.520
Trey, right?

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.420
TREY: Found it yesterday.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.200
NATHALIE CABROL: Found
it yesterday.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.670
OK, so one thing that the Titan
team is aware of is

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:41.130
obviously the role of the
tide because of Titan.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:44.490
There will be current related
to tides on Titan.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.330
But what they didn't think about
was that the lakes have

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.380
oscillation on their own, and
the seas the same thing.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:53.540
You can generate these
oscillation.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.300
It's just like imagine the
breathing of someone.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.140
OK, you have a wind on the lake,
and then you have a wave

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.830
that's carried into that lake.

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.130
And the swell will go down
as time goes by.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:09.960
But there is a rhythm to that,
and there is a cycle.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.720
And we call these seiches.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.940
And you can, theoretically just
with a piece of paper,

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.110
knowing the depth of your lake
and knowing it's dimension,

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.710
figure out the oscillation, the

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.640
wavelength of those seiches.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.910
And we get this little exercise
with [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.820
because we thought we
were seeing some.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:32.460
And we changed the data
resolution on

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.220
our water level sensor.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.600
And this is what we picked up.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.900
So there are seiches.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.590
And the period is about
30 minutes.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:49.940
We would have to know much
better the depth of the sea or

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.990
the lake where Titan robot needs
to go if we wanted to

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.090
understand what is the
oscillation and the wavelength

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:56.950
of a seiche.

00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:00.570
But they will have also to
figure out a way to work with

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.800
those, because it depends
on the wind, depends

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.050
on a number of things.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.570
But definitely, this will take
their robot from one

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.420
place to the next.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.190
Bathymetry.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:15.820
This is one point where
definitely Ellen came to some

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.740
very, very hard realization.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.560
So the idea is that, as the
TiME robot lands or splash

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.330
down on the lake, it
will use the wind.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.400
There is no propulsion.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.010
There is also no way
of stopping it.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.550
It's just a passive robot
going on the lake.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:35.970
And every hour or so, it says
a ping with the sonar to do

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.540
the bathymetry of the lake.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.000
So 8:00 in the morning, we
take Ellen on our boat.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.740
We have the bathymetric system
on, and we sit in the middle

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.150
of the lake.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.580
And say OK, let's be the probe
and see what happens.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.160
One hour later we were about the
same place because there

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.280
was no wind.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.560
So I said to Ellen, two things
are going to happen here.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.690
If you don't have any wind,
you will have a very, very

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:02.430
high resolution map of
your lake from a

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:03.930
very, very small area.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.060
But if you have lots of wind,
you are going to have a very

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.730
low resolution map
of your lake.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:11.720
So these are the kind of thing
that all of a sudden

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.910
operationally you start
to understand.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.410
If you have a passive robot,
it's not going

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.690
to be a simple thing.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:20.280
And also, if you are passive and
if there is an obstacle,

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.410
you're doomed.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.790
So these were the kind of
rational and reasoning we went

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.100
through with her over there.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.090
All of a sudden, this mission
to the different life.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.080
And for us too, because we
didn't know what exploring

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.510
alien seas and lake
was going to be.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:40.160
So, in terms of the lake itself
and what's going on

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.530
here, I'm not expecting this to
happen on Titan, but just

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.260
because it's so incredible.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.120
As deglaciation progresses,
lakes are becoming more

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.650
transparent, at least at
one phase of them.

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:55.360
And this is a disaster
for life in there.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.190
Because for the first phase,
when the lake is turbid, you

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.590
have plenty of microbes
in there.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.690
There's a large biodiversity,
everything

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.420
and anyone is there.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.800
But one, the transparency
changes and increases.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.850
All of a sudden, the UV goes
through the water column.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:16.840
And whatever is not resistant
to it gets fried.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.540
So those lakes still have lots
of population when you are

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:23.560
looking at numbers, but the
biodiversity is going down.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.590
And you now have microorganisms
that are

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.370
resistant to UV.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.780
What you see here to the
left is the water

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.170
column of Laguna Negra.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.520
And this is taken at
a time where the

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.230
lake is at the murkiest.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.060
So there's a spring, summer.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:46.670
And we still had light a 50
meter down, which means that

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.860
this is probably, if we were
going to have the same data in

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.390
the winter, it's going to be
even more transparent because

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.320
all of the turbidity and the
sediment has settled down.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.110
So you see the curves
right there.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.820
That probably puts this lake
as one of the highest, most

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.570
transparent lakes
in the world.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:07.565
And you can still see the curve
changes in light at the

00:51:07.565 --> 00:51:08.050
bottom of the lake.

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.230
And this is 45 meters down.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:15.350
So what life does, it
follows the food.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.350
And so we hope that on
Titan it will be

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.390
doing the same thing.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.840
What you see on the left here
are two charts showing the

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.450
changes in chlorophyll and blue
and green algae in the

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.570
water column.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:32.570
One is really somewhere in the
middle of the lake at the

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.260
temporary mooring station.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.600
And at the permanent station
here, where the cascade is and

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.000
where the nutrients are being
brought into the lake, this is

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.310
where you get most of the
chlorophyll and the blue and

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.750
green algae.

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.130
Now, adaptive science.

00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:49.490
What you see here--

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:53.110
and that will be the conclusive
part of the talk--

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:57.860
is some of the profile that we
are getting from the Planetary

00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.520
Lake Lander.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.170
And typically, this is the kind
of thing we would love to

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:05.600
have on Titan.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:11.890
And what the robot is going to
do is to be able to learn the

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:13.740
changes that you are seeing
in the water column.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.560
Here you have temperature, you
have transparency, you have

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.160
dissolved oxygen, and you
have chlorophyll.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.600
And so what it does, it's
picking up the changes in this

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.300
environment.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.590
And what we want it to do is
really to try to understand

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.090
what's going on, what is the
cause of the change?

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.370
And this is the adaptive system
that we were trying to

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.010
develop here.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:39.620
So what I put here in that box
is a change in turbidity

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.540
that's related to a change
in temperature.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.500
And now we are going back to
what I was saying at the very

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.810
beginning of the talk, is that
why is it important for us to

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.520
be able to pick up changes in
temperature and turbidity?

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.920
Because these are the kind of
changes we are going to pick

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.220
up on Titan as well.

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.060
And we want to understand
what they are.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.330
So basically, when you have
changes in turbidity in a

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:07.810
lake, because it's seasonal,
you will have a very slow

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.046
gradient of turbidity
going up.

00:53:11.046 --> 00:53:14.970
If this is something that's
related to a stochastic event,

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.960
such as an avalanche, your
signal is going to have a very

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.460
different gradient and go down
in a very different way.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:25.150
And you can have also algal
blooms and things like that

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.640
increasing your turbidity.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.450
So what we want to do this year
really is to teach PLL

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:33.570
how to recognize those.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:38.270
And once we have the algorithm
ready for that, then we will

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.950
try this inside over there.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.190
And hopefully we can make
some demonstration.

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:46.940
This is really the goal that
we have this year.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:53.470
So 2013 will be really our
testing time for PLL.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:56.350
We will have a robot, hopefully,
that we can release

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:57.590
in the lake.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:02.820
We will be able to drift like
it would do on Titan.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.990
And also be able to pick up
changes in the environment,

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:09.220
and tell us what kind of
changes these are.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.380
So I'm going to go through
this very quickly, but

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.320
basically this is what the
robot has to learn.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.310
It has to learn how to
recognize changes in

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:20.810
temperature, in turbidity, in
water discharges, and in water

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:21.670
temperature.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.310
And changes in chlorophyll
and blue green algae.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:27.370
Put that together, and then
come up with the right

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:31.150
solution in telling
us what it was.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:36.310
And finally, this is our
timeline for this year, the

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:36.920
field campaign.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.820
And the field campaign
will be in December.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.690
And we will have ORTs this
summer and beginning of fall,

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:46.750
and working with the TiME
mission as well, to give them

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.360
some data to think more about
a real mission to Titan.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.370
So thank you very much.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.700
I'm running over, I'm
sorry about that.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.230
But this is what PLL is about.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.780
There's still a lot
for us to learn.

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.680
But definitely, exporting lakes
and alien seas is a

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.840
very, very different beast.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.280
I'm coming from the Rover
standpoint and exploring Mars.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.590
And it's completely different.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:14.270
It's completely different
because you don't have as much

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.660
command over your robots.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.342
It's not that you can drive it
at this point in time if we

00:55:19.342 --> 00:55:21.470
are going with a concept
of time.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:24.820
But maybe the lesson that we
have is there are some flaws

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.250
in that mission concept that
we want to change, because

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.880
going to another
planet is hard.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.850
When you're succeeding in
landing there, I think you

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.520
should be able to steer a little
bit your robot if you

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.540
feel that there is a danger
somewhere coming at you.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.030
So anyways, thank you very
much for your attention.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:50.200
And just as the last slide,
here's the crew

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.450
of the pirate ship.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:54.530
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
all pretty

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.000
interested in bandwidth.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.170
We think in huge bandwidth
numbers here.

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:03.370
And you talked about having
really low bandwidth

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.980
allotments, and presumably
low computational

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.496
allotments as well.

00:56:07.496 --> 00:56:10.860
Can you talk about why that's
a hard constraint?

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.300
That you can't just be like,
actually you know what, it's

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.370
worth it to get more
bandwidth back.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.700
So let's spend a little more
money on better rockets.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.460
NATHALIE CABROL: Well it's
not like the rocket.

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.750
And there are a number thing I
want to be very candid with

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.340
you on this.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:27.110
I will not talk about the TiME
specs, because this is

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.420
proprietary material from Ellen
and I. I swore to her

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.590
that I wouldn't talk
about that.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.770
But I can give you an idea
of why the limitation

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:36.620
are what they are.

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.130
This mission was proposed
in the context of

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.100
the Discovery program.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.200
And then you have that much
money that you are allotted.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.050
And this is why they
don't have an

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.980
orbiter supporting them.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:52.580
And this is why they have to
go, they had to go now,

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.930
because of a direct worth
that they can use.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.120
They are in line of sight.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.080
The season is going to change
very, very fast on Titan.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.950
And so it's going to be a lot
more complicated even, to

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:03.810
communicate.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.380
But you have the constraints
that are related to a program.

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.680
But now if you want to say,
OK, let's assume that the

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.990
program is not the constraints,

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:12.930
how would I do that?

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:13.890
Well, sure.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:16.170
You wouldn't like to
limit yourself.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.310
Once you're on Titan and you
land there, you want as much

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:19.410
information as you can.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:24.870
And you don't want to have one
image per day, per Titan day.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:27.080
And so on and so forth.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.420
So how you do that?

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.540
Well, you can put small orbiters
or communication

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.460
satellites, you know, swarms.

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:37.790
We do little things now that are
not so expensive anymore.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:39.220
But it's not going
to be within the

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.510
Discovery Program frame.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:43.860
Although, the Discovery
Program is going to be

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.560
recompeted soon now.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.710
So we'll see if Ellen goes.

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:50.890
If she doesn't, then
maybe there are

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:52.160
room for other options.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.260
And who knows.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:57.100
The private sector seems to be
very keen on getting involved

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:58.330
into planetary mission.

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.130
And when you look at
the cost of that, I

00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:02.790
think it's very feasible.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:03.570
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
just wondering,

00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:04.730
have you worked with--

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:08.320
well, was there any idea to have
a Rover right by the edge

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.440
of the lake that could
also go in?

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.960
NATHALIE CABROL: Definitely not
in a Discovery Program.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:21.530
But what we did that is not in
the TiME mission, the shore

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:25.980
station that we do have is
already a relay showing us the

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:29.630
perspective of what's over there
on our shore, not on

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:30.810
Titan, all right?

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:35.470
But it's looking also at the
Lake Lander, the Lake Lander

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:36.430
is looking at it.

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:40.420
So we have ways of seeing what's
going on on the shore,

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.920
seeing the changes.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.580
Now you are talking about an
integrated mission that will

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.330
have a Rover and
a Lake Lander.

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:50.250
And in that say, if you go that
route, why don't you put

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:52.620
an airplane on Titan?

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.160
Or a balloon?

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.000
And I'm just half kidding,
because this is exactly the

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.490
place where you want
to do that.

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:01.620
And I was talking about the
thermal imagery that we are

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:05.800
using to survey the watershed
and the meteorologist changes.

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.270
But then you can think about
having those instruments on

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:11.880
board two little airplanes,
or one airplane.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.600
And following the Lake Lander,
and just looking

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.680
maybe what's ahead.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.780
Because you don't have this
vision from the Lake Lander.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:24.680
Maybe you can have it as a scout
for your Lake Lander.

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.140
You will more or less know where
you are going because of

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.260
the direction of the wind.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.800
And so maybe an airplane can
go there and send you data,

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:36.642
and allow you to do
some planning.

00:59:36.642 --> 00:59:39.520
A little bit like what we do on
Mars when we are using the

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.870
orbiter to plan traverses or we
are using panoramic images.

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:46.950
But when you are on the water,
there is more water or methane

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:47.760
in front of you.

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.440
So this is hard.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.550
But no, it's very interesting.

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.760
I'm completely sold to the
ideal of multirobotic

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.740
approaches even on
one mission.

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.590
Swarms of robots are really
good ideas, but they can

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:06.830
become very expensive and very
complex, very, very quickly.

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.420
MALE SPEAKER: I was wondering,
how much do you know about how

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.970
the oceans behave there?

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:13.990
Or these lakes, how strong
are the currents?

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:17.470
And also, the differences
between floating in water and

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:18.820
floating in methane?

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.850
People think the density
is different.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.910
NATHALIE CABROL: Yeah, the
density of methane is about

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.690
half that of the water.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:27.050
So you're going to float.

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:31.980
But for the ways right now, the
seasons they were supposed

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.790
to land on, winds were supposed
to get up to one

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:39.710
meter to 1.5 meter.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.420
This is what's modeled.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.120
And once again, once you land,
you learn where your model

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.020
went wrong.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.370
But this is what
it is modeled.

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:53.370
And so this is going to
generate small waves.

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:56.360
We're not expecting anything
like a tsunami.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.700
But anything can happen.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:03.130
I mean, large waves are
happening in lakes, not only

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:06.460
because of wind, but they're
also happening because rocks

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.260
fall into the water.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.430
You can generate very large
waves because of that.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.490
On Titan there is less risk to
have asteroids and comets

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:18.510
falling and generating
a big wave.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:21.810
But that can happen.

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:26.480
We saw that the frequency on
Mars is quite abundant.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.630
Did you see the paper a couple
of days ago coming out?

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:32.030
So new you impact
craters on Mars.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.390
This is not going to
happen on Titan.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:36.710
The atmosphere is thicker
than it is on the earth.

01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:39.420
But things happen,
things happen.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.250
So you can have a large waves.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.160
So winds, one to 1.5
meter expected.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.140
Waves at say, about 10,
20 centimeter max.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.700
So it should be a smooth
ride to some extent.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:56.740
And the currents are being
generated by the wind, also by

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.370
the seiches I talked
about, but also by

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.140
Saturn's tide, daily.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.820
And I don't remember the number
of all the tides.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.840
I don't know if you have
any idea, Liam.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.060
I don't remember.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:14.350
But they are a few meters
per second.

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: How do
you determine that

01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:18.630
what you see is life?

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.500
NATHALIE CABROL:
Great question.

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.950
Well if you have a rabbit
jumping in front of the--

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:25.300
that's always the response.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:30.180
But we're not expecting
a rabbit on Titan.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.440
But, as I said, once you land,
this is when you know where

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.660
you went wrong.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:44.030
But more seriously, I think that
in the incarnation events

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:49.640
vision of exploration of Titan,
time is a first step.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.680
It's not a life detection
mission, but definitely they

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.250
are looking at organics.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:59.010
So they are looking with a Raman
at organic molecule that

01:02:59.010 --> 01:02:59.680
they can find.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.020
And their abundance
in the water.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.540
And the changes of this
abundance during the day,

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.290
during season.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:07.430
Well, they won't
last that long.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:11.160
So in the course of the day and
night, the same thing as

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.010
you would do on the Earth
that we are surveying.

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.330
So they will be measuring
that.

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:19.470
Once again, it will be
very, very limited.

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:22.070
And this is always unfortunately
the same theme

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:24.180
that comes back with
the TiME mission.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.780
Not because it's a bad mission,
but because it's very

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.660
limited when it comes
to what they can do.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.940
But the power of it is that
it's the first time.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.480
This is the first data
we're going to get.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.680
And with that data,
we are going to

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.700
prepare something else.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.110
Remember the old
Viking mission?

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:42.120
Viking mission to Mars had a
life experiment on board.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.320
And we went with a life
experiment on Mars.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.110
And then we landed there for the
first, and we had no clue

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.380
what the environment was.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:54.695
And then when it came time to
really interpret that data, it

01:03:54.695 --> 01:03:55.640
was really hard.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.460
Today we still say the results
were ambiguous.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.940
But now we know that there are
number of things that can

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.590
create the result that we
saw that are not life.

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:09.080
So the idea is, you just cannot
go to a place that is

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.320
so completely different
than our place.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.780
And Mars was so close
compared to that.

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.020
So methane chemistry?

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.180
I have no clue.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.690
I have no clue.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:22.960
So the only way I think we will
know that something is

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.330
alive in front of a camera if
it's jumping out of the water

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:30.890
or moving in certain direction
that mean that they are not

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:37.050
only driven by currents and by
other things, but right now,

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.430
TiME is not a life
seeking mission.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:43.600
It's a brick of life-- a little
bit like Curiosity.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.030
Curiosity is looking right now--
it's not a mission that

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:48.330
searches for life on Mars.

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:51.400
It's a mission that's here to
say, where the bricks of life

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.460
present on Mars?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.530
So a mission like TiME
would do that.

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:57.650
And I think this is a very
wise first step.

01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:58.960
MALE SPEAKER: So it kind of blew
my mind when you started

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.070
by saying, yeah, let's try
just letting a drift.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.260
Right at the beginning.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.750
I'm thinking, oh well I put a
robot on a lake, and in not

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.350
very long I've got
a broken rowboat.

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.390
And I didn't go where--

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:14.560
NATHALIE CABROL: This is exactly
what I'm saying.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.050
But I'm here to make
his life miserable.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:21.270
MALE SPEAKER: So can
you talk about the

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.970
practicality of that?

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.250
And why it's a less
bad idea than it

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.320
sounds to my naive mind?

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.993
NATHALIE CABROL: Oh it's a worse
idea than whatever you

01:05:27.993 --> 01:05:28.396
have in mind.

01:05:28.396 --> 01:05:29.280
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a worse idea than

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.620
even I could imagine.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.400
NATHALIE CABROL: But I'm
conscious about that.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.330
I don't ignore it.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.840
And I'm not completely
stupid either.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.110
So us here is the idea.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:41.100
We definitely have to
demonstrate that we can do the

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.520
kind of science that
we have developed.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:50.590
Because developing adaptive
science on a platform that's

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:54.750
not moving, that's anchored,
then you have sort of a stable

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.600
environment.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.590
The lake is what it is
around your robot.

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.900
And then you pick up stuff
and it changes.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.910
And you know it changes because
you are in one place.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.420
But now what we are saying is
that we are going to send the

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.910
robots, floating robots
on Titan, the

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:09.970
thing is going to drift.

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:11.990
Because this is what they
had in their scenario,

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.680
it is going to drift.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.720
So now we need to demonstrate
that we can do that kind of

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.820
adaptive science and pick up
real changes as we go.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:27.130
Which means that not only we
have a floating robot, but

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:29.540
then we have to understand that
the changes that we're

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:33.380
seeing are not only related to
the different places where we

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.217
go, but also to something
fundamentally important for

01:06:36.217 --> 01:06:37.080
the mission.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.740
This is very, very complex.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.080
Because as you move across the
lake, you are changing

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:42.870
environment.

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.290
And condition might change.

01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:47.230
And you might trigger your
adaptive system all the time.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.670
We have no clue about that.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:54.070
Once again, we are going
to be hands on there.

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.370
And this is scary.

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.780
This is scary from the
adaptive standpoint.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.590
But this is also scary from
the robotic standpoint.

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:04.650
And the good thing is here on
Earth, we can do something.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.780
And the thing we're going to
do is to put a couple of

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.280
engines on board the platform.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.020
And probably someone on
the platform as well.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:18.060
Which means that we will do this
when conditions are OK.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.960
And so there is a lot of
wind on that lake.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.700
But we know the time during
the day where

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.930
there is less wind.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:27.260
So we'll do operations
at that moment.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.230
I don't even want to think about
starting to talk about

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.320
night operation to the safety
review board at Ames.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.090
But it ultimately, we'll have
to go there at some point.

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:45.810
And so if something, if there
was a realization to me the

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:53.320
first day we put PLL in the
water was that going to Titan

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.130
pretty much dead in the
water is a bad idea.

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.920
And so if there is something
that needs to be changed in my

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.590
mind, it's that this robot
should have some mode of

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.050
propulsion.

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.330
If only an emergency one.

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:11.560
And one that you don't want
to use all the time.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.020
MALE SPEAKER: That's really
scary looking rock.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.780
Maybe we use up some
battery power.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.290
That kind of situ-- right?

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.130
NATHALIE CABROL: Yeah, and for
that, you also need more

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:21.899
bandwidth, because you need to
be able to see that rock long

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.120
before it hurts you.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.290
And in the kind of bandwidth
and capabilities they have,

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:30.720
I'm not sure we can
do that really.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.550
And that goes back to the
airplane or whatnot--

01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:39.479
a surveyor on top of you which
could help you this way.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:46.250
So I really love the TiME
mission, because it is the

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.390
first vision of an exploration
of an alien sea.

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:54.819
By many means, it is a poetic,
more than scientific, vision

01:08:54.819 --> 01:08:58.399
of exploring seas, just like we
did in the past, where you

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:01.149
were putting a boat with
people on the sea.

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:02.200
And let's go.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.750
Let's go see what's
in front of us.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.460
And we'll see.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.790
But in the meantime, it takes
a long time to get to Titan.

01:09:14.790 --> 01:09:17.790
It is scary to be going through
that atmosphere and

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:19.229
splash down.

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:23.229
And you want the
most out of it.

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:24.710
You really want the
most out of it.

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:29.750
So if Ellen is going to
resubmit, I think I would have

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.830
a few suggestions for her.

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:34.220
And if I was going to submit a
mission, it would definitely

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.549
have some different
flavor about it.

01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:38.149
Thank you.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:43.096
