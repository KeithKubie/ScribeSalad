00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.080
Look!

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Up in the air!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.080
It’s a bird!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.270
It’s a plane!

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.570
No, it’s a bird.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.879
Hey there flappy birds, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.510
You’ve probably seen birds migrating, or
just making short trips for feeding, and you’ve

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.750
probably noticed that birds tend to fly in
a V-shape.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.190
There’s usually one bird up at the front
leading the way, and each successive bird

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.619
lines up back and to the right or left of
the bird in front of it.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.800
There are other basic shapes, such as J-formations,
and inverted versions of both, and these groups

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.880
are actually types of “echelon formations”,
meaning that they line up linearly.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.700
V-formations have been used extensively, not
just by birds, but by military generals.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.120
From the earliest days of war, allegedly stemming
back to when the Thebans were fighting the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.560
Spartans in 4th century BC, all the way to
today, the formation is used in sea battles

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.680
and aerial warfare.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.240
Birds, planes, boats, and people all have
similar reasons for doing this.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.910
Lining up in a V gives each member a clear
line of sight ahead of them.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.280
In some cases, it also takes less energy to
travel in this formation.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
See, when a bird flaps it’s wings, a vortex
of air directly behind it is pushed downward,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.800
called ‘downwash’.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.470
The air further back and to the sides responds
by pushing up, called ‘upwash’.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.330
Any bird situated in another bird’s upwash
has to expend less energy to stay aloft, since

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.780
they’re already being pushed upwards, and
a V-formation situates each member back and

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.590
to the side, directly in its neighbor’s
upwash.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.870
In 2001, researchers at the French National
Center for Scientific Research put heart-rate

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.480
monitors on pelicans flying in V-shapes, and
they found that the ones farther back had

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.460
slower heart rates and did not have to flap
their wings as often to stay afloat.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.200
In fact, there was an 11-14% total energy
savings for the birds.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.700
Another study from the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences also found that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.870
the flock also tries to makes sure that the
bird up front doesn’t get too tired.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.740
Since it doesn’t receive any benefits from
the communal upwash.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.140
The leader bird rotates among the flock, although
scientists still aren’t sure if there is

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.590
a hierarchy of who “gets” to be the leader.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.140
Of course, all this mess could be avoided
if we taught birds how to order plane tickets.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.979
One bird, the arctic tern, flies roughly 56,000
miles round-trip and is able to sleep while

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.120
in flight.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.500
But how does the tern, and plenty of other
birds pull off the ability to sleep mid-air?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.530
Find out in this video.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.010
