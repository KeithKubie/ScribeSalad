00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.000
After several days of camping
and long-distance bicycle

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.540
riding, you decide to
ride straight home riding

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.960
at a constant rate.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.360
After 2 hours of riding, you
are 10 kilometers from home.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.980
And after 4 hours of riding,
you are 5 kilometers from home.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.640
Once you begin to ride
home, in how many hours

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.786
will you finish your bike
ride and arrive at home?

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.660
This last sentence is
a little bit redundant.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.820
It really should say,
what was your total length

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.820
of your bike ride home?

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.530
But let's just think about
the data that they gave us.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.950
So let's just think
about on one column,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.650
let's put how long
you've been riding.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.260
So time.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720
Time riding.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.570
And then in this column let's
put the distance from home.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.850
So they tell us
that after 2 hours,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.410
and the time is in
hours, after 2 hours

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.320
we are 10 kilometers from home.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.080
And after 4 hours, we are
5 kilometers from home.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.800
And we are going home
at a constant rate.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.940
So let's think about
what this rate is.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.060
When our time
increased by 2 hours,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.700
our distance decreased by 5.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.720
So if our time increased
by another 2 hours,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.910
so now 6 hours have gone
by, then our distance

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.610
will have decreased
by 5 again, and we

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.970
are 0 kilometers from home.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.500
So we've answered our question.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.460
Once you begin to ride
home, in how many hours

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.820
will you finish your bike
ride and arrive home?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
Well, it'll take you
a total of 6 hours.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Now, I'm going to ask
ourselves another question

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.480
that they didn't ask us here.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.559
Which is, how far away was I
when I started riding home?

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:53.350
Well, we could back
things up a little bit.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.130
Actually, let me copy
and paste all of this.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.390
And move it down.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
So let me cut, let me paste
this all down a little bit,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.235
so we have some extra space.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:06.880
And let me draw a
little white line here.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.420
And then finally, let me erase
this business right over here.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.170
And so we could think
of it the other way.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.330
Where were we at time 0?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.830
So time 0, that was 2
hours before this point

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.040
right over here.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.440
So here we are
subtracting 2 hours.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.360
So instead of subtracting
5, we will add 5.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.540
They're going to
have opposite signs.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.650
So we were 15 kilometers away.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.920
Another way that you
could think about this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.880
is we started 15 kilometers
away, 2 hours goes by

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.026
and our distance has
decreased 5 kilometers.

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:51.400
So let's actually
graph this just

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.990
to visualize things
in graphical form.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.720
So let's say that
this is our time axis,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.867
actually our distance axis.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:02:59.700
Distance in this case
is a function of time,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.410
so the convention is to plot
that on the vertical axis.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.740
And then let's put time
on the horizontal axis.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.310
So that is time
right over there.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.910
So when time equals 0 our
distance is 15 kilometers.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.080
This is 5, 10, 15.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.980
So when time is equal to 0,
distance is 15 kilometers.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.130
That's this point
right over here.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.890
And then when time
is equal to 6,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.461
our distance is 0 kilometers.

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.960
So it's not perfectly--
so let's say

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.657
that this is 1 hour, 2 hours, 3
hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:41.990
hours, obviously, it should
be drawn a little bit neater

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.435
than that.

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:44.310
Let's do it this way.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.030
Let's call this
2, 4, and 6 hours.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.470
Obviously, not the
same scales for

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.250
the vertical and
horizontal axes.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.480
But this last point right over
here when time is 6 hours,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640
our distance from
home is 0 kilometers.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.070
So that's that point there.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.940
And we're traveling
at a constant rate.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.475
So our line will look like this.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320
Now one question you might
ask yourselves, well,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.110
can we quantify this
rate, or how would

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.890
this rate relate to the
inclination of this line?

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.830
Well remember, the
inclination of this line

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.600
is defined as slope,
and that's the rate

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.300
of change of our vertical
axis to our horizontal axis.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.890
So the slope of this line
is equal to the change

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.500
in our vertical axis.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.330
This triangle is the
Greek letter delta,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.720
shorthand for change in.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.060
Change in our vertical
axis with respect

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.829
to a change in our
horizontal axis.

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:37.370
So in our horizontal
axis, we already

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.530
see when we have a change
of 2 in our horizontal axis,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.820
and we saw that with
the first two points,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.760
when we went from
2 comma 10, that

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.990
was this point right
over here, to 4 comma

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.590
5, what was our change in time?

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.236
Well, our change in time
was we went from 2 to 4.

00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:01.610
So I could do it
right over here.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.770
So our change in
time was equal to 2.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.600
And what was our
change in distance?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.230
Well our change in distance,
we went from 10 to 5.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.120
So our change in distance
was equal to negative 5.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.620
It went down when
our time increased.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.180
So it's negative 5.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.740
So the slope of this
line is negative 5/2.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.350
We started at time
0 at 15 kilometers,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.780
so actually we could express
the equation for this line.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.490
We could write that
distance-- and we could even

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.260
write it as distance as a
function of time like that,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.650
or we could just write
distance-- is equal to,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.620
we started at 15
kilometers, and then

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.900
we decreased our distance
from there as time increases.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.900
So it's 15 plus
negative 5/2 times time,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:54.030
or we could say
minus 5/2 times time.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.530
So we didn't have
to do all of this.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.260
We could have just reasoned
through it with the table

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.770
that we did really
in the first minute,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.430
but it is nice to
just think about this

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.790
in all the different ways.
