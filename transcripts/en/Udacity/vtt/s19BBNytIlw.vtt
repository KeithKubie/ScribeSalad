00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.860
Although you share more traits with those relatives with whom

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.800
you're most genetically similar, let's say your parents, and your

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.060
brothers and sisters, this doesn't mean that your closest relatives

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.980
like your parents or siblings share every trait that you have.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.580
And this diagram that we've constructed up to this point

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.490
doesn't do a very good job at revealing which family

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.300
members share which traits. Right? We're not doing a good

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.340
job of showing the relatedness of particular traits. Now, to combine

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.400
this sort of family tree with the information about

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.470
traits that we're interested in understanding, we're going to use

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.780
a very special kind of diagram called a pedigree.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.090
Now, pedigrees are just an organized way of looking at

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.640
family relations and traits. Females are symbolized with just

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.090
a simple circle symbol and males are symbolized with

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.590
just a square. A single line drawn in between

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.650
a male and female does not indicate marriage, I repeat,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.620
does not indicate marriage. It simply indicates that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.350
there were sexual relations and line coming downwards and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.530
splitting into any number of circles and squares

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.820
simply indicates the number of children and whether or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130
not they were sons squares or daughters, circles.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.420
And each new generation in the pedigree gets it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.990
own row, so here we have the children, the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.730
parents, the grandparents, the great-grandparents. Now none of this

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.550
is probably really unique to you from our family

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.480
tree we were looking at before, because we have the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.060
relatedness of the family, the genetic relatedness, right? We can

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.500
see the tiers, the organization, the male-female aspect of it

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.470
but what we're missing are trait relationships. And this

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.300
is where pedigrees become immensely useful, because not only are

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.730
these shapes indicative of something about this individual, the fact

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.860
that they're male or female, but we can also shade

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.290
them in to indicate whether or not the individual has a particular trait

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.350
or not. So, let's use an example the trait of lactose intolerance. Something

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.410
we learned about in the last lesson, lesson four. Now, the way this

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.560
works, is we want to represent the trait

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.570
of lactose intolerance using our shading mechanism.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.010
If an individual is in fact lactose intolerant, we

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.670
want to shade that individual shape, the circle or the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.760
square and if they're not lactose intolerant, if they're

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.380
lactose tolerant, right, they can actually digest milk products,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.010
then we're not going to shade the circle at all.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.140
We're going to leave it empty. It really is that

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.560
simple. So let's try to build a pedigree for

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.720
a particular individual concerning the trait of lactose intolerance.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.415
Meet Kate. Kate and her family have a European and Jewish ancestry. Kate is, in

00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:35.470
fact, lactose intolerant but her brother is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.100
not. Neither of Kate's parents are lactose intolerant

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.770
either but, her maternal grandfather and paternal

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.640
aunt are intolerant. Remember, maternal grandfather means the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.460
grandfather on her mother's side and paternal

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.410
aunt means the aunt on her father's side.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.240
Using all of this information I want you to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.030
tell me, which of the following pedigrees represents Kate's family,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.930
and the trait of lactose intolerance. Now only one

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.720
of these five pedigrees can be right. And the only

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.810
way you'll be able to figure it out is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.940
if you understand what the symbols mean in the pedigree

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.140
and what the shading means. Hopefully, this isn't too

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.820
hard and go ahead and give it your best shot.
