00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.870
RANDY: I'm still
not fully awake.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.370
There was this male
red deer last night

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.870
doing his thing, his bugles.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.230
I can just imagine
when he's, like--

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.770
I was laying there in
bed, thinking, you know,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.770
he's just calling out--

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.030
hey, girl.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.930
Why don't you just
come on right over?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.200
We could hang out, you know,
do our thing, just crawl--

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
crawl on over into my bed.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.500
It's kind of what I imagined
he was saying, specifically

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.300
in that voice, too.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.900
Let's see what's
the plan for today.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.470
Might try to just fish all day.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.970
Definitely starting to
feel the lack of energy

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.530
due to calorie deficiencies.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.130
It's like I'm living
on minimum wage here,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270
and I'm kind of living day to
day as much as I possibly can.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.230
So mainly, the thing
that I'm focused on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.730
is finding a long
term food source--

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.470
that being a deer or
a lot of smoked fish.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.100
RANDY (VOICEOVER): My survival
strategy isn't necessarily

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.230
about energy conservation.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.900
Fish on.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.870
RANDY (VOICEOVER): It's about
finding ways to live out here.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.730
Ah, [bleep].

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.570
[bleep]

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.930
RANDY (VOICEOVER): There's a
correlation between how I'm

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.600
feeling mentally and emotionally
and the amount of food

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.130
that I'm getting.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.230
Not having food is making things
a little bit more difficult

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.830
on me.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.630
[bleep].

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.400
RANDY (VOICEOVER): I
can't get discouraged.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.000
I want to make sure that
I put as much energy

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.400
into every aspect
of my life out here.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.470
I feel like I can be successful
if I'm really persistent.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.030
If you haven't been to a
spot in a while, they just,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.900
uh, they forget.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.570
I'm not sure what it is.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.100
RANDY (VOICEOVER): It's just
a nice little boost at a time

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.700
when you need it.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.600
Every little bit counts.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.630
I've been out here a long time.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.070
And I still can't believe
that I'm actually out here

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.170
and I'm doing it.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.630
I'm successful.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.070
And I will be the first one
to tell you that there are

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.430
times when I have my doubts.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.200
All the fish on camera here.
All right.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.870
Well, I'm calling it at nine.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.330
Nine's a good number.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.370
That gives me five--

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.400
after dinner and breakfast, that
gives me five fish to smoke--

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.100
10 halves, which is pretty good.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.100
It's damn good.
