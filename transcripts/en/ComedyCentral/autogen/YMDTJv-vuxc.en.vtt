it climate change is not real but if it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920
it climate change is not real but if it
 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.260
it climate change is not real but if it
is real it's not man-made but if it is

is real it's not man-made but if it is
 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.460
is real it's not man-made but if it is
man-made then maybe it's actually good

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
