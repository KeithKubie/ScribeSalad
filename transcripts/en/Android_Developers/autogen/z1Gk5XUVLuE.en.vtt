00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.670
support for pre honeycomb devices this
is true why hasn't a bit this included

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
is true why hasn't a bit this included
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109
is true why hasn't a bit this included
in the support baggage what is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
in the support baggage what is
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480
in the support baggage what is
recommended for the following design

android design for these devices this

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
android design for these devices this
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.280
android design for these devices this
would be a great Roman Nurik question

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
would be a great Roman Nurik question
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.870
would be a great Roman Nurik question
but Rome is not with us today anybody

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
but Rome is not with us today anybody
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.870
but Rome is not with us today anybody
else wanna chat tackle that one yes so

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
else wanna chat tackle that one yes so
 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.340
else wanna chat tackle that one yes so
we certainly know that there's demand to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
we certainly know that there's demand to
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260
we certainly know that there's demand to
go and have support for action bar in

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
go and have support for action bar in
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.709
go and have support for action bar in
the support library it turns out that

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719
the support library it turns out that
 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.270
the support library it turns out that
there were some technical issues that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
there were some technical issues that
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790
there were some technical issues that
didn't allow us to do this it's not

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800
didn't allow us to do this it's not
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.410
didn't allow us to do this it's not
quite as simple as just going and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
quite as simple as just going and
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640
quite as simple as just going and
copying the code ova

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
copying the code ova
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.610
copying the code ova
so yeah for now our recommended approach

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
so yeah for now our recommended approach
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.890
so yeah for now our recommended approach
is to use actionbarsherlock and so I was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
is to use actionbarsherlock and so I was
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.509
is to use actionbarsherlock and so I was
reading through the comments on here and

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519
reading through the comments on here and
 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.800
reading through the comments on here and
it seemed like the author is concerned

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810
it seemed like the author is concerned
 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.569
it seemed like the author is concerned
with that was that he wasn't sure what

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579
with that was that he wasn't sure what
 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.160
with that was that he wasn't sure what
the license was for actionbarsherlock

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
the license was for actionbarsherlock
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.580
the license was for actionbarsherlock
and mind are sitting is that is in fact

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
and mind are sitting is that is in fact
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.670
and mind are sitting is that is in fact
licensed under the apache license so

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
licensed under the apache license so
 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.110
licensed under the apache license so
that's a it's a permissive license

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
that's a it's a permissive license
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.970
that's a it's a permissive license
you're free to use it in your code and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980
you're free to use it in your code and
 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.339
you're free to use it in your code and
it works pretty well so right now our

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349
it works pretty well so right now our
 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.170
it works pretty well so right now our
recommended approach is to use

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
recommended approach is to use
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240
recommended approach is to use
actionbarsherlock we can't talk about

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
actionbarsherlock we can't talk about
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.910
actionbarsherlock we can't talk about
the future of the support library but we

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
the future of the support library but we
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.440
the future of the support library but we
do know that there's a demand to go and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
do know that there's a demand to go and
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.589
do know that there's a demand to go and

talking about but I think the confusion

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980
talking about but I think the confusion
 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.189
talking about but I think the confusion
was the first ask Ashley thought these

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199
was the first ask Ashley thought these
 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.589
was the first ask Ashley thought these
were tabs in which case it would be a

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599
were tabs in which case it would be a
 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.360
were tabs in which case it would be a
set of tabs vertically stacked in a tiny

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
set of tabs vertically stacked in a tiny
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.680
set of tabs vertically stacked in a tiny
chunk of the screen somewhere in the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
chunk of the screen somewhere in the
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.780
chunk of the screen somewhere in the
middle which would be very difficult to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
middle which would be very difficult to
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.920
middle which would be very difficult to
do and I don't think we actually have

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
do and I don't think we actually have
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.599
do and I don't think we actually have
that kind of functionality built in

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609
that kind of functionality built in
 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.699
that kind of functionality built in
other they're really just buttons though

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709
other they're really just buttons though
 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.710
other they're really just buttons though
yes this is the very first page of the

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720
yes this is the very first page of the
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.719
yes this is the very first page of the
app you let you launch google play and

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729
app you let you launch google play and
 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.509
app you let you launch google play and
you have four buttons hey you know apps

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519
you have four buttons hey you know apps
 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.969
you have four buttons hey you know apps
yeah this is music and movies member

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979
yeah this is music and movies member
 

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.280
yeah this is music and movies member
Berkeley and yes they're literally just

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290
Berkeley and yes they're literally just
 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.719
Berkeley and yes they're literally just
buttons they might look like tabs but

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729
buttons they might look like tabs but
 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.399
buttons they might look like tabs but
there's nothing special about them and

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409
there's nothing special about them and
 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.020
there's nothing special about them and
then you can just use you know normal

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030
then you can just use you know normal
 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.390
then you can just use you know normal
you know normal lab managers to go and

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400
you know normal lab managers to go and
 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.960
you know normal lab managers to go and
you know align them however you want so

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970
you know align them however you want so
 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.729
you know align them however you want so
so the secret is make buttons look like

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739
so the secret is make buttons look like
 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.990
so the secret is make buttons look like
tabs and then you can do whatever right

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000
tabs and then you can do whatever right
 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.849
tabs and then you can do whatever right
yes the secret of you I is just make

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859
yes the secret of you I is just make
 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.379
yes the secret of you I is just make
everything do what you wanted to do by

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
everything do what you wanted to do by
 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.420
everything do what you wanted to do by
making them all on tapped right or but

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
making them all on tapped right or but
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.190
making them all on tapped right or but
there's no or buttons depending on what

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200
there's no or buttons depending on what
 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.240
there's no or buttons depending on what
you wanted it

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250
you wanted it
 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.160
you wanted it
all right looks like we've got somebody

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170
all right looks like we've got somebody
 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.310
all right looks like we've got somebody
in the Hangout one of our regulars do

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
in the Hangout one of our regulars do
 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.160
in the Hangout one of our regulars do
you have a question sir yes I've got one

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170
you have a question sir yes I've got one
 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.360
you have a question sir yes I've got one
name I need to do a image views that go

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370
name I need to do a image views that go
 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.890
name I need to do a image views that go
for me you know the changes the picture

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900
for me you know the changes the picture
 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.440
for me you know the changes the picture
from zero you know 12 the number zero on

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450
from zero you know 12 the number zero on
 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.660
from zero you know 12 the number zero on
the screen and then it goes from zero to

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670
the screen and then it goes from zero to
 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:55.190
the screen and then it goes from zero to
100 in three seconds okay 100 and so you

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200
100 in three seconds okay 100 and so you
 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.580
100 in three seconds okay 100 and so you
wanted to count out to 103 seconds yes

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590
wanted to count out to 103 seconds yes
 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.560
wanted to count out to 103 seconds yes
it's nice to go from you know 0 1 2 3

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570
it's nice to go from you know 0 1 2 3
 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.620
it's nice to go from you know 0 1 2 3
all the way to 100 but can you tell us

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630
all the way to 100 but can you tell us
 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.450
all the way to 100 but can you tell us
why when you need specifically an image

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460
why when you need specifically an image
 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.790
why when you need specifically an image
feel for that or why is it that you need

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800
feel for that or why is it that you need
 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.400
feel for that or why is it that you need
an image viewer not the standard at XP

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410
an image viewer not the standard at XP
 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.330
an image viewer not the standard at XP
or other with you well it doesn't have

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
or other with you well it doesn't have
 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.130
or other with you well it doesn't have
to beat image with as to be something

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140
to beat image with as to be something
 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.110
to beat image with as to be something
that presents a picture because it's big

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120
that presents a picture because it's big
 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.690
that presents a picture because it's big
shells because its engine numbers that

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700
shells because its engine numbers that
 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.450
shells because its engine numbers that
were designed for the app okay

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
were designed for the app okay
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.840
were designed for the app okay
understand okay so I mean actually

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850
understand okay so I mean actually
 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.180
understand okay so I mean actually
possible that's going to be roughly 30

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
possible that's going to be roughly 30
 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.360
possible that's going to be roughly 30
frames per second which is perfectly

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
frames per second which is perfectly
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.090
frames per second which is perfectly
within the refresh rate at the screen

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100
within the refresh rate at the screen
 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.620
within the refresh rate at the screen
the only limiting factor there i think

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630
the only limiting factor there i think
 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.240
the only limiting factor there i think
is to be how quickly can you go and load

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250
is to be how quickly can you go and load
 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.060
is to be how quickly can you go and load
these images off of your storage and get

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070
these images off of your storage and get
 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.190
these images off of your storage and get
them into you into memory and into a

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200
them into you into memory and into a
 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.360
them into you into memory and into a
place that you can go and copy them into

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370
place that you can go and copy them into
 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.310
place that you can go and copy them into
your video buffer so i think as long as

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320
your video buffer so i think as long as
 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.630
your video buffer so i think as long as
you preload everything there shouldn't

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640
you preload everything there shouldn't
 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.650
you preload everything there shouldn't
be anything really technically

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660
be anything really technically
 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.750
be anything really technically
challenging about this did it give us an

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760
challenging about this did it give us an
 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.610
challenging about this did it give us an
estimate about how big those bitmaps are

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620
estimate about how big those bitmaps are
 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.980
estimate about how big those bitmaps are
I mean as a full screen bitmaps or are

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990
I mean as a full screen bitmaps or are
 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.420
I mean as a full screen bitmaps or are
they just tiny images there a PNG's

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430
they just tiny images there a PNG's
 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.090
they just tiny images there a PNG's
right but how are they and let me just

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100
right but how are they and let me just
 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.310
right but how are they and let me just
check that and then one more thing I did

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320
check that and then one more thing I did
 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.190
check that and then one more thing I did
all that is something that day I know

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200
all that is something that day I know
 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.440
all that is something that day I know
that all the image views of 0 to 9 and

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450
that all the image views of 0 to 9 and
 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.960
that all the image views of 0 to 9 and
just the day i paid with the visible and

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970
just the day i paid with the visible and
 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.730
just the day i paid with the visible and
invisible you know based on the number

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
invisible you know based on the number
 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.150
invisible you know based on the number
that i need to show but that they took

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160
that i need to show but that they took
 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.969
that i need to show but that they took
nine seconds to get from 0 to 100 right

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979
nine seconds to get from 0 to 100 right
 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.400
nine seconds to get from 0 to 100 right
yeah well i think in that case the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410
yeah well i think in that case the
 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.659
yeah well i think in that case the
really tricky thing is that you've gone

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669
really tricky thing is that you've gone
 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.860
really tricky thing is that you've gone
in I mean that's a lot of data to be

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870
in I mean that's a lot of data to be
 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.840
in I mean that's a lot of data to be
trying to go and load up all at once

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850
trying to go and load up all at once
 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.820
trying to go and load up all at once
yeah the best case scenario would be if

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830
yeah the best case scenario would be if
 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.469
yeah the best case scenario would be if
the bitmaps are small enough that you

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479
the bitmaps are small enough that you
 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:34.790
the bitmaps are small enough that you
can hold them all in memory and then

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800
can hold them all in memory and then
 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.620
can hold them all in memory and then
just display because if you have to swap

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630
just display because if you have to swap
 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.770
just display because if you have to swap
them back and forth

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780
them back and forth
 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.770
them back and forth
from memory yeah you may have them on

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780
from memory yeah you may have them on
 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.090
from memory yeah you may have them on
that too but you're gonna be modifying

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100
that too but you're gonna be modifying
 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.770
that too but you're gonna be modifying
your layout yeah and when you modify the

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780
your layout yeah and when you modify the
 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.170
your layout yeah and when you modify the
layout that's a lot more complicated nuh

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180
layout that's a lot more complicated nuh
 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.300
layout that's a lot more complicated nuh
stopping a an image out there's actually

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310
stopping a an image out there's actually
 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.980
stopping a an image out there's actually
a lot of structure behind it that has to

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990
a lot of structure behind it that has to
 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.570
a lot of structure behind it that has to
adjust right we have the entire layout

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580
adjust right we have the entire layout
 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.000
adjust right we have the entire layout
tray that we got to go and refresh yeah

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010
tray that we got to go and refresh yeah
 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.540
tray that we got to go and refresh yeah
so uh another thing that I held about

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550
so uh another thing that I held about
 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.159
so uh another thing that I held about
you tell me maybe it's better to you

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169
you tell me maybe it's better to you
 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.680
you tell me maybe it's better to you
something that scored them one second

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690
something that scored them one second
 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.700
something that scored them one second
let me just see what what it's called a

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710
let me just see what what it's called a
 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.820
let me just see what what it's called a
level list could that possibly faster

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830
level list could that possibly faster
 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.460
level list could that possibly faster
the speed a little less trouble yeah

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470
the speed a little less trouble yeah
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.110
the speed a little less trouble yeah
that's well that's usually not know what

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120
that's well that's usually not know what
 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.480
that's well that's usually not know what
it's intended for but I don't know if

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490
it's intended for but I don't know if
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.790
it's intended for but I don't know if
you could sort kajol it into doing that

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800
you could sort kajol it into doing that
 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.250
you could sort kajol it into doing that
another option would be to just extend

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.260
another option would be to just extend
 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.280
another option would be to just extend
directly a canvas yes I suppose think

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.290
directly a canvas yes I suppose think
 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.140
directly a canvas yes I suppose think
that is so what you're essentially doing

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150
that is so what you're essentially doing
 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.790
that is so what you're essentially doing
is you're playing full screen video or

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800
is you're playing full screen video or
 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.920
is you're playing full screen video or
there's a full full frame rate video

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
there's a full full frame rate video
 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.760
there's a full full frame rate video
right and you know the way our video

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770
right and you know the way our video
 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.050
right and you know the way our video
players work cuz they don't actually go

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.060
players work cuz they don't actually go
 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.129
players work cuz they don't actually go
and have an image you that they keep

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.139
and have an image you that they keep
 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.950
and have an image you that they keep
updating this have essentially a canvas

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960
updating this have essentially a canvas
 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.430
updating this have essentially a canvas
that they're drawing to and really that

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440
that they're drawing to and really that
 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.690
that they're drawing to and really that
that's going to be your key here right

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:45.700
that's going to be your key here right
 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.180
that's going to be your key here right
so make sure that you're not every time

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.190
so make sure that you're not every time
 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.100
so make sure that you're not every time
you have a new frame of your video which

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.110
you have a new frame of your video which
 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.740
you have a new frame of your video which
is essentially what this is that you can

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:52.750
is essentially what this is that you can
 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.240
is essentially what this is that you can
just go and draw that in flakes without

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250
just go and draw that in flakes without
 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.440
just go and draw that in flakes without
having to go and modify your view

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450
having to go and modify your view
 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.469
having to go and modify your view
hierarchy so and really the easiest way

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479
hierarchy so and really the easiest way
 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.120
hierarchy so and really the easiest way
to do that is going to be to go and use

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.130
to do that is going to be to go and use
 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.779
to do that is going to be to go and use
a canvas and just go and you know paint

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:03.789
a canvas and just go and you know paint
 

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:04.980
a canvas and just go and you know paint
your pixels right on top of whatever

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:04.990
your pixels right on top of whatever
 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.920
your pixels right on top of whatever
hurry on the screen exactly and that way

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:07.930
hurry on the screen exactly and that way
 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.300
hurry on the screen exactly and that way
also you can skip the step of having to

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.310
also you can skip the step of having to
 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.029
also you can skip the step of having to
clear it too right so if you even if you

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039
clear it too right so if you even if you
 

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:14.010
clear it too right so if you even if you
reload the same or if you reuse the same

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.020
reload the same or if you reuse the same
 

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.110
reload the same or if you reuse the same
image you right you're gonna have most

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120
image you right you're gonna have most
 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.930
image you right you're gonna have most
likely actually no I don't think if you

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:18.940
likely actually no I don't think if you
 

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.640
likely actually no I don't think if you
just update in place out to get one hour

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:20.650
just update in place out to get one hour
 

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.590
just update in place out to get one hour
then you wouldn't have the other whole

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:22.600
then you wouldn't have the other whole
 

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.870
then you wouldn't have the other whole
layout overhead right so you might be

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:24.880
layout overhead right so you might be
 

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.270
layout overhead right so you might be
able to get that too I mean it's still

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280
able to get that too I mean it's still
 

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.770
able to get that too I mean it's still
going to be a bit heavier than if you

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:28.780
going to be a bit heavier than if you
 

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.300
going to be a bit heavier than if you
just have a canvas and paint it directly

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.310
just have a canvas and paint it directly
 

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.200
just have a canvas and paint it directly
so that's going to get you the best

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.210
so that's going to get you the best
 

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.760
so that's going to get you the best
performance but you might be able get

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:32.770
performance but you might be able get
 

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.140
performance but you might be able get
away with just reusing the same image

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.150
away with just reusing the same image
 

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.540
away with just reusing the same image
you and updating that the the source is

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:36.550
you and updating that the the source is
 

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.579
you and updating that the the source is
being fed into it each time and of

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:38.589
being fed into it each time and of
 

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:40.079
being fed into it each time and of
course be careful about keeping a lot of

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:40.089
course be careful about keeping a lot of
 

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:41.430
course be careful about keeping a lot of
defense in memory since there there's a

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
defense in memory since there there's a
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.620
defense in memory since there there's a
memory limit right well it's not ready

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.630
memory limit right well it's not ready
 

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.390
memory limit right well it's not ready
to lend it over with the best equipment

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:45.400
to lend it over with the best equipment
 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.240
to lend it over with the best equipment
when I just checked the file sizes of

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.250
when I just checked the file sizes of
 

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.800
when I just checked the file sizes of
those numbers each one is about some

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:50.810
those numbers each one is about some
 

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.550
those numbers each one is about some
twin named fall 27 a kilobytes yeah but

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560
twin named fall 27 a kilobytes yeah but
 

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.290
twin named fall 27 a kilobytes yeah but
be careful that and it gives them

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:56.300
be careful that and it gives them
 

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.570
be careful that and it gives them
uncompressed in memory so the file size

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580
uncompressed in memory so the file size
 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.370
uncompressed in memory so the file size
may not reflect how much memory it

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:00.380
may not reflect how much memory it
 

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.650
may not reflect how much memory it
actually takes when you're loaded into a

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:02.660
actually takes when you're loaded into a
 

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.000
actually takes when you're loaded into a
bitmap object so but I mean assuming the

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.010
bitmap object so but I mean assuming the
 

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.410
bitmap object so but I mean assuming the
images are not very large it should be

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:08.420
images are not very large it should be
 

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.150
images are not very large it should be
all right yeah and in me and make make

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160
all right yeah and in me and make make
 

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.769
all right yeah and in me and make make
sure that you're not scaling them too I

00:09:11.769 --> 00:09:11.779
sure that you're not scaling them too I
 

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:15.070
sure that you're not scaling them too I
mean 30 frames per second you might be

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.080
mean 30 frames per second you might be
 

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.740
mean 30 frames per second you might be
able to get away with it but yeah it's

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750
able to get away with it but yeah it's
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.380
able to get away with it but yeah it's
cutting it close I would try and make

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:20.390
cutting it close I would try and make
 

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.640
cutting it close I would try and make
sure that whatever resolution be

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:21.650
sure that whatever resolution be
 

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.350
sure that whatever resolution be
displaying these on your screen is the

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360
displaying these on your screen is the
 

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.790
displaying these on your screen is the
resolution that they're stored locally

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800
resolution that they're stored locally
 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.310
resolution that they're stored locally
and then you keep that that processing

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320
and then you keep that that processing
 

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.690
and then you keep that that processing
pipeline as short as possible between

thank you China you can consider OpenGL

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.450
thank you China you can consider OpenGL
 

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.940
thank you China you can consider OpenGL
well yeah but then that's you know

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:39.950
well yeah but then that's you know
 

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.790
well yeah but then that's you know
that's the last option on the menu it

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800
that's the last option on the menu it
 

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.710
that's the last option on the menu it
should be possible to open jail I mean

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720
should be possible to open jail I mean
 

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.430
should be possible to open jail I mean
it it's video yeah you know a video does

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440
it it's video yeah you know a video does
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440
it it's video yeah you know a video does
take a bit of work but it is entirely

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.450
take a bit of work but it is entirely
 

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.150
take a bit of work but it is entirely
possible without having to resort to

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160
possible without having to resort to
 

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.230
possible without having to resort to
native code okay or open to jail for

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240
native code okay or open to jail for
 

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.550
native code okay or open to jail for

sure that that never happens so if you
 

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.920
sure that that never happens so if you
are actually saying I want to hide that

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:34.930
are actually saying I want to hide that

we provide a mechanism to go and pull it

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:37.460
we provide a mechanism to go and pull it

wanted you for that was make it so if
you tap anywhere on the screen your

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:44.300
you tap anywhere on the screen your
 

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.300
you tap anywhere on the screen your
system back comes back up the use case

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.310
system back comes back up the use case
 

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.740
system back comes back up the use case
for this is playing for example a

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:47.750
for this is playing for example a
 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.300
for this is playing for example a
YouTube video or any video for that

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:49.310
YouTube video or any video for that
 

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.700
YouTube video or any video for that
matter you get rid of the video but if

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:51.710
matter you get rid of the video but if
 

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.870
matter you get rid of the video but if
you tap some more just like the video

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880
you tap some more just like the video
 

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.760

controls come up so does your home

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:54.770
controls come up so does your home
 

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.880
controls come up so does your home
button so that's the behavior you get

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:57.890
button so that's the behavior you get
 

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.190
button so that's the behavior you get
automatically when you use that and

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200
automatically when you use that and
 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.450
automatically when you use that and
because the home button is sacred there

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:01.460
because the home button is sacred there
 

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.270
because the home button is sacred there
is no way to override that behavior so I

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:04.280
is no way to override that behavior so I
 

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.920
is no way to override that behavior so I
was reading through the comments and you

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:05.930
was reading through the comments and you
 

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.090
was reading through the comments and you
can suggest that maybe you want

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.100
can suggest that maybe you want
 

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.320
can suggest that maybe you want
something else like using the power

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.330
something else like using the power
 

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.600
something else like using the power

having a gesture there's a lot of

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:11.750
having a gesture there's a lot of
 

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.970

different approaches you could use for

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:12.980
different approaches you could use for
 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.890
different approaches you could use for
this but we decided that the use case we

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:14.900
this but we decided that the use case we
 

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.930
this but we decided that the use case we
want for this because it really is the

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:16.940
want for this because it really is the
 

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.580
want for this because it really is the
simplest one and this the one users are

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.590
simplest one and this the one users are
 

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.590
simplest one and this the one users are
already familiar with from videos is if

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600
already familiar with from videos is if
 

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.820
already familiar with from videos is if
you tap on the screen the home button

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:21.830
you tap on the screen the home button
 

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.960
you tap on the screen the home button
comes back I know you said in your

comes back I know you said in your
 

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.610
comes back I know you said in your
comments there's for a handwriting

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:27.620
comments there's for a handwriting
 

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.130
comments there's for a handwriting
recognition program you want to use use

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.140
recognition program you want to use use
 

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.900
recognition program you want to use use
jennie-o like for detecting gestures and

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:31.910
jennie-o like for detecting gestures and
 

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.650
jennie-o like for detecting gestures and
you want to make sure some use

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:32.660
you want to make sure some use

left-handed doesn't hit the home button
probably the best feedback I can think

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:36.830
probably the best feedback I can think
 

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.200
probably the best feedback I can think
of there is maybe we should move the

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.210
of there is maybe we should move the
 

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.130
of there is maybe we should move the
home button to the other side of the

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.140
home button to the other side of the
 

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.590
home button to the other side of the
screen is option but that's good

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600
screen is option but that's good
 

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.100
screen is option but that's good
feedback for our you 2i team but

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.110
feedback for our you 2i team but
 

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.880
feedback for our you 2i team but
unfortunately I don't think that there's

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:45.890
unfortunately I don't think that there's
 

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.040
unfortunately I don't think that there's
really any way that I can think of to go

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.050
really any way that I can think of to go
 

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.330
really any way that I can think of to go
and get the behavior you're looking

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:49.340
and get the behavior you're looking
 

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.740
and get the behavior you're looking
forward at home buttons completely gone

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:50.750
forward at home buttons completely gone

yeah I know my understanding of that is

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:53.420
yeah I know my understanding of that is
 

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.940
yeah I know my understanding of that is
they don't want to take away those

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:54.950
they don't want to take away those
 

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.770
they don't want to take away those
buttons because that's like the one

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:56.780
buttons because that's like the one
 

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.330
buttons because that's like the one
thing that can get people out of

Android ratted specifically because of

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199
Android ratted specifically because of
 

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:21.519
Android ratted specifically because of
performance constraints so yeah I think

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:21.529
performance constraints so yeah I think
 

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.749
performance constraints so yeah I think
you're going to get the best performance

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:22.759
you're going to get the best performance
 

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:25.420
you're going to get the best performance

external I zabal I mean I haven't

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:27.380
external I zabal I mean I haven't

mean what you're saying makes yeah I

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600
mean what you're saying makes yeah I
 

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.190
mean what you're saying makes yeah I
mean it looks like it's a lot more

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.200
mean it looks like it's a lot more
 

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.240
mean it looks like it's a lot more
because you know you're not supposed to

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.250
because you know you're not supposed to
 

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.889

external I zabal actually can be used

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.370
external I zabal actually can be used
 

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.910
external I zabal actually can be used
for you know writing to a file and stuff

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920
for you know writing to a file and stuff
 

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.650
for you know writing to a file and stuff
like that you know that's correct but

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:50.660
like that you know that's correct but
 

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.250
like that you know that's correct but
exercisable also i mean lets you specify

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:53.260
exercisable also i mean lets you specify
 

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.170
exercisable also i mean lets you specify
what file format you want correct right

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:56.180
what file format you want correct right
 

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.260
what file format you want correct right
I think so yeah we're as possible I

00:15:59.260 --> 00:15:59.270
I think so yeah we're as possible I
 

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.000
I think so yeah we're as possible I
imagine is going to have some very

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.010

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:04.970
make any sense outside of the devices
 

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.139
make any sense outside of the devices
you know context so for that reason you

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:08.149
you know context so for that reason you
 

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:09.370
you know context so for that reason you
probably have a little bit more overhead

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:09.380
probably have a little bit more overhead
 

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.079
probably have a little bit more overhead
with externalize Bowl because you have

00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:11.089
with externalize Bowl because you have
 

00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:14.260
with externalize Bowl because you have

okay I mean I think if you've ever

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:23.750
okay I mean I think if you've ever
 

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.420
okay I mean I think if you've ever
looked at protobuf protocol buffers

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.430
looked at protobuf protocol buffers
 

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.000
looked at protobuf protocol buffers
which we use internally at Google same

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.010
which we use internally at Google same
 

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.250

look like a random block on I guess but
because of that you get really good

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.490
because of that you get really good

out this question from n hot in
 

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.809
out this question from n hot in
Jerusalem what do you guys think all

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:22.819
Jerusalem what do you guys think all
 

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.970
Jerusalem what do you guys think all
right so as well so first I think we

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:24.980
right so as well so first I think we
 

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.530
right so as well so first I think we
have to define what you mean by static

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:26.540
have to define what you mean by static
 

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.939
have to define what you mean by static
block right i mean there's different

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:27.949
block right i mean there's different
 

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:29.490
block right i mean there's different
places you can use the static keyword

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:29.500
places you can use the static keyword
 

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.100
places you can use the static keyword
but so let's say that it's just you know

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:33.110
but so let's say that it's just you know
 

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.260
but so let's say that it's just you know
simplest case you have some static

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:35.270
simplest case you have some static
 

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.430
simplest case you have some static
variables that are included with your

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440
variables that are included with your
 

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.919
variables that are included with your
class right let's thetic open curly yeah

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:39.929
class right let's thetic open curly yeah
 

00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:42.970
class right let's thetic open curly yeah
yeah yeah same thing so in that case

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:42.980
yeah yeah same thing so in that case
 

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.249
yeah yeah same thing so in that case
it's as far as i understand it I mean

00:17:46.249 --> 00:17:46.259
it's as far as i understand it I mean
 

00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:48.139
it's as far as i understand it I mean

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440
in Java so your your variables are going
 

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.220
in Java so your your variables are going

your class which would I believe be as
 

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.960
your class which would I believe be as
soon as you launch your application yes

00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.970
soon as you launch your application yes
 

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.480
soon as you launch your application yes
depending on your usage yeah it might be

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:02.490
depending on your usage yeah it might be
 

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.159
depending on your usage yeah it might be
the case that a particular class is

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:04.169
the case that a particular class is
 

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:07.519
the case that a particular class is
loaded later so I wouldn't try I would

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:07.529
loaded later so I wouldn't try I would
 

00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:08.990
loaded later so I wouldn't try I would
try not to rely too much on this

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000
try not to rely too much on this
 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.119
try not to rely too much on this
behavior and then just use static blocks

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:11.129
behavior and then just use static blocks
 

00:18:11.129 --> 00:18:13.009
behavior and then just use static blocks
for things that should really be static

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:13.019
for things that should really be static
 

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:16.820
for things that should really be static
and it shouldn't matter what exactly the

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:16.830
and it shouldn't matter what exactly the
 

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.060
and it shouldn't matter what exactly the
life cycle is right so I wouldn't rely

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.070
life cycle is right so I wouldn't rely
 

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.480
life cycle is right so I wouldn't rely
on that too much the the general rule

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.490
on that too much the the general rule
 

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.980
on that too much the the general rule
though that should be followed is it

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:24.990
though that should be followed is it
 

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.830
though that should be followed is it
follows the same as its standard Java

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840
follows the same as its standard Java
 

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.560
follows the same as its standard Java
conventions right so I mean I've seen

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:30.570
conventions right so I mean I've seen
 

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.519
conventions right so I mean I've seen
interesting cases where it's some sort

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:34.529
interesting cases where it's some sort

was just wondering if the Android team
were thinking about incorporating

were thinking about incorporating
 

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:39.430
were thinking about incorporating
something to help tidy up the Android

something to help tidy up the Android
 

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.180
something to help tidy up the Android
code for new developers so if there's

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.190
code for new developers so if there's
 

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.299
code for new developers so if there's
code that's out of date would it

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:46.309
code that's out of date would it
 

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:49.990
code that's out of date would it
possibly be capable of tidying up the

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000
possibly be capable of tidying up the
 

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.529
possibly be capable of tidying up the

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:55.539

so it's very what context are you

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640
so it's very what context are you
 

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.710

thinking that were you thinking like
 

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.070
thinking that were you thinking like
what what code will be tidied up here um

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080
what what code will be tidied up here um
 

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:09.490
what what code will be tidied up here um
but basically a code that it says is i

that's really an app quality issue

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080
that's really an app quality issue

that's really an app quality issue
that's that's that's SDK issues and

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:46.610
do progress on maintaining a backwards
 

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.149
do progress on maintaining a backwards
compatible Android so we want to go and

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159
compatible Android so we want to go and
 

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:50.409
compatible Android so we want to go and
keep those around as long as possible

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:50.419
keep those around as long as possible
 

00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:52.000
keep those around as long as possible
even though we display warning saying

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.010
even though we display warning saying
 

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.610
even though we display warning saying
please don't use these but I think

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:54.620
please don't use these but I think
 

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.919
please don't use these but I think
that's a completely orthogonal issue to

00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:56.929
that's a completely orthogonal issue to
 

00:21:56.929 --> 00:21:57.610
that's a completely orthogonal issue to
Africa

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.620

deprecated SDK calls as an end user I'm

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:04.790
deprecated SDK calls as an end user I'm
 

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.730
deprecated SDK calls as an end user I'm
not going to see that right I'm going to

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:06.740
not going to see that right I'm going to
 

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.299
not going to see that right I'm going to
see the the the UI that's been designed

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:10.309
see the the the UI that's been designed
 

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:13.030
see the the the UI that's been designed
and you lady quality of the assets and

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:13.040
and you lady quality of the assets and
 

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.799
and you lady quality of the assets and
you know what you I conventions I'm

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:14.809
you know what you I conventions I'm
 

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:16.570
you know what you I conventions I'm
using and what my applications

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:16.580
using and what my applications
 

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.250
using and what my applications
navigational structure is right

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.260
navigational structure is right
 

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.560
navigational structure is right
performances performance is another very

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:20.570
performances performance is another very
 

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.330
performances performance is another very
important issue yeah does it though do

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.340
important issue yeah does it though do
 

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.100
important issue yeah does it though do
what I wanted to do etc that's sort of

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:24.110
what I wanted to do etc that's sort of
 

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.230
what I wanted to do etc that's sort of
that's a good quality yeah how well does

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240
that's a good quality yeah how well does
 

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.210
that's a good quality yeah how well does
it conform to the UI conventions too I

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:28.220
it conform to the UI conventions too I
 

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.340
it conform to the UI conventions too I
mean this is something we think about

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:30.350
mean this is something we think about
 

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.260
mean this is something we think about
you know we just recently released our

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:32.270
you know we just recently released our
 

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.570
you know we just recently released our
Android design site which goes into

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.580
Android design site which goes into
 

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.110
Android design site which goes into
quite a bit of detail about what

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120
quite a bit of detail about what
 

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.570
quite a bit of detail about what
different conventions are used

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580
different conventions are used
 

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.730
different conventions are used
throughout Android and what UI developer

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:42.740
throughout Android and what UI developer
 

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.680
throughout Android and what UI developer
should be following we've also been

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:44.690
should be following we've also been
 

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.549
should be following we've also been
doing quite a bit of work on the

00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559
doing quite a bit of work on the
 

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:48.070
doing quite a bit of work on the
framework side ever since honeycomb oh

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080
framework side ever since honeycomb oh
 

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.250
framework side ever since honeycomb oh
you know we've released our holo theme

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.260
you know we've released our holo theme
 

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.919
you know we've released our holo theme
with the goal of both giving a visual

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:53.929
with the goal of both giving a visual
 

00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:55.900
with the goal of both giving a visual
refresh with the Android platform but

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:55.910
refresh with the Android platform but
 

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.970
refresh with the Android platform but
providing a single theme this guaranteed

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:57.980
providing a single theme this guaranteed
 

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.370
providing a single theme this guaranteed
to be present all devices even if the

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:00.380
to be present all devices even if the
 

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.750
to be present all devices even if the
rest of the system theme has been

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760
rest of the system theme has been
 

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.650
rest of the system theme has been
modified or customized by OEMs so you're

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:05.660
modified or customized by OEMs so you're
 

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.120
modified or customized by OEMs so you're
always guaranteed on a honeycomb when

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.130
always guaranteed on a honeycomb when
 

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.950
always guaranteed on a honeycomb when

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960
your device to have the holo theme
 

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.460
your device to have the holo theme
present but really a lot of the ends so

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:12.470
present but really a lot of the ends so
 

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.200
present but really a lot of the ends so
I mean we're trying to put the tools out

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:14.210
I mean we're trying to put the tools out
 

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.360
I mean we're trying to put the tools out
there to go and make sure that app

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:16.370
there to go and make sure that app
 

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.400
there to go and make sure that app
developers can write all the apps and

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.410
developers can write all the apps and
 

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.290
developers can write all the apps and
make sure that you follow the same

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:20.300
make sure that you follow the same
 

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.180
make sure that you follow the same
guidelines but part of it too is just an

guidelines but part of it too is just an
 

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.220
guidelines but part of it too is just an
app developers have to follow those

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:24.230
app developers have to follow those
 

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.840
app developers have to follow those
guidelines you know we can only do so

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:25.850
guidelines you know we can only do so
 

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.140
guidelines you know we can only do so
much on our end all right we do use a

new developer myself on the Android
 

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.570
new developer myself on the Android
platform so I just want to make sure

developing a simple SMS scheduler up at
 

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.860
developing a simple SMS scheduler up at
the moment I just want to make sure that

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:47.870
the moment I just want to make sure that
 

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.440
the moment I just want to make sure that
customers are use Android devices feel

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:50.450
customers are use Android devices feel
 

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.210
customers are use Android devices feel
that they get as good quality ups as

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:52.220
that they get as good quality ups as
 

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.080
that they get as good quality ups as
people on other platforms so yeah so in

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.090
people on other platforms so yeah so in
 

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.460
people on other platforms so yeah so in
that case I would definitely take a look

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.470
that case I would definitely take a look
 

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.860
that case I would definitely take a look
at the Android design site how are you I

00:23:59.860 --> 00:23:59.870
at the Android design site how are you I
 

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.380
at the Android design site how are you I
looks it's going to be one of the most

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:02.390
looks it's going to be one of the most
 

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.600
looks it's going to be one of the most
important things as far as how users

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:04.610
important things as far as how users
 

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.910
important things as far as how users
perceive the quality of the application

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:06.920
perceive the quality of the application
 

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.260
perceive the quality of the application
and then I'd say that the second i have

is not going to be enough right that'll

00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:26.869
is not going to be enough right that'll
 

00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:28.810
is not going to be enough right that'll
go to the visual look and feel but of

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:28.820
go to the visual look and feel but of
 

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.369
go to the visual look and feel but of
course you know how you actually design

00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:30.379
course you know how you actually design
 

00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:32.859

your UI matters a lot too and we can't
 

00:24:32.869 --> 00:24:34.239
your UI matters a lot too and we can't
do that for you automatically right and

do that for you automatically right and
 

00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:35.589
do that for you automatically right and
we know how do your buttons look you

00:24:35.589 --> 00:24:35.599
we know how do your buttons look you
 

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:37.509
we know how do your buttons look you
know how do you structure your action

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:37.519
know how do you structure your action
 

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:39.609
know how do you structure your action
bar you know how have you hired a

00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:39.619
bar you know how have you hired a
 

00:24:39.619 --> 00:24:40.959

graphic design or they go into your
 

00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:42.519
graphic design or they go into your
graphics because most programmers are

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:42.529
graphics because most programmers are
 

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:44.459
graphics because most programmers are
actually not that good graphic design

00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:44.469
actually not that good graphic design
 

00:24:44.469 --> 00:24:48.669
actually not that good graphic design

attention to performance I think it's

00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279
attention to performance I think it's
 

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:02.169
attention to performance I think it's
easy to overlook that probably the

00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:02.179
easy to overlook that probably the
 

00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:04.509
easy to overlook that probably the
easiest thing to do is go into developer

00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:04.519
easiest thing to do is go into developer
 

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.009
easiest thing to do is go into developer

from the beginning sorry about that is
it a correct assumption that a rooted

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.150
it a correct assumption that a rooted
 

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.510
it a correct assumption that a rooted
android phone is inherently insecure

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520
android phone is inherently insecure
 

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.260
android phone is inherently insecure
that there is no way to properly secure

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.270
that there is no way to properly secure
 

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:09.390
that there is no way to properly secure
a rooted android phone ah ok so yes the

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400
a rooted android phone ah ok so yes the
 

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.730
a rooted android phone ah ok so yes the
question is is it possible to have a

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:11.740
question is is it possible to have a
 

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.650
question is is it possible to have a
secure rooted phone or they always

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:13.660
secure rooted phone or they always
 

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.510
secure rooted phone or they always
insecure no just always assume that a

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520
insecure no just always assume that a
 

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.130
insecure no just always assume that a
rooted phone is insecure yes that is

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.140
rooted phone is insecure yes that is
 

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.740
rooted phone is insecure yes that is
correct yeah so the Android security

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:19.750
correct yeah so the Android security
 

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.140
correct yeah so the Android security
model defense depends on sandboxing apps

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.150
model defense depends on sandboxing apps
 

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.770
model defense depends on sandboxing apps
by process ID as well as by user IDs

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:25.780
by process ID as well as by user IDs
 

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.380
by process ID as well as by user IDs
when you install an app the system will

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:28.390
when you install an app the system will
 

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.990
when you install an app the system will
assign it a unique user ID for that

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000
assign it a unique user ID for that
 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.450
assign it a unique user ID for that
particular application and the problem

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:33.460
particular application and the problem
 

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.130
particular application and the problem
is is if you root your phone and you

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:35.140
is is if you root your phone and you
 

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.860
is is if you root your phone and you
allow applications to run this route it

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:37.870
allow applications to run this route it
 

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.870
allow applications to run this route it
means every application can read from

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880
means every application can read from
 

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.390
means every application can read from
every other application sandbox and so

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400
every other application sandbox and so
 

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.640
every other application sandbox and so
you've completely disabled Android

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
you've completely disabled Android
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.560
you've completely disabled Android
sandboxing functionality which is in

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:46.570
sandboxing functionality which is in
 

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.950
sandboxing functionality which is in
fact insecure so yeah now there are some

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960
fact insecure so yeah now there are some
 

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.100
fact insecure so yeah now there are some
apps like super user out there which

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.110
apps like super user out there which
 

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:56.100
apps like super user out there which
attempt to mitigate this by adding some

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.110
attempt to mitigate this by adding some
 

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.810
attempt to mitigate this by adding some
hooks that will pop up a dialog and

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:57.820
hooks that will pop up a dialog and
 

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.340
hooks that will pop up a dialog and
giving you like an allow denied choice

00:36:59.340 --> 00:36:59.350
giving you like an allow denied choice
 

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.590
giving you like an allow denied choice
whenever an app requires root permission

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:01.600
whenever an app requires root permission
 

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.140
whenever an app requires root permission
and that helps to go and improve this

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.150
and that helps to go and improve this
 

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.300
and that helps to go and improve this
the problem with that though is you're

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:06.310
the problem with that though is you're
 

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.750
the problem with that though is you're
depending entirely on making sure that

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760
depending entirely on making sure that
 

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.450
depending entirely on making sure that
there's no privilege escalation bugs in

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:12.460
there's no privilege escalation bugs in
 

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.470
there's no privilege escalation bugs in
the superuser app and I have never done

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480
the superuser app and I have never done
 

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.110
the superuser app and I have never done
an analysis on this myself but I know

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:19.120
an analysis on this myself but I know
 

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.150
an analysis on this myself but I know
some of our security folks have and they

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160
some of our security folks have and they
 

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.340
some of our security folks have and they
had a few concerns I can't really speak

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:23.350
had a few concerns I can't really speak
 

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.350
had a few concerns I can't really speak
any more to it than that because I don't

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:25.360
any more to it than that because I don't
 

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:30.410
any more to it than that because I don't
remember but I guess my point is yeah in

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420
remember but I guess my point is yeah in
 

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:36.620
remember but I guess my point is yeah in
given that I've never are so given that

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:36.630
given that I've never are so given that
 

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.089
given that I've never are so given that
it's sort of a sketchy area to begin

00:37:39.089 --> 00:37:39.099
it's sort of a sketchy area to begin
 

00:37:39.099 --> 00:37:40.770
it's sort of a sketchy area to begin
with and I don't think a lot of people

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:40.780
with and I don't think a lot of people
 

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.920

if you have if you really do care about

the date of your phone the easiest thing
 

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.250
the date of your phone the easiest thing
is just not to root it now that being

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:53.260
is just not to root it now that being
 

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.480
is just not to root it now that being
said I there's not too much that you

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:57.490
said I there's not too much that you
 

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.160
said I there's not too much that you
actually need to read your phone for I

00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.170
actually need to read your phone for I
 

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:00.810
actually need to read your phone for I
understand wanting to unlock your phone

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:00.820
understand wanting to unlock your phone
 

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.460
understand wanting to unlock your phone
to put alternative firmwares on there

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:02.470
to put alternative firmwares on there
 

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.829
to put alternative firmwares on there
but actually putting ruin your phone is

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839
but actually putting ruin your phone is
 

00:38:04.839 --> 00:38:09.050
but actually putting ruin your phone is
only useful in a few specialized cases

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060
only useful in a few specialized cases
 

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.730
only useful in a few specialized cases
so I'm just a curiosity where's that

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:11.740
so I'm just a curiosity where's that
 

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.810
so I'm just a curiosity where's that
you're trying to deal with it requires

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:12.820
you're trying to deal with it requires
 

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.569
you're trying to deal with it requires
root I don't require root at all but I

00:38:15.569 --> 00:38:15.579
root I don't require root at all but I
 

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:19.050
root I don't require root at all but I
know that certain consumers of my rest

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:19.060
know that certain consumers of my rest
 

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.609
know that certain consumers of my rest
api will run on a rooted phone ah yeah

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:23.619
api will run on a rooted phone ah yeah
 

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:26.280
api will run on a rooted phone ah yeah
so yeah me so and yeah I mean that is a

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:26.290
so yeah me so and yeah I mean that is a
 

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.109
so yeah me so and yeah I mean that is a
concern if your app is running on a

00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119
concern if your app is running on a
 

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:31.740
concern if your app is running on a
rooted phone yeah that phone is problem

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:31.750
rooted phone yeah that phone is problem
 

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.800
rooted phone yeah that phone is problem
is is not as secure as a phone that has

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:34.810
is is not as secure as a phone that has
 

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.750
is is not as secure as a phone that has
not been rooted but if we turn the

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760
not been rooted but if we turn the
 

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.000
not been rooted but if we turn the
question around and so we can assume

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.010
question around and so we can assume
 

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.370
question around and so we can assume
that a non rooted android device is

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:41.380
that a non rooted android device is
 

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.010
that a non rooted android device is
perfectly secure if for example I have I

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:44.020
perfectly secure if for example I have I
 

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.470
perfectly secure if for example I have I
would not say perfectly secure we can

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480
would not say perfectly secure we can
 

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.890
would not say perfectly secure we can
say perfectly secure to anything yes as

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:49.900
say perfectly secure to anything yes as
 

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.230
say perfectly secure to anything yes as
somebody who's studied uh you know

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240
somebody who's studied uh you know
 

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.059
somebody who's studied uh you know
computer science i can say that i don't

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:54.069
computer science i can say that i don't
 

00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:55.319
computer science i can say that i don't
know of any system that was perfectly

00:38:55.319 --> 00:38:55.329
know of any system that was perfectly
 

00:38:55.329 --> 00:38:58.079
know of any system that was perfectly
secure I know systems are very secure

00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:58.089
secure I know systems are very secure
 

00:38:58.089 --> 00:38:59.370
secure I know systems are very secure
but I don't know if needed are perfectly

00:38:59.370 --> 00:38:59.380
but I don't know if needed are perfectly
 

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.410
but I don't know if needed are perfectly
secure perfectly to get me out of our

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:01.420
secure perfectly to get me out of our
 

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.660
secure perfectly to get me out of our
asymptotes where you can get clothes but

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:03.670
asymptotes where you can get clothes but
 

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.849
asymptotes where you can get clothes but
it doesn't exist so uh in terms of yeah

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:08.859
it doesn't exist so uh in terms of yeah
 

00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:10.559
it doesn't exist so uh in terms of yeah
i think android security is very good

00:39:10.559 --> 00:39:10.569
i think android security is very good
 

00:39:10.569 --> 00:39:13.170
i think android security is very good
but I'm not ever going to call anything

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:13.180
but I'm not ever going to call anything
 

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.420
but I'm not ever going to call anything
perfect because I know later on I'll

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.430
perfect because I know later on I'll

perfect because I know later on I'll
wind up regretting that if for no other

wind up regretting that if for no other
 

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.290
wind up regretting that if for no other
reason than you could treat the phone as

reason than you could treat the phone as
 

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.089
reason than you could treat the phone as
though it were not rooted and then

00:39:21.089 --> 00:39:21.099
though it were not rooted and then
 

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:22.589
though it were not rooted and then
someone could come along with the phone

00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599
someone could come along with the phone
 

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:25.230
someone could come along with the phone
well or rooted phone could pretend to be

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240
well or rooted phone could pretend to be
 

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.940
well or rooted phone could pretend to be
unrooted your own then you have other

there are all sorts of fun little
side-channel attacks that yes what is it

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:40.300
side-channel attacks that yes what is it
 

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.620

anyway so did you have any fun more
 

00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:47.630
anyway so did you have any fun more
follow up on that or we suppose what

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640
follow up on that or we suppose what
 

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.480
follow up on that or we suppose what
would be like the the general security

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:50.490
would be like the the general security
 

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.460
would be like the the general security
guidelines that that we would need to

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:52.470
guidelines that that we would need to
 

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.220
guidelines that that we would need to
implement for example I have this kind

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:55.230
implement for example I have this kind
 

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.990
implement for example I have this kind
of remember me functionality because I

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000
of remember me functionality because I
 

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.609
of remember me functionality because I
don't want the user to type in their

00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:58.619
don't want the user to type in their
 

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:01.940
don't want the user to type in their
username passwords every half an hour or

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:01.950
username passwords every half an hour or
 

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.370
username passwords every half an hour or
every day so I need to store some kind

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380
every day so I need to store some kind
 

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.430
every day so I need to store some kind
of credentials on the phone okay so like

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440
of credentials on the phone okay so like
 

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.170
of credentials on the phone okay so like
I can I can store for example an

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180
I can I can store for example an
 

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.940
I can I can store for example an
authentication code that comes from the

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:13.950
authentication code that comes from the
 

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.299
authentication code that comes from the
REST API I can encrypt that on the

00:40:17.299 --> 00:40:17.309
REST API I can encrypt that on the
 

00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:20.150
REST API I can encrypt that on the
device I can obfuscate my coat would

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160
device I can obfuscate my coat would
 

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.029
device I can obfuscate my coat would
that be a sufficient level of security

00:40:23.029 --> 00:40:23.039
that be a sufficient level of security
 

00:40:23.039 --> 00:40:26.480
that be a sufficient level of security
for a mobile app or yes I say

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.490
for a mobile app or yes I say
 

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:30.289
for a mobile app or yes I say
recommendation I give is to yeah so

00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:30.299
recommendation I give is to yeah so
 

00:40:30.299 --> 00:40:31.880
recommendation I give is to yeah so
basically what you're saying you create

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:31.890
basically what you're saying you create
 

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.890
basically what you're saying you create
an authentication token so the very

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900
an authentication token so the very
 

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.420
an authentication token so the very
first time you login these will provide

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:35.430
first time you login these will provide
 

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.430
first time you login these will provide
their user and password of course that

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440
their user and password of course that
 

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.470
their user and password of course that
jelly is over an encrypted channel yeah

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480
jelly is over an encrypted channel yeah
 

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.200
jelly is over an encrypted channel yeah
and then you return back a token that

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.210
and then you return back a token that
 

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.960
and then you return back a token that
you save on the device instead and then

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:44.970
you save on the device instead and then
 

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.180
you save on the device instead and then
if the user ever changes their password

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:47.190
if the user ever changes their password
 

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.309
if the user ever changes their password
via your web app or you know whatever

00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319
via your web app or you know whatever
 

00:40:49.319 --> 00:40:50.920
via your web app or you know whatever
change password functionality you have

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:50.930
change password functionality you have
 

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:54.140
change password functionality you have
revoke all the old tokens and make the

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:54.150
revoke all the old tokens and make the
 

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.480
revoke all the old tokens and make the
user retentate on those devices and so

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:56.490
user retentate on those devices and so
 

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.900
user retentate on those devices and so
what that means is if the though most

00:40:59.900 --> 00:40:59.910
what that means is if the though most
 

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:01.670
what that means is if the though most
importantly it means if somebody does

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680
importantly it means if somebody does
 

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.349
importantly it means if somebody does
mean to compromise your credential store

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359
mean to compromise your credential store
 

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:05.870
mean to compromise your credential store
it means the users plaintext password is

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880
it means the users plaintext password is
 

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.259
it means the users plaintext password is
interviewed and yeah the problem is

00:41:09.259 --> 00:41:09.269
interviewed and yeah the problem is
 

00:41:09.269 --> 00:41:10.849
interviewed and yeah the problem is
users are usually pretty bad with their

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859
users are usually pretty bad with their
 

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:12.589
users are usually pretty bad with their
passwords when they change them a lot of

00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599
passwords when they change them a lot of
 

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:13.910
passwords when they change them a lot of
times listen you change it by one digit

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920
times listen you change it by one digit
 

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.670
times listen you change it by one digit
or worse they'll go and we use that

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680
or worse they'll go and we use that
 

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.839
or worse they'll go and we use that
password across the lot of different

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:17.849
password across the lot of different
 

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:20.569
password across the lot of different
sites now and therefore if somebody

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579
sites now and therefore if somebody
 

00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:22.460
sites now and therefore if somebody
discovers your plaintext password for a

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:22.470
discovers your plaintext password for a
 

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.370
discovers your plaintext password for a
user that's very bad or as if they just

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380
user that's very bad or as if they just
 

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.599
user that's very bad or as if they just
have an auth token you can revoke that

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:26.609
have an auth token you can revoke that
 

00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:28.839
have an auth token you can revoke that
auto can every issue later and you know

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:28.849
auto can every issue later and you know
 

00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:31.990
auto can every issue later and you know
that mitigates a lot of the risk there

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000
that mitigates a lot of the risk there
 

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.019
that mitigates a lot of the risk there
now as far as investigating your code

00:41:35.019 --> 00:41:35.029
now as far as investigating your code
 

00:41:35.029 --> 00:41:40.220
now as far as investigating your code
that's you know it helps in some cases

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:40.230
that's you know it helps in some cases
 

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.509
that's you know it helps in some cases
and that does make it a little bit

00:41:41.509 --> 00:41:41.519
and that does make it a little bit
 

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:43.069
and that does make it a little bit
harder to go and understand your code if

00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079
harder to go and understand your code if
 

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:45.410
harder to go and understand your code if
you run it through a deep compiler but

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420
you run it through a deep compiler but
 

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.150
you run it through a deep compiler but
the problem is if somebody really is

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160
the problem is if somebody really is
 

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.529
the problem is if somebody really is
determined and there are a lot of

00:41:48.529 --> 00:41:48.539
determined and there are a lot of
 

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:51.620
determined and there are a lot of
determined people out there who enjoy

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:51.630
determined people out there who enjoy
 

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.029
determined people out there who enjoy
trying to go and figure out how things

00:41:53.029 --> 00:41:53.039
trying to go and figure out how things
 

00:41:53.039 --> 00:41:56.090
trying to go and figure out how things
work that you know if my

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.100
work that you know if my
 

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.700
work that you know if my
take them you know instead of a day it

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:58.710
take them you know instead of a day it
 

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.980
take them you know instead of a day it
might take them a couple of weeks but

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:00.990
might take them a couple of weeks but
 

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.470
might take them a couple of weeks but
you know codification won't actually

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480
you know codification won't actually
 

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.450
you know codification won't actually
it's not going to prevent somebody from

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460
it's not going to prevent somebody from
 

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.890
it's not going to prevent somebody from
trying to ferret Rico does right it

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900
trying to ferret Rico does right it
 

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.900
trying to ferret Rico does right it
removes his it's not a lot just trying

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:08.910
removes his it's not a lot just trying
 

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.120
removes his it's not a lot just trying
to make them bar who is still there yeah

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.130
to make them bar who is still there yeah
 

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.980
to make them bar who is still there yeah
not so yeah so much security you need

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:12.990
not so yeah so much security you need
 

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.870
not so yeah so much security you need
really depends on how badly people are

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880
really depends on how badly people are
 

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.970
really depends on how badly people are
going to want to break it so if you're

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980
going to want to break it so if you're
 

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.670
going to want to break it so if you're
protecting you like Bank data or like

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680
protecting you like Bank data or like
 

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.710
protecting you like Bank data or like
banking data I mean it's a Prudential

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720
banking data I mean it's a Prudential
 

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.090
banking data I mean it's a Prudential
with which someone somebody could lose

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:23.100
with which someone somebody could lose
 

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.860
with which someone somebody could lose
money or something then you're probably

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:24.870
money or something then you're probably
 

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.870
money or something then you're probably
gonna need better security than if it's

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880
gonna need better security than if it's
 

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.180
gonna need better security than if it's
just i don't know--it app application so

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:29.190
just i don't know--it app application so
 

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.670
just i don't know--it app application so
i mean it all depends on the case the

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680
i mean it all depends on the case the
 

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.770
i mean it all depends on the case the
office you do your code and you install

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780
office you do your code and you install
 

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.750
office you do your code and you install
your credentials encrypted and you take

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760
your credentials encrypted and you take
 

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.640
your credentials encrypted and you take
all these measures then definitely it's

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:37.650
all these measures then definitely it's
 

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.610
all these measures then definitely it's
going to take a very very determined

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:39.620
going to take a very very determined
 

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.990
going to take a very very determined
cracker to actually get the information

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000
cracker to actually get the information
 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.910
cracker to actually get the information
so you can ever hope for a hundred

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920
so you can ever hope for a hundred
 

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.500
so you can ever hope for a hundred
percent security can just make it very

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:45.510
percent security can just make it very
 

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.510
percent security can just make it very
difficult yeah and if you really do want

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520
difficult yeah and if you really do want
 

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.230
difficult yeah and if you really do want
extra security you know what I'd

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240
extra security you know what I'd
 

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.420
extra security you know what I'd
recommend is using x509 client

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:53.430
recommend is using x509 client
 

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.960
recommend is using x509 client

security a security need it is an option
 

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.120
security a security need it is an option
though yeah because here there's also

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.130
though yeah because here there's also
 

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.860
though yeah because here there's also
this business requirement that user

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:27.870
this business requirement that user
 

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.740
this business requirement that user
simple city it is also very important i

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:30.750
simple city it is also very important i

mean users should only be able to key in

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:35.570
mean users should only be able to key in
 

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:38.630
mean users should only be able to key in
username password once during some kind

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640
username password once during some kind
 

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.850
username password once during some kind
of registration flow and then the things

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:40.860
of registration flow and then the things
 

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.310
of registration flow and then the things
should just work basically like you have

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:43.320
should just work basically like you have
 

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.310
should just work basically like you have
like with an oauth2 application where

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:46.320
like with an oauth2 application where
 

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.920
like with an oauth2 application where
you kind of log in to service you get

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:48.930
you kind of log in to service you get
 

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.470
you kind of log in to service you get
this access token refresh token and then

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480
this access token refresh token and then
 

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.170
this access token refresh token and then
you're good to go but yeah so in that

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180
you're good to go but yeah so in that
 

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.850
you're good to go but yeah so in that
case I'd say the most likely what you're

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:55.860
case I'd say the most likely what you're
 

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.120
case I'd say the most likely what you're
looking for is to just go and store a

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.130
looking for is to just go and store a
 

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.880
looking for is to just go and store a
randomly generated off token generated

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:01.890
randomly generated off token generated
 

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.860
randomly generated off token generated
for this new user session which is the

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:03.870
for this new user session which is the
 

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.990
for this new user session which is the
new it basically once they've logged in

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000
new it basically once they've logged in
 

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.550
new it basically once they've logged in
until they've cleared data on that or

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560
until they've cleared data on that or
 

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.140
until they've cleared data on that or
reset their password

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:09.150
reset their password
 

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.299
reset their password
and then make sure you do storage within

00:44:11.299 --> 00:44:11.309
and then make sure you do storage within
 

00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:13.190
and then make sure you do storage within
the applications data directory on

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200
the applications data directory on
 

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.260
the applications data directory on
internal storage and you mark it as

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:15.270
internal storage and you mark it as
 

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.799
internal storage and you mark it as
private every now and then we'll see

00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:18.809
private every now and then we'll see
 

00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:20.299
private every now and then we'll see
somebody try and store credentials on

00:44:20.299 --> 00:44:20.309
somebody try and store credentials on
 

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:22.069
somebody try and store credentials on
the SD card which is a very bad place to

00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079
the SD card which is a very bad place to
 

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:23.870
the SD card which is a very bad place to
put them because the SD card it doesn't

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880
put them because the SD card it doesn't
 

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.289
put them because the SD card it doesn't
enforce and boxing but yeah I'd say

00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:27.299
enforce and boxing but yeah I'd say
 

00:44:27.299 --> 00:44:29.180
enforce and boxing but yeah I'd say

it's not only possible it's actually
 

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.089
it's not only possible it's actually
super easy all you have to do is query

00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099
super easy all you have to do is query
 

00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:07.519
super easy all you have to do is query
the package manager and I mean I assume

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:07.529
the package manager and I mean I assume
 

00:45:07.529 --> 00:45:08.539
the package manager and I mean I assume
you're going to have some sort of

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:08.549
you're going to have some sort of
 

00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:12.140
you're going to have some sort of
internal list of what of your

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.150
internal list of what of your
 

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:14.960
internal list of what of your
applications a just corey package

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:14.970
applications a just corey package
 

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.309
applications a just corey package
manager will return a list of installed

00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319
manager will return a list of installed
 

00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:19.549
manager will return a list of installed
applications yeah it management yeah and

00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559
applications yeah it management yeah and
 

00:45:19.559 --> 00:45:21.769
applications yeah it management yeah and
even just search for thing if you start

00:45:21.769 --> 00:45:21.779
even just search for thing if you start
 

00:45:21.779 --> 00:45:23.240
even just search for thing if you start
off your packages you know calm my

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.250
off your packages you know calm my
 

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.309
off your packages you know calm my
company right I scruffty that list and

00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319
company right I scruffty that list and
 

00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:26.539
company right I scruffty that list and
find everything that's going on my

00:45:26.539 --> 00:45:26.549
find everything that's going on my
 

00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:28.279
find everything that's going on my
company I think you can actually just

00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:28.289
company I think you can actually just
 

00:45:28.289 --> 00:45:29.809
company I think you can actually just
filter and have a return to filtered

00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819
filter and have a return to filtered
 

00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:31.069
filter and have a return to filtered
well yeah of course then you have got

00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079
well yeah of course then you have got
 

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:33.260
well yeah of course then you have got
foot you know come my company my app

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.270
foot you know come my company my app
 

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.180
foot you know come my company my app
actually corresponds to a sort of a

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:35.190
actually corresponds to a sort of a
 

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.150
actually corresponds to a sort of a
human readable name but to do that you

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160
human readable name but to do that you
 

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.529
human readable name but to do that you
can actually then go a step further and

00:45:39.529 --> 00:45:39.539
can actually then go a step further and
 

00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:41.480
can actually then go a step further and
check you can actually look inside of

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:41.490
check you can actually look inside of
 

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.720
check you can actually look inside of
that applications resource table and

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:43.730
that applications resource table and
 

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.519
that applications resource table and
query for its you know its list of

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:46.529
query for its you know its list of
 

00:45:46.529 --> 00:45:48.769
query for its you know its list of
strings or just ask what the application

00:45:48.769 --> 00:45:48.779
strings or just ask what the application
 

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:51.680
strings or just ask what the application
reports is title to so yeah as long as

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:51.690
reports is title to so yeah as long as
 

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.970
reports is title to so yeah as long as
your applications are signed with the

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980
your applications are signed with the
 

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.799
your applications are signed with the
same developer signature you can

00:45:54.799 --> 00:45:54.809
same developer signature you can
 

00:45:54.809 --> 00:45:56.299
same developer signature you can
actually go and retrieve resources from

00:45:56.299 --> 00:45:56.309
actually go and retrieve resources from
 

00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:57.950
actually go and retrieve resources from
other apps on the system so that also

00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960
other apps on the system so that also
 

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.359
other apps on the system so that also
gives you a lot of additional

00:45:59.359 --> 00:45:59.369
gives you a lot of additional
 

00:45:59.369 --> 00:46:01.700
gives you a lot of additional
functionality there but yeah first step

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:01.710
functionality there but yeah first step
 

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.599
functionality there but yeah first step
is take a look in package manager

00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:04.609
is take a look in package manager
 

00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:07.760
is take a look in package manager
alright thanks for that question anybody

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:07.770
alright thanks for that question anybody
 

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.160
alright thanks for that question anybody

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:23.750
one that I if I can yes DVD fee left to

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760
one that I if I can yes DVD fee left to
 

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.970
one that I if I can yes DVD fee left to
see Debbie yes hey I I want to ask about

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980
see Debbie yes hey I I want to ask about
 

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.890
see Debbie yes hey I I want to ask about
a how many blood of connections can a

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:32.900
a how many blood of connections can a
 

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:37.280
a how many blood of connections can a
android supports immune taneously that's

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:37.290
android supports immune taneously that's
 

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.220
android supports immune taneously that's
a good question i don't know how many

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:40.230
a good question i don't know how many
 

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.680
a good question i don't know how many
blue connections can invigorate support

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:42.690
blue connections can invigorate support
 

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.359
blue connections can invigorate support
simultaneously i think that's more of a

00:46:44.359 --> 00:46:44.369
simultaneously i think that's more of a
 

00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:46.670
simultaneously i think that's more of a
hardware yeah limitation then assault

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680
hardware yeah limitation then assault
 

00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.780
hardware yeah limitation then assault
yeah I want to say it's gonna be

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:47.790
yeah I want to say it's gonna be
 

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.390
yeah I want to say it's gonna be

00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099
the so let's ask about the galaxy nexus
 

00:46:56.099 --> 00:46:59.660
the so let's ask about the galaxy nexus
for example well I I don't think anyway

00:46:59.660 --> 00:46:59.670
for example well I I don't think anyway
 

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.030

this room can actually answer because we

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040
this room can actually answer because we
 

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.400
this room can actually answer because we
were we were the experts in app

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:04.410
were we were the experts in app
 

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:05.750
were we were the experts in app
development or not the people who

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760
development or not the people who
 

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.370
development or not the people who
actually build the devices that's a

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380
actually build the devices that's a
 

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.280

different team so yeah it's right next

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:10.290
different team so yeah it's right next
 

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.770
different team so yeah it's right next
to us but you know we'd have to actually
