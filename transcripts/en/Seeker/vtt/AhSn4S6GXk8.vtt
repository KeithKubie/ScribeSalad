00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.260
Eyes are really weird when you think about
them.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.990
They’re like little gel filled sacks sticking
out of our faces.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.430
They take all these wavelengths of light and
somehow make pictures out of them.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.070
But how did they evolve to be like that?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.340
Hey seers Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.840
Eyes are extraordinarily complex.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.220
And the theory of evolution posits that such
complexity arose from the process of natural

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.870
selection over millions of years.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.859
But extraordinary claims demand extraordinary
evidence.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.250
So how did eyes evolve?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.390
Well with each generation of offspring having
slightly altered eyes with ever increasing

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.910
improvement, that gave them a decisive advantage
over predators and peers.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.340
Back when life was just a bunch of cells in
a soup, eyes probably got their start in bacteria

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.851
over 600 millions years ago.

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:50.640
A random mutation gave some bacteria a collection
of light sensitive cells.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.050
These cells helped the bacteria know how bright
sunlight was.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.300
And some bacteria, who could sense this light,
moved away from it, which helped them since

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.360
bright sunlight also carries harmful UV rays.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.129
After a few more random mutations these little
“eyespots” as they’re called turned

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.110
into a kind of early eye.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.350
Early eyes, if you can even call them that,
were just a collection of cells called photoreceptors

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.409
with photosensitive cells with proteins called
opsins.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.360
They lay on top of the photoreceptor and catch
photons coming into the eye.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.570
They trigger a series of chemical reactions
that causes the photoreceptor to send an electrical

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.020
message towards the brain.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.479
Their appearance in the tree of life can be
traced back more than 580 million years and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.670
can be found in everything from jellyfish
to insects to dogs and humans.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.290
One study published in the journal National
Review of Neuroscience found that evidence

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.591
like this “strongly supports the notion
that a common ancestor of sea-squirts and

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:45.970
vertebrates possessed...many of the building
blocks that are fundamental to light signalling

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.070
in our own eyes.”

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.490
And we can see some of this process happening
in the fossil record.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.549
We can find evidence for early eyes in fossils
of trilobites, a marine arthropod, that lived

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.120
around 543 million years ago.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.640
As in most cases of evolution the delicate
balancing act, or should I say arms race between

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.479
predators and prey, drove the evolution of
the eye.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.159
So you’re probably wondering, how could
we tell what their eyes looked like, eyes

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.700
don’t fossilize well.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.120
And you’re mostly right, except trilobites
had a type of bacteria in their eyes that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.769
laid down a thin layer of minerals.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.639
And it’s these traces that we can see, but
only with super high powered x-rays.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.859
According to a study published in the journal
Science Reports, trilobite eyes looked like

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:24.859
flowers.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.519
Under a lens, their sensory cells are shaped
like petals, surrounding a photoreceptor.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.199
While basic, these eyes served well enough
for these bottom of the ocean dwellers.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.739
They worked so well in fact, a relative of
the trilobite, the horseshoe crab, still has

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.739
them.

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.519
As time wore on, the arms race drove the evolution
of more and more complex eyes.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.249
Rather than looking for fossilized evidence
we can examine the eyes of modern animals

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.059
that haven’t changed all that much.

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.650
Take a look at the turbellarian worm.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.629
Their eyes are more like little cups lined
with pigment cells.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.680
These cells are opaque and don’t let light
pass through, so they act as a way to direct

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.959
light towards the photoreceptor cells.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.989
After a few more years of evolution, the eye
cup becomes more of a chamber and the opening

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:03.989
narrows.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.819
This shape allows greater ability to tell
where the light is coming from and an early

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.950
way to form images of shapes and things.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.159
This is called a pinhole eye and can still
be seen on primitive animals like the beautiful

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.159
nautilus.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.799
Along the evolutionary way, animals evolved
spines and skulls, and with it, their eyes

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.109
got more advanced.

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.019
According to a study published in the journal
Nature Reviews Neuroscience, researchers found

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.620
we could trace our own complex eyes all the
way back to early lamprey-like vertebrates

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.029
who lived over 500 million years ago.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.239
Their eyes start to look more like how we
think of eyes.

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.859
A lens forms from a thin layer of adapted
epithelial cells covering the opening to keep

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:38.859
out infection.

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.019
They even have a retina and ocular muscles
that allow for eye movement.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.129
These eyes would have been able to form a
simple image over a broad range of wavelength.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.510
But there was a problem.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.400
These eyes evolved for living in water.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.349
Once our ancestors moved onto land, our eyes
needed to evolve again.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.599
Around 430 million years ago, according to
a study published in the Journal of Experimental

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.729
Biology, tetrapod eyes took on a more elliptical
shape to compensate for seeing in the air

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.939
rather than water.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.979
And the development of evolution even decides
where eyes are located.

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.180
For instance prey like deer tend have their
eyes on the side of their heads so they can

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.750
keep a watchful eye out over nearly 360 degrees
for a predator.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.709
And predators, like wolves, tend to have eyes
on the front of their head so they have depth

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.709
perception.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:24.310
All the better to hunt you with my dear.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.750
So our eyes aren’t perfect and evolution
isn’t a perfect process.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.669
But as Charles Darwin said “from so simple
a beginning endless forms most beautiful and

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.409
most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.”

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.800
