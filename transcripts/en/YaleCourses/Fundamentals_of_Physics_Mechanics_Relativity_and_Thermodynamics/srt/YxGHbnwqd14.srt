1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,980
So I have to leave you in the middle
of something. Yeah, pretty exciting.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,500
So I'll come back and take it from there.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,910
So what does it do you have
to remember from last time,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,520
you know what are the
main ideas I covered?

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,590
One is we took the notion of temperature
for which you have an intuitive feeling

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,500
and turn it into something
more quantitative.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,310
So you can not only say this is harder
than that, that's harder than this.

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,530
You can say by how much
by how many degrees.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,870
And in the end we agreed to use the
absolute Kelvin scale for temperature.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,680
And the way to find the Kelvin scale,
you take the gas,

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,550
any gas that you like,

12
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,551
like hydrogen or helium or low
concentration and put that inside a

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,490
piston and cylinder,

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,230
but it occupies and volume and there's
a certain pressure by putting weights on

15
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:58,950
top and you take the product of p Times v

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,370
and the claim is for whatever gas
you take, it will be a straight line.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,050
Remember now this is in Kelvin. You're
sending grid scale is somewhere over here.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,660
But I've shifted the origin,
the Kelvin scale.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,330
So somebody here will be the boiling
point of water somewhere when the freezing

20
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:18,991
point of water,

21
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,770
that may be the boiling point of water
and if you took a different amount of a

22
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,460
different gas,
you will get some other life,

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,980
but they will always be straight lines
if the concentration is sufficiently low.

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,600
In other words,

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,600
it appears that pressure
times volume is some constant,

26
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:43,230
I don't know what the colleges
c times this temperature

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,540
and you can use that to
measure temperature because
if you not two points on a

28
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,374
straight line,

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,470
then you know that you can find the
slope and then you can calibrate it the

30
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:59,550
monitor than for any other
value of p Times v that you get.

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,740
You can come down and
read your temperature.

32
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,050
That's the preferred scale and we prefer
the scale because it doesn't seem to

33
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:11,010
depend on the gas that you use. I can
use one that you can use another one,

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,040
people in another planet
who'd never heard of water.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,420
They can use the different guests,
but all gases seemed to have the property,

36
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,950
the pressure times the volume is linearly
proportional with this new temperature

37
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,660
scale measured with this new audit in an
absolute zero that is really nothing to

38
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:29,430
the left of this t equals zero.

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,550
Next thing I mentioned was people used
to think of the theory of heat as a new

40
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:41,700
theory. You know you got
mechanics and all that stuff,

41
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,840
levers and pulleys and all that. Then you
had this mysterious thing called heat,

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,250
which had been around for many years,

43
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,300
but people started quantifying it by
saying that it's a fluid called the

44
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,410
calorific fluid and hot things have a
lot of it and called things have less of

45
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:57,410
it and when you mix them the calories,

46
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,650
some whole flows from
the heart to the cold.

47
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,790
Then we defined specific heat law of
conservation of this catalytic fluid that

48
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:08,950
allows you to do some
problems in calorimetry.

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,490
You make so much of this with so
much of that. Where will they end up?

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,260
That kind of problem.
So that promoted heat to a new,

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,880
an independent entity, different from
all of the things we have studied,

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,070
but something such as that.

53
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,750
It is not completely alien or new
concert because that seems to be a

54
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,400
conservation law for this heat because
the heat lost by the quarter Walker was

55
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:38,140
the heat gained by the hot water.
Sorry, he'd gained by the cold water.

56
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:41,410
It was the heat loss by the hot water,
so you have a conservation law.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,090
Secondly,
we know another way to produce heat.

58
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,700
Instead of saying put it on the stove,
put it on the store,

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,410
in which case that is something mysterious
flowing from the stove into the water

60
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,910
that he'd sit up. I totally,
this is a different way.

61
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:58,540
I think you can do take two automobiles,

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,910
slammed him and go,

63
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,190
this is not the most economical
way to make your dinner,

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,400
but I'm just telling you as a
matter of principle by two ferries,

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,600
slammed them into each other, take this
park and put it on top and it'll heat up,

66
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,350
but arteries will heat up.
The question is,

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,400
what happened to the Kennedy Energy
of the two cars that is really gone.

68
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,100
So in the old days we would say,
well,

69
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,040
we don't have play the law of
conservation of energy because this is an

70
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,090
inelastic collisions that was an
illegal way out of the whole issue.

71
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,570
But you realize now this calorie fluid
can be produced from nowhere because

72
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,890
there was no calorie fluid before,

73
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,770
but slamming the two cars
produces this extra heat.

74
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,500
So that indicates that perhaps there's
a relation between mechanical energy and

75
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:52,090
heat energy that when mechanical energy
disappears, heat energy up peers.

76
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,900
So how do you do the conversion ratio?
You know,

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,520
how many calories can you get if you
sacrifice one jeweler mechanical energy.

78
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,820
So jewel did the experiment,
not with cars.

79
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,160
I mean he didn't have cars at that time.
So if he did,

80
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,580
you would have probably done it with cars.
He had this guy did with him,

81
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,220
which was a little,
uh,

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,270
shaft with some padlets
and a pulley on the top.

83
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,730
And you let the weight go down.
And I told you guys,

84
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,650
the way it goes from here to here,

85
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,390
the MGH laws will not be the
gain in one half MV squared.

86
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,260
Something will be missing. Keep track
of the missing amount. So many jewels,

87
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,870
but meanwhile you find
this water has become hot,

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,900
you find than how many calories should
have gone in because we know the specific

89
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,770
date of water,
we know the rise in temperature,

90
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,670
we know how many calories were produced
and then you compare the two and you

91
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,470
find that 4.2 jewels is
equal to one calorie.

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,450
So that is the conversion ratio
of calories to Jews. One jewel,

93
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,240
4.2 joules of mechanical energy.
So in the example of the in cars,

94
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,560
take the one half MV squared for each car,
turn it into jewels,

95
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,690
slammed them together.
If they come to arrest,

96
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
you've lost all of that and then you
take that and you write it as divided

97
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,870
before 0.2 and that's how much
calories you helped produced.

98
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,530
You have to card was made of just
one material it at a specific heat,

99
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,560
then it would go up by seven temporary.
You can actually predict.

100
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:23,981
Okay,

101
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:28,690
so today I wanted to go a little deeper
into the question of where does the

102
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:32,940
energy actually stored in the car?
I mean,

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,560
what is heat? We still don't
know in detail what he does.

104
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,730
We just said car heats up and the loss
of jewels do better before point to is

105
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,750
the gain in counties.

106
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,210
Now we can answer in detail
exactly what is heat.

107
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,180
That's what we're going
to talk about today.

108
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,560
Whenever you say something is hotter,
what did we mean at a microscopic level?

109
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,850
In the old days when people didn't
know what anything was made off,

110
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,840
they didn't have this understanding.

111
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,530
And the understanding that I'm going to
give you today is based on the simple

112
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:06,880
fact that everything is made
up of atoms that was not known,

113
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,090
and that's one of the greatest
discoveries. In the end,

114
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,750
everything is made of atoms. Then atoms
combined to form molecules and so on.

115
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,190
So how does that come into play for that,

116
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,200
I want you to take the simple example,

117
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:25,201
but the temperature enters that isn't
the donation PV equals to some constant

118
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,370
times temperature.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

119
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,950
Take some gas,
make sure it's sufficiently tight.

120
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,430
You would put it into this person.

121
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,760
Measure the weights on top of it
divided by the ATO to get the pressure.

122
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:43,750
That's the pressure. That's the
volume. The volume is the region here.

123
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,960
Multiply the product.

124
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,490
Then if you heat up the gas by
putting it on some hot plate,

125
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:55,360
you will find the product PB increases
and as the temperature increases,

126
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,580
PBS proportional duty. They want to ask
what this, this proportionality constant.

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,140
Suppose you were doing this in the
old days. That's what people did.

128
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,310
What did we think should
be on the right hand side?

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,400
What is going to control this particular
constant for your given experiment?

130
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,510
You know what it might be proportional to

131
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,360
yes, yes, I'm out of gas.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,510
That's true because I'm out of gas at
zero. We think there is no pressure.

133
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:32,250
When you say amount of gas
as a very safe sentence, uh,

134
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,940
because I'm on measured in by what means?
By what metric?

135
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,010
Right. Suppose you were not
aware of particles then.

136
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,810
What would you mean by amount of gas?

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,970
Yes,

138
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:52,350
the mass. Know if you guys ever said
malls, I was going to shoot you down.

139
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,460
You're not supposed to know those things
we have finally did use to put yourself

140
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,910
back in whatever's stone ages. We
wouldn't, we don't anything else.

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,380
Mass would be reasonable argument.
Right? What's the argument?

142
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,760
We know that if you had some amount of
gas producing the pressure and you put

143
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,790
twice as much stuff, you think it
will produce twice as much pressure.

144
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,900
Same reason why you think the expansion
of a rod is proportionally change in

145
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:20,180
temperature times the starting length.
So at this mass is what doing it.

146
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,750
So it's proportional. The mass
is a video. Reasonable guess.

147
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,700
So if we put more gas into your best and
you think it'll produce more pressure,

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
that's actually correct.

149
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,690
So let's go to that one particular
sample in your laboratory that you did.

150
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,920
So put the mass that you had there.
The new should put a constant still,

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,220
I don't know what you want me
to call this constant c prime.

152
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,670
This constant contain everything,

153
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,680
but I pulled out the mass
and the remaining constant
I want to call [inaudible].

154
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,380
This is actually correct.
You can take a certain gas in,

155
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:55,910
it could find out what's the premise,

156
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,820
but here is what people
found if you do it that way.

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,420
The constant sleep prime depends
on the gas you are considering.

158
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,510
If you consider hydrogen gas,
that's called that c prime for hydrogen.

159
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,890
Somebody else puts in helium gas and
you find the seat prime for helium

160
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,880
is one fourth c prime for hydrogen.

161
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,890
If you do carbon,
it's another number c prime for carbon.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
You see prime for hydro then divided by 12

163
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,950
so eat gas has a different constant.

164
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,490
So we conclude that yes it's
the mass that decides that,

165
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,530
but the mass has to be
divided by different numbers
for different gases to find

166
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:56,880
the real effect that has in terms
of pressure. In other words,

167
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,630
one gram of hydrogen and one gram of
helium do not have the same pressure.

168
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,251
In fact,

169
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,930
one game of helium has to be divided by
four to have the two finder's effect on

170
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:11,764
pressure.

171
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,260
So you have to think about why is it
that the mass statically is not involved.

172
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,900
Masters to be divided by a number.
The,

173
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,480
it's a nice round number four
for this and fall for that.

174
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,320
And of course people figured out
there's a long story I cannot go into,

175
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,720
but I think you all know the answer,
but now,

176
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,130
now you're allowed to fast forward to
the correct answer because I really don't

177
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,050
have the time to see
how they worked it out.

178
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,280
But from these integers and the way
gasses reacted informed complicated

179
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,320
molecules,
they figure it out.

180
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:45,880
What's really going on is that you're
dividing by a number that's proportional

181
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,880
to the mass of the underlying
fundamental entity,

182
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,400
which would be an Adam
in some cases molecule,

183
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,080
but I'm just going to
call everything is Adam.

184
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,700
So if things like carbon as Adam's
weighed 12 times as much as things called

185
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:03,130
hydrogen,
then if you took some amount of carbon,

186
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:08,131
you divided by the number like 12 to
count the number of carbon atoms in case.

187
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,330
Why didn't you want to count the number
of hydrogen atoms so that what really

188
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,020
you want here, it's not the mass, but
the number of atoms of a given kind.

189
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,370
We are certainly free to write either a
mass or the number of items because the

190
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:28,370
two are proportional.
But the beauty of writing it this way,

191
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,700
you write it in this fashion,
but this is the new constant.

192
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:36,160
K K is independent of the guests.

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,560
You want to write it in the manner in
which it doesn't depend on the gas,

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,220
right it in terms of mass if you did,

195
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,440
but each mass you've got to
divide by a certain number.

196
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,370
Then once you divided by the number,
you can put a single concert in front,

197
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,630
or if you want a universal constant,

198
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,200
what you should really be counting
the number of atoms or molecules.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,150
So you couldn't have written it that way
until he knew about atoms and molecules

200
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,150
and people who were let to atoms and
molecules by it and looking at the way

201
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:13,080
gases interact. And it's a beautiful
piece of chemistry to figure it out.

202
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:18,081
Really that that are entities
which come in discrete units,

203
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,020
not at all obvious. Now all days that mass
comes in discrete units called Adam's,

204
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:23,640
but that's what they,
they used.

205
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,270
So this is called the Boltzmann constant.

206
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,530
The Boltzmann constant has a value of
1.4 times 10 to the minus 23 let's see

207
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:40,980
jewels,
Kelvin,

208
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,020
that's it.
Or

209
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,240
you'll just Kelman or degrees centigrade.

210
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,600
So this is the universal constant.

211
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:11,400
So now what people like to do is they
don't like to write the number because if

212
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:14,220
you write the number
in a typical situation,

213
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,680
what's the number going to be on it?
Take some random group gas, one gram,

214
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:22,800
two grams, one kilogram, it doesn't
matter the number you will put in there.

215
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,500
There's some number like 10
to the 23 attended the 25

216
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,960
that's a huge number.
So whenever a huge numbers involved,

217
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,080
what you try to do is to measure the
huge number as a simple multiple off.

218
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:40,020
Another huge number, which will be
our unit for measuring large numbers.

219
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,120
For example,
when you want to buy eggs,

220
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,510
you measure in dozens and
he wanted to buy paper,

221
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,100
even want to measure written thousands,

222
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,550
five hundreds or whatever the units
they sell them. And it's a natural unit.

223
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,610
When you want to find intergalactic
distance, as you may use a light year,

224
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,760
you use units. So that in that
unit, the quantity of interest was,

225
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,650
is some number that you can count in your
heads. When you count people's height,

226
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,740
you'll use feet because if something
between one and eight let's say you don't

227
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:12,830
want to use angstroms and you don't
want to use millimeters. Likewise,

228
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,750
when he wanted to simply count numbers,

229
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,990
it turns out that's a very natural
number called Avogadro's number.

230
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,323
Yes.

231
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,210
Avogadro's number is six times
10 to the 23 it has no unit.

232
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,880
It's simply a number and
that's called a mall.

233
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,080
Say more or less like a dozen.

234
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,600
Want it to buy six times 10
to the 23 eggs. You will say,

235
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,640
get me one mole of eggs, but more or less
than just a number. It's a huge number.

236
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,840
You can ask yourself,
what's so great about this number?

237
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,470
Why would someone think of this particular
number? Why not some other number?

238
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,290
Why not 10 to the 24

239
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,020
do you know what's
special about this number?

240
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,163
Yes,

241
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,920
yes.

242
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,920
If you like a mall is such that one
mole of hydrogen weighs one gram and

243
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,500
hydrogen is the simplest element.

244
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,820
If the nucleus is just a proton and
the electron mass it negligible.

245
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,950
So this if you like,
is the reciprocal of the mass of hydrogen.

246
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,680
Other words,
one over Avogadro's number,

247
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,960
just the mass of hydrogen in grams

248
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,880
of a hydrogen atom
in grams.

249
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,480
So you basically say,

250
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,680
I want to call it this large number.
So let me take one gram,

251
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,260
which is my normal unit.
You're thinking in grams.

252
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,340
Then I ask how many hydrogen atoms?
There's one gram of hydrogen contain.

253
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,960
That's the number.
That's the mall.

254
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,500
So if you decide to measure the number
of atoms you have in a given problem in

255
00:16:58,501 --> 00:17:02,610
terms of this number, you write it as
some other small number called malls,

256
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,240
titans,

257
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,710
the number in a mall,
and you are free to write it this way.

258
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,300
If you write it this way,
the new write,

259
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:18,301
this n r t o is the universal gas constant

260
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,930
times the Boltzmann constant and
zero times the Boltzmann constant.

261
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,440
That happens to be 8.3 joules per
degree centigrade or per Kelvin,

262
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,770
right? The units were odd
will be Pv, which is you
understand energy divided by t

263
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,960
in terms of calories.

264
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,590
I remember this nice known number
two calories per degree centigrade

265
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,650
degrees centigrade and Calvin are
the same. The origins are shifted,

266
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:58,320
but when you go up at one
degree in San Diego or Kelvin,

267
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,870
you go with the same or
more than temperature.

268
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,380
So this is what they found out first
because they didn't know anything about

269
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,640
atoms and so on.

270
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,540
But later on when you go look under
the hood of what the gas is made of,

271
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,550
if you write it in terms of the number of,

272
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,210
if you write it in terms of
the number of actual atoms,

273
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,170
you should use the Lidl k or you can
write it in terms of number of malls,

274
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:22,950
in which case use

275
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,783
big r

276
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,370
and the relation between
the two is simply this.

277
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,820
If you're thinking of a gas and how
many moles of gas do I have? Exactly.

278
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,490
One gram of hydrogen would be one more.
Then you will use our,

279
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,540
if you've gone right down to fundamentals
and say how many items do I have a new

280
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,030
put that here you would multiply
it by this very tiny number.

281
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,970
All right.

282
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,780
No. You start with this law and
you asked the following question.

283
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,570
On the left hand side is the quantity
p Times v or the right hand side?

284
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,770
I have an rt but let me
write it now as an Katie,

285
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,100
you guys should be able to go back and
forth between writing in terms of number

286
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:12,760
of moles or the number of atoms.

287
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,270
You like this because all numbers
here will be small of order.

288
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,900
One artist a number like what?

289
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,800
Eight in some units and it
will be one or two malls here.

290
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,730
This and it will be huge number like
10 to the 23 k will be a tiny number,

291
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:31,330
like 10 to the minus 23 I think in
terms of atoms, that's what you do.

292
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,410
Big Numbers, small constants of
think of malls, small numbers,

293
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,410
I mean moderate numbers and
moderate value of constantly.

294
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,110
We want to ask ourselves,

295
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,070
is that a microscopic
basis for this equation?

296
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,330
In other words, do we,
once you believe in atoms,

297
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:53,260
do we understand why that is
a pressure at all in a gas?

298
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,360
That's what we are going
to think about now.

299
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,490
So for this purpose we
will take a cube of gas.

300
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,633
It is,

301
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,050
this is a cube of site l by El by l,

302
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,653
okay.

303
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,920
Inside this as guests and has got some
pressure and I want to know what's the

304
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,160
value of the pressure you got?
Ask yourself why is that pressure?

305
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,870
Remember I told you what pressure means.

306
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,090
If you take this face of the cube for
example, it's got to be nailed down,

307
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,620
but the other phases,

308
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,800
otherwise it does come flying out
because the gas is pushing you out.

309
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,860
The pressure is the force on
this face divided by area.

310
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,740
So somebody inside is trying to get out.

311
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,610
Those guys are the molecules or the atoms
and what they're doing is constantly

312
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:53,440
bouncing off the wall and every
time this one bounces on a wall,

313
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,860
it's momentum changes from
that to the other one.

314
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,800
So who's changing the
momentum of the wall?

315
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,330
Changing the momentum is reversing that.
For example,

316
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:06,360
if you bones head on and go back,
your momentum is reversed.

317
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:07,950
Okay?

318
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,440
That means you push the wall
with some force in the wall,

319
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,920
pushes you back with the opposite force
is the force that you exerted on the

320
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:17,850
wall that I'm interested in.
I wanted to find the force on the wall.

321
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,570
Say this particular phase,
you can find the pressure on any phase.

322
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,660
It's going to be the same answer.
I'm going to take the shaded faced.

323
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,150
Find the pressure on it.
No.

324
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,070
If you want to ask, what is the
force exerted by me on anybody?

325
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,320
I know the forest is rate
of change of momentum

326
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,580
because that is d by Dt of Mv and Msa
constant and that just DVD t we just at

327
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:49,210
me, I'm just using the old f equals m a
but I'm writing it is rate of change the

328
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:52,060
momentum.
No,

329
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:56,530
I have an molecules are an Adams
randomly moving inside the box.

330
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,570
Each center's own direction. Suffering
collisions with the box bouncing off,

331
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,430
uh, like a billiard ball would at the end
of the pool table going to another wall

332
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:09,160
and doing it.
That's a very complicated problem.

333
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,720
So we're going to simplify the problem.
The simplification is going to be,

334
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,010
we're going to assume that one third of
the molecules are moving from left to

335
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:18,844
right.

336
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,420
One third are moving up and down and
one third are moving in and out of the

337
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,254
blackboard.

338
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,330
If Batali make an assumption that the
molecules have simply moving into three

339
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:32,150
primary directions, of course you
will have to give equal number.

340
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:35,330
It needs directions, nothing in the gas
that favors how does onto the vertical.

341
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,050
In reality, of course, you must admit
the fact they move in all directions,

342
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:42,620
but the simplified derivation happens
to give all the right physics.

343
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,460
I'm going to use that.

344
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,540
So an over three molecules are going
back and forth between this wall and this

345
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,360
wall. I'm showing you the side view.
The wall itself, it looks like this.

346
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,460
The molecule just got back and forth.

347
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,643
Next assumption,

348
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,530
all the molecules at the same
speed I'm going to call me.

349
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,390
That also is a gross and crude
description of the problem,

350
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:13,180
but I'm going to do that
anyway and see what happens.

351
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,040
So now you ask yourself the following
question. Take one particular molecule.

352
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,150
When it hits the wall and it bounces back,

353
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,500
it's momentum changes
from MV the minus MD.

354
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,710
Therefore the change in momentum is to MV.

355
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,820
How often does that change take place?

356
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,250
You guys should think about that first.
How often will collision take place?

357
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,300
Once you hit the wall here, you got
to go the other wall and come back.

358
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,900
So you've got to go a distance to
l and you're going at a speed v.

359
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,880
The time it takes you to l
over be the belt that be over.

360
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:03,881
Delta t is two l divided by V that
gives me and B squared over l.

361
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,990
That is the force due to one molecule.

362
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,530
That's the average force.
Realize it's not a continuous forest.

363
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,130
Monica hit the wall.
That's a little four 16th between the two.

364
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,210
Then there's nothing. Then you wait till
it comes back and hits a wall again.

365
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,480
If that were the real,
if that were the only thing going on,

366
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,780
what you would find is the wall once
the time has no pressure and suddenly it

367
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:33,170
has a lot of pressure and then
suddenly nothing. But fortunately,

368
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,760
this is not the only molecule that
are roughly 10 the 23 guys pounding

369
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,460
themselves against the wall.
So at any given instant,

370
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,530
even if returned the minus five seconds,

371
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:44,300
that'd be a large number
of molecules colliding.

372
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,280
That's the way the forest will appear to
be steady rather than a shotgun noise.

373
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:53,210
It looked very steady cause somebody at
other, we'll be pushing against the wall.

374
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,050
So if you ask,
know how many molecules,

375
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,480
this is the force due
to one molecule before,

376
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:05,481
it's due to all of them will be an over
three times and B squared over there

377
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,260
and over three because
of the end molecules,

378
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,860
a third of them were
moving in this direction.

379
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,090
You realize the other two
directions are parallel to the wall.

380
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,840
They don't apply force on the
wall to apply a force in the wall.

381
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:27,550
You gotta be moving perpendicular
to the wall. But example,

382
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:31,500
if the plates that walls are coming out
of the blackboard moving in and out of

383
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:35,730
the blackboard doesn't produce a force
in this wall that produces the force and

384
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:36,750
the other two phases.

385
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,850
So as far as any one set of
faces is concerned in one plane,

386
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,520
only the motion orthogonal talking
to that is going to contribute.

387
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:47,820
That's why you have an over
three little bit almost done.

388
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,620
That's the average force. If you want,
I can denote average by some f bar.

389
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,620
Then what about the average pressure?

390
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,090
The average pressure is the average
force divided by the area of that phase f

391
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,010
over l square.

392
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,660
That gives me an over three
M v squared over l cubed.

393
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,351
Oh,

394
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:17,300
this is very nice because LQB
just the volume of my box.

395
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,140
So I take the Lq, which is
ego, the volume of my box,

396
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,730
and I send it to the other side,

397
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,780
right it as PV equals and
over three M v squared.

398
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,100
This is what the microscopic theory tells

399
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,460
you.

400
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Microscopic data says if your molecules
have all have a single speed that moving

401
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:54,150
randomly in space so that a third of them
are moving back and forth against that

402
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:56,910
wall and this wall.
Then this is the product PB.

403
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,760
Experimentally you find
Pv is equal to n k t

404
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,990
so you've compared the two
expressions and outcomes.

405
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,020
One of the most beautiful results which
is that NV squared over two is three

406
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,380
over to Katie.

407
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,470
Oh that guy deserves a box cause
look what it's telling you.

408
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,240
It's a really profound formula.

409
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,660
It tells you for the first time real
microscopic meaning of temperature.

410
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,820
What you and I call the temperature of
a gas is simply up to these factors.

411
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,910
Three over two k simply the
candidate energy of the molecules.

412
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,920
That's what temperature is.

413
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,070
If you've got a gas and you put your
hand into the furnace and it hot,

414
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,970
the temperature you're measuring
is directly the kinetic
energy of the molecules.

415
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,880
That is a great insight
into what temperature means.

416
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,020
Remember, this is not true. If
t is measured in centigrade,

417
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,910
if t but measured in Centigrade
I freezing point of water,

418
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:11,840
MV squared would vanish,
but that's not what's in play.

419
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,970
You should be measured from absolute zero.

420
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,830
It also tells you why absolute zero
is absolute. As you call your gas,

421
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,280
the kinetic energy of molecules are
decreasing and decreasing and decreasing,

422
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:26,300
but you cannot go below not moving at
all. Right? That's the lowest possible.

423
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:29,870
Kennedy, Kennedy. That's why it's
absolute zero. At that point,

424
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,160
everybody stops moving. That's
why you have no pressure. No.

425
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,510
These results that are modified
by the laws of quantum mechanics,

426
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:42,860
but we don't have to worry about that
now in the classical physics is actually

427
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,930
correct to say that when the temperature
goes to zero, all motion Caesar's,

428
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,910
Oh, this is the picture that I want you
to bear in mind when you say temperature.

429
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:53,871
Absolutely.

430
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:58,520
Temperature is a measure of molecular
agitation more precisely up to the

431
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:01,100
constant k three over two k.

432
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,020
The kinetic energy of a molecule is the
absolute temperature. That's part I gas.

433
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,270
If it took a solid and you say,

434
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:12,350
what happens when I heat the
solid Bellis got a question. Yes.

435
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,910
Just out of curiosity,
why

436
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,380
did they said divide both sides by two?
Just it.

437
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,340
You would divide by two because one half
MV squared is a family at a quantity,

438
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,310
namely Kennedy.
Granted that's what you divide by two

439
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,770
not the thing to notice is that every gas,

440
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,820
whatever is made off at a given
temperature as a given Kennedy energy,

441
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,100
because the Kennedy energy per molecule
on the left hand side is dependent

442
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,370
absolute temperature and nothing else.
So at certain degrees,

443
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:49,960
like 300 Kelvin hydrogen Kennedy going
to do to be the same carbon Kennedy

444
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:53,020
energy, but also be the same. The
Kennedy Kennedy will be the same,

445
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,310
not the velocity.
The carbon atom is heavier.

446
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,360
It'll be moving slow,

447
00:29:58,361 --> 00:30:01,390
but at that temperature in order
to have the same candidate again,

448
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,890
so all molecules,
all gases at a given temperature,

449
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,050
all I'll atoms,
let me say,

450
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:11,140
I'd give given temperature engages
farm will have the same Kennedy got it.

451
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,380
No.
If you have a solid,

452
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,770
what's the different between
the gas into a solid and a gas?

453
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,300
The Adams said moving anywhere
they want in the box in a solid,

454
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,990
every atom has a place.
If you take a two dimensional solid,

455
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,910
the atoms look like this,

456
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,090
they form a lattice or an array.

457
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,680
That's because you will find out that
this is more advanced stuff that every

458
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:43,380
atom plants itself in a
potential that looks like this.

459
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,580
You imagine on the ground you make these
hollows low points. The low potential,

460
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:55,720
high point high potential. Obviously
if you put a bunch of objects here,

461
00:30:55,721 --> 00:31:00,130
they will sit at the bottom
of these little concave holds.

462
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:03,370
You've dug in the ground at zero degrees,

463
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,720
absolute all items that sit at the
bottom of that allotted positions.

464
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,100
That'd be a solid at zero temperature,
so in a solid,

465
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,910
everybody has a location.
I've shown you one dimensional solid,

466
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,960
but you can imagine a three dimensional
solid where in a lattice of three

467
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:24,460
dimensional points there's an assigned
place for [inaudible] and it sits there.

468
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,760
If you heat up that solid. Now what
happens is these guys start vibrating.

469
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,110
Now here is where your knowledge of
simple harmonic motion to come into play.

470
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,520
When you take a system in equilibrium,
it'll execute simple harmonic motion.

471
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,720
If you give it a real kick,
if you put it on top of a hot plate,

472
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,560
the atoms in the hot plate, we'll bump
into these guys and start the movie.

473
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,000
They will start vibrating.

474
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,390
So a hot solid is one in which the
atoms that making more and more violent

475
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,150
isolations around their
assigned positions,

476
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,310
the hit the more and more and more.
Eventually you start doing this,

477
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:04,870
you go all the way from here to here.

478
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,600
That is nothing to prevent you
from rolling over to the next site.

479
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:12,790
Once you jumped the fence and
take up a bunch of houses, okay,

480
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,940
all hole in the ground,
you're living in a hole in the ground.

481
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,710
You as you get agitated,

482
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:20,920
you're able to do more and
more oscillation silicon
rollover to the next house.

483
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,541
Once that happens,

484
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,840
all hell breaks loose because you don't
have any reason to stay where you are.

485
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,200
You start going everywhere.
What do you think that is?

486
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,960
Pardon me? That's melting.
That's the definition of melting.

487
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,560
Nothing is when you can leap
over this potential barrier,

488
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,640
potential energy barrier,
go to the next site.

489
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,820
The next side is just like this site.
If you can jump that fence,

490
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:46,400
you can jump this one.
You go everywhere and you melt.

491
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,310
That's the process of melting.
And once you have a liquid,

492
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,270
atoms don't have a different location.
Now between the liquid and a solid, uh,

493
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,290
this is, this is clear, different but
in liquid and the vapor is more subtle.

494
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,070
So I don't want to go into that.
But at some point, uh, liquids,

495
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,160
if you look at a liquid locally,
it will look very much like a solid,

496
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,910
the sense that interrupt tomic spacing
just very tightly constrained in liquid,

497
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,860
a solid. If I know I'm here, I know if I
go 100 times the basic lattice spacing,

498
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,820
there'll be another person sitting there
that's called a long range order in the

499
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:22,510
liquid. I cannot say that liquid.
I can say my, I'm here locally.

500
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,630
The environment around me is known.
But if you go a few hundred miles,

501
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:30,070
I cannot tell you are precise location.
If some mother Adam will be there or not.

502
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,790
So we sell liquid, a short
rain position, a lottery,

503
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,820
but not long grain daughter and
a gas has no auditor at all.

504
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,740
If I tell you there's a gas molecule here,

505
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,430
I cannot tell you about anybody else's.
We, nobody has any assigned location.

506
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,850
Okay, so this is the big city should
have off temperature temperatures,

507
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,460
agitated motion, either motion in the
vicinity of where you're told to sit.

508
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,900
You feel it in a solid motion all over
the box with more than more candidate

509
00:33:57,901 --> 00:33:58,734
candidate.

510
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,700
The next thing in this category
teacher is that certainly not true.

511
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,730
That third of the molecules are moving
back and forth. We know that's a joke,

512
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,370
right? Right now I'm in this
room. There's no reason on earth.

513
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,620
Third of the molecules are
doing this and others are doing.

514
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,140
That's an approximation had
moving in random directions.

515
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,910
So if we really got the stomach for it,

516
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:20,660
you should do a pressure calculation in
which you assume the molecules of random

517
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:24,860
velocities sprinkled in all directions
and after all the hard work turn said,

518
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:28,070
you will get exactly this answer.
So that's one thing I didn't want her to.

519
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,250
What's something I should point out
to you is the following. So supplies,

520
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:35,120
they give you a gas at 300 Kelvin.

521
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,590
You go and you take this formula literally
and you calculate from it a certain

522
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
one half MV squared.

523
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,480
If you knew the mass of the items says
hybrid and we know the mass of hydrogen,

524
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,570
then you find the velocity and you say,
okay,

525
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,400
this man tells me that anytime a cat,
a hydrogen atom,

526
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,770
it'll have this velocity at 300
Kelvin if I have a random direction.

527
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,920
But he tells me that the velocity squared,
take the square root of that.

528
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:02,660
That's the velocity it seems to us in
a unique velocity to each temperature.

529
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,460
Well,
that's not correct.

530
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,450
Not only are the molecules
moving in random directions,

531
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,320
they're also moving with
essentially all possible velocities.

532
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,870
In fact that a many,

533
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:19,871
many possible velocities and this velocity
I'm getting in this formula is some

534
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:24,470
kind of average velocity or the most
popular one are the most common one.

535
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,690
So if you'd really go to a gas and you
had the ability to look into it and see

536
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,420
what each velocity, what's the
probability that I get that velocity?

537
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,170
The pics that I have given you is the
probability is zero except that this one

538
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,750
magical velocity controlled
by the temperature,

539
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,540
but the real graph looks like this.

540
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,180
It has a certain peak.
I likes to have a certain value.

541
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,060
So if you had even know
enough about statistics,

542
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,800
you know there's a most probable value,
there's medium,

543
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,490
there's a mean value that
our different definitions,

544
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,930
they will all vary by factors of water
one but the average Kenetech energy will

545
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:05,730
obey this condition.
Yes,

546
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,300
got it. Great. In their gaps,

547
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,170
I, it's not really a Gaussian because
if I draw the nature of this curve,

548
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:17,171
it looks like B square you to
the minus M v squared over two k.

549
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:22,490
T
that's the graph I'm trying to dry here.

550
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,120
So it look like a ghost into the vicinity
of this, but it's kind of skewed.

551
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,100
It's forced to vantage of the audition

552
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,000
and it's not peaked at the equal
to zero real a Gaussian peaks.

553
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,030
At this point would be some metric
is not symmetric advantage to see it.

554
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,230
An advantage does infinity.

555
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,520
This is called the Maxwell
Boltzmann distribution. You
don't have to remember it.

556
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:50,490
Any names that just the detailed
property of what's happening in a gas,

557
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,960
so a temperature does not
pick a unique velocity,

558
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,400
but it picks this graph.
If you vary your temperature,

559
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:02,970
look at what you have to do.
If you change the number t here,

560
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,050
if you doubled the value of t,
that means you,

561
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:09,420
if you double the value of
bees where here and there,

562
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,690
the graph will look the same for every
temperature there is a certain shape.

563
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,840
Do go to your temperature.
It'll look more or less the same,

564
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,280
but it may be peaked at a different
velocity if you go to higher temperature,

565
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,310
no, this is another thing I want to
tell you. If you took a box containing,

566
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,820
not atoms but just radiation,

567
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,450
other words go inside a pizza oven,
take out all the air,

568
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:41,140
but the oven is still hot and the
walks or the almond not radiating

569
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,430
electromagnetic radiation.

570
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,640
Electromagnetic radiation comes in
different frequencies and you can ask how

571
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,240
much energy is contained in
every possible frequency range.

572
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,720
You know, each frequency is
a color, so you know that.

573
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,120
So how much energy is in the red,
how much is in the blue.

574
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,400
That graph also looks like this.

575
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,670
That's a more complicated law
called the plaque distribution.

576
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,170
That law also has a shape,
completely determined by temperature

577
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,230
is what happens.

578
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,950
The ship is determined by temporary that
as well as the mass of the molecules.

579
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:16,940
In the case of radiation,

580
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,940
it determined fully by temperature
and the velocity of light.

581
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,720
You give me a temperature and I will draw
you another one of these roughly bell

582
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:28,070
shaped curves. As you heat up the
furnace, the shape will change.

583
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,911
So again,

584
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:36,911
our temperature for radiation means a
particular of energies at each frequency

585
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,540
for a gas.
That means our distribution of velocities.

586
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,270
No, that is, has anybody seen that in
the news lately or have heard about this?

587
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,533
Pardon me?

588
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,670
I bought this particular graph.
What radiation?

589
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,770
The probability at each frequency of
finding radiation of that frequency in a

590
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:04,180
furnace of some temperature.
T

591
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,423
yes,

592
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:16,220
no, but in current news
in the last few years,

593
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,600
what people did was the following is
one of the predictions of the Big Bang

594
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,750
theory that the universe was formed some
14 and a half billion years ago and at

595
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:30,470
the early stages the temperature of
the University of some incredibly high

596
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,530
degrees than acid expanded the universe
schooled and today at the current size

597
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,610
it has got a certain average temperature
which is a remnant of the big bang

598
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,260
and that temperature means that is we
are sitting in a furnace up the big bang,

599
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,690
but the furnace, the school, the
lock over the billions of years,

600
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,280
the temperature of the universe is,
I don't three degrees Kelvin

601
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,590
and the way you determine that is
you point your telescope in the sky,

602
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,330
of course you're going to
get light from this star,

603
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:04,400
you're going to get late from that.

604
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:09,401
Start ignoring all the pointy things and
look at the smooth background and age

605
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,780
should be the same in all directions
and plot that radiation and noticed they

606
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:19,781
use satellites to plot that and you get
a perfect fit for this kind of furnace.

607
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,530
Radiation are called blackbody radiation
and you read the temperature by taking

608
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:27,110
that graph and fitting
into a graph like this,

609
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:29,210
but there'll be a temperature
in the case of light.

610
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,150
This won't be velocity squared but
there'll be the frequency square,

611
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,870
but read off the temperature that'll
make this work and that's what gives you

612
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:40,670
3.1 or something. You get
three degrees Kelvin. In fact,

613
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,870
the data point for that,

614
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,610
if you've got that in your lab and you
will be definitely busted for forging

615
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,510
your data because it's a perfect fit.
The blackbody radiation,

616
00:40:50,511 --> 00:40:54,110
one of the most perfect fits to the
black body radiation is the background

617
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:57,830
radiation for the Big Bang
and there's isotropic meaning.

618
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:02,831
It's the same in all directions and this
is one of the predictions of the big

619
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:06,890
bang is that there'll be the remnant
of the black body radiation. Again,

620
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,940
it tells you that's a sense in which the,
if you go to intergalactic space,

621
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,330
that is your temperature,
that's the temperature to get for free.

622
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,320
They're all living in that heat. Pat
At three degrees. You want more heat,

623
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:19,490
you got to light up your furnace,

624
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:23,420
but this is everywhere in the universe
that heat left over from creation.

625
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,813
Okay,

626
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,220
that's a very,
very interesting subject.

627
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:33,270
No Lot of new physics is coming out by
looking at just that black body radiation

628
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,460
because the radiation
that's coming to your,

629
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:40,820
I left those stars long ago,

630
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,990
so what do you see today is not what's
happening today is what happened long ago

631
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,520
when the radiation left
that part of the universe.

632
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,360
Therefore we can actually tell
something about the universe,

633
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:57,770
not only now but earlier periods and
that's the way in which we can act.

634
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:02,771
Will you tell whether the universe is
saying yes expanding or not expanding or

635
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,640
is it accelerating in its expansion?

636
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,240
Or you can even say once it was
decelerating and nobody's accelerating,

637
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,950
all that information comes by being able
to look at the radiation from the big

638
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,410
bang.
What for you guys?

639
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,460
I think the most interesting thing is
that when you od in thermal equilibrium

640
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,340
and you are living in
a certain temperature,

641
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,220
then the radiation in your world and
the molecules and atoms in your work,

642
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,350
we'll have a distribution of frequencies
and velocities given by that universal

643
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,720
graph.
Now in our class,

644
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,750
we will simplify life and replace this
graph with the huge peak at a certain

645
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,900
velocity by pretending
everybody's at that velocity,

646
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,720
we will treat the whole gas as separate
representative by single average number.

647
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,600
So when someone says find
the velocity of molecules,

648
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,700
they parking board the average velocity,

649
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,290
you know statistically that is the
distribution of answers and an avid dance.

650
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,040
Here's the average is what you
wouldn't you and I have to know,

651
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,160
namely one half MV squared is
three half skatey on average.

652
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,770
Okay? No, I'm going to study in detail.

653
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,520
They're more than Amex.
So the system,

654
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:17,310
I'm going to study Islam only one.
We all study,

655
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,550
which is an ideal gas
sitting inside at Vista,

656
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,353
okay?

657
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,990
It's got a temperature is about a pressure
and it's got a volume and I'm going

658
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:34,591
to plot here pressure and volume and I'm
going to put it dot and that's my gas.

659
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,350
The state of my gas is summarized
by where you put the dot

660
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,320
everybody. Dot. Here is a possible
state of equilibrium for the guests.

661
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,330
Remember the gas,
if you look at the under the hood,

662
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,690
it's made up of 10 to the 23 molecules.
The Real,

663
00:43:55,691 --> 00:44:00,520
real state of the gas is
obtained by saying giving me
10 to the 23 locations and

664
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:03,460
tender the tender that the
velocities accordingly. Newton,

665
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,840
that's the maximum information
you can give me a board.

666
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,370
The gas right now because with that and
Newton's laws, I can predict the future,

667
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,350
but when you study thermodynamics,

668
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,540
you don't really want to
look into the details.

669
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,100
You want to look at gross macroscopic
properties and there are two that you need

670
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:22,270
pressure and volume. You might
say, what about temperature?

671
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,740
Why don't they have a
third axis for temperature?

672
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,990
Why is that also not a
property? Yes, for sure.

673
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,440
Yeah,

674
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,180
because PV equal to and Katie,

675
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:44,160
I don't have to give you tea if I know
pnb rather an independent thing you can

676
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:48,360
pick, you can pick P and B independently.
You cannot pick tea. Let me tell you,

677
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:51,660
by the way,
Pv was NKT is not a universal law.

678
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,810
It's a law that you
applied to dilute gasses,

679
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,090
but we are going to just
study only dilute ideal gas.

680
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,740
Ideal gas is one in which the atoms and
molecules are so far apart that they

681
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:07,950
don't feel any forces between
each other unless they collide.

682
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,820
So here's my gas sitting here.
Now what I do,

683
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,890
I had a few weights on top of it three
ways. I suddenly pull out one weight,

684
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,190
throw it out.
What do you think will happen?

685
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,250
But I think this gas will now shoot up.

686
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,550
It'll Bob up and down a few times.

687
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,880
Then after a few seconds or a fraction
of a second, it'll settle down,

688
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,150
but the new location but settled down.

689
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:39,450
I mean after a while I will
not see any macroscopic motion.

690
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:44,070
Then the gas has a new
pressure and a new volume.

691
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,700
It's gone from being there to being there.

692
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,650
What about in between?

693
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,540
What happened in between
starting and finishing points?

694
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,260
You might say, look, if it went,

695
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,240
if it was here in the
beginning it was there later.

696
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,540
It must have followed some path.
Not really.

697
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,670
Not In this process because if you do it
very abruptly but suddenly throwing out

698
00:46:11,671 --> 00:46:15,660
one third of the weights, that's the
period when the piston rushes up.

699
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,000
When the gas is not in equilibrium.

700
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,290
By that I mean there is no single
pressure you can associate with the gas.

701
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,161
The bottom,

702
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:27,750
the gas doesn't even know the top is
flying off is that the old pressure in the

703
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,130
top of the gas is at low pressure.

704
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,460
So different parts of the
gas at different pressure.

705
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:33,660
We don't call that equilibrium.

706
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,910
So the dot representing the system
moves up the graph, it's off,

707
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,210
it's off the radar and only
when it is finally settled down,

708
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,930
the entire gas can make up its mind
on what it pressured wants to be.

709
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,280
We put it back here

710
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,830
so we have a little problem that
we have this equilibrium states,

711
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:55,470
but when you try to go from one
to another, you fly off the map,

712
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,480
so you want to find a device by which
you can stay on the PB diagram as you

713
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:01,680
change the state of the gas.

714
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,400
That brings us to the notion of
what's called a quasi static process.

715
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,650
It's a quasi static process is trying to
have it both ways in which you want to

716
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:13,620
change the state of the gas and you
don't want it to leave the PB diagram.

717
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,240
You want it to be always at equilibrium.

718
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,640
So what do you really want to do is not
put in three big fat blocks like this,

719
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,560
but instead take a guess where you
have many, many grains of sand.

720
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,620
They can produce the pressure though to
move one grain of sand that most a tiny

721
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,970
bit and very quickly settles down.

722
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,510
It is again true during the
tiny bit of settling down.

723
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:41,590
You didn't know what it was doing,

724
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:43,600
but you certainly named
it at the second location.

725
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,370
Then we'll one brain at a time.

726
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,170
Then you get a picture like this and you
can see where this is going or you can

727
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,500
make the grain smaller and smaller and
smaller and not a mathematical sense.

728
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:55,210
You can then form a continuous line.

729
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,080
That is to say you perform a process that
leaves the system arbitrarily close to

730
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:01,900
equilibrium,

731
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,070
meaning give it enough time to readjust
to the new pressure settled down to the

732
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:10,000
new volume that take another grain
and another brain and in the spirit of

733
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:14,440
calculus you can make these changes
vanishing that you can really then say it

734
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:17,050
did this.
Yes.

735
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,160
Pardon me? Yes, such a process.

736
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:26,440
Processes also called a,
you can call it quasi static,

737
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:30,820
but one of the features of
that, it is reversible. You
got to be a little careful.

738
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:31,750
When you say reversible,

739
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,790
what we mean by reversible is if I took
off a grain of sand and it came from

740
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,940
here to the next doc and
I put the grain back,

741
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,680
it'll climb back to where it was.
So you can go back and forth on this,

742
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,290
but now that's an idealized process
because if you had a friction,

743
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,720
if you had any friction between
the piston and the walls,

744
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:58,630
then if you took out the grain and it
went up, you've put the grain back,

745
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,520
it may not come back to quite where it is

746
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,770
because some of the frictional
losses you will never get back.

747
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,200
You cannot put Humpty dumpty back.

748
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:13,390
So most of the time processes are not
reversible. Even if you do them slowly,

749
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,090
if there is friction. So it's assumed
it's a completely frictionless system

750
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,540
cause if that is friction,

751
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,110
that is some heat that goes out somewhere
and some energy is lost somewhere and

752
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:27,700
we cannot bring it back if
took a frictionless piston
and on top of it it very,

753
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,770
very slowly you can follow this graph.

754
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,730
That's the kind of thermodynamic
process we're talking about.

755
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,540
In the old days when I studied a
single particle in the x, y plane,

756
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,390
I just said the guy who goes
from here to here to there,

757
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,230
that's very easy to study and there is
no restriction on how quickly or how fast

758
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,520
it moved particles.

759
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:49,000
That is no matter how quickly they
move for the thermodynamic system,

760
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,830
you cannot move them too fast because
they are extended and you're giving the

761
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:56,050
huge gas a single number called pressure,

762
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,970
so you cannot change one part of the
gas with waiting for all of them to

763
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:05,230
communicate and readjust and achieve a
global value for the new pressure and you

764
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:10,231
can move gradually that way it takes time
to drag along tender the 23 particles

765
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,440
as if they are the single number
two numbers characterizing them.

766
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,190
So we'll be studying processes like this.

767
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,680
Now this is called a state is the
state and one is the state. every.here.

768
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,410
That is a state.
No.

769
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,310
In every state of the system I'm
going to define a new variable,

770
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,510
which is called,
maybe I'll start fresh

771
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,920
quantity calls you.

772
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,880
We'd stand for the internal
energy off the gas.

773
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,340
Internal energy is simply the
Kennedy energy of the gas molecules,

774
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,780
solids and liquids. There's more
complicated formula for the gas.

775
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,850
Internal energy is just the
kinetic energy. And what is
that? It is three halves,

776
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,600
k t,
four molecule times n,

777
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,310
I'm sorry, three halves and Cape. Uh,
and yeah, three halves Katie. Times that

778
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,640
Audrey can write it as
three halves and our teeth.

779
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,453
Yeah,

780
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:30,490
but NRT is Pv.
Can alternate date is three house PVC.

781
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,340
Internal Energy's the three halves.
PV.

782
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,160
That means at a given
point in the PV diagram,

783
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,930
you have a certain internal energy. If
you're there, that's your internal energy.

784
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,450
Take three halves a Pv,

785
00:51:42,451 --> 00:51:45,120
and that's the energy and that's
literally the kinetic energy of all the

786
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:46,290
molecules in your box.

787
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,970
So now I'm ready to write down what's
called the first law of thermodynamics.

788
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,450
Okay.

789
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,770
That talks about what happens if you make
a move in the PV plant from one place

790
00:51:59,771 --> 00:52:03,340
to another place to go from
one place to another place.

791
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,560
Your internal energy will change from
u one to u two. Let's call it delta.

792
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:09,394
You,

793
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,680
you want ask what causes the
internal energy of the gas to change.

794
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:17,980
So you guys think about it now.

795
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,070
Oh that you know all about
what's happening in the cylinder.

796
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,170
You can ask how will I change the energy?

797
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,760
Well if you wanted to attend the energy
of a system that are two ways you can do

798
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,220
it.
One is you can do work on the gas.

799
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,900
Other thing is you can put the gas on a
hot plate cause if you put it on a hot

800
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,770
plate, we know it's going to get hotter.
It gets harder, temperature goes up.

801
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:41,350
If the temperature goes up,
the internal energy goes up.

802
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,190
There are two ways to
channel the energy of a gas.

803
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,730
The first one we call heat input.

804
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:54,070
That just means put it on something
harder and let the thing heated up.

805
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,690
Temperature would go up.

806
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,430
Notice that the internal energy of an
ideal gas depends only on the temperature.

807
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,850
That's something very,
very important.

808
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,900
I mentioned that every time I teach the
subject and some people forget and lose

809
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,220
a lot of points needlessly.

810
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,840
So I would say it once more with
feeling energy of an ideal gas.

811
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,020
Depends only on the temperature.
The temperature is not changed.

812
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,450
Energy has not changed. So probably
to remember that for what I do later.

813
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,980
So the change of the gas,

814
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,250
this cylinder full of better,

815
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,740
put some weights on top
and I've got gas in sight.

816
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,530
It can change either because I did,

817
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,880
I put in some heat are the gas,
did some work.

818
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,810
By that I mean if the gas expands,
like pushing out against the atmosphere,

819
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,670
then eat this. Doing the work in
Delta w is the work done by the gas?

820
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,520
That's where it comes to the minus sign
because it's the work done by the gas.

821
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:01,900
If you do work, you lose energy. So
what's the formula for work done?

822
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,120
Let's calculate that.
If you've got a piston,

823
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,560
here is the force times the distance,

824
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,920
but the force is the pressure times
the area at times the distance.

825
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,720
Now you guys should know enough geometry
to nor the ADF, the Piston Times,

826
00:54:19,721 --> 00:54:23,650
the distance it moves is the
change in the volume we can write.

827
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,180
It is p times DV.
That leads to this great law.

828
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:33,040
Let me write it in a new blackboard
because we are going to be playing around

829
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,960
with that law.
This is law number one.

830
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,830
The change in the internal energy
of a system is equal to Delta Q.

831
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,803
Minus P. Delta V. Okay.

832
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:58,510
What does it express? It expresses
the law of conservation of energy.

833
00:54:58,511 --> 00:55:02,530
It says if the energy goes up either
because you push the piston or the piston

834
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:03,364
pushed you,

835
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,200
then you decide what the overall sinus
[inaudible] on a hot plate we are not

836
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,860
equating putting it on a hot plate is
also equivalent to giving good energy

837
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,410
because we identify
heat as simply entered.

838
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,640
So if you took the piston and you nailed
the piston so it cannot move and you

839
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:27,020
put it on a hot plate PDV part we'll
manage because there is no delta B.

840
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,570
That's the way of heating
it is called Delta Q.

841
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,310
Another thing you can do is you can
terminally isolate your piston so no heat

842
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:37,730
can flow in and out of it and they
can either have the volume increase or

843
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:40,400
decrease if the gas expanded.

844
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:45,790
Delta v is positive and the PDLT minus
PW is negative and the Delta you will be

845
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,510
negative.
The gas bill lose energy.

846
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,820
That's because the molecules are beating
up on the piston and moving the piston.

847
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,100
I remember applying a force
doesn't cost you anything.

848
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,460
What if the point of application moves
you do work and who's going to pay for

849
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,170
the gas? It will pay for it through
it. Lots of internal energy.

850
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,641
Conversely,

851
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,840
if you push down on the Gas Delta v
will be negative and this will become

852
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:10,600
positive in the energy
of the gas would go up.

853
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,130
So there are two ways to change the
energy of these molecules. In the end,

854
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,830
all you want is one of the molecules
to move faster than before.

855
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,820
One is to put them on a hot
plate where that are fast moving.

856
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,450
When they collated the
slow moving molecules,

857
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,320
typically the of and sort of more faster
and the fast and sort of more slower

858
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:30,890
and therefore they'll
be transfer of Kennedy,

859
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,580
Canada out of any push the piston down,

860
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,940
you can show when a molecule
collides with the moving piston,

861
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,680
it will actually gain energy.

862
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,620
So that's how you do work to,
this is the first law.

863
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,413
Okay.

864
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,760
So let us know,

865
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,840
calculate the work done in a process.

866
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:57,890
We had a gas goes from here
to here on an isothermal.

867
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,653
Okay.

868
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,900
ISOTHERM is a graph of given temperature,

869
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,590
so this is a graph.

870
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:12,830
Pete Times would be equal to constant
because PB [inaudible] and our tea,

871
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,740
if t is constant, PV is a constant.
It's the rectangle of hyperbola.

872
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,740
The product of the x and
y coordinates is constant.

873
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,770
So when the x coordinate advantage
the way we'll go to infinity,

874
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,960
white and advantages x,
we'll go to it.

875
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,380
Yeah,

876
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,460
so you want to take your gas photo right
from here to here throughout instead of

877
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:35,660
certain temperature t
what work is done by you?

878
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,080
That's the video.
Nice interpretation.

879
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:44,450
The work done by you
is the integral of PDD,

880
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,390
but what does integral PDV
that's p and that's DV.

881
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:55,550
PDB is that shaded region.
In other words,

882
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,920
if it just right PDB,
it makes absolutely no sense.

883
00:57:57,921 --> 00:58:00,770
If you go to a mathematician and say,
please do the integral for me,

884
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,900
can the mathematician do this?
What's the,

885
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,480
what's coming in the way of the math
addition actually doing the integral?

886
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,790
What do you have to not
really do an integral,

887
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,120
you have to know the function.

888
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,510
If we just said p we'll say maybe piece
constant with guess I'll pull it out of

889
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:21,850
the integral but for this problem,

890
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,480
because Pv is n r t and t you say constant
PE is an r t divided by V and that's

891
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:35,080
the function of the that you would need
to do the integral and if you did that

892
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,130
you will find is and our t all of them
are constants that come over to the

893
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,090
integral DV over v integrate
from the initial volume.

894
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,780
The final volume,
you guys know this is a logarithm,

895
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,800
the log of upper minus log of
low but is the log of the ratio.

896
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,500
This gives me an r t log be two over
v one so we have done about first work

897
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:06,511
calculation when the gas goes
on an isothermal trajectory
from start to finish,

898
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,250
from volume to volume v to the work done.

899
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,380
This is the work done by the gas.

900
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,730
You can all see that gas is expanding
and that's equal to the shaded region.

901
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,003
Okay.

902
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,920
By the way, I mentioned it. No,
I don't want to distract you,

903
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:33,960
but suppose later on I make it go
backwards like this. Part of the way

904
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:39,690
the work done on the going backwards
part is this area, but with a minus sign.

905
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:43,620
I hope you'll understand if you go to the
right, the Ada is considered positive.

906
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,750
If you go to the left area
is considered negative.

907
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,440
If you do the integral and put the right
limits, you'll get the right answer,

908
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:54,470
but geometrically the area under the
graph in the PB diagram is the work done.

909
00:59:54,961 --> 00:59:57,000
If you're moving the direction
of increasing wallet,

910
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,350
if you will decrease the volume. For
example, if you just went back from here,

911
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,030
area looks the same but the work
done is considered negative.

912
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:11,490
You don't have to think very hard.
If you do the calculation going backwards,

913
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:15,200
you'll get log of the one over v two
they'll automatically be the negative of a

914
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:20,070
log of p two over B one but geometrically
the area under the graph is the work.

915
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:21,420
If you're going to the right,
yes.

916
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,150
Let's
turn

917
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,800
to the second stage.

918
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,920
Oh, this one. This will
be a graph PV equal to

919
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:39,190
essentially a constant. So you take your
gas, you see how many malls that are,

920
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,110
you know are,
you know the temperature.

921
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,630
You promise not to change
the temperature so you,

922
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,840
we'll move on a trajectory so
that the product PB never changes.

923
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,380
And in any x, y plane, if the product,

924
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,930
if you draw a graph that the
product x y doesn't change,

925
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:57,750
you'll have this shape contract time
that or hyperbola it just means whenever

926
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,700
one increases, the other should
decrease keeping the product constantly.

927
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,680
That's why P is proportional,
the recipe [inaudible] of the,

928
01:01:05,681 --> 01:01:08,740
and you do the intake integral.
Very good.

929
01:01:08,741 --> 01:01:12,610
So this is now a,
the work done by the gas.

930
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,050
What is the heat input?

931
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:19,740
The heat input is the change in
internal energy minus the work that uh,

932
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,933
let me see.

933
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:27,180
The law was Delta U is equal
to Delta Q minus Delta w yeah,

934
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:28,390
let's go back to this law.

935
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:31,370
Okay.

936
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,240
In this problem.

937
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,710
Delta w is what I just
calculated and our tea,

938
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:41,711
whatever log be two over
B one what is Delta Q?

939
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:48,320
How much heat has been put into this gas?
How do I find that?

940
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,080
Pardon me?
Uh,

941
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,630
for the heat and put you
mean? Yeah, you can use MC,

942
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,760
Delta t but you don't
have to do any more work.

943
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,460
By that I mean you don't
have to any more celebration.

944
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,230
What can you do with this equation
to avoid doing further calculations?

945
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,390
Do you know anything else?

946
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,123
Yes.

947
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,300
Yes. This is what I told you. It says
fact that people not constantly remember,

948
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,460
but you must,
this gas did not change its temperature.

949
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,670
Go back to the equation number.
Whatever I wrote down,

950
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,020
you equal three halves and
rt or something. He doesn't
change. Doesn't change.

951
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,190
That mean the initial temporary
initial internal energy. And finally,

952
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:37,770
internally the are the same
because initial templates
and final temperature the

953
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:39,870
same,
but this guy has to be zero.

954
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,140
That mean Delta Cube the same as Delta W

955
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,560
in this particular case?

956
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,703
Yes.

957
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,010
Uh, when you say Mc Delta t you got to
be careful what formula you want to use.

958
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,663
Uh,

959
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,330
I'll tell you why you
cannot use simply use MC,

960
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:09,050
Delta t if you've got a solid and you
use MC Delta t that is correct because

961
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:12,980
when you hit the solid, the heat you
put in goes into heating up the solid.

962
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:17,420
In the case of a gas, you can maybe
let's ask the following question.

963
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,620
His question is the following.

964
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:24,670
You're telling me you put heat into a
gas right and you say temperature doesn't

965
01:03:25,191 --> 01:03:27,020
go up.
How can that possibly be?

966
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,320
I always thought when I put heat into
something then printed it goes up.

967
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:35,590
That's because you were thinking
about a solid red. If you put in heat,

968
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,110
it's got to go somewhere and of
course the temperature goes up.

969
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,390
What do you think is
happening to the gas here?

970
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,450
Think of the Piston
and weight combination.

971
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:48,460
When I want to go along
this path from here to here.

972
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:52,860
Okay.

973
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:53,940
You can ask yourself

974
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:59,960
where does the heat input and where is
the change in energy and why is that an

975
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:03,060
oil change in temperature?
If you take a piston like this,

976
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:09,420
if you wanted to increase the volume, you
can certainly take off a grain of sand,

977
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,040
right? If you took the grain of
sand and the piston will move up,

978
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,620
it will do work in that
actually it will cool down,

979
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,840
but that's not what you're doing.

980
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:24,530
You are keeping it on a hot plate at a
certain temperature so that if it tries

981
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:28,470
to cool down heat flows from below
to about maintaining the temperature.

982
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:34,010
So what the gas is doing in this case is
taking heat energy from below and going

983
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:36,960
there and working against
the atmosphere about it,

984
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:40,740
texting with one hand and gives out to
the other without changing his energy.

985
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,360
So when you were starting to specify kid,
which is my next topic,

986
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,630
you've got to be a little more careful
when you talk about your specific keeps

987
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:51,890
up gasses.
And I'll tell you why.

988
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,610
There is no single thing called
specifically for our guests that are many,

989
01:04:55,611 --> 01:04:58,520
many definitions,
the depending on the circumstance.

990
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,020
But I hope you understand in this
case you got to visualize this.

991
01:05:03,021 --> 01:05:05,210
It's not enough to draw
diagrams and rob pictures.

992
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,650
What did I do to the cylinder to maintain
the temperature and yet let it expand.

993
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,330
Expansion is going to demand
work on part of the gas.

994
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,280
That's going to require a loss of
energy unless you in energy from below.

995
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,860
So what I've done is I take green after
green so that the pressure drops in the

996
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:28,360
volume increases, but the slight
expansion would have cooled it slightly.

997
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:31,780
But the reservoir from below brings it
back to the temperature of the reservoir.

998
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:34,120
So you prop it up in temperature.

999
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:38,470
So we draw the picture by saying the gas
went from here to here and we usually

1000
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:42,580
drop picture like this and say he'd
float into the system during the process.

1001
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:49,560
All right, now we'll come to this question
that was raised about specific heat.

1002
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,700
No specific Keith,
you always say is Delta Q over Delta,

1003
01:05:56,701 --> 01:06:01,050
t uh, over Delta t divided
by the mass of the substance.

1004
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:03,570
Now we turned,

1005
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:07,470
so for a gas you want it is seen that
what you want to count is not the actual

1006
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:09,420
mass with the malls.

1007
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,710
Yeah.

1008
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:14,440
Because we have seen at the
level of the ideal gas law,

1009
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:18,820
the energy is controlled by not simply
the mass pipe by the mall cause every

1010
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,800
molecule gets a certain number of energy,

1011
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,850
namely three half scape t I knew he just
wanted to count the number of molecules

1012
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,230
or the number of malls.
Now there are many,

1013
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:33,700
many ways in which you can pump in heat
into a gas and heat it up and see how

1014
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:34,570
much heat it takes.

1015
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:39,400
Well let's agree that we will take one
more from no one and not one kilogram

1016
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,370
knock one kilo graph.
We'll try.

1017
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,230
We'll find out if you do it that way.

1018
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:51,220
The answer doesn't seem to depend
on the gas. That's the first thing.

1019
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:54,620
Take them all off some gas
and call the specific key.

1020
01:06:54,621 --> 01:06:58,990
Does the energy needed to raise the
temperature of one mall by one degree?

1021
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,130
So this should not be em.
They shouldn't be the number of malls.

1022
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,150
So if it take one mole,
you can say,

1023
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:13,151
okay one mole of gas I was told has
energy you equals three halves are t

1024
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:20,590
because it was three halves and our tea.
ButN is one more.

1025
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:23,271
No,

1026
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:27,800
you want to put in some heat and you
really want the Delta Q over Delta t so I

1027
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:32,720
remind you the Delta Q is dealt to you.
Let's be Delta beef.

1028
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:35,580
Okay.

1029
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:38,200
The heat input into a gas is the candy,

1030
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:40,890
the energy plus p Delta v
that just from the first law.

1031
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:46,530
So if I'm going to do by Delta Q
by Delta t that's the problem here.

1032
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:52,170
Did you allow the volume to change or
did you not follow the volume to change?

1033
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:55,110
That's going to decide
what the specific heat is.

1034
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,560
In other words, you've been a solid is
heated. It expands at a tiny amount.

1035
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,250
We don't worry about the work done by the
expanding solid against the atmosphere.

1036
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,100
What for the gas when you heated,

1037
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:12,240
the volume changes so much that the
worker does against the external world is

1038
01:08:12,241 --> 01:08:13,360
non negligible.

1039
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:18,830
Therefore the specific is dependent on
what you allow the volume term to do.

1040
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,360
So that is one definition of specific.
He'd called CV.

1041
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,070
CV is the one at constant volume.

1042
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,440
You don't let the volume change.
In other words,

1043
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:32,690
you take the piston and you clamp it.

1044
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,710
Now you're pumping heat from below
by putting it on a hot plate,

1045
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,890
all the heat goes directly
to internal energy.

1046
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,380
None of that is lost
in terms of expansion.

1047
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,560
The Delta v Zero in that case,

1048
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,580
Delta Q over Delta t add constant volume.

1049
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,420
We don't know that in this fashion,
a constant volume.

1050
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:56,420
This term is gone and it
just becomes belt you over.

1051
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:58,670
Delta t that's very easily done.

1052
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:01,750
They'll tell you what Delta
t is three over two R.

1053
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:06,920
Yeah,

1054
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,920
so the specific Keith of a gas at constant
volume is three over two are when I

1055
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:13,371
started solids,

1056
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:16,280
I never bothered about constant volume
because the change in the volume of a

1057
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:18,410
solid is so negligible.
When there's heat it up,

1058
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,220
it's not worth specifying that
it was a constant volume process,

1059
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:26,090
but for the gas it's going to matter,
but there's constant volume or not.

1060
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,410
Then there's a second specific
Keith people like to define

1061
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:34,460
that then follows.
You take this piston,

1062
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:40,210
you have some gas at some pressure you
pump in some heat but he don't clamp the

1063
01:09:40,311 --> 01:09:45,080
piston. The Piston expand any way
it wants at the same pressure.

1064
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,050
For example, if we're being
pushed down by the atmosphere,

1065
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,370
you would let the person move up if it
wants to maintaining the same pressure.

1066
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,171
Well,

1067
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:58,130
if it moves up a little bit then that it
correctly creation is the heat that you

1068
01:09:58,131 --> 01:10:03,131
put in is the change in internal energy
plus p times Delta v where now p is some

1069
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:08,270
constant pressure.
Say the atmospheric pressure.

1070
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:12,440
Delta v is the change in volume.
So Delta you needed now will be more

1071
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,080
because you're pumping and heat from
below and you're losing energy about

1072
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,710
because you're letting the gas expand
because you are letting the pressure be

1073
01:10:21,711 --> 01:10:23,960
controlled from the outside
at some fixed value.

1074
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,040
So now Delta Q,
this delta,

1075
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:31,250
you will be three over to our Delta t.

1076
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,300
Now,
what's the change in p times?

1077
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:38,270
Delta v here's where you
should know your calculus.

1078
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:42,470
That p Times Change v is
the same as change in Pv.

1079
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,510
If p is a constant, right? I remember
long back when I did rate of change,

1080
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:52,070
the momentum is DVT of envy. It's
m times Dvdt. So M doesn't change.

1081
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:53,600
You can take it inside the change,

1082
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,110
but now we use PV equals Rt.

1083
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,450
I'm talking about one more PV equals Rt.
That's a change in the quantity.

1084
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Rt is art as a constant as our times delta
t so I put in here are times Delta t.

1085
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,550
This is the delta Q at constant pressure.

1086
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,960
So the specific either constant pressure
is Delta Q over Delta t keeping the

1087
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,350
pressure of constant.

1088
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:27,610
You divide everything by Delta t you get
three over two r plus another r which

1089
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:29,490
is fire over to ours.

1090
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,200
So the thing you have to remember,

1091
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,400
what I did in the end is that a gas
doesn't have a single specific heat.

1092
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:45,630
You could just say put in some heat and
telling me how many calories I need to

1093
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:47,220
raise the temperature.
That's not enough.

1094
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:51,090
You have to tell me whether in the
interim the gas was fixed dinners,

1095
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:54,660
volume or changes volume or
obey or some other condition.

1096
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:59,320
The two most popular conditions people
consider are either the volume cannot

1097
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,270
change or the pressure cannot change,
the volume cannot change.

1098
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,110
Then the change in the heat you put in
goes directly to internal energy from the

1099
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:08,400
first law of thermodynamics.

1100
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,190
That gives you the specific
heat of three over two r.

1101
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,140
If the pressure cannot change,

1102
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,380
you get five over two are you can see CP
is bigger than CV because when you let

1103
01:12:19,891 --> 01:12:24,540
the Piston expand, then not all
the heat is going to hit the gas.

1104
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,500
Some of it is dissipated on top
by working against the atmosphere.

1105
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:34,710
Then notice that I've not
told you what gas it is.

1106
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,160
That's where the specific heat,

1107
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:42,780
but mall is the right thing to think
about because then the answer does not

1108
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:45,330
depend on what particular guests you took.

1109
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:50,880
There's hydrogen and helium. They all
have the same specific heat per mall.

1110
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:55,020
They won't have the same
specific hip per gram, right?

1111
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,920
Because one gram of helium and one gram
of hydrogen don't have the same number

1112
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:02,490
of moles, so you have to remember
that we're talking about more.

1113
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,070
Final thing I have to caution
you. Very, very important.

1114
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,760
This is for a monarch atomic guests.

1115
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,440
This is for a gas who's
Adam is the gas itself.

1116
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:21,510
It's a point. It's only energy is
kinetic energy that are diatomic gases,

1117
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,800
but two of them join together.
They can form a dumbbell or something.

1118
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:30,360
Then the energy of the dumbbell has
got two parts as you learned long ago.

1119
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:34,140
It can rotate around some axes
and we can also move in space.

1120
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,680
Then the internal energy
has also got two parts.

1121
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:40,710
Energy do do motion of the center
of mass and energy due to rotation.

1122
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,180
Some molecules also vibrate
the lots of complicated things,

1123
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:49,680
but if you've got only one guy,
one Adam, whatever, his masters,

1124
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:53,130
it cannot rotate around itself
and it cannot vibrator on itself,

1125
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:54,600
so those energies all disappear.

1126
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:00,020
So we have taken the simplest one of a
mano atomic gas against whose fundamental

1127
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:03,330
entities? A single atom rather
than a complicated molecule.

1128
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:08,190
That's all you are responsible for.
I'll just say one thing, CP over CV.

1129
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,620
I wanted to mention it before
you run off to do your homework.

1130
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:15,460
I don't ever comes out. It's called gamma.
That's five third for a monotonic. Yes.

1131
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,530
You can just take the
ratio of the numbers.

1132
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,760
If in some problem you find
gamma is not five thirds, do not.

1133
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:26,380
Panic just means it's a gas, which is not
monoatomic. He was not monitored Tommy.

1134
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:30,970
These numbers don't have exactly those
values. We don't have to go beyond that.

1135
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,510
We just have to know this ratio.
Gamma is five thirds in the simplest case,

1136
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,480
but in some problem somewhere in
your life. Let me get a gamma,

1137
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:38,590
which is not fight this.
