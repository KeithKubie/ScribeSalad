00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.710
DAN GALPIN: 10 things
game developers

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.000
should know-- this is
the third time I've

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.592
done this talk in
GDC-- especially

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:13.800
if they want to get featured.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.160
So let's start with Android
design applies to you,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.636
or at least
considerate it, mostly.

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.760
What we mean is you don't
have to use flat sprites,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.120
but you should take a look at
the core app quality guidelines

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.440
we have on
developer.android.com.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.310
And especially look at
things like launcher

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.870
icons, because it's the most
important asset for your brand.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.020
Please consider not making
it a rounded rectangle.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.800
It's not required
on our platform.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.550
Also, look at navigation
[? in ?] handling

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.540
the back key, because
even if your UX looks

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900
completely custom,
the back key better

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.040
work in a reasonable way.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.540
Phones sometimes
have hardware keys.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.260
And notifications--
the featuring team

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.610
hates spammy notifications.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.026
Your application should not
use more than one notification

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.400
at a time as a guideline.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000
And you should combine
notifications on Jelly Bean

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.830
and above.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.290
Two, support the new
stuff and the old stuff.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.290
What do we mean by this?

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.400
In your manifest, always
support the latest version

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400
you have tested against.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.150
This turns off any
compatibility hacks

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.525
that might slow
your performance,

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.380
and the [? featured ?]
committee likes it.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.610
But of course, if you're
using an NDK application,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.440
your app platform must be less
than or equal to your min SDK

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.290
version, because this
is a C++ ABI after all,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080
so we don't have
forward compatibility.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.786
Three, using immersive mode.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:21.660
One of the new features
you might want to use

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.687
is immersive mode
when it makes sense.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:25.270
If you're not doing
an immersive game,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.730
you probably don't
need immersive mode.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.860
So it just makes a potentially
confusing navigation

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.517
experience your players
when the nav bar disappears.

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:33.350
But if you have some
awesome real time space

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.135
simulation that would benefit
from immersive mode, go for it.

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.430
Four, support cloud save.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.220
It doesn't have to be
ours-- any cloud save.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.650
But your users will
really appreciate it.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.234
And of course, it's
nice if it's ours.

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:48.733
You get all sorts
of great features,

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.310
along with Play Game services.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240
And we call this Saved
Games, really creatively.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.940
Five, respect user privacy.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.010
What we mean here is
minimize permissions, OK?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.866
So I used to talk about the
top 10 bad game permissions.

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:02.990
There's really no bad list.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.290
But if you're using
anything like this,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.873
you probably don't
have a good reason.

00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:07.430
And if your middleware
requires it,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.560
you probably shouldn't
be using that middleware.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.018
Finally, make sure that you
understand when the advertising

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:13.922
ID can and must be used.

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:16.380
Remember that you really are
responsible for any middleware

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.720
your game uses.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.880
Six, play by the
rules of Google Play.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.590
Speaking of advertising
ID, take a close look

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.050
at your developer distribution
agreement and your program

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.970
policies.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.824
Read these policies.

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:30.240
Remember that our
enforcement team

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.070
deals with thousands
of infractions daily

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.930
and has little patience
with the bad guys.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.638
So if you think what
you're doing is even

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:38.900
violating the spirit of
these policies, think again.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.850
All right.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.770
Seven, controls.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.320
Be flexible with your controls.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.287
For example, on
developer.android.com,

00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:49.620
we've got this fantastic
example of what standard button

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.000
mapping looks like.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.770
So consider
supporting game pads.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.620
And also consider both
phones and tablets

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.130
when designing touch controls.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.840
Just because my screen
is bigger doesn't

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.470
mean my fingers are longer.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.180
And of course, think of TVs.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.120
This means you shouldn't
require touch at all.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.740
And you consider supporting
D-pads, at least in your menus.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.090
Eight, size matters, always.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.510
So this is our Nexus 6.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.040
It is our biggest,
baddest phone,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.030
and it has 64 gigs of
onboard storage, up to.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.046
That's still not enough.

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:24.670
It has a whopping
three gigs of memory.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.260
That's also not enough.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.860
So smaller APKs tend
to get more downloads.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.420
Use things like multi APK and
GPU Native Texture formats

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.150
to keep things small in memory.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.030
Use WebP, a distribution
size, as your highest concern.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.250
Consider hosting
assets for post install

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.360
to make the initial
download size smaller.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.240
The size in Flash matters, too.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.892
OK?

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:45.850
Because people will delete
things that are big.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.170
On lower memory devices,
adapt by using Native Texture

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.780
formats.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.656
Finally, we can't make
batteries much larger.

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:53.030
Keep people playing
the game more

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.075
by avoiding excessive
network use and wake locks.

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:56.660
If you need to
keep the screen on,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.010
use a window flag,
not a wake lock.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.430
Nine, testing.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.110
Don't panic.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.567
Use the matrix.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.900
As you can see, with the
matrix, it's just five devices.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.860
We've tested three screen size
buckets, five resolutions,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.110
four memory configurations,
five GPUs, five CPUs

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.140
from five different
manufacturers.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.660
It's not that hard.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.480
10, have fun.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.722
Build great games.

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:23.180
And what do I mean
when I say that?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.730
Well, here is an example
of a featured list

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.430
from a current
Google Play session.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.800
And if you take a look
at these, they all

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.860
have something in common.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.420
Users love them.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.750
Ultimately, we want to
promote games both we

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.500
and our users love.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.792
So that's it-- 10 things that
will help you build games

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:38.916
that your users will love
and that Google Play will

00:04:38.916 --> 00:04:39.640
want to feature.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.510
All right?

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.896
Thank you.

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.236
