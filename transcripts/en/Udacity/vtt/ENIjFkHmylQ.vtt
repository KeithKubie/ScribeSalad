The correct answer here is viewWillAppear as this is

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.100
the method where we show and hide things on our phone.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.650
Now, if you look at our class, this method, viewWillAppear, does not exist yet.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.800
As I start typing it, however, Xcode actually autocompletes the method for

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.760
me and I can accept that autocomplete suggestion by hitting Enter.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.490
There. This method viewWillAppear is inherited from UIViewController, and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.190
that is why this keyword override is used.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.160
Now in here, I want to hide the stop button.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.960
To do this, I will need to access the stop button in the code somehow.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.290
And the way I can do that is by pressing Control on my keyboard and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.910
creating an outlet at the top here.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.910
I will call it stopButton and hit Connect.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.568
Okay, I'm going to scroll up a little bit so we can see all of the code,

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:51.550
and inside viewWillAppear, I will hide the stop button.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.560
Now, one last thing I want to do here is I want to make sure that

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.810
the stop button actually starts to show up when I press this microphone button.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.550
So remember when I press this microphone button, this action gets called.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.940
So in here, I'll say stopButton.hidden is equal to false.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.240
Let me run this and see if it works.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.860
All right, so when the app first launches, I do not see any stop button.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.900
That is good.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.200
When I click on this microphone, the stop button starts showing.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.720
That is great.
