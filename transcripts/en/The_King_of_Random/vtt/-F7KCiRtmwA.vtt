00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.860
In today's video,

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.549
we're going to see what happens
if we take 1000 lollipops,

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.100
and melt them in a slow cooker.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.200
[Music]

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm Nate.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm Calli, and we have
a new slow cooker.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.254
What should we put in it?

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.000
I have a couple extra lollipops.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.380
Yeah.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.940
[Music]

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.600
You might not know
what the word couple means.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.750
Well, I wanted a lollipop,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.465
and I figured
if I'm buying a lollipop,

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.000
I might as well buy
a couple extra.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800
So we need a thousand
for the project today.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.600
Is there a thousand there?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400
I think so.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.000
Well. better get started.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
We have made some hard
candy stuff before,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.581
and it usually seems
to melt pretty well.

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:43.900
So we're thinking

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.100
that these lollipops
will melt back down,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.359
and I'm curious what's going
to happen with the colors.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.700
We've got like two or three
different types of lollipop,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.200
and they're all multiple colors.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
So I'm wondering

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.200
if we're gonna get
like swirled effect,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.626
or if it's just going to turn
like into a brown blob.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:58.700
It's going to go brown.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
Might depend on if we mix it.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.730
What's going to happen
to the sticks,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.400
because we're not going
to take the sticks out.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.200
We're just going to throw
that in with it,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.200
and hopefully,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.500
the sticks won't melt,
even though they are plastic.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.100
If they do,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.000
then we're not gonna want to eat
what comes out of this.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700
So these are just Tiger Pops.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
Lots of pretty colors,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.200
but we're really not sure
about the flavor.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.800
All right, so we each need
to count off 500.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:29.680
[Music]

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.680
So, are you sure
we have a thousand?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.000
We might have a few extra.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:54.200
[Music]

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.980
Aha!

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.200
Number 1,000.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.300
We still have space,
and we still have lollipops.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.360
So I think we should just keep
going a little bit.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.120
[Music]

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.080
That was an extra
twenty one on my part.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.200
1,171 lollipops in a Crock-Pot.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.100
And now we turn it on,
and see what happens.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.900
Yep.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.600
Oh, no, there's more.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.120
71, 72, 75, 76.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.300
1,176.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.240
We had a set to about
250 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.600
and we started getting a lot
of smoke coming off of it.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.500
Our goal is not to just
set it on fire,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.111
and have tons of sugar burning.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.740
So we've lowered
the temperature down to 150.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.100
We thought it was the candy
burning just at first,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.000
but the sticks are melting too,
so got to be careful of that.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.160
This may not be edible
by the time it's all melted.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.740
Wanna make a lollipop sculpture
here and just [inaudible]?

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.300
That's just a stick.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.980
Now, you have garbage
in my beautiful sculpture.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.900
Hey, Mark, we made this for you.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.900
I want to try and stir it.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
Like I feel like that's
only safe way to do this.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.448
I think it's only melt
around the edges.

00:03:16.448 --> 00:03:18.800
So we just need
to let it sit longer,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.260
at the lower temperature.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:43.880
[Music]

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.300
Okay, so we are having

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.829
success in melting
the lollipops themselves.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.700
The problem that we're having
is to get them to melt,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.100
we're having to raise it
to such a high temperature

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.700
that the sticks
are also melting.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.900
So the plan is now,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.440
we are actually going
to lower the heat, but also...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.100
Put a lid on.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.300
Hopefully, we can contain
some of that heat,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.800
and actually get an even melt.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.960
Fingers crossed.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.580
I've got this silicone cake pan,

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:12.170
and if everything goes pretty
well with our melting lollipops,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.409
I want to try maybe pouring some
of the lollipop goo into here,

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.200
and making a giant
lollipop out of it.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.920
Kind of depends on

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.800
if we can get some
of the sticks out of the way,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.900
and if everything doesn't like
burn badly in that roaster,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.700
and something like that,
but we're going to give a shot.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.760
So here's a lollipop mold,
here's a lollipop stick.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.360
[Music]

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.300
Make it a little bit smaller

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.140
than the diameter
of the stick so that...

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.660
[inaudible] the lollipop
will leak through.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.360
[Music]

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.960
I think that looks
like it should work pretty well.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.340
[Music]

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.760
So at this point,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.120
we're going to try and
get the sticks out.

00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:55.300
Now, most of this looks burned,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.300
but we think
it's mixed flavour?

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.480
Just maybe everything got mixed?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.600
Mine taste good.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.500
[Music]

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.300
That's definitely
somewhat burned.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:22.180
[Music]

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.100
Okay quick update.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.500
We were trying to melt
here a thousand lollipops,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500
and I think we were
just a little impatient.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.900
We're just trying to kind of do
it in sort of a one-day thing,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.135
and it really burned.

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:32.600
And we left the plastic in.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.550
We're going to try,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.900
and revisit this with
a slightly different method,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.170
because this, it's just burnt.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.745
Like it doesn't even
taste good anymore,

00:05:38.745 --> 00:05:40.200
and that kind
of defeats the purpose.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.370
&gt;&gt; So we're going to try it again.
&gt;&gt; It taste okay.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.000
We're gonna try it was
lower heat and longer time.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.700
I think we're going to try
letting it run like overnight,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.600
or even for a day

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.300
or two just to see
if we can get it to work.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.300
Guys, the first time we tried

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.278
putting our lollipops
in a slow cooker,

00:05:55.278 --> 00:05:57.746
what we had was actually more
of a roasting pan.

00:05:57.746 --> 00:05:59.638
It is something
that can cook slowly,

00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:02.679
but it doesn't work the same way
as a regular slow cooker.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:05.400
So we've adapted and changed
things up a little bit.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.501
So our crock pot is
a little bit different.

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:09.971
A crock-Pot has
thick ceramic walls,

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:10.976
cooks things slower,

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:13.222
but at a much more
even ambient temperature.

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:16.200
Hopefully, fingers crossed,
it's not going to burn things.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.900
You can see
this right here,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.767
like this whole thing is...

00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:22.000
I think it can't
even lift it out.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.312
That is full of hundreds
of lollipops right now.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.000
So that's thick ceramic,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.800
and at no point is there
like a thin steel wall

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000
that gets too hot,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.799
and should start
burning the lollipops.

00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:36.600
That was the biggest problem
we ran into before, is well,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.005
the inside temperature overall
might be controlled pretty well,

00:06:40.005 --> 00:06:41.300
the edges get too hot,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.500
and so we really started
having burned sugar.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.042
So we got new lollipops.

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:48.000
We have now unwrapped
a new thousand lollipops,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and these ones actually
have paper sticks.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.266
So even if they are in contact
with a heating element,

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:54.953
they probably, I don't think it
would get hot enough to burn,

00:06:54.953 --> 00:06:56.700
and definitely,
wouldn't get it to melt.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.440
So we've got
our new slow cooker,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.400
which is now very very full

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.081
of unwrapped lollipops
with paper sticks.

00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:05.217
And unfortunately,

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.300
we can't fit
all 1000 in at first.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.600
So we have a plan.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.900
Plan's going to
be pretty simple.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.340
We are going to wait
until this melts down,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.100
and as it does,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.736
we're going to add
the rest of them.

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:15.500
So this is what?

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.720
800 almost or--

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.120
Yeah, I'd say we probably added
about 800, and 200 here.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.040
So once those 800 melt down,
we're going to pour in the rest,

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:25.100
and hopefully,
everything melts evenly,

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.794
and then we can pour
it into our mold.

00:07:26.794 --> 00:07:28.844
If the glass top gets
to covered in steam,

00:07:28.844 --> 00:07:30.020
we'll probably take that off.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.400
It would go slower
without the top,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.841
so we're hoping
that doesn't happen,

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.997
but we'll keep an eye on it.

00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:35.097
And if it gets opaque,

00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:36.770
so we can't see
the lollipops melting,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.150
we'll remove it.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:08:02.000
[Music]

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.100
Our lollipops are
thoroughly cooked.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.300
More thoroughly than we

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.498
were expecting them
to become in fact.

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:11.380
Or that we wanted
them to become.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.451
I was confident that

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.708
the low setting
on a slow cooker like this,

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:17.482
with the ceramic pot
to evenly distribute the heat,

00:08:17.482 --> 00:08:19.036
would keep it all low enough

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.200
that we wouldn't have
a burning problem.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.320
I was wrong.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.700
So that was just a piece

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.100
that had bubbled over
and drip down the side.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.900
and I was just tasting it,
see what it's like,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.377
and it's very burned tasting.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:33.427
There is like a fruity
tangy flavor to it.

00:08:33.427 --> 00:08:35.227
But then it's also
just pretty acrid.

00:08:35.227 --> 00:08:36.600
Taste like burnt sugar, huh?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.700
Yeah, that's burnt sugar
with a little bit of flavoring.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.500
Let's see if we
can get this lid off.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.160
It bubbled over
like around the lid,

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.580
then it cooled down.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.300
So now the lid is
pretty well attached,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.160
and it's glass.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.000
Wait, see if we can just
pick the whole thing up

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.945
by the lid handle.

00:08:50.945 --> 00:08:52.100
Okay, you go for that.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.830
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, we got the lid off.
&gt;&gt; Well, it worked.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.500
Okay.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.080
Now, we have

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.900
what looks like a pot
full of pretzel sticks.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.100
That one actually broke
like a pretzel stick.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.900
Usually, lollipop sticks
like his will just bend.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.800
This is just...

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.320
That's like your pretzel.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.600
[Music]

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.600
You can break them,
but you can't really chew them.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.460
Mmm.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.700
It's a weird combination
of sour and bitter.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.100
Actually, it still
smells quite good.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.500
&gt;&gt; It smells like lollipops.
&gt;&gt; It really does.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.800
These were our remaining few

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.759
that we did manage to get
into the crock pot

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:25.610
before it boiled over.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.110
This has more smell than this.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.521
Really?

00:09:27.521 --> 00:09:28.080
Wait. Yeah.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.000
That doesn't really
smell like much to me.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.500
Okay.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.040
Yeah.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.200
Yeah, I think burning it,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.005
or even this cooking it kind
of brought that smell out.

00:09:36.005 --> 00:09:37.300
It smells very fruity.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.300
Like a candy fruit flavor,
but like a fruit flavor still.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.500
Check this out.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.980
The sugar is about here.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.960
So that means
we have four inches

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.880
of solid burned cooked sugar
full of lollipop sticks.

00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:54.950
Look, it's a new
sort of lollipop.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.600
Oh, yes.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.000
It's the sideways lollipop
that gouges in to your face.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.400
Those will be very popular.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.920
[Music]

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.900
I regret everything.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.622
It's interesting.

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:09.751
You really can still taste
like the fruit flavors

00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:11.817
of the lollipop mixed in
with the burning flavor.

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:14.341
I was expecting a lot more
of like a smoky burnt flavor.

00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:14.840
Yeah.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.400
Yeah.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.340
This is just bitter.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.460
Well, I'm surprised
that it did this.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.192
I have learned something
about crock pots.

00:10:20.192 --> 00:10:21.583
From what I researched,

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:24.961
it said that the low setting
should be under 200 degrees.

00:10:24.961 --> 00:10:26.365
But I assume that even

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:28.514
though we had
the thick ceramic pot,

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:31.400
it still had hot spots
where right at the edges,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400
it was getting higher
than that temperature,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.288
and the temperature

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:37.388
that I looked up must have been
the average inside temperature.

00:10:37.388 --> 00:10:38.400
The ambient temperature.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Yeah, so we were getting burning

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.200
as you probably saw
in the time-lapse.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.400
It kind of foamed up,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.400
bubbling and burning
on one side.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.200
A little bit on both sides,
more on one side than the other,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.640
and just took over everything.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.240
Yeah, and it was
around the edges.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.900
So I'm--

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.640
Yeah, like you said,

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.200
I assumed that heat was much
much higher than expected.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.700
This doesn't taste
nearly as burnt.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.580
Yep.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.000
It's more efficient this way.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.340
I don't think that word means
what you think it means.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.500
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940
Guys, that's not all.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.140
