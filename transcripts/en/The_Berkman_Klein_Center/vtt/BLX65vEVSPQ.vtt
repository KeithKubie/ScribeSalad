00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.160
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.270
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.545
This is the sixth of 12
lectures on copyright.

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:24.090
I'll be examining today
the mechanics of copyright,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.910
in other words, the way in which the
machinery of the copyright system

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.910
works in practice.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299
As usual, I'll devote
most of my attention

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.090
to how the US Copyright system works.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.920
Indeed, of the 12
lectures in this series,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.710
this is the one that pays
especially close attention

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.350
to the idiosyncrasies of the
law in the United States.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.510
However, I will identify
along the way some respects

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.460
in which the copyright systems
of other countries differ.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.490
And more importantly, I will emphasize
the broad policy questions implicated

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.850
by the US rules, policy questions
that are pertinent to all countries.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.450
Also as usual, I will be
supplementing my presentation

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.700
with various audiovisual
materials, which are best

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.800
seen by watching the lecture
on a computer or a device

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.070
with a reasonably large screen.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.960
One source of those
supplementary materials

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.580
will be a map of copyright law,
the current version of which

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.820
can be downloaded from my home page,
the address of which is tfisher.org.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.600
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.590
The machinery of the copyright
system is intricate, surprisingly so.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.310
I will not attempt today
to catalog all its details.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.110
Instead, I will concentrate on three
important dimensions of this machine--

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.730
first, the roles played by formalities;
second, the rules governing

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.840
how long copyrights last, and
third, the aspects of the system

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.510
that attempt to protect vulnerable
artists and their families

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.187
from exploitation.

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:03.395
We'll begin with formalities.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.870
Until quite recently, the United States,
unlike most countries in the world,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.670
extended copyright
protection only to authors

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.220
who had complied with some
administrative requirements known

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.900
as formalities.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.310
These administrative requirements
were not especially burdensome,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.910
but they were important.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.850
Indeed, failure to
observe them could result

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.930
in permanent forfeiture
of one's copyright.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.400
In the late 20th century, most
of these formal requirements

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.330
were eliminated, not all
at once, but in stages.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.110
The result is, that since 1989, the
copyright system of the United States

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
has been, in this respect, very
similar to the copyright systems

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.830
in most other countries.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.050
During this segment
of the lecture, I will

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.680
describe how those formal
requirements once worked

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.930
and the process by
which they were largely,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.890
although-- as we'll see--
not completely abandoned.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.950
A threshold question--
if these formalities

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.196
have been more or less eliminated,
why do we need to discuss them?

00:03:13.196 --> 00:03:15.710
There are two answers to that question.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.620
First, as you'll soon see,
many of the copyrights that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.670
remain commercially valuable
in the United States

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.910
were born during eras in which the
formalities were still in force,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.380
and the abolition of the
formalities was not retroactive.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.370
As a result, the legal status
today of many copyrighted works

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.900
depends upon the capacity
of the putative owner

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.250
to demonstrate that the formal
requirements were once upon a time

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.650
appropriately observed.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.960
In short, the formalities
still matter in practice.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.900
The second reason is that,
as you will also see,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.620
many scholars today believe that the
abolition of formalities was a mistake

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.230
and that the copyright system
did function and would function

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.840
much better if at least some
formalities were reinstated.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.540
Indeed, these scholars
argue, all countries

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.279
should revive some variant of the model
that once existed in the United States.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.290
Examining the history of
formalities in the United States

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.660
will help us to assess that
important policy argument.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.790
With those two considerations
in mind, let's turn to the law.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.460
The slide on your screen summarizes
the changing status in US law

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.260
of the three most important formalities.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.100
I hasten to add that this
chart is not comprehensive.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.320
It focuses on, as I say, the
most important requirements.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.880
If you're hungry for more
information on the subject,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.295
follow the branch of the map that
summarizes the history of formalities.

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:53.420
You'll find they are linked
to an excellent article

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.400
by Professor Jane Ginsburg.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.910
On pages 13 and 14 of
her article, you'll

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.300
find a chart that contains much more
detail than the one on your screen.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.400
So with that cautionary note,
let's focus on the main themes.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.970
To make sense of this field, you
need to differentiate three eras

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.360
in the legal history of copyright in the
United States-- the period between 1909

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:27.670
and the end of 1977; the period between
January 1, 1978 and February 28, 1989;

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.150
and the period between March
1, 1989 and the present.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.270
The first of these eras
was governed by the 1909

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.900
version of the Federal
Copyright Statute.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.290
The event that separated the
first from the second era

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.990
was a comprehensive reform of that
statute, which was adopted in 1976

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.270
but only became effective
at the start of 1978.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.170
The event that separated the
second from the third era

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.350
was the effective date of the
statute, that as we have seen earlier,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.500
altered US law enough
to enable the United

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.360
States to join the Berne Convention.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.000
We could, of course, look
farther back in time than 1909.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.370
But no copyrights governed by pre-1909
statutes are still alive today,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.360
so we won't.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.440
During the first of these eras,
there were three main formalities.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.170
Most important, and for
authors, the most dangerous

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.870
was the notice requirement.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.590
When you first published
your work, you had

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.900
to notify the world that you
were claiming copyright in it,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.840
or you forfeited your rights.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.490
The statute was quite precise
concerning the content and placement

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.910
of that notice.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.390
For example, if you
published a novel, you

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.050
had to place the notice on the
title page or the following page.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.670
You had to use the word copyright
or any abbreviation thereof,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.720
such as the now famous
c within a circle.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.670
And you had to indicate the
date of the publication.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.630
Here, for example, is the
second page of an edition

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.650
of Gone with the Wind by Margaret
Mitchell, a very popular novel

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.620
that we will discuss
later in this course.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.700
The crucial material is indicated here.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.290
You might wonder, why is
the copyright asserted

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.240
by McMillan rather than by Mitchell?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.810
And what's the purpose of the
language highlighted on your screen?

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.390
We'll address those issues shortly.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.650
Now back to the chart-- as I
say, if you published your work

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.060
without appropriate notice, you no
longer enjoyed copyright protection.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.480
This requirement corresponded to
and reinforced the distinction,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.670
during the era governed
by the 1909 statute,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:52.110
between state and federal
copyright protection.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.485
Here's how that distinction
worked in practice.

00:07:54.485 --> 00:07:57.840
 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.470
When you first created your
work-- let's assume it's a novel--

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.790
you acquired a copyright but not a
copyright recognized and enforced

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.090
by federal statutory law.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.070
Rather, you enjoyed a copyright
recognized and enforced

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.820
by state common law.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.180
If you never published your
novel, that common law protection

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.420
would last indefinitely.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.910
But if you published your novel, your
common law protection evaporated.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.350
From that point forward, you got
copyright protection under federal law,

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.610
if at all.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.679
This is the moment when the
notice requirement took hold.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.260
If you published the novel
without the requisite notice,

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.140
you forfeited federal
protection permanently.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:44.670
As a result, the novel fell into the
public domain, the set of materials

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.250
that anyone can use freely.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.990
The metaphor of falling is interesting.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.080
Why didn't the novel rise
into the public domain?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.730
There are various possible
explanations for this terminology--

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.470
perhaps because the public
domain was thought of as debased,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.680
perhaps because it was analogized
to the Lockian untilled field,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.920
perhaps because it was thought
of as a reservoir, like water,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.910
of raw materials.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:21.590
Not clear, but almost certainly, the
metaphor of falling had, and still has,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.440
power.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.420
Back to our story-- if by
contrast, you or your publisher

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.370
attached to all copies of the
published book the requisite notice,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.630
then you did acquire federal
copyright protection,

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.540
but it did not last forever.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.460
Rather, it lasted for an
initial term of 28 years.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.090
When that term ended,
the novel again fell

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.370
into the public domain, unless you, or
as we'll see, a member of your family

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.040
renewed the copyright, in which
case, it would enjoy protection

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.950
for a second 28-year term, whereupon
it would finally and permanently

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.880
fall to the public domain.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.720
Thereafter, anyone could
use it, copy it, publish it,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.990
read it aloud in a public
park, and so forth.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.230
For the most part, the system worked
just fine for sophisticated novelists,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.340
like Margaret Mitchell, and
publishers, like McMillan.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.120
They were aware of the statutory
requirements, and complying with them

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.650
was not hard.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.040
But less sophisticated players or the
creators of less-conventional works

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.010
sometimes neglected the notice
requirement, and as a result,

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.870
lost copyright protection permanently.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.620
The courts, sympathetic to the plight
of these unsophisticated players,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.940
begin to tinker with this
legal regime, in order

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.020
to reduce the frequency of forfeitures.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.930
They couldn't, of course, ignore the
statutory requirement altogether.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.710
Instead, they began
to construe the term,

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:02.719
quote, "publication," close quote,
in a way that helped 90% of authors.

00:11:02.719 --> 00:11:04.510
They were able to do
so because the statute

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.810
itself did not to find
the term publication,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.230
but left that up to the courts.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.640
Seizing that opportunity,
the courts differentiated

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.500
two kinds of publication-- so-called
limited publication, which would not

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.540
trigger the notice requirement,
and so-called general publication,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.400
which did.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.910
The courts then defined
general publication narrowly,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.320
to exclude lots of
things we would actually

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.960
associate with the term publication.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.190
For example, they held that
making and distributing

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.220
a sound recording of
a musical composition

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.760
did not result in publication
of the composition

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.380
and that giving a public lecture did not
result in publication of the lecture,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.160
unless you passed out unrestricted
copies of the text to your audience.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.670
 

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:59.210
Here's an important and illustrative
case, the outcome of which

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:04.380
hinged on this counterintuitive
definition of publication.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.570
On August 28, 1963, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:14.860
organized a march in Washington, DC in
support of the civil rights movement.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:20.600
Roughly 200,000 people gathered on
the mall at the center of the city.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.840
The march culminated with a
speech by Dr. Martin Luther King

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.060
Jr, the founder and president
of the Leadership Conference.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.650
The latter portions of
his speech contained

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:38.020
some of the most moving and justly
famous lines in US political history.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.220
Here are a few.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.860
"I have a dream that my four children
will one day live in a nation

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.840
where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.090
but by the content of their character.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.130
I have a dream that one day the state
of Alabama, whose governor's lips are

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.640
presently dripping with the words
of interposition and nullification,

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.980
will be transformed into a situation
where little black boys and black girls

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.390
will be able to join hands with
little white boys and white girls

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:13.730
and walk together as
sisters and brothers."

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.400
As I say, roughly 200,000
people heard this speech live,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.610
and millions more saw it on television.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:27.440
Roughly a month afterward, it apparently
occurred to King, or his advisers,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.380
that he ought to enjoy a
copyright in the speech

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.440
and that other people
should have to pay him,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.500
if they wished to sell
copies the speech.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:41.080
So on September 30, 1963, King
filed for copyright registration

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:47.000
and duly received a certificate
of registration on October 2.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.920
He then initiated an infringement
suit against unauthorized seller

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.740
and prevailed.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.770
It's probably occurred
to you that there's

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.360
an important policy issue lurking here.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.970
Should political speeches be
subject to copyright protection?

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.360
In the United States, so
long as their authors are not

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.310
officials of the federal government,
they are protected by copyright.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.330
And Dr. King and his estate
have enforced their copyrights

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.810
in his speeches and letters fiercely.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.200
I leave to you the question of
whether giving King and his estate

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.170
this power makes sense on the basis
of any of the theories of copyright

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.050
we've considered thus far
in this lecture series.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.970
But our primary concern today is not
with that important policy issue,

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.750
but with of question of formalities.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.650
For decades, no one seems to
have challenged King's copyright

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.300
in the "I Have a Dream" speech.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.400
Then, in 1994, CBS produced
a documentary series

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.520
on 20th century US history.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.870
One segment of one episode in
that series focused on the March

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.020
on Washington.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:02.770
In it, CBS showed roughly
60% of King's speech.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.020
CBS did not, before making
the film, ask permission

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.150
and did not pay the
customary license fee.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.660
CBS's estate predictably
brought suit against CBS.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.790
CBS's main line of defense was that
King, and subsequently his estate,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.950
lacked copyright protection, because
King had published the speech in August

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:30.470
of 1963 without the
statutorily required notice.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.890
There's no question that King had not
given any kind of copyright notice

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.820
when he delivered the
speech on the mall.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.200
So the only issue, at least during
the preliminary round of litigation,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.340
was whether making the speech
before a nationwide audience

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.810
constituted publication.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.620
The trial court concluded,
yes, and thus that King

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.130
had forfeited copyright protection.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.320
But the Court of Appeals for
the 11th Circuit concluded, no.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.090
A general publication, the
court ruled, occurs only

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.145
in two situations-- first,
when tangible copies of a work

00:16:05.145 --> 00:16:08.170
are distributed to the general
public in such a manner as

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.880
to allow the public to exercise
dominion and control over those copies;

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.230
and second, when the work
is exhibited and displayed

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.140
in a way that invites unrestricted
copying by the general public,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.470
for example, by publicly displaying
a sculpture without any restrictions

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.490
on the freedom of
viewers to photograph it.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.970
At the stage of the litigation
in which this issue arose,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.740
CBS had not yet established that
King had done either of those things

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.640
when he delivered the speech.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.660
So he did not forfeit
his copyright in it.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.960
So CBS, as a result, had to obtain
a license from King's estate,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.720
if CBS wished to broadcast it.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.840
This case illustrates a couple things--
on one hand, the crucial importance

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.530
during this first year of
the notice requirement;

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.490
and on the other hand, the willingness
of some courts in borderline cases

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.144
to construe the term publication
in a way that avoided forfeiture.

00:17:07.144 --> 00:17:09.890
 

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.710
So that's the first of
the three main formalities

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.650
that governed US
copyright law until 1978.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.940
After that date, the requirement
was softened considerably.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.329
Between 1978 and 1989,
failure to attach notices

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:30.270
to copies at the time of
registration was not fatal, so long

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.800
as you made an effort to cure
the problem within five years.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.860
In 1989, the notice
requirement was eliminated

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.300
as a precondition for
copyright protection.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.210
Although, as we'll see
in the 12th lecture,

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.510
a failure to attach
appropriate notices may

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:51.240
limit the amount of statutory damages
you can collect from infringers.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.680
Remember, however, that these
changes were not retroactive.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.540
So in the King case, the fact
that the CBS documentary was not

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.850
made until the 1990s did not mean that
the notice requirement was irrelevant.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.430
Because the speech was
made and published in 1963,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.610
the 1909 statutory
requirements still applied

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:18.780
and continue to apply
today to pre-1978 works.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.940
The second of the three formalities
is also illustrated by the King case.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.970
Registering your work
with the Copyright Office

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.150
was not a prerequisite
to copyright protection.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.570
But you could not bring an infringement
suit prior to registration,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.290
nor could you renew the copyright.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.230
That's the reason King sought
and obtained registration

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.160
before filing his initial suit.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.950
In 1978, the renewal system,
as we'll see, disappeared.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.910
But registration remained necessary
if you wanted to bring a lawsuit.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.790
An additional incentive
for registration was

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.600
added, namely that you couldn't recover
statutory damages or attorney's fees

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.440
for infringements that
began prior to registration.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.150
In 1989, registration
ceased to be a precondition

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.740
for initiating a lawsuit with
respect to works first published

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.700
outside the United States.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.660
But it's still remained
so for so-called US works.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.860
 

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.380
The softest and least
important of the formalities

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.280
was the requirement that authors
deposit two copies of their works

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.760
with the Library of Congress
within three months of publication,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.700
basically, in order to help the
library build its collection.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.270
Failure to comply exposed
you to escalating fines.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.740
If after being notified by the Copyright
Office you still refuse to comply,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.130
you could forfeit your copyright,
although this seems to have been rare.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.690
Forfeiture was eliminated
as a sanction in 1978,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:58.240
and that regime
continues to the present.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.180
So that, in brief, was how the
US system of formalities worked

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.800
and how it has been radically cut back.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.760
As we've seen, the system
had two unfortunate effects.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.120
First, it sometimes resulted
in inattentive authors

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.040
losing their copyright
protection altogether.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.620
Second, it tended to benefit
sophisticated parties and institutions

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:26.410
and to disadvantage authors and others
less aware of the rules of the game.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.340
However, in its heyday,
the system of formalities

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.160
also had two important
beneficial social functions.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.850
First, the registration requirement
facilitated socially beneficial

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.870
licenses and assignments.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:43.750
Suppose you encountered
a copyrighted work

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.100
and wanted to use it for some purpose.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.220
For example, you came
upon a sound recording

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.200
you wanted to include in
a film or an article you

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.380
wanted to include in an anthology.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.440
If the copyright in the recording or
article has been properly registered,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.430
you were more likely to be able
to locate the copyright owner

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:07.360
and thus obtain a license than
if had not been registered.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.730
Viewed from this angle, however,
the system was far from perfect,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.470
because as we've seen, lots of
work still in there first term

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.660
had not been the subject of litigation
and thus were still unregistered.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.440
And yet, the copyrights
in them were valid.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.720
The second of the two
beneficial social functions

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.530
was advanced more
effectively by this regime.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.280
The notice requirement had the effect
that many works, specifically all works

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.180
published without the proper
notice, fell into the public domain.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.700
Arguably, this was
desirable, both by increasing

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.070
the set of materials from which
future authors could draw freely

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:52.160
and by giving all authors an easy way
of dedicating their works to the public.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.680
If you didn't want to assert
a copyright, all you had to do

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.970
was publish your work
without a copyright notice.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.700
 

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:05.640
Some evidence that these functions
were indeed being advanced

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.230
can be gleaned from
data compiled by Chris

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:14.550
Sprigman in his pioneering
article on copyright formalities.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.250
The slide in front of you,
taken from Sprigman's article,

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.800
shows the number of copyright
registrations each year,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.190
from 1909 through the
end of the century.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.410
As you can see, it begins at
about $100,000 per year and peaks

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.010
at around 600,000.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.670
That might seem like a large number.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:40.760
But it's a tiny percentage of the set
of potentially copyrightable works.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.100
Another feature of the system
reinforced this effect.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.150
As you'll recall, the
original 1909 regime

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.930
did not give authors a
copyright lasting 56 years,

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.940
but rather gave them an initial
term of 28 years plus an option

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.920
to renew for another 28 years.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.470
If they failed to exercise
that option, their works

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.540
fell into the public domain.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.900
And most authors did indeed fail,
as this chart, also from Sprigman,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.910
demonstrates.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.930
It shows the fraction of
works originally registered

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.720
that were renewed when the
time came for renewal arrived.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:26.030
As you can see, that percentage begins
around 5% and rises to only around 20%.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.340
In other words, the large
majority of registered works

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.674
were not renewed and thus went out
of copyright after only 28 years,

00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:36.715
thus contributing to the
public domain reservoir.

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:39.790
 

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.290
The general principle
underlying the system

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.930
is that copyright was an opt-in regime.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:51.800
If you wanted a copyright, you had
to affirmatively acquire and keep it.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.480
If you didn't, you lost it.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.690
By contrast, the current US
regime and the copyright regimes

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.380
in virtually all other
countries is an opt-out system.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.460
Copyright protection, as we've
seen, arises automatically.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.570
If you don't want a copyright
in one of your works,

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:16.790
you have to act affirmatively to give
it up, and it's not easy to do so.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.300
Graphically, this difference
can be characterized as follows.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.830
This, as you now know, is
the original 1909 system.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.990
By contrast, this is
how things work today.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.820
As soon as you create a work-- more
specifically, as soon as you fix it

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.810
in a tangible medium of expression--
federal copyright protection

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.450
automatically arises.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.360
You don't need to wait
until publication.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.270
And protection lasts not for
20 years or even 56 years,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.990
but for your lifetime plus
an additional 70 years.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.940
Somewhere along this timeline,
you or your heirs or devisees

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.500
may publish the work.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.530
And as we'll see, publication
has some important legal effects,

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.790
particularly if it's a work for hire.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.740
But publication does not alter
the existence of the copyright.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.260
When the term expires, the work will,
as usual, fall into the public domain.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.250
But that won't be until
long after you're dead.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.310
Before then, it's possible
to give up your copyright

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.700
by dedicating to to the public domain.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.770
But that, as I say, is hard and rare.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.740
The result, as I've
indicated previously,

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.970
is that billions of creative
works throughout the world

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.680
are now subject to copyright protection.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.730
But the absence of an
effective registration system

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.400
often makes it difficult to locate
the owners of those copyrights

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.280
and thus to obtain
permission to make otherwise

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.920
proscribed uses of those works.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.840
The result is needless
impediments to cumulative

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.380
or derivative artistic progress.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.820
 

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.320
What might be done to alleviate
this problem, without, of course,

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.210
corroding the rights of
the artists and authors who

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.650
do want and depend upon copyright?

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.540
There at least three possibilities.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.730
First, and most radically, we might
repudiate the provision of the Berne

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.520
Convention that forbids making
compliance with formalities a condition

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.150
of acquiring or exercising copyrights
and then, country by country,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.970
reinstate systems of formalities.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.860
That might well be socially
desirable, but it's very unlikely.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.200
Second, we might increase the
incentives for voluntarily complying

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.520
with formalities, in particular
for registering one's copyrights.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.380
As I've said, there already exists
some incentives for registration.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.890
For example, registered copyrights
enjoy a modest presumption of validity.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.600
And as we've seen in the United
States, statutory damages

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.010
are not available when unregistered
copyrights are infringed.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.550
But we might amplify the
benefits of registration,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.920
perhaps by further
increasing the remedies

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.000
available to the owners
of registered works.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.700
Alternatively, we might make a failure
to register more costly, perhaps

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.310
by expanding the set of
exceptions and limitations

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.840
applicable to unregistered works.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.890
But in so doing, we'd need to be
mindful of the constraints imposed

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.390
by the so-called three-step
test contained in the Berne

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.080
Convention and the TRIPS Agreement,
which I discussed in the first lecture.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.040
 

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.390
The third of the three
possible responses

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.880
would be to provide a mechanism that
makes it easier for authors and artists

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.580
to donate some or all
of their entitlements

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.870
to the public-- to make, in other words,
a credible and enforceable announcement

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.460
to the world that they will retain
and exercise only some of the rights

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.360
that the copyright system
automatically confers upon them.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.060
That's basically the idea
behind Creative Commons,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.340
the brainchild of Larry Lessig.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.570
Creative Commons makes
available to copyright owners

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:12.580
a set of standardized licenses that
they can grant to the public at large

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.630
by attaching appropriate notices
to copies of their creations.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.810
As we saw in the King case,
attaching a copyright notice

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:25.890
to copies of one's work
was once essential,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.860
if one wanted copyright protection.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.880
The Creative Commons
notices do the opposite.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.800
They signal to the world that
the copyright owner wishes

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:41.680
to give up some or all of the rights
he or she acquires automatically.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.010
The following short video
from Creative Commons

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.719
itself shows how these notices work.

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:56.870
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.330
When you share your creativity,
you're enabling people anywhere

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.710
to use it, learn from it,
and be inspired by it.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.550
Take the teacher, who shapes
young minds with work and wisdom

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.220
from around the globe; and the
artist, who breeds beauty out

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.590
of bits and pieces she finds online;
and the writer, whose stories use

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.030
ideas and images crafted by
people he's never even met.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.720
These people know that when
you share your creative wealth,

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.070
you can accomplish great things.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.630
They and millions of other
people all around the planet

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.530
are working together to build a
richer, better, more vibrant culture,

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.120
using Creative Commons.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.950
To understand Creative Commons,
you need to know a little bit

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.260
about how copyright works.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.050
Did you know that when you
create something, anything

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:53.030
from a photograph to a song to
a drawing to a film to a story,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:57.370
you automatically own and all rights
reserved copyright to that creativity.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.310
It's true.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:03.090
Copyright protects your creativity
against uses you don't consent to.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.560
But sometimes full
copyright is to restrictive.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.690
What about when you want all those
millions and millions of people

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.830
out there to use your work without the
hassle of coming to you for permission?

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.310
What if you want your
work to be freely shared,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.640
reused, and built upon
by the rest of the world?

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.290
Luckily, there's an
answer-- Creative Commons.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.470
We provide free copyright licenses
you can use to tell people exactly

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.845
which parts of your copyright
you're happy to give to the public.

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:31.610
It's easy.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.980
It only takes a minute.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.710
And it's totally free.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.510
Just come on our website and
answer a few quick questions

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.290
like-- will you allow
commercial uses of your work?

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.900
And will you allow your
work to be modified?

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.220
Based on your answers,
we'll give you a license

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.030
that clearly communicates what people
can and can't do with your creativity.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.490
You don't give up your copyright.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.110
You refine it, so it
works better for you.

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.710
Welcome to a new world
where collaboration rules.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.780
It didn't even exist
just a few years ago.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.630
But now there are millions
and millions of songs,

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:10.100
pictures, videos, and written
works available to share, reuse,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.940
and remix, all for free.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.500
Want to work together?

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.320
Then join the commons--
Creative Commons.

[MUSIC PLAYING] [END PLAYBACK]

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.350
If you're persuaded by this video and
follow the narrator's instructions

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:57.760
to go to the Creative
Commons website, you

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.410
will find there six
main licensing options

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.870
which give you and other authors
of a variety of sets of rights

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:08.960
that you and they may decide
to retain or surrender.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.370
In addition to the six
licenses listed on your screen,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.500
Creative Commons makes
available to copyright owners

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.630
a standardized notice
known as CC0, that they

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.730
can employ to give up all of their
rights-- in other words, as I've said,

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.980
to donate their works
to the public domain.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.510
An important footnote-- as you
know by now, in some countries,

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.780
authors enjoy some non-waivable
moral rights, in other words,

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.390
entitlements that they cannot give up.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.060
In those countries, use
of the CC0 label may not

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.860
be fully effective or
at least not permanent.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.890
That troubling possibility
has not yet been tested.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.830
But this label, CC0, provides authors
an easy way to give up as many rights

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.560
as they can.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.450
In terms of our schematic
characterization of the copyright

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.910
system, here's what CC0 enables.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.880
The current regime, as you'll
recall, works like this.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.470
CC makes it easier for
copyright owners to opt out

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:16.135
of some more or all of their
rights, in other words, to do this.

00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:21.130
 

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:25.850
That advantage of Creative Commons,
as compared to the other two

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:29.700
ways of tempering the unfortunate
side effects of our current lack

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.060
of formalities, is that
it in no way undermines

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.062
the right of copyright owners who
want to retain all of their rights.

00:33:37.062 --> 00:33:41.940
It is this optional feature that
prompted Jack Valenti, the former head

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.070
of the Motion Picture
Association of America

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:49.094
and a staunch defender of copyright,
to endorse Creative Commons.

00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:50.010
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.830
I'm glad to be here via this video.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.650
I wish I could be there in person.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:00.010
But I wanted to say just few words
about Larry Lessig's concept of Creative

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.400
Commons.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.800
I'm attracted to it for
the following reasons.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.210
First, Larry makes it clear
that he is respectful of

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:17.429
and supports copyright-- copyrighted
material that artists create.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.130
And he believes it
ought to be protected.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.650
But he also says, and
I agree, that there

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.520
are those people who have
copyrighted material who

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.230
may want to give up part of
their copyright or all of it,

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.790
to put on the Creative Commons and
let other people view it or hear it

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:33.850
or whatever.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.580
And I have no problem with that.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.360
I think that's part of the free
and society in this country,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.790
that if you want other
people to have your material

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:47.210
you have created free of charge
with your permission, wonderful.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:54.230
And I find that to be a
salutary kind of thing.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.180
But I think it's also important,
as Larry staunchly believes,

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.680
that those people who have
copyrighted material-- whether it

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.960
be in a book or a television
program or home video

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:11.990
or music or movie or computer software--
and who want it protected, so that they

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.790
can make sure that it can move
through the various venues

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.690
where that material is
brought to the public

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:23.640
and given to consumers at fair and
reasonable prices. [END PLAYBACK]

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.410
The disadvantage of Creative Commons is
that the majority of copyright owners

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:33.430
do not and will not use it, either
because they were unaware of it,

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:38.530
don't understand it, or simply
don't want to give up any rights.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.040
Creative Commons thus
mitigates the troubling impact

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:47.470
of our lack of formalities, but
certainly doesn't eliminate them.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.120
What else might we do
without sacrificing

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.820
the clear benefits of
our current regime?

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.900
I'll leave that to your
imagination and deliberation.
