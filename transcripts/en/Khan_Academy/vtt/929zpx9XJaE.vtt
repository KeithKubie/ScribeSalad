00:00:00.663 --> 00:00:02.399
- [Instructor] We are
told a red disc spins

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.892
with angular velocity omega,
and a point on the edge

00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:08.032
moves at velocity V.

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:09.805
So they're giving us angular velocity

00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:12.944
and also you could view
this as linear velocity,

00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.619
and they are both vectors,
that's why they are bolded.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.361
A blue disc spins with
angular velocity two omega,

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.619
so that's twice the angular velocity,

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.830
so its angle is changing twice as fast,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.937
with a point on the edge
moving at velocity 2V,

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:33.115
so the linear velocity is also twice,

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:35.994
twice the linear velocity of the red disc.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.324
And they ask us which
disc has a larger radius.

00:00:39.324 --> 00:00:41.668
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that

00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:44.458
before we work through it together.

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:48.107
So let's first, let's
just visualize things.

00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:51.699
So if this is our red disc, my
best shot at drawing a disc,

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:52.847
this should be a perfect circle,

00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:55.286
but I can't hand-draw a perfect circle,

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:56.758
but you get the idea.

00:00:56.758 --> 00:01:00.506
And let me draw the
radius of our red disc,

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.089
right over there, I'll
call that R sub red,

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:06.880
and we know a few things.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.363
We know that a point right
over here has a velocity V,

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:13.131
so let me draw that.

00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.824
So let's say it's going
right in that direction,

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:19.324
right at that moment, it has a velocity V,

00:01:21.487 --> 00:01:26.051
and we also know that it has
an angular velocity of omega.

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:29.884
So our angular velocity
is omega in this case,

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:34.044
in terms of how fast it is rotating,

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:36.280
and then we have our blue disc.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.865
So let me draw the blue
disc, and I'm gonna draw it

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.816
at an arbitrary radius,
'cause we haven't figured out

00:01:40.816 --> 00:01:44.934
how the radii relate
to each other just yet.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:47.814
This is, should be a
circle, but I'm trying

00:01:47.814 --> 00:01:49.431
to hand-draw it, alright.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.388
So this is the radius of the blue disc,

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:56.971
so I will call that R
sub blue, R sub blue,

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:02.017
and the velocity of an analogous point

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:04.297
right over here is 2V.

00:02:04.297 --> 00:02:07.333
So I should make that
vector twice as tall.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.045
So this is 2V right over here,

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:13.712
and it has an angular
velocity of two omega,

00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:19.467
so that tells us how fast
it is actually rotating.

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:21.555
So how do we make the statement,

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:23.391
which disc has a larger radius?

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:25.180
Or how do we decide that?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.060
Well the key realization
is the relationship

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.430
between the magnitude of angular velocity

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.286
and the magnitude of velocity.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.896
A couple ways to think about it is,

00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:37.818
the magnitude of angular velocity,

00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:39.736
notice I didn't put an arrow
on top, so I'm just talking

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:42.170
about the magnitude of
our angular velocity,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.404
times our radius is going to be equal to

00:02:45.404 --> 00:02:47.759
the magnitude of our velocity,

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.476
or is going to be equal to our speed.

00:02:49.476 --> 00:02:50.983
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.034
if you divide both sides by R,

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:55.069
the magnitude of our angular velocity

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.435
is going to be equal to the
magnitude of our velocity,

00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.929
or our speed, over R.

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:04.185
Or we can say that R
is equal to the speed,

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.617
magnitude of velocity, over the magnitude

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:09.347
of our angular velocity.

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:11.450
So in this situation right over here,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.283
for this red disc, we
could say that R sub red

00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:20.061
is equal to V over omega, and over here,

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.816
we could say that R sub blue is equal to,

00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:30.277
well the magnitude of the velocity,

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:34.649
the speed is going to
be 2V over the magnitude

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:38.859
of our angular velocity,
is going to be two omega.

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.785
Well notice, the twos cancel out,

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:44.833
so this is just going to
be V over omega again.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.881
These two things are identical.

00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.336
That is equal to that.

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:53.612
So they are actually going to
have the exact same radius.

00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:55.945
So they are the same radius.
