00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:11.760
(Speaking German)

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.700
That means that a given number is the sum of two primes.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.880
I hold it for a completely certain result.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.600
Looking aside from the fact that I can't, myself, prove it.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.880
So we're talking about Goldbach's Conjecture. One of the real old chestnuts of mathematics.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.300
Christian Goldbach was born in 1690 in  KÃ¶nigsberg, now part of Russia.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.380
And he was a fairly serious mathematician.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.200
But his great moment of fame came in a correspondence with Leonard Euler,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.700
who was really one of the great mathematicians of all time.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.860
And in a letter that he wrote to Euler,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.120
on the seventh of June in 1742.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.740
In that letter, Goldbach proposed this conjecture,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.180
which got sort of ironed out after a few rounds.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.900
But it is a famous conjecture now which says

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.060
that every even integer is the sum of two prime numbers.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.640
Why even integers?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.020
Well prime numbers are mostly odd numbers

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.300
and if you add two odd numbers you always get an even number

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.100
Let's make a picture that shows how this happens.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.340
I'm gonna write two lines, which both have the primes on them.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.080
3. And let's see, 4 is not a prime

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.040
5 is a prime, 6 is not a prime.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.560
7 is a prime. 8, 9, 10, are not primes,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.180
11 is a prime

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.360
Let's put a 2 in just to please Brady.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.080
Because two is a prime. Why should we discriminate against two?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.280
So here, I'll put two on the other side as well.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.180
2 is a prime. 3 is a prime. 4 is still not a prime.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.140
5 and we could go on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.120
So this is an infinite game. And now let's draw lines that connect the sides.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.660
So I'm gonna try my best to draw a line parallel

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.540
to the lines I've drawn.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.320
And now let's look at where these lines intersect

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.640
and write down the sums of the two primes that are coming

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760
So here's four, which is 2+2.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.640
3+2 is 5.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.280
Well, that's not even but we'll put it down anyway just for the sake of having something there.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.420
And of course we have 7 and 9. Now 3+3 is the first interesting one.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.820
Here's 6. And let's see what else do we have...

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.200
We have 5+3 is 8

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.560
And 7+3 is 10

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.140
And 11+3 is 14. That's a bit of a skip. I might be worried about that one

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.680
And 13+3 is 16

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.260
You mean because we've skipped 12?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.880
We skipped 12? Did we get a 12? Well yes of course we do. We get 5+7.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.260
Here's 12 and here's 7+5

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.360
This is a symmetric picture so it's not too surprising we get the same thing both ways.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.560
7 and 7 we saw one 14 before. This is a really different 14.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.960
We had 3+11 or 7+7.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.540
Uh, what's this one? 11 and 5

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.440
Another 16. Here's 5+11 another 16.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.560
And then here's 5+13 is 18. And 7+11 another 18. A really different 18.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.480
I have 13+7=20.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.160
Here's 11 and 11: 22. And as you can see as it goes

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.320
down I sort of fill things out. Now what

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.250
you don't see from this picture so well

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.500
is that actually as the numbers get big

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.020
there are really a lot of ways of

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.670
writing the numbers as the sum of two

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.520
primes. And in fact you can estimate how

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.940
many in a very crude, simple-minded way,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.800
and it turns out to be that you're

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.750
really pretty close for big numbers. So

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.630
let's do a little calculation. One

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.430
of the most famous theorems in number

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.920
theory is the prime number theorem and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.620
it says that the density of the primes

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.489
around n, so the chance of a number near n

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.610
being prime, is n divided by the natural

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.160
logarithm of n. That's the prime number

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.990
theorem. I'm not going to try to prove it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.240
or justify it, but it's true. So using

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
that, we can estimate the number of ways

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.660
to write a given number n, or 2n let's say,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.630
as the sum of two primes. Let's

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.759
use a different number, 2m. So how many

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.419
ways can you write 2 times m, that's an

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.000
even number, as p plus q where p and q

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.990
are prime?

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.789
That seems pretty mysterious. They just,

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.770
if you don't know anything about it, but

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.400
it's easy to analyze. So if you write

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.860
2m as the sum of p plus q, then one of

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.919
p and q had better be bigger than m,

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.599
bigger than or equal, and the other one

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.300
will be less than or equal to m.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.800
If we look at a particular number that's a

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.440
little bigger than m, between m and 2m, its

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.229
chance of being prime is 1 over the log.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.990
Now logarithm doesn't change very fast.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.409
It's a very slowly growing function. So we can

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.289
estimate it as being the log of m. So if

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.650
I write, if I write 2m as a plus b,

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.650
where a is bigger than or equal to m and

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.930
b is less than or equal to m, then

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.110
the chance of a being prime is about 1

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.990
over the log of m. So the chance the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.120
probability that a will just by accident

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.870
be prime is about equal to 1 over the

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.479
log of m. Okay. And that's the same for

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.669
the chance of b being prime. It's about 1

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.159
over log of m. So the chance of both of

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.009
them being prime at the same time is one over

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.530
the log of m squared. Well, that's a

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.289
bit of a fib. It would be 1 over log m

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.570
squared if they were independent events,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.210
but it's not quite independent. We'll

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.620
talk about that in a minute.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.710
How many chances do we get? To compute

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.169
this probability we had to choose an a

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.310
between m and 2m, so there are m choices.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.169
Number of ways to write 2m as p plus

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.159
q is about equal to m divided by the log

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.889
of m squared. m is a whole lot bigger

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.110
than the log of m. Think of base 10.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.750
Think m is a million and the log of m is

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.690
6. So you know, this is like a million

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.839
over 36 and if it's a billion or a 10 to

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:47.930
the 12th let's say, then m would be 10 to

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.469
the 12th and this would be 12. So 10 to

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.289
the 12th over 144 in other words this is

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.469
this is pretty close to m actually. So

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.199
it's an enormously large number. So for

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.880
any given large number there are gonna

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.860
be lots of ways of writing it as a

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.699
sum of two primes.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.500
Somebody I was talking to said maybe

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.779
that's why it's so hard to prove. If there

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.360
were a unique way, then maybe you could

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.400
just find it. You could figure out the

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.589
formula for it. But if they're just any

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:18.139
old ways, almost everything works, then

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:19.969
how are you going to find that needle in

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.219
a haystack? Or the haystack around the

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:24.199
needle, rather? This is very heuristic,

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:25.820
right? We didn't prove anything in this

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.099
little discussion. We just made a guess,

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.380
but it turns out to be a very good guess

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.110
and there people who have tabulated these

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.719
things. There's something called Goldbach's

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:37.610
Comet. For each number m you show

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.560
the number of ways of writing it as the

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.380
sum of two primes. And it grows just as you

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.089
would expect, like this. You see this

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.159
wonderful picture. There's some variation

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:48.020
of course, some numbers have lots of ways,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.779
some a few. But even the ones with the

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.480
fewest ways, the number seems to grow pretty steadily.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.860
Brady: "Do you ever get a

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.960
"really really big even number that has

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.840
"like only one way? Or is there always lots of..."

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.680
No one has ever found such a thing, I think. It really

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.490
just keeps growing. I don't know if there's

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.650
any lower bound known or guessed.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.930
So it remained unproven all this time.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.090
People have proven other things, people

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.070
have made other conjectures around it.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.590
For example, Harold Helfgott finally

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.650
in 2013 managed to prove that every odd

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.900
number is the sum of three primes, and

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.210
that actually implies that every even

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.729
number bigger than something is the sum

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.160
of four primes. So, you know, that's

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.589
something. And Hardy and Littlewood,

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:35.650
famous famous number theorists, decided

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.150
that it was too bad to leave out the odd

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.750
numbers, so sum of three primes, that's all

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.969
very well. But let's make it more special.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:45.580
How about the sum of a prime and twice a

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.950
prime? So the sum of three primes would

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.080
take two of them to be equal. So they

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.870
conjected that that was true. Nobody can

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.940
prove that either, but all these things

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.510
seem very likely to be true. My friends

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.980
who are analytical number theorists would

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.890
die to prove Goldbach's conjecture. It

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.170
really is, would be a great prize, a great

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.940
coup. You know the professionals are

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.190
shy about them. If I talk to you

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.010
about Goldbach, you might think I'm actually working on it. You might think I'm

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.640
nuts. But, because nobody really has a

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.430
clue how to attack it, I think. But

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.150
nevertheless, people do work on it and

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.560
sometimes in their closets, sometimes in

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.130
their attics. I'm sure lots of my friends

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.140
would love to prove it, so secretly. I

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.800
swear I've never worked on Goldbach's Conjecture, honest to God.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.980
22, 24, 22, 23 it's a lot

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.720
of information. And then one more thing,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.270
one more thing to you we can learn from

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.330
this, a prime number formula: the nth

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.880
prime twiddles, or is approximately n

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.100
lots of...
