How are you?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,650
Um, I am in Warsaw, Poland and
I actually have a special guest,

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,940
my only friend here,
the only person I really know in Poland.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,500
Mr. Paul Versey.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,510
Paul, how are you? Thanks
for having me here.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,520
Um, excellent. Maybe I'll do it like this.

10
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,820
I'll just sit there and I'll try to move
this cause I don't have the equipment

11
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:37,800
that I need. Um, Paul, um,
since we last spoke. Yeah.

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,140
Well it's been a long time since
you've been on the podcast,

13
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:44,210
but this week we've been to Germany,
Estonia,

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,590
Latvia,
hungry

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,580
in Poland. Yeah. And uh,
it's been a great time.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,840
Hands Down Budapest and down Budapest,
hands down Buda, Buda and pest.

17
00:00:56,841 --> 00:01:00,200
Last night Budapest was, Budapest
was, they were all great,

18
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:04,630
but Budapest was so good.
Last night I was on stage and I,

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,330
and I had that thought in my head like,
dude, I think I take a special here.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,100
That was what? That felt like
a hot American crowd. Yeah.

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,490
It didn't matter where you like, it
didn't matter. We were in Hungary,

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:19,060
they were ready. It was great. Lot
for was the best tackles. Lot fee.

23
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,500
I enjoyed Lafayette. I the
one, the one, uh, you know,

24
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,720
there was a couple of
times in a lot for you.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,430
You felt alone up there
with dude Astonia well,

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
10 minutes before I go on
stage and granted I'm going,
obviously I'm going cold.

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,330
The only thing I got is Kenny going,
we have a space.

28
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,080
You're really gonna love 'em clumps,
soda. Kenny shout out to him.

29
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,650
He brings me up and uh,

30
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,200
10 minutes before I go
up, the guy goes, yes,

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,310
stand ups only been here for eight years.
It got introduced in 2010.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
And I was like, that's a little unnerving
to hear before you go out there.

33
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,030
But like, you know, they were dressed
up really nice to theater was beautiful.

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,840
Yeah. And uh, you go into something and
it was just, it's like you said, man,

35
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,170
those Baltic states,
it was fucking in a little bit.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,670
This is a little bit something
like differently. They're very,

37
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,910
very fucking smart and logical.

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,900
Astonia was like the best look and crowd.
They were like dressed so nicely.

39
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:11,620
I felt like a, I felt like out of
place. It's theater was too nice

40
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,960
for what we were saying. Um, but Munich,

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,700
it was also like Budapest
by the unit picked Munich

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,770
in Budapest where uh,

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,850
we're four fuck and Munich was with
three 30 show and they were all hot,

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,910
crowded but all of them have been a great,

45
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,020
but like those were the two cities that
you didn't have to even think that you

46
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,830
were over somewhere. But like, so anyways,

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,330
I've been on the road when now for like
a week and I'm a moody son of a bitch so

48
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,530
I know I'm driving them nuts.
But uh,

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,350
you know it's funny is to your way
of talking like I was just joking.

50
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,430
Like what did you just say? Like
volume it up. Volume up. Yeah.

51
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,380
You said volume it up like
I was trying to, yeah,

52
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,550
figured out cause of recording seemed
like you just have your own way of

53
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,550
speaking and I have to try to figure
out what the fuck you talking about.

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm like, this, this is coming to, it's
too quiet in a corner. You're just going,

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,150
well, you know, just, just
volume it up. Well, volume it.
You mean turn up the volume?

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,440
Uh, oh no, no. You just, uh, oh they
did, they had bread before you came in.

57
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,740
You did they, I mean, just they, they,
what'd you say? Wipe it down with Windex.

58
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,710
Windex that

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,520
now imagine if they want. Yeah. Well, you
know, the thing is to me and my mother,

60
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:21,320
I got this from my mother. My mother
always says, um, like turn the lights.

61
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,710
Uh, like we don't say turn the lights
on and off. We say a cut the lights. No,

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,990
not cut the lights. What is
it? Uh, AH, fuck. I forgot.

63
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,420
I have another thing in my wife goes,
I'd never heard that turned the lights up.

64
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,310
Now turn the lights off. You don't even
know this. Your language is so crazy.

65
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,020
You don't even know what you saying.
Yeah.

66
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,760
I don't say turn the lights
the way that other people do

67
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,720
funny as shit today. So we're, we'll
leave in Budapest. Oh, this is great.

68
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,240
And we've been taking these
small propeller planes and shit,

69
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,210
cause you know there's short
little flights here and uh,

70
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:51,961
so it's one of those deals.

71
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:55,650
You go to the gate and then you get on
a bus and then you'd take the bus out to

72
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,470
the propeller plane and there,
you know what I like about them?

73
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,320
They don't give a fuck. You
bag doesn't fit. They're like,

74
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,580
I just shove it under the seats.

75
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,100
They get on the seat next to you that
it's not like this fucking post nine 11.

76
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,260
You know,
why are you being hostile?

77
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,930
Get your bag off the fucking plane
the way they are in the states.

78
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,780
So I get on the thing,

79
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,140
the bus versus he got on the
bus first and I said hey.

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,930
And he had a weird looking face. What's
up? He said, dude, you just missed it.

81
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,560
This guy just asked me to sit next to him.
Like some total like gay shit.

82
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,480
Like he like pat the seat next to him.

83
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,370
I saw Paul and he pat on the seat
or whatever. Right. So I am like,

84
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,860
really? I go, oh, maybe it's like
a European thing or whatever.

85
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:34,810
But I didn't think it was weird cause the
bus was so big and there was all these

86
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,420
seat, there was all these seats. Yeah.

87
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,040
So then later versus he's looking at
the guy and he's laughing at him going,

88
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,490
dude, look at his little hat.
His hat doesn't fit his head.

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,250
And I'm just looking over it.
And I knew it wasn't Jewish.

90
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,500
I knew it was something religious.
It turned out was like a Muslim.

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,960
It was definitely bigger than a Yamaka.
Yeah. It's bigger than a Yamaka.

92
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,870
So it was like, it was the Muslim at
right. And then we finally realized,

93
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:58,620
I'm looking at the guy and he looks
just like [inaudible]. And I'd go,

94
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:02,520
wait a minute, this guy's probably
Muslim. Thought you were Muslim.

95
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,240
He's in fucking Budapest and he wanted
to hang with you. And then he ends up,

96
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,190
and then was funny, he's, he's,

97
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:11,940
he was freaking you out and you'll see it
was like 10 [inaudible] and Kenny goes,

98
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,440
watch, he'll probably have 10, eight
and then the fucking guy, dad gets on,

99
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,090
he's at 10,
eight and then he goes out to you.

100
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,150
Yeah. Are you Arabic? But the
ones that, so bill was right,

101
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:26,630
but the one thing you left out in
the story is when I did get on alone,

102
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,130
when he said, uh, I, you know, like
I'm a free people that don't know me.

103
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,610
I'm kind of like, even you said, I get a
little too nice with my small talk. Like,

104
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,740
oh, so it snowed here. I
like the obvious shit, dude.

105
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,900
You talk to that kid with the sneakers
that went on forever. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,

106
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,420
I can just talk to a stranger. My
grandfather was like that, right?

107
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:49,280
So I look at this guy, I smile and
he smiles back overly like too much.

108
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,110
And then he goes,

109
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,600
he said something I didn't understand
and then he patted the seat next to him

110
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:56,780
and looked at me like, hey, I
have this seat waiting for you.

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,290
And made me like a little weird because
it was all empty, right? So I'm going,

112
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:04,790
Oh shit, maybe this guy. So,
but bill says, dude, he goes,
he may think you're Muslim.

113
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,940
So sure enough, like he said, like
he said, the guy comes next to me,

114
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,160
couldn't have been sweeter. I go, sorry
about the bed. No problem, no problem.

115
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,360
And then he leans over and I'm just going
fuck and oh go fuck your bill is right.

116
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,440
Let not let him, it's bad that you are
right. But he goes, are you a Arabic?

117
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,280
And I go and I go, what? Cause I
didn't, he goes, Arabic, you Arabic.

118
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,890
And he like pointed to my face
and I go, no. And he goes,

119
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:30,560
you look at her beck and I go,
mother fucker. Ville was right.

120
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,740
Literally wanted me to sit with them.
He thought I was Muslim. How fuck.

121
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,160
And I didn't want gay. You thought
he was a gay guy with a little hat.

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,900
That's the funniest shit ever.

123
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,030
Oh my God dude.

124
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,180
All right.

125
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,990
I want to talk to you because this is
something that is gradually going into

126
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,561
your act,

127
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:54,240
which I think is going to make you stand
out and it's going to be your voice and

128
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:58,290
it is your, uh, your ideas of luxury,

129
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,390
your ideas of leisure,
amenities, amenities. You
have your big into amenities.

130
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,210
Like if there's a mint on your pillow,
when you come back,

131
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,930
you feel like that means
something. It does. And this is

132
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,380
why I love working with you.
Not only that, we're friends.

133
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:16,050
You got class never in a back to school.

134
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,650
[inaudible] you've got classes
because I rubbed off from you buzzing.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,550
The guy that read in his college dorm,
remember he made the college dorm,

136
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,840
he knocked down walls. No, but you go,
you like your five star. You know, you're,

137
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,440
I wouldn't say you got five, you've
got a cunt about it, but you like,

138
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,440
you like Nice Shit. You know,
I love, I love listening.

139
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,210
I stayed in a bunch of, yeah,
super eights in motel six is yeah,

140
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:43,610
but I don't, I don't stay at the,
the fucking Ritz Carlton Penthouse.

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,910
No, but I like working with you too
because you just like, you know,

142
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:51,860
certain things and I liked that. But
uh, yes. So I love the little things.

143
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:56,730
I love to slippers. I loved it. I
loved the chocolate. Now I love the,

144
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,830
I love the joy that you get out of it.
It's just so fucking funny.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,240
I don't know why, why those little things
mean something. Cause those slippers to,

146
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,320
if you've got those slippers
for Christmas, you'd be like,

147
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,890
it's my wife cheating on me. Yeah.
These things are so fucking cheap there.

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,310
They never fit your feet. But
you know, you come in like, dude,

149
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,640
you just see the robe. Yeah, I know.
Oh my God. I don't know why bill,

150
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,970
they had chocolates. Yeah, you
would think that I was raised.

151
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,090
You would think that I was raised
in the streets. I don't know.

152
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,900
I don't know what it is. You sitting
there. We were on the airplane going like,

153
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,780
Dude, you know, we should start an
airline first of all, like the cost,

154
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,330
like billions of dollars.
And he goes,

155
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,070
we'd call it luxury air and I
immediately go, I wouldn't fly that.

156
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,020
You're like, why you wouldn't fly? I guess

157
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,600
too on the nose is trying too hard.

158
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,660
I feel like I'd go in there and
they'd be like, you know, like a,

159
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,580
like a faucet that was like gold,

160
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,150
but it wasn't real gold but it
was golden color. Like look good.

161
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,950
The luxury imitation rum. Yeah.
Yeah. All of that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,020
Um,
so we were trying to come up,

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,700
but you would fly an airline that
had 25 all first class seats,

164
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,970
leather skull beds. All right. This,

165
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,310
this is what we were talking about
right when I was like that there's a

166
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:12,180
difference between, uh, like classy

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,370
Gaudy.

168
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,930
There's refined and then this showing
up and there's just certain people,

169
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,460
I don't know if either one
is right or whatever. I got,

170
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,770
if I look at like a Ferrari,

171
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,020
a guy my age can drive a Ferrari
and not look like an asshole.

172
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,760
You keep yourself in shape and you
can tell it. This guy is, he's into,

173
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,490
he's into like, he knows how to
work on cars. He worked his way up.

174
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,700
I'm not talking about some fucking jerk
off, you know, pinky ring type of thing.

175
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,800
But like a Lamborghini, a Lamborghini
is a young man's car. That's for like,

176
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,840
you're in your 20s,
you're shirtless,

177
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,940
you've got like a cheetah on like
a fucking leash. Like, like I,

178
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:54,941
I feel like the Lamborghini is
obnoxious where the Ferrari is the shit,

179
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,400
right?
Like they,

180
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,550
like if they were people like the
Lamborghini would be walking around and

181
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,310
talking about how much money
had had where the fucking,

182
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,250
the Ferrari guy would be like,
chill. See, here's the thing.

183
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,590
My Greek side is the class here,

184
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,060
but my Sicilian kind
of goes in and is like,

185
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,020
and we have that battle.
But most of those cars are Italian.

186
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,780
That was made by Italians though.
So, no, I know, but that's why. See,

187
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:21,870
I like the chain. I love the gold
chain. It's like, pardon me, I love it.

188
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,430
But when you got to kill chain,

189
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,770
you literally said that the
gold chain completed yet. Yes.

190
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,140
You and Yan is love that yon is
almost cried when I said that. Yeah,

191
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,630
the gold changes did something,
but I can't go pinky ring.

192
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,990
That's where I draw the line. So I think
that that's the Greek where it's like,

193
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,100
now you can't wear my father hundred
percent full blooded Italian,

194
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,680
the whole thing. He just goes, he's
like into the Jew. He goes, he goes,

195
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,160
where'd you go? Second chain. I would
go second chain if it complimented this,

196
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,330
the right. So that, that, that's the
high water mark. That chain. Uh, yeah.

197
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,450
I mean I would go one more.
No, no, no, no. But I'm saying,
but the other one would,

198
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,980
would, would compliment it. You wouldn't,

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,080
you wouldn't then now maybe even like a
little thinner than this around it would

200
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,510
compliment it. That's it. Okay.
Just an accent. An accent.

201
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,650
You'd look good in the chain.
Now I really want to get a chain now.

202
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:13,980
I think I got a thin rope. It would
look good on you. A thin one. Yeah.

203
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,410
But then I would start looking
like something that I'm not,

204
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,860
which I'm not something you ever
wear a chain with a cross ever.

205
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,660
I grew up in the 80s.
Of course I did.

206
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:26,040
I had the a but I wanted the smooth
one around and my mother got me the one

207
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,731
that's like that,

208
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:31,170
which wasn't in style than the other one
was the total Guido fucking the flat,

209
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:36,060
the rope. I had to be like, what are you
at? Oh, you got this? Yeah. Okay. So,

210
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,050
um, yeah, no, I think this,

211
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,390
there's a certain thing
about if you have a chain,

212
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:46,210
there's a certain level as shit you're
going to talk. There's a certain level of,

213
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:50,210
of, you know, there's something, you know,
you can go out and get. I would wear it,

214
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,500
something like that if I was
playing a character in a movie.

215
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,020
But like I know I'm not a chain guy.
No.

216
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,980
Are you a leather jacket that you're
wearing a nice leather? Uh, yeah.

217
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,390
I like what Jack was like. Uh, but
I wouldn't get a motorcycle one.

218
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,860
I get one that was like really
like top leather leather,

219
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,180
but it was like a, it was, I'm
wearing it because it's less.

220
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,570
It's cold outside. Yeah,
you're not alive. Yeah.

221
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,610
I'm not trying to wear it to be
like, oh, look at my leather coat.

222
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:23,590
I can't pull it off, dude. I'm,
I'm a fucking pasty northern
European guy. You know?

223
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:27,010
I didn't grow up in Southie when Southie
was Southie. I wasn't like one of these,

224
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,900
you know? I mean, I basically,

225
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,470
I didn't care about fighting somebody
else until I got to junior high and

226
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:36,400
everybody else grew and I didn't grow
and then kids really could fucking fight.

227
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,160
Once I started seeing people getting
their teeth knocked out, nose is broken.

228
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,280
I was just like, alright.
You know, I mean, I don't,

229
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:45,580
I don't want to go into this world.
I'm too fucking slow. You know,

230
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,380
I have the anger to do this, but I'm going
to lose. And you don't read Ed's dude,

231
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,710
you barely touch us. We look like
we fucking fell off a motorcycle.

232
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,670
We just bruise so easily. Were you ever
a, are you, you're not a sneaker guy.

233
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,600
You're not a, you're not, were you ever
like, uh, I liked sneakers when I was,

234
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:04,300
when I was a kid and I do
like some old school ones,

235
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:09,301
but I got to admit that subset of
American culture where you know,

236
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,410
you're in your forties,

237
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:15,010
you're in your 50s and your still dressing
like it's the first day of school at

238
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:15,844
the bus stop.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,830
We have like the brand like I
receive made me like respect Jordans.

240
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,030
I like them in that type of shit.

241
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:27,031
But it is hilarious to me that we've
worked some of the greatest theaters in

242
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:32,340
America and you walk out with a pair
of sneakers on and like, you know,

243
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,030
Shane out and shit like that.
And to you that's like dressing up.

244
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,810
But where I'm from like, um, oh,
uh, what's his face? Nate Cordrey.

245
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,130
I worked with him on
a, on a fucking uh, uh,

246
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,690
the heat and we would joke
in about Boston. We were
shooting there and he said,

247
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:52,790
he goes, dude, it's like
totally acceptable in Boston,

248
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,810
Massachusetts to show up to a holiday
party wearing like a Tom Brady Jersey.

249
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,470
Like people be like, oh, you got the
away one. Oh, that's cool. I like that.

250
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,240
It's got the Superbowl patch on it.

251
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:08,010
So I came from more like a sports culture
like that, but um, there is something,

252
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,340
uh, I think, and it's also, I think
it's because of being in this business,

253
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,120
which has so much shit about your age,
you know, you gotta you know, you,

254
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,460
you've got to always try to look
younger. You got to do all this shit. Oh,

255
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,000
he's fucking women bench like that.
That doesn't happen to guys too.

256
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
You know what I mean?
Like if you go bald,

257
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,620
that doesn't affect the
fucking parts you get off for.

258
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,140
So I as usual,

259
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,850
my cunty way rather than giving into that
and getting the hair plugs and fucking

260
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:37,290
trying to, you know, get, you
know, do whatever. I steer into my,

261
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,030
I keep myself looking good,

262
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,240
but it's just like I'm willing to lose
whatever I'm going to lose to not come

263
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,370
out the other side with
the fucking ant leg,

264
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:52,100
Caterpillar hairs coming up at the top
of my head and fucking know face yanked

265
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,840
back and shit. And I'll tell
you what's fucked up, dude.

266
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,650
It's been in this business long enough.
You know,

267
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,320
you're going to see it right now at 40.
Yeah. I mean switch. You're going to see,

268
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,393
as you're going to say,

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,550
you're going to see the first few
people that you start out with go crazy.

270
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,780
Someone's going to go legit crazy.
Uh, someone's going to quit.

271
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,110
It's weird when they quoted forties a
fucked up one for people where they just,

272
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,890
cause people start panicking.
If they don't have something going on,

273
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,970
they're going like,

274
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,970
this is my last port hole to get out
of this shit and actually have a legit

275
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,970
career because I have this 20 year gap
now in my fucking resume that I went out

276
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:26,210
and I,

277
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,740
I told jokes and shit and then you'll
see the other people that just doubled

278
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,970
down. They got nothing going on and
then they start getting a little botox.

279
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,620
Uh,
you know,

280
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,890
best shoe Polish is going into the fuck
and they start throwing hail Mary's.

281
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,870
Yeah, no, it's not a
heron Belzy at this point,

282
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:45,810
but there's definitely the throwing the
hook and ladder is definitely a halfback

283
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,030
option. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,480
All of a sudden they think of the rating
bags thrown in the back, the fake punt,

285
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,560
the fake plants coming out right on this,
this, this time. So it's scary, man.

286
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,590
The thing that thing is, and when I
was, I might say we were talking about,

287
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,680
but we would, you know the business
thing that I was talking to you about,

288
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,580
how you carry yourself in
this fucking business, right,

289
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,210
is there's that thing where you got
to want it, but you can't chase it.

290
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,670
You have to really believe in
what it is that you're doing.

291
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:15,360
And in stick to that with this weird thing
where you have to be flexible if, if,

292
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,570
if, if what you're doing isn't
working, but if you, you know,

293
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,500
if you're not hurting anybody,

294
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,960
you're not being malicious and you really
have this fucking thing that you want

295
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,900
to do, you have to stay on that
thing. And when people tell you, no,

296
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,560
you don't take it personal,
but then you don't keep chasing them.

297
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,660
When they say no to you,
you keep doing your thing,

298
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,510
you keep fucking killing and all of a
sudden they start hearing about you.

299
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,860
Then they come to you and then it's
everything that they said before is water

300
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,720
under the bridge and
you have to let it go.

301
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,880
You can't ever do that a mother fucker.

302
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,770
You fucking said no to me back in 96
because they're not going to remember it

303
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,971
now and it's not,

304
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:50,720
and you're just going to come off and look
like a fucking insecure asshole. Yeah.

305
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,330
I remember what you said
to me like five years ago.

306
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,540
I had just moved into the
house upstate and I go, uh,

307
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,440
I remember I wanted to get the tonight
show. I wanted to get something. Uh Huh.

308
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,370
And uh,

309
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,240
and you go, why the fuck are
you auditioning for that gun?

310
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,740
Like they're going to hear about you and
then they're going to want you and I'm

311
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,960
lit. I literally thought when
I got off the phone, I'm like,

312
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,690
not thinking you're delusional. You've
been in the business longer than me,

313
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:14,470
but I'm going like bills 10 years ahead
of me. Like what's he talking about?

314
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:18,370
It's easy for him to say, right. You know,
he's not an angry way, but just like he,

315
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,890
I'm trying to get something
like he's there, you know,

316
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,690
I'm trying to get something and then like,
sure enough,

317
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:27,580
like last year I did this monster set
at Gotham and the booker of the tonight

318
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,340
show and he was just like a hey dude,
guy. Oh yeah, just send me like whatever.

319
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,240
And you know, obviously I want to work
on it. This year and time went by,

320
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:37,750
I was working on this special, so I, it
didn't happen the way I want it to yet,

321
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:39,610
but he just goes, yeah, send me so well,

322
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,640
and it was just weird how he did kind
of say, I don't even need a tape.

323
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,920
Well just let me know. Send a
transcript. Like, like tell me.

324
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,580
And I was literally like, Oh my God,
that does happen. Yeah, but don't do it.

325
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,100
I chased it. I, you know,

326
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,660
I chased it right up til about 2001,
2002 when that's when I said fuck this.

327
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:58,290
But I did the whole thing when it
was like, whatever the look was,

328
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,060
I tried to have the look,
you know,

329
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,710
the fucking goatee on as I got old
standup clips and everybody had a goatee.

330
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,210
So I grew up fucking goatee.
I had like a, you know,

331
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,550
it's funny now because now people will
look at those things and they'll make

332
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,900
comments like they figured it out,
which is one of the things that I like,

333
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,160
like literally people listening right now.

334
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:18,990
You guys are ruining so much shit
that you could fucking, you know,

335
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,831
I don't know.
I,

336
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:23,160
I saw there was something on Twitter
today was like check it all these cool

337
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:27,180
clips of people hanging out in Hollywood
and all these fucking amazing parties

338
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:32,070
and shit. Uh, that no longer happened
cause social media ruined it. And,

339
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,950
and it's just like,
and I know everybody all boohoo they,

340
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,730
they can't fucking hang out with their
fucking infinity pools. It's just like,

341
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,590
dude,
I haven't,

342
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,290
when I came in the business like that's
all you wanted to hear all those stories

343
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,690
about so and so going
to the playboy mansion,

344
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,920
all these crazy fucking parties and
all of that type of shit. And the,

345
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:52,740
the thing was was they were fun and now
everybody's sitting there acting like

346
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,830
every fucking party.
There was some sort of like,

347
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,800
I don't know what me too thing that
happened and everybody just had their

348
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,520
fucking dick out and shit. And
it's just like, it's just this,

349
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,630
it was a total fucking overcorrection
now and I'm to tell you something right

350
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:11,110
now there that people are going
to run from this shit. The way,

351
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,170
remember that if the AllSeen for awhile
they were acting like the all scene was

352
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,800
going to bury like comedy clubs and
then that just ended up fizzling out.

353
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,330
Now how many clubs are thriving,

354
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,850
thriving and now all those dudes a slither
in back into the comedy clubs, right?

355
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,160
And it's just like all of that shit.
But they,

356
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,930
any sort of like extreme thing like that,

357
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:34,200
it can't sustain itself. It just
eventually what happens is it's not a,

358
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,720
it goes away tears. Well, it levels
out. Yeah. Because right now,

359
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,960
like the behavior that was wrong is
going to be reported from here on out.

360
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,790
But now that just go in like that,
like that junk that I do on my act,

361
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,190
it's like now what if
somebody did something or not?

362
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,540
Somebody has to get in trouble.

363
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,560
Like they have to throw a body on the
fire every four to six weeks just to keep

364
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:56,200
it in the news. Yeah.
Which I have a theory.

365
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,080
I think what's going to happen is I
think with the whole me too thing and

366
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:02,920
everything, I think what's gonna make
it die down. And I could be wrong,

367
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:06,910
but I think things are going
to start coming out about
females did stuff. Uh, no,

368
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,053
that, that, that's,

369
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,270
that's a fucking pipe dream because
shit has and nothing happens to them.

370
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,150
It's just, well, you daddy actually,
you know what the Nick Cannon, yeah.

371
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:18,060
That nick cannon think they're all
good. Why are you being so petty, nick?

372
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,510
It still was the guy's fault. Where
if somebody fucking did that to a guy,

373
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,890
if those are all guys,

374
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,190
nick cows looking out for his friend
and he just peaced some if he just said,

375
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,821
hey man,

376
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,920
if I don't want to do this cause I don't
want to get the people that he said in

377
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:29,161
trouble.

378
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,540
Of course all of their tweets that I
read were clearly them joking around.

379
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,600
They're all jokes that are all just
the point is it's all jumped though.

380
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,400
Like Kevin Hart's did is he was joking
was 10 years ago it was in his standup

381
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,640
back and these are comedians.

382
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,290
Yeah and they're acting like they heard
him say this at like at a party with no

383
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,230
setup and punch it.

384
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,330
I don't want to keep bringing this up
because I don't want to come to keep

385
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,670
mulching that over cause I'm sure
he wants to fucking move on from it.

386
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,790
But it is like this. No, it's just this,

387
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,600
this fucking thing that where everybody's
go to a, they get a lot of this talk.

388
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,380
They get that fucking Guy John Legend
Shit. Because when he took a pit,

389
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,740
because he wrote music for that Dude's
movie and it's like w what is supposed to

390
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,430
be standing in his shower to be
knowing what the fuck he's doing. Yeah.

391
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,230
Like you don't know what somebody's done.

392
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,460
If you went to their party and years
earlier, you don't know. Yeah, I Paul,

393
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,020
it's might as well as I know you.
I don't know what you do. Well,

394
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,550
I mean I call you, we call each
other enough to bitch. I know,

395
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,930
but you start like you don't know, recall.
Wait, what point would you ever call me?

396
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,870
I to say a pill.
You wouldn't believe in this man.

397
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,360
One time I took my deck out
and I was blocking this door.

398
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,200
You would never tell me that. So,
but the thing is is I never did that.

399
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,010
But that's what I'm saying. I
shouldn't have said you, but whatever.

400
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,830
But if you knew somebody like that,
then it'd be like,

401
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,420
how could you have been
friends with this guy?

402
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,880
It's like he had fucking
tell me that shit. Yeah. Yes.

403
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,240
People who are friends with people at
work and the finds out there like a

404
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,690
fucking serial killer. How could
you take a picture with this guy?

405
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,580
He had already merged in 40 people.
It's like,

406
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,950
well he wasn't bringing that up when
we were fucking hang around the water

407
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,090
cooler,
you know,

408
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,900
to man like I feel like a lot of these
head coaches we were talking about before,

409
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,520
like you got 53 man roster,

410
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,720
you love him and one of
them does something and then
they're like this piece of

411
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,900
shit new. And it's like, you
know, it's taller they had,

412
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,380
that becomes that that'd be becomes at.

413
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,930
And then all of a sudden it's like
this program is corrupt and everything.

414
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:14,500
Like everybody knew and
everybody, everybody knew.
And it's like everybody knows,

415
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,030
dude, I remember, I'm not gonna say names,

416
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:19,900
but one comic got in trouble and this
guy tried to suggest that the entire

417
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:22,660
comedy club all got together
and protected this guy.

418
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,430
And I almost did a spit take. It's like
the second that guy got in trouble,

419
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,590
all anybody underneath him was thinking
is great. Now I can get his spots. I mean,

420
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,424
they just don't,

421
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,010
and it's always people who aren't
in the fucking business is just,

422
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:40,840
they don't understand how
fucking cutthroat this
business business is fucked.

423
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,020
It's all actually,
it's no,

424
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,490
it's no different than I imagine if
you were in the oil industry, you know,

425
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:47,110
if you're on Wall Street,
just all of it,

426
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:51,370
when you're going for something that
in the end, at least back in the day,

427
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,550
you're going to have a yacht dude
and is going to be models on it.

428
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,940
Like your fantasy when you're in your
20s, like the shit that people are, uh,

429
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,200
are willing to do.
Dude,

430
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:04,060
I remember after I did my second
show ever in New York City,

431
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,770
I crushed and I walked off and I literally
was like, dude, I'm going to be like,

432
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,030
I'm going to be, he started
thinking, you're like, oh my God.

433
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,010
Cause you're like nobody could do,

434
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,620
you don't realize that there's
other people out there. You know,

435
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,930
when you first started doing it like
this, I'm going to be a fucking, you know,

436
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,800
your business. The first thing everybody
thinks is I'm going to win an Oscar.

437
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm gonna, I'm going to have a fucking
special and all that type of shit.

438
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:25,740
And then once,
what I,

439
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,980
what I liked about this business of
in the last 10 years is I've actually

440
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,720
figured out where I want to be in it.

441
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,550
So any of that shit I would love to
still happen or whatever. But like,

442
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,920
it's just like if I could just traveling,

443
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,840
but I'm wearing fucking Warsaw right now.

444
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,720
Like I just looked out there
and I'm looking at this shit,

445
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,890
I can't fucking believe I'm here.

446
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,280
I can already tell this is going to be
like Budapest where I remember we were

447
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:51,670
walking around Budapest yesterday as a
pot. I was just, I liked this place, man.

448
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,040
These people are fucking cool.
And I got that vibe from the,

449
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,540
the dude who drove us over here,

450
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,520
he was funny.

451
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,590
He was the oldest of five minutes Donia
when I saw the guy and he was like,

452
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,700
oh dude, dude. And I was like,
this might not go this. Yeah.

453
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,460
And then when I got to Budapest and that
woman was like, Oh, here. And she said,

454
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,960
my mother in law and if your
throat hurts, take this. And,

455
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,860
and all of a sudden I said, oh it's going
to be great. I got the same vibe here.

456
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,970
How funny did that, I still like a Kia
motors building at a fort night poster,

457
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:20,360
which made me think of my son. I'm going
to going to be great here, you know.

458
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,980
But I will tell you this bill,

459
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,010
I noticed this and I told you we were on
a train from Munich to Frankfurt and I

460
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,730
just started watching people, you
know, and people are the same.

461
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:35,510
Like I saw this 80 year old woman and
they gave little candies out in the thing

462
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,470
and she took whatever her daughter or
whoever did it and I saw her get her purse

463
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,690
and open up personally.
My grandmother used to do with cookies.

464
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,070
My grandmother was like,

465
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,650
I dunno if it was from when she grew up
cause she came here and my grandmother

466
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,900
came to the United States,
10 years old from Sicily,

467
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,040
didn't speak a lick of English or like
would like go to a park and learn English

468
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:56,420
that way. At 10 years old. Oh my God.
She was, she came at 10 years old.

469
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,640
A rest her soul.
She died.

470
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,330
I think she died at 80 80 in her
mid eighties so she'd probably,

471
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,760
I need a year.
I'm trying to do the math.

472
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,880
They thrown out shit when she tried
to do the year when she did, she,

473
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,410
I'll do it for you. If she passed, I
believe in o nine oh nine eight days.

474
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:17,360
So that's like 1929 she probably
came in the twenties 29 no wait,

475
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:17,720
no.

476
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Is that 29 was that 1919 told us
that (394) 095-0960 nine yeah,

477
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,920
it'd be 1919 right. So she got here,
let's say 1920 New York City depression,

478
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,200
10 years old.
Never spoke a lick of English.

479
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,290
And then she did this thing where like
when we would go out, she would go, hey,

480
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,260
if they take those cookies and I'd
be like, grandma, I don't need,

481
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,000
she would literally take
two cookies that were,

482
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,620
that wrapped them and Napkins
and put her in bed. Still.

483
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,230
Just that depression era shit.

484
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,940
So I saw this German woman do it and then
I saw like the little kids and I sold

485
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,250
little girls from Germany on their
phone. Like it's all the same shit. Yeah.

486
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,440
You know,

487
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,500
I'll talk about a fight with my wife and
then even the journey [inaudible] they

488
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:55,334
get it.

489
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,510
Everybody's the same human beings that
that's what this trip has shown me is

490
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:04,490
that human beings are really all the same
in a way, which is now your bad ones.

491
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,020
If like this, this will change
how you then view foreign policy.

492
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,980
And when this, when they're sitting
there, you know, trying to make,

493
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,850
I still want the wall. I don't want those
town halls gum kit. It's no, but no,

494
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,360
but uh, I yeah, it makes you think like,

495
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,730
well you know, do we know, but there's
shit where they sit there and they,

496
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,490
oh you know what I like your idea of,

497
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,680
of say the Middle East and stuff
like that. It just changes your life.

498
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,190
Cause there's that grandmother there.
There's the version of there,

499
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,024
there's the me there,

500
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,110
and then what you have is the lunatics
at the top and they just get everybody

501
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,590
all fucking stirred up beneath them
that these fucking people are gonna come

502
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:40,850
over here and they're going to do this.

503
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,700
They're going to do that and all of
this shit. So I don't know. You know,

504
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,130
it's fucking

505
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,650
hilarious about that. That whole
fucking Trump thing with the wall is,

506
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,920
I didn't realize this. They're already
really, basically there's a wall there.

507
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,880
There's some areas where to get an area.
He's trying to get the area,

508
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,850
the south that doesn't have as much,
which they're saying is doing stuff,

509
00:26:56,851 --> 00:27:00,630
but he doubled down so much on it
that that's why he's not, it's like,

510
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,261
well this is the thing,

511
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,860
like I don't think either side's going
to back down because the Democrats can't

512
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:07,530
back down and he's just
getting up and walking out.

513
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,130
A guy that prideful that tweets late at
night and celebrities that don't matter,

514
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,040
calls single comedians' names out
as the president nodded states,

515
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,790
that guy that said we're getting the wall
done and doubled down and promised his

516
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:22,180
thing. He can't. Yeah, I can't
tell if he's like, uh, not yet.

517
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,220
Stay here and know if it's insecurity.
Like I'm not a psychologist,

518
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,450
but however he is made up, um, is,

519
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,240
is he is,
he isn't going to back down.

520
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,920
I love that tweet that you show share
demands. We'll just say share what?

521
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,220
Oh yeah, I saw, what was
the word that they used all
these headlines on the phone.

522
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,330
Um,
shared demands,

523
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,820
shared demands that Polosi don't die on
this hill tops to shut down and don't

524
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:52,970
die. The share demands it shared
amongst your demands. It yeah, the pups.

525
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,450
The sinner. Yeah. The, the,

526
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,460
the demands it well shared demands that
this politician doesn't listen to this

527
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:05,510
reality TV star that is now president.
Like that's where the fuck were at. Bill.

528
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:07,970
Do you know how funny that headline is?
Shared demands.

529
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:08,901
Well,

530
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:11,990
what's funny is transplant presence is
so fucking long that you forget that this

531
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:16,760
is the guy from the apprentice.
Yeah, yeah. It's, yeah,

532
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,030
it's bad. You know, I just liked it.

533
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,380
Now people are finally being able to kind
of question financially what the fuck

534
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:28,910
we're doing over in Iraq because that is
the big fucking thing. And that is not,

535
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,810
that is not liberal or conservative.
That is just black and white dude.

536
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:37,100
Where it's just like, how the fuck
yeah. Like do your kids' kids' kids.

537
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,040
I'm still gonna be paying
that fucking tab. Do you know,

538
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,480
and I think that they should
fucking investigate those
corporations that is made

539
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,280
zillions of dollars off of this.

540
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,730
I think of the ones that are prolonging
whatever the fuck it is we're still

541
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:54,500
doing there. Um, I dunno. I mean, I
don't know enough about it, but I,

542
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:57,020
I do. I do know how to
balance a fucking checkbook.

543
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,610
And I do see money coming in versus
money going out assets and liabilities.

544
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,020
And there is, there is no other
fucking business where you wouldn't,

545
00:29:06,021 --> 00:29:07,970
you wouldn't right now
just be completely fucked.

546
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,700
That's another funny fucking thing
about him wanting to build this wall.

547
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,710
It's like with what? Money? Yeah.

548
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,301
Cause they're gonna be on as well.

549
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:16,240
That's going to create jobs
and blah blah blah. Yeah,

550
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:20,080
but then you still have to pay for the
fucking wall. Yeah. And He fucked up man.

551
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:24,640
He fucked up dude by saying Mexico is
going to pay for it and now American tax

552
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,370
payers are going to pay for
it. It's fucked up. But uh,

553
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,100
talking about money let we did.
Yeah,

554
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,010
because nobody's going to remember that.

555
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,340
And all people do is like getting people
who are for Trump to admit that this,

556
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,740
this financially does it
make sense or whatever.

557
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,570
We don't have the money or
whatever the fuck it is.

558
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:48,571
It's literally trying to get somebody
who's like a die hard whatever fan to

559
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:52,760
admit that that bullshit call that went
your way was actually a bullshit call.

560
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,210
Like I would say like last,
not this past season,

561
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,540
the season before when that Steeler
clear clearly caught the ball against the

562
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:01,960
patriots, clearly caught a fucking
touchdown and they called it back.

563
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,240
Now the amount of patriots fans,

564
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:07,720
I'll throw my own friends under
the bus or be amount of them.

565
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,660
That would have to be there.
They would all do.

566
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,510
Clearly he didn't make a football
movie rule is the rule. Yeah. Hey,

567
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,160
they would say that, but
it's just like, you know,

568
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,700
I'm one of those guys all the way along.
The line was saying the Tuck rule is,

569
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,020
it's a stupid rule.

570
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,680
I understand that they wanted to
have clarification or whatever,

571
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,590
but it's just at the end of the
day it's like, dude, he had it.

572
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,950
The guy slapped it out of his fucking
hands and fell on it. It's a fumble.

573
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:33,400
The fucking game is over. The top group.
I remember Tom Brady being like, hey man,

574
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,530
it's the fucking tucked role.
It's just like whatever,

575
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,320
but like trying to get people politically.

576
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,080
Now you see kids to look at
people like trying to get,

577
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:46,081
like most of my friends are liberals
trying to get them to see things about the

578
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,410
Clintons or the Obama's or whatever. They
just think, oh, but they did the best.

579
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,080
They'll say they're not as bad
as Bush than not as bad as Trump.

580
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:57,550
It's just like they always just steer
it into this fucking argument where it's

581
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,241
just like,
you know,

582
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:01,630
if this guy's really a man of the
people and he's really such a great guy,

583
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,560
why are his first two speaking engagements
with two of the biggest fucking banks

584
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,950
out there when all of these people are
upside down in their houses because of

585
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,200
these fucking cons?
Because at the end of the day,

586
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,880
they're getting paid by the same guys.

587
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:15,610
They got their faces in the fucking
pig trough and this is too big for this

588
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:17,470
podcast.
I don't know why we're talking about this.

589
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:20,080
Maybe at a talking about spending money.
Let's talk about spending money.

590
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:23,470
You can balance a budget. I mean you can
bounce that. Fuck. You want to know what?

591
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,970
I'm not good at it. Now I'm getting
better. I'm getting told me again.

592
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,600
Paul told me cause his special did so well
and now he's selling tickets. He goes,

593
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:34,780
Bill, I'm not going to lie to
you. I'm going to go through.

594
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,430
I'm going to go through a fur coat
phase. I wouldn't, I wouldn't do that.

595
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,670
I actually think that that's too much.
I do think of [inaudible].

596
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,880
It's a little ridiculous. I do.
I don't know. I you liked them.

597
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,950
You liked when will that fighter came in?
When he goes,

598
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:50,650
it's his fucking polar bear. The guy
that he looks like the Burger King Guy.

599
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:54,610
The fucking, he's got the Oh, fast.
What's his name? Irish guy. Yeah.

600
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,370
Notorious Conor. Yeah.
Conor McGregor. Yeah.

601
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,100
He came out with like a white
one and he just started walking,

602
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,190
but he did it like no shirt
chain underneath. Like that guy.

603
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:06,880
That guy's not only one of
the best fighters in the
world. He could be talking,

604
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:11,440
he's up. Maybe take five. He could
be a great standup comedian. So yes.

605
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,760
Yeah. I think kind of regret, but he's
shit talking. I'd put him top five.

606
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,110
He's at wrestler level. I love that
one. One time when he was doing a promo,

607
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,110
don't do promotion. You'll
do fucking know, dude.

608
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,980
My favorite one was
when, when he goes, uh,

609
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,190
this guys tried to give him shit
and he just turns around and goes,

610
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,640
oh the fuck are you?
Who the fuck is this guy?

611
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,000
And even the guys started laughing at me
like, yeah, I know. Nobody knows who I am.

612
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,940
I was trying to get famous
off for you calling.

613
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,580
Had all of them laughing. I remember
Rhonda Rousey was another thing.

614
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:47,450
He was who the fucking, who the fuck
is this guy? I love what he goes,

615
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:51,530
Yo do nothing. And he gets, he gets into
the AH, he's, he's, he's on there man.

616
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,300
He's up there with that level.
But I will tell you this too.

617
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:56,930
I know he was going to,
I told you I heard things from people,

618
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,460
but when he was talking that extra shit,
somebody goes do it. This is rocky three.

619
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,150
When that guy beat him like it
seemed like he what his wall,

620
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,220
cause I feel like right
now what he's trying to do

621
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,850
do constitute those guys are
all pieces of meat. Yeah.

622
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,490
So what he's doing right now
is I think he's realized that.

623
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,190
So he's trying to get on the other
side where it's just like, all right,

624
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:20,840
how the fuck can I get the most amount
of money without getting my brains beaten

625
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,340
? And so he took all that
money to fight like Mayweather.

626
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,340
It's kind of like in the porn industry
where after awhile they're like,

627
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,320
fuck this.
I'm starting my own website.

628
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,250
Yeah. You know, if I'm going to take all
these hits, man, I'm fucking make it.

629
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,840
The money's coming to me.
Right.

630
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:40,800
Probably a fucked up analogy. Can wholly
shots taken all these shots to the face,

631
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:45,780
man, I'm going to fucking stop milk.
Yeah, exactly. That's exactly it.

632
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:48,150
All right. I got to read a couple
of advertising then we're done. Hey,

633
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,000
do you have any, a club dates or anything
that you can, I've got a ton, man.

634
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,510
I've got a ton. I'm going to be February
through July. All kinds of dates.

635
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:55,350
I believe my,
uh,

636
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,190
late February date that helium and
buffalo tickets are on sale now,

637
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,470
but I have a bunch of dates, so
I'll go. What I love about you,

638
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:05,510
what's your website? You know,
[inaudible] right now if you go to the,

639
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,330
it's all done. The website's new
Paul [inaudible] dot com via Arzi.

640
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,800
The show's page has all the dates from
now through a 19 and more are being added.

641
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,650
Yes. And I can tell you that when
we were at Gotham, uh Oh yeah. Uh,

642
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,340
what was it, a month ago or so? Yeah. I
went and I did a show for the Mozillians.

643
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:23,810
I love those guys. And they, uh,

644
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,290
they were nice enough after we did the
Gig in New York the month before they had

645
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:32,270
the after party or the cake boss make the
cake. They just the best guys ever. Um,

646
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,270
Steve and Chris. So I was like, I
am and come back, I'll do a night.

647
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:39,020
So we did at night and you were on stage
in front of me and you didn't know that

648
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:41,480
Seinfeld was coming down? No. Yeah.

649
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:43,550
So we were having him
stretch and Paul's thinking,

650
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:47,420
why do they keep having me do more time
builds in the room and I've watched you

651
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:48,870
do like 35,

652
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,700
35 minutes and you will refund
and you were fucking around.

653
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,560
And I was just like,
wow man,

654
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,990
this guy's like a legit headliner
and I'm telling you dude,

655
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,670
hours are going to come easy.

656
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,160
Much easier for you then then
somebody who like is like a joke.

657
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:04,371
Right?

658
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:08,120
Which is why I love Joe graders cause
it's like like how hard much harder it is

659
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:11,900
for them. But you're like a storyteller.
He will fuck them with the crowd.

660
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,570
I mean I was like a, I was really
like you came into your own dude.

661
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,300
Definitely check Paul out.

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,860
You said Monday might be a little bit late

708
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,060
because our,
unless we a record when we're in Vienna,

709
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,400
but I'll be coming back I
think flying back Monday,

710
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,910

so far ahead. I don't know. All right,

I'll see you.

712
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,370
[inaudible].

713
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,480
Hey,
what's going on?

714
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:09,810
It's built bar and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

715
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,180
January 10th, 2011 how are Ya? Hello?

716
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:18,750
It's me.
Why is that song in my head?

717
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,260
Lionel Richie. Lionel Richie.
There's a good looking fellow.

718
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:29,070
Huh? That was one weird look and son of
a bitch, wasn't it? You know with his,

719
00:39:29,071 --> 00:39:31,620
his Jerry Curl,
he had a Jerry curl,

720
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:34,950
a mullet and an afro all at the same time.

721
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:39,120
Three of a two out of three of
the worst fucking haircuts ever.

722
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,930
I think the Afro was cool if you
were in the Aba. Other than that,

723
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,760
it was probably just another
reason for racist to not get along.

724
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,270
You know, you sit there, you're
trying to be open minded.

725
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,200
You write a fucking sporting event or
maybe at a movie theater and some guy

726
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:59,670
comes walking in with a big
doctor, j Afro, you know,

727
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:03,960
it doesn't have the decency to put that
Frederick Douglass part on the side.

728
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,800
So maybe you could look down as
part and see a little bit of jaws,

729
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:11,190
part two or whatever the fuck was coming
out when people had hair like that and

730
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:16,020
what it creates. Um, animosity.

731
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,030
That's what it is.
Everybody thinks it's that slavery stuff.

732
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,540
They think it's the Holocaust. That's
not what it is. It's the haircuts people.

733
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,210
That's why people don't get along.
You know,

734
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,450
you look at other people's hair cuts cdoa
what kind of people will get hair cuts

735
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:31,980
like that,
you know?

736
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,370
And then there's some little psycho in
the corner with greasy hair and a weird

737
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:39,270
mustache and the shit starts.
That's how it goes down. People,

738
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,580
you might be sitting there
right now going cheap bill.

739
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:45,420
That was really fucking ignorant.
Don't you watch the history channel?

740
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,000
As a matter of fact, I do. I
do watch the history channel.

741
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:54,930
Thank you very much for not asking me and
allowing me to create your question in

742
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,360
my head. I do watch the
history channel and there's,

743
00:40:57,361 --> 00:41:02,070
there's no history left on that channel.
All they show is pawn shop on that.

744
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,200
I don't know what the fuck is on that.
You know,

745
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,090
it's just become like every other channel.

746
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,060
I was reading something today where
they were doing a mini series on the

747
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,810
Kennedys. I, uh, get
shade a bridge and, uh,

748
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,180
am I really going to do a hacky Ted
Kennedy? I think I've got a, yeah, yeah.

749
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:22,800
We went down to the bottom of the
logo, add a, I took a deep breath.

750
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:24,690
I finger fucked her a couple more times,

751
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:29,370
left her in the car and swam to the
surface. Actually the size of my head,

752
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,230
maybe so buoyant. I just sort of floated
unconsciously, your honor. Uh, yeah.

753
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:39,320
So they had a mini series about the,
uh, the Kennedys and they canceled it.

754
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,410
They canceled it yet for some reason.
Uh,

755
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,130
evidently if you have a bunch
of shit in a storage shed,

756
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,490
they want to go down and film it.
Um,

757
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,090
was that a little social commentary?
Is that what I did?

758
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:58,091
Two minutes and 49 seconds
into the podcast that I
really just do some sort of a

759
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,480
, what is the state of the history
channel commentary? I think I did.

760
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,030
Um,
okay.

761
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,350
Well I have an announcement to make and
it's with heavy heart that I have to

762
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:14,240
tell you that my three week
vacation is over, you know,

763
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,730
uh, yeah, it's back to the goddamn grind.

764
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,830
And I know a lot of you right
now going on three weeks, dude,

765
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:22,340
I get fucking two weeks for the year.
Well, you know what? That's your fault.

766
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,570
All right? You picked that career.
It's a free goddamn country.

767
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:30,350
Go write some fucking jokes.
You can't, maybe then you,

768
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,190
you could take a three week
vacation and buy vacation.

769
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,130
What I meant is a,
I didn't have to get on a plane.

770
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:40,640
I didn't have to go to any airports
for three weeks was awesome.

771
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,360
I was actually hanging out with
some people a the other day and uh,

772
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:47,930
they weren't Comedians,
but they traveled a lot.

773
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,670
And we just sat around talking about
different airports and it blew my mind how

774
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:57,590
much I knew about all these airports
and places where you could get something

775
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:01,880
decent to eat and buy decent. Of
course, I mean by airport standards,

776
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,300
you know,
I know whenever I land in Dallas,

777
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,440
I'm going to come down that fucking
escalator for, for my connecting flight.

778
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,710
And there's that awful Mexican
restaurant that's right there.

779
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,920
And every time I go in there because
I'm hungry and I hope against hope that

780
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:22,190
they're going to have the real cheese
and not that cheese whiz. You know,

781
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,170
that cheese come that they put on the
burritos and every time I order a fucking

782
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,060
Burrito I said, hey,
listen to this burrito.

783
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,980
Does it have the real cheese or does
it have that nuclear waste Cheez whiz

784
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:38,360
stuff? And the waitress
never knows. You know,

785
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,970
because who's kidding who?
If you're a waitress at an airport,

786
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:45,680
you don't give a fuck, you know, I don't
know. Let me go in and ask the chef.

787
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,490
Then they go in and they come back.
So what's the verdict there? Uh,

788
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,140
what's a good Texas fucking
named? Taycee. You what's,

789
00:43:56,141 --> 00:44:00,440
what's the verdict there sweetheart?
Is it the, do you have the real cheese?

790
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:06,230
We certainly doubt nodding the head.
You know, mind fucking, you're like,

791
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:10,300
you got to get an, you know, nodding
up north means yes. Down South.

792
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:15,290
It could mean yes or fuck no.
Why? We most certainly do not.

793
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,400
We absolutely doubt,
ah,

794
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,370
with your big fucking

795
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,880
those big fucking Texarkana
for those Oklahoma,

796
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:32,520
that fucking huge white face that,

797
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:36,540
that Hugh Hefner loves.
He loves those girls.

798
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,000
Those big panhandle faces.

799
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,090
Huge fucking heads.
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas,

800
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,300
white girls got the biggest round is
fucking heads I've ever seen in my life.

801
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,130
Jesus fucking Christ. They played
football. You couldn't get in my helmet.

802
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,000
You'd have, you'd have to custom make
helmets for the beautiful bodies,

803
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,890
you know, big Vanilla titties, Huh?

804
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,840
That's right. Big Vanilla titties.
Yeah. Big Medela. Titties ain't got the,

805
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:13,674
you know,

806
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:18,330
the stars at night are big and bright.

807
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,130
Just like my big fucking head,
you know,

808
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:27,210
if I had to slap the shit out of any
woman, I don't, I think I can't. Yeah,

809
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:31,650
I think it'd be what some chick from
fucking Texarkana, Oklahoma, you know,

810
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,030
just get a big 12 ounce
glove, right? Boxing Glove.

811
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,730
Just hit a big fruit card
of a fucking head. Um,

812
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,030
all right. Speaking of which,
I will be in Addison, Texas,

813
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:47,400
now that I've trashed your women,
you're women.

814
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,170
I'm going to be there the last
weekend, uh, in, uh, in January.

815
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,280
So if you get a chance,
you know, you know,

816
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:59,320
you put on your best pair of boots.

817
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,320
Is that what you guys
do out there in Dallas?

818
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:05,770
Why am I shitting on this is the second
week in a row I've shit on people in the,

819
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,840
in the Greater Dallas area. Um, and I,

820
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,820
and I still have the audacity to think
that I'm going to sell tickets down there.

821
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,020
Jesus Christ.
Is this the Chinese Year of arrogance?

822
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:20,740
Because that's what I'm
feeling. Um, anyways,

823
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,970
so two more weeks of no Busan
and I've made my 100 days,

824
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:30,730
100 days.
I think about you in a hundred ways.

825
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,230
What song was that?

826
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,840
Was that a Jane's addiction song or
was that when they were porno for

827
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:40,600
Pyros Pyros Huh? Was that to Haitian Moon?
Is that what I was just singing there?

828
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,630
Who Was it? Bali and
my eyes. Um, I the, uh,

829
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,260
anybody else in the podcast? I'm, I am.

830
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,480
I like the only person
who ever bought that CD.

831
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,480
[inaudible] the second porno for Pyros.
I like Bali.

832
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,470
That song.
Bali.

833
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,240
I don't like the weird high pitch
singing that Perry Farrell does in the

834
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:01,961
beginning of it,

835
00:47:01,961 --> 00:47:05,350
but I really liked the sound of the guitar
just in case you were wondering if it

836
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,370
would just sitting there going,
you know,

837
00:47:06,371 --> 00:47:10,510
I wonder what bill thinks about
that obscure track. What does it,

838
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:15,280
the fucking last song. Second
side. Oh, fucking gives a shit.

839
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,110
All right. What the hell am
I talking about? Okay, let's,

840
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:20,470
let's talk about something in sports
that really fucking bothered me this

841
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,030
weekend. Uh, I was watching the
Bruins Canadians game. Okay. Hey,

842
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:26,350
horrific loss for the Bruins.

843
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,410
We were up to the north and then we let
up to fucking goals and then right in

844
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:30,730
the end and then lost in overtime.

845
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:35,731
But this is what pisses me off
about the fucking Canadians is uh,

846
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,440
the Canadians are sort of like,

847
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,630
they're like Matt Matthew mcconaughey's
character and dazed and confused.

848
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,860
Remember that guy?

849
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,370
The 26 year old guy's still hanging
out in high school where in his fucking

850
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:52,030
Letterman jacket asking where the
parties are. That's what they are like.

851
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,780
They are a stilled the most successful
NHL franchise in the history of hockey,

852
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:04,140
but they have not dominated
the league since pre Gretzky.

853
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,020
We'll talk in 1979 we're talking
Jimmy Carter in office. All right.

854
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,640
We're talking about the AMC Pacer being
a viable option for a car of the future.

855
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,760
Then I just realized
because I drive a Prius,

856
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,760
that I bet if me live my was my age
in 1979, I would have bought it.

857
00:48:23,761 --> 00:48:27,340
I would have bought a pacer.
I really just learned that about myself.

858
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,440
It makes me feel bad. So anyways, um,

859
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,670
just to give you a little bit of history
between the Bruins and the Canadians.

860
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:37,390
The Canadians kick the shit out of the
Bruins for a good 50 fucking years.

861
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,820
All right.
Dominated the league.

862
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,390
We met him in the final seven
times and we never beat him.

863
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,400
And every time we went up to the, to
the Montreal forum, they always be this.

864
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,010
And it was like this Hex, we
just couldn't beat it. Right.

865
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,950
And this is the weirdest jinx in sports

866
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,870
because in 1987,
88,

867
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,630
we finally went up to the Montreal forum.

868
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,220
We finally had a better fucking team,
or a couple of times we had a better team,

869
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:06,911
but we would still lose.

870
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,570
But we finally had a better team
and we fucking paid them. Right?

871
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,970
It's over. The fucking Hex
is over. Oh, thank God.

872
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:18,880
Right. Just for better
measure. Two years later,

873
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,560
we beat them again in the
fucking playoffs, you know,

874
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,330
and then over the next 20 years,

875
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,650
we pretty much went tit for
tat and the playoffs playoffs.

876
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,750
And two years ago,

877
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:37,030
we beat Montreal every fucking
game in the regular season.

878
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,090
And then we swept them in the playoffs,

879
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,680
the final two games in their own building.
Okay.

880
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,780
But for some fucking reason,

881
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:51,580
they still always talk
about this fucking hacks.

882
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:55,120
Like it's still going on.
I, I for the life of me,

883
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:59,860
can somebody hockey fan please fucking
explain it and don't even say it's

884
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:04,861
because the Bruins haven't won a cup
because we did during that 50 year fucking

885
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,350
drought.
We one in 70 and we won in [inaudible] 72

886
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,780
that would be like if the red sox won it
and 70 and 72 when you're still talking

887
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:17,050
about the curse of the babe.
I don't know what this fucking curse is.

888
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,070
Is it because we haven't beaten
him in the finals ever? We can't.

889
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:25,000
They realigned the divisions.
We've played them in the playoffs.

890
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:30,130
We've beaten since 87 we're
pretty much 50 50 against him.

891
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,710
I don't fucking understand.
I understand it.

892
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,600
When Dan Shaughnessy says something
because Dan Shaughnessy like if an old 80

893
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,480
like an 80 year old woman
became a sports writer,

894
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,560
she would be Dan Shaughnessy because Dan
Shaughnessy never talks about the game.

895
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:50,590
Dan Shaughnessy loves ghosts and
Goblins and fucking urban myths.

896
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,730
He's everything about the fucking game.
He will talk about all of it.

897
00:50:55,731 --> 00:51:00,500
Like he doesn't know shit about
hockey. All right? As he asked,

898
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:05,000
actually called for the end of
the winter classic this week,

899
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,740
he said, you know, it's time to retire
the winter classic. This is this.

900
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:10,100
This is what I'm more on this guys.

901
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,720
He talks about how the first fucking
three years were awesome and now we stood

902
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:19,070
next to Bobby. Your arguably the
greatest player of all time, you know,

903
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,020
if not top two, if not top
three, if you're a cunt, you know

904
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,380
the fucking arguing,

905
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:30,590
greatest player of all time stands
next to Dan Shaughnessy when the,

906
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,680
the winter classic was at Fenway
Park and he says to Shaughnessy,

907
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:38,330
this is what real hockey is. This is what
it is. This is it, this is, this is it.

908
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:42,470
And it's, it's, it's most pure form.
This is how we all learned how to play.

909
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,300
All right.
And then this year,

910
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,780
just because you know one year that
you're going to have bad weather,

911
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,990
it was kind of raining out in the ice,
wasn't good.

912
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,440
Shaughnessy says that
they should cancel it.

913
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,940
He's such a fucking retard.
It's like Dan,

914
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,160
those first three years,

915
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,820
that's pond hockey in
the middle of the winter.

916
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:12,440
What you signed Pittsburgh is pond hockey
at the beginning and the end of the

917
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:16,760
pond hockey season. All right. If you
ever fucking played in, in your life,

918
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,743
you dumb ass.

919
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:22,400
The second I saw that
Pittsburgh Washington game and
I saw the ice surface with

920
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:26,930
those puddles, I immediately was taken
back to my youth during the, you know,

921
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:30,320
just to be getting when it was just cold
enough to play hockey or you'll coming

922
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:31,880
into spring and what would you do?

923
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,700
You'd take big rock should throw
them up in the fucking air.

924
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,630
See if they would go through the ice
and then you'd send the fattest fucker.

925
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,650
You've out of all your friends to walk
out on the ice. And if he didn't drown,

926
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,150
game on,
you'd go out there and you would skate.

927
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,730
You know?
And if you started losing,

928
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,580
you try to trip one of your
friends into the big puddle,

929
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,740
so whatever. So anyways, so I
want to know seriously, okay,

930
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,340
now Montreal Canadien fans,
I'm not disrespecting you
guys, you guys, you know,

931
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:05,570
other than the New York Yankees,
uh, you're, you're the most success.

932
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,180
You have the most championships.
All right?

933
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,190
And if I had to rate franchises,

934
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,780
I would say Yankees,
Lakers,

935
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,730
uh,
Canadians and then Celtics.

936
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,200
And I know a lot of Boston fans aren't
gonna like that, but this, this is why,

937
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,100
all right. Yankees cause they got the
most and they've won in every era.

938
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,810
Then I would go,

939
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:36,110
I would say I would go Lakers just because
they've won 10 championships in the

940
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:42,750
last 30 years, that know Canadians
haven't Yankees having, I mean,

941
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:46,350
that's fucking unheard of in
the modern era with free agency.

942
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,700
[inaudible] that's fucking insane. Um,
well, so I guess I would put there,

943
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:55,200
maybe I would say, okay, well I don't know
where to put the Lakers. How about that?

944
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,350
I'll put the Lakers is the best
franchise to the last fucking 30 years,

945
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,870
without a doubt.
Um,

946
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,260
yeah,

947
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,930
and I can't remember what the fuck I said
about the rest of this shit. All right.

948
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,220
But I don't understand like
what exactly has to happen?

949
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:12,790
How many fucking times do the Bruins
have to beat the Canadians in the fucking

950
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:17,410
playoffs? I don't get it. And we've won.

951
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:22,650
We won two Stanley cups during
I, I just, I don't get it.

952
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,870
I absolutely,

953
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:29,060
I do not fucking understand
why every time I watch

954
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:31,290
the Canadians Bruins,

955
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:36,150
they have to bring up something
that ended that fucking ended.

956
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,540
Jesus Christ. Oh, almost a
quarter of, a century ago.

957
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,900
The Canadians have not dominated the
Bruins for any significant amount of time

958
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,410
since, uh, 86 [inaudible] 1986.

959
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,740
I Dunno if I got the Canadian feed.
I have no idea what,

960
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,970
but that is the most overrated
fucking thing I've ever heard.

961
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,630
Overrated fucking thing
I've ever heard at anytime.

962
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,560
The Canadians when like they did, came
back and won there. There'll be like,

963
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:10,070
you see, you see and, but they'll,

964
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,110
they'll ignore the fact that we swept
them for a whole year and in the playoffs,

965
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,220
the final two games in their
own fucking building. You know,

966
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:24,780
how come the Red Sox, how come their
thing ended? I don't, I don't get it.

967
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,270
Whether that w shouldn't,
shouldn't that,

968
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:28,820
that thing of continued the whole
fucking thing doesn't make sense.

969
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,510
It's just this classic a
thing as a Boston sports fan,

970
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:36,890
which I'm so fucking sick of,
is I can't stand, first of all,

971
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,990
I don't believe in curses.

972
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,950
That whole Dan Shaughnessy old fucking
lady thing where it's such a pussy way of

973
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:48,320
looking things where you literally
take your hand off the wheel,

974
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,550
you have no control of your destiny
because there's a god damn Gremlin under

975
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:56,210
your bed. It's like, isn't
it really that aside?

976
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:59,750
In fact that Montreal was a tremendous
fucking franchise back in the day.

977
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,240
All right?
As tremendous as they were,

978
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,590
the Bruins were horrific,
wasn't it? That, uh, you know,

979
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:13,591
Harry Sinden didn't embrace free agency
and he resented fucking resented the

980
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:18,190
fact that players were now in control.

981
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,580
Any absolutely categorically
fucking refused to pay top
dollar whether they were

982
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,720
worth it or not.
It wasn't.

983
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:30,610
That wasn't that more likely than that.

984
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:34,480
There was some sort of fucking ghosts
floating around a fucking hockey arena.

985
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:38,320
I don't know. I don't know. So whatever.
So for the 900 fucking year in a row,

986
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,000
I got to watch a Bruins Canadians game.

987
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:44,320
And despite the fact that the Montreal
Canadians are not a factor in the NHL

988
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,300
anymore, they're in first place
now. But you know what I mean,

989
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:51,410
that they're not an elite
franchise anymore. They just not,

990
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,060
and they haven't been. Okay. They haven't
won a fucking cup since 93. It's over.

991
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:01,360
It's over. Okay. It's fucking over.

992
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:09,390
I mean, I, I don't, I don't
know. I mean, it's a Celtics
fan. I, I admit that it did.

993
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,620
It's over it, it died when Len
bias died with Len bias died.

994
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,330
It was fucking over and it hasn't come
back just because we want one sense then.

995
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:21,660
It hasn't come. It's fucking
over, you know, speaking of which,

996
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:24,120
I've actually started to watch a lot
of hoop and I gotta tell you something.

997
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,860
When the fucking Boston Celtics,

998
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:30,840
I've never seen so many
goddamn ace bandages and knee
pads and my entire fucking

999
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:35,260
life, I think they have the oldest
legs in the NFL and the NBA,

1000
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,320
every one of them is taped from
the ankles up to their hips.

1001
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,740
I don't think that I have, I really just
don't see them winning it this year.

1002
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:46,720
I don't, I think that, uh, I
think Miami Heat's going to do it.

1003
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,330
I actually think they're going to
do it. They're, they're, they're,

1004
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,970
they're much younger.
The fucking,

1005
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:55,270
everybody's dressed like Marcus
Haynes on the Goddamn Celtics.

1006
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,290
Now he has an old reference for you.
Huh? Markus Hanes. Look it up. People,

1007
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,540
he was a, the, the, the magical
fucking the guy on the globe trotters

1008
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:06,990
[inaudible]

1009
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,420
right.
And each slide around on the floor.

1010
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,260
You know what black people bitch about
fucking Hollywood in that type of shit.

1011
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:17,060
Don't we do the white
people, you know, for the,

1012
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,100
the stereotypes and the awful roles,

1013
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,600
which they've been given for
decades in Hollywood, you know,

1014
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:28,810
to white people get any sort of credit
for being on the Washington generals and

1015
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:30,740
just being absolute stooges.

1016
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,740
You know what I mean? Just
going out there, paid to lose,

1017
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,490
paid to fall for the same fucking
trick every goddamn night.

1018
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:46,270
Just looking like absolute fucking
buffoons. Do we get any sort of a credit?

1019
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,520
Can Can Spike Lee make a tragic film
about white people who had played in the

1020
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:54,760
Washington generals? Anybody? Can anybody
back when that back me on that one?

1021
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:58,990
Back me up. People. What's the deal? Um,

1022
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:04,330
how far did this fucking podcast
am I 20 God damn minutes. Alright,

1023
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,290
so what is there to talk about you guys?
Uh,

1024
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,440
what do you guys want to talk about?

1025
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,900
I sound like a headliner right now who
is run out of jokes and he's done an

1026
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,520
hours worth of material in 20 minutes.

1027
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:19,510
So now he's just going to try
to fucking play with the crowd,

1028
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,300
which I can't do because not here.
So why don't we read this, uh,

1029
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:28,250
this email under the provocative
name corporate bullshit. Uh,

1030
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:28,780
Bill,
uh,

1031
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:33,780
dear bill recently I had to
return some items at the mall.

1032
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,970
Uh, it was the day after Christmas and
I was with a girl. I was dating, uh,

1033
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:41,150
with the girl that I was dating.
She wants to return some shoes.

1034
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,990
So we went to the journey store
where the shoes were bought.

1035
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,920
Uh, when she got to the
counter to return the shoes,

1036
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:53,060
the girl behind the counter asked
her for her name, address, email,

1037
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:56,360
and phone number.
Oh my God.

1038
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,090
The amount of fucking people who
actually give out that information.

1039
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,710
My girlfriend just gave the information
over. As soon as the girl asked for it,

1040
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,520
we were leaving the store.
I remarked that I thought it was bullshit,

1041
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,550
that she had to give away personal
information to return a pair of shoes.

1042
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,440
She said, uh, it was not a big
deal, but I didn't like it.

1043
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,310
All right.

1044
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,780
Why the fuck would you give somebody all
in information and just in case you're

1045
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:23,900
new to my podcast,
just say you can say no,

1046
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,300
can I, you know I, I go out
to buy shit all time. Can I
have your phone number? No.

1047
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,443
Yeah.

1048
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,660
I don't even say I don't
even try and make it nice.

1049
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:38,160
I just say no and then they
go, oh, okay. You know,

1050
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,180
why do you feel like you've got
to give them their information?

1051
01:00:40,181 --> 01:00:43,180
You're trying to buy something.
I'm sorry I can't,

1052
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,220
I can't sell you this unless
I get your information.

1053
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:50,170
Well then go fuck yourself or buy it
somewhere else. I don't even need it.

1054
01:00:50,171 --> 01:00:54,520
Anyways. So anyways, he goes,
next we go to American Eagle.

1055
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,860
You guys hit all the hotspot,
Huh? Then we went to Cinnabon.

1056
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,310
Next we went to American Eagle where I
had to return his shirt. That was a gift.

1057
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,070
There was a long line for returns.

1058
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,090
Watch your return the shirt and did it
not fit or was it ugly as hell or was it

1059
01:01:10,091 --> 01:01:12,130
both?
As I was waiting in line,

1060
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:15,670
one of the employees comes up to me
with a clipboard with the little form to

1061
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:19,660
fill out. Now is anybody else kind
of getting the prison camp vibe here?

1062
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,213
You know,

1063
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,930
they're standing in line to get processed
and there's a guy coming up onto the

1064
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:30,160
VAT. Is Your name please? Your phone
number? Uh, I stopped the employer.

1065
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:30,850
Uh,

1066
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:35,850
I stopped the employee and asked her
why she needed this information and she

1067
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:40,780
says that it was to verify my purchase.
How fucking dumb are people?

1068
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,130
You're going to verify my purchase. Well,
here's the sales slips there, sweetheart.

1069
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,130
This verifies it.
That's it.

1070
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,890
I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you and your clipboard?

1071
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,070
Why don't you hold that clipboard between
your little fucking beef curtains and

1072
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:59,460
take a fucking walk down the street? How
about that? Hi Sweetheart. There it is.

1073
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:03,050
The reasons you use that type of
language. Go Fuck Yourself. Oh,

1074
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,690
how about I fucking grab that ponytail
and just, no, let's, let's, let's, let's,

1075
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,520
let's keep it clean this week,
shall we? People. Anyway, she,

1076
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,740
he goes before I could protest further.

1077
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,710
She said that I could
just put my name on it.

1078
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,020
Oh,
on

1079
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,420
the clipboard.
Yeah.

1080
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,990
When she walked away, I pulled out the
gift receipt Ppas said to my girlfriend,

1081
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,110
oh, here it is. Yeah. This is what
verifies my purchase. Exactly.

1082
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,330
The clipboard employee wasn't as
far as way as I thought she was in.

1083
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:37,300
Heard me say,
did I read that wrong?

1084
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:39,790
Get hurt me say it's heard me say this.

1085
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:44,350
And she began to explain further why
I needed to give over the information.

1086
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:48,730
This is the part of the email I hate.
He goes, I apologized and told her.

1087
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:52,960
I realized it wasn't her and that it was
just a company's policy that she was in

1088
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,050
forcing. She walked
away again. I felt bad.

1089
01:02:56,051 --> 01:02:58,240
So the next time I saw
her I apologized and said,

1090
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,730
I realized that she was just
doing her job, but she ignored me.

1091
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:04,210
She was probably pissed because it was
the day after Christmas and I was causing

1092
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:08,680
her grief. But you could at least
accept my apology. You Bitch. Um,

1093
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,700
I love how you go from being
totally liberal and seeing
somebody fucking side of

1094
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:16,510
it too, being yeah, man
up, you can't. Um, anyway,

1095
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:19,900
I got up to the counter and there
wasn't any further problems.

1096
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:23,320
The guy at the register just took my
name and didn't ask me for anything.

1097
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:26,590
I felt as though I had a small
victory against the big corporations.

1098
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:30,520
Then this week I had to go back to the
store to return a hat my girlfriend got.

1099
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,200
Did you guys not make Christmas
lists or all your relatives blind?

1100
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:38,290
The seems to be a lot of,
uh, returning of gifts.

1101
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:43,540
This is hilarious. You're returning a
hat that your girlfriend got. You Dude.

1102
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:47,890
How horrific was that hat? Can you
please send me a picture of it before I,

1103
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:49,540
if you took one before you returned it?

1104
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,040
Yeah.

1105
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,720
Picture one of those, uh, plaid Charlie
Chaplin Hat. Um, I had the receipt,

1106
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:59,680
but again, the girl at the register
asked me for my address and phone number.

1107
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:00,101
I said,

1108
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:03,670
I didn't want to give that information
to her immediately panic sets in and her

1109
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:06,100
face and she says that I have to,

1110
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,650
I said that I didn't have to the day
after Christmas and I wasn't going to now,

1111
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,513
good for you.

1112
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,410
She calls over a coworker and they both
get defensive and hold to the idea that

1113
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:20,250
I have to give over my information
in order to return a stupid hat.

1114
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,450
Even though I had my receipt,
I asked why and they let me slide.

1115
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,750
Why the let me slide on this before
and they maintained that I had,

1116
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,360
I had to give them my name,
address and phone number.

1117
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,510
So what did I do in the face
of corporate opposition?

1118
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:39,620
I caved and I gave it to him.
You fucking Pussy,

1119
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,370
dude. The second you saw
the panic on their face,

1120
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,860
you knew that they were gonna
lose. All right. He goes,

1121
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:54,760
I just don't get it, Bill. Why is a
receipt not enough? Nowadays it is enough.

1122
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,260
They say they need our
personal information to verify
purchase. They're not, dude,

1123
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,910
they're not. All right. All of that shit.

1124
01:05:03,911 --> 01:05:07,630
All those little safe, you know you
want to get when our discount store,

1125
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:12,340
they're creating a file on you.
They figure out what you want to buy,

1126
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,720
what they can mark a towards you,

1127
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:17,590
and then they take that information and
they sell it to other fucking companies.

1128
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,530
Even though they say they're not going to,
they sell your information,

1129
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,630
your information gets up on the Internet.

1130
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,500
And that's why there's all these creepy
websites out there right now that have

1131
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:29,110
all this fucking information
about you, about, you know,

1132
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,530
how many siblings you have,
your brothers and sisters names.

1133
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,530
They all use that information to
fucking, it's, I'm telling you

1134
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:40,210
this,
don't give them your information.

1135
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:44,740
You don't have to give him your
information and people out there

1136
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,560
who just have this fucking attitude
towards these corporations just sitting

1137
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:53,210
there going like, wait, you know
what we do? What are they going?

1138
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,180
You mean as long as you're not
doing anything wrong? I mean,

1139
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,700
what do I care if they know where I live?

1140
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,530
What do I keep this fucking morons.
You,

1141
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,580
I don't even,

1142
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,060
I've explained this shit till I'm blue
in the face and then I always get these

1143
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:11,870
emails from these people.
Um, he just, I don't think,

1144
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,800
I dunno, I can't, if I said
something the other day, you know,

1145
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:17,860
I'm sitting there listening, I was sitting
there, I was listening to sports radio,

1146
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:22,600
you know, cause I'm a deep
thinker, right. And uh, this,

1147
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:27,601
this new guy got on sports radio out
here in Los Angeles and you know,

1148
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:33,700
he does what most people do when they
have nothing to say, which is they,

1149
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,230
they just start,
they just go over the top arrogant.

1150
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,680
You know what I mean? Like he was
talking about how he wanted to get some,

1151
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:45,580
some sort of sports culture
personality on the show,

1152
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,850
but he doubted he could get him as
a guest because the guest hated him.

1153
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,520
And he goes, you know, cause
I disagreed with them on some,

1154
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:56,890
he was talking to a coach and he was
actually disagreeing with what the fucking

1155
01:06:56,891 --> 01:07:00,190
coach, he's disagreeing with the guy and
he goes, you know what the problem is?

1156
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:03,000
You know, he goes like, I'm, I'm
just like such a good debater.

1157
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:06,160
I actually ended up like convincing
myself of my own opinion.

1158
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:10,210
You actually said that over the airwaves
and I just sort of muttered to myself

1159
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:14,800
that the confidence of
morons is staggering.

1160
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:20,350
You know what I mean? Morons think
they know everything. That's,

1161
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,120
that's what makes them fucking morons.

1162
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,570
And like the emails I get with
people who don't question this shit,

1163
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:32,410
um, which is, I don't know,
like last week when I,

1164
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:34,120
when I went off on my
little fucking rant there,

1165
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:37,880
just some of the fucking emails
I get, it's like people are, are,

1166
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,600
are sending me shit. That kind
of is backing up what I'm saying.

1167
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:43,930
And then telling me that it sounded
like I have tin foil on my fucking head,

1168
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,030
which obviously I am out of my
fucking mind on some level, but, um,

1169
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,640
I'm not out of my mind when I don't
trust corporations and I don't trust them

1170
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:55,270
when they say we're not going to
do anything with this information.

1171
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,840
The other day I was in cvs and I go to
buy something and the lady asked me that

1172
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:03,610
I have a saved card and I said, no.
She said, do you want one? And I said,

1173
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:06,850
no. And she goes, well
that's okay. I'll just,

1174
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:10,960
and she swiped the fucking thing
anyways. And I was like, lady,

1175
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:15,470
what did I just say to you now? See if I
use my credit card, they'd have my name

1176
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:20,570
and then to match up to that fucking
number and what the hell I just bought and

1177
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:25,040
just a little bit more information about
me and my question to all you people

1178
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:29,360
who have these, this faith
in these corporations,

1179
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,670
why does that person do that?

1180
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:36,850
Why are they so hell bent on trying to
make that corporation less money in that

1181
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:41,370
moment?
They give me this card,

1182
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:46,080
you know like everybody has those cards
so you're not saving any fucking money.

1183
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:51,170
It's just, it's a big fucking
shell game to make it seem, Ooh,

1184
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:53,710
look is saving money.
What they're really doing there.

1185
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:57,480
I'll look at this hand over here is you're
giving them all your personal fucking

1186
01:08:57,481 --> 01:09:01,550
information that they can then use to,

1187
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:06,690
to very lease sell the other corporations
to increase junk mail and it also to a

1188
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,900
limit.
You're fucking level of privacy.

1189
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,020
The fact that they can put all that
shit up in the Goddamn Internet.

1190
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,580
People have been sending me these random
websites where they have like your name

1191
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:22,500
and your address, where you fucking live
and all this type of shit. It's like,

1192
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,690
how do you think that they
get all that information?

1193
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:30,000
Do you think there's somebody sitting
there with the phone book and just typing

1194
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:33,790
all of this shit in? I don't
know. I have fucking though.

1195
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:40,340
If some [inaudible] kills me.
If some fucking random creepy guy,

1196
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:45,240
you know you're standing there waiting
for the subway, came up to you,

1197
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:49,830
asks you what's your name,
your phone number and your address was,

1198
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:53,750
would you give it to him
now,

1199
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,430
but for some reason you're inside of
a fucking store and there's socks and

1200
01:09:58,431 --> 01:10:02,440
sweaters and somebody has a name
tag. Now all of a sudden you, you,

1201
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:06,860
you give them total fucking trust,
you're out of your mind. So sir,

1202
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:11,430
don't cave in. All right, all you get,

1203
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:16,300
you just, just say that's
unacceptable. That's unacceptable.

1204
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,340
I want to speak to the manager what
they're doing. It's not legal yet.

1205
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,870
It's not legal yet,

1206
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:27,871
but I can guarantee you there's somebody
lobbying for it that in Washington

1207
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,730
there's some sort of fucking
high powered lobbying group.

1208
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:34,120
I swear to God is probably
lobbying that from here on out.

1209
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,990
We need to have a law that if
you're going to return a hat,

1210
01:10:37,991 --> 01:10:41,290
you have to give us your name, your
address, and your social security number.

1211
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:45,700
Just so there's not another nine
11 could guaran fucking tee it.

1212
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,830
So yeah,
you don't have to.

1213
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,860
That's actually one of the highlights of
my day. What I do now is when they say,

1214
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:58,150
do you have our little savy safe card? And
I say, no, I don't. Would you like one?

1215
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,720
No, I don't. I then say, and
please don't swipe another one.

1216
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,140
You know? And then I tried to
pay with cash. I love cash.

1217
01:11:07,141 --> 01:11:08,820
Cash is fucking anonymous.

1218
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,660
All you guys out there who was sitting
there watching these commercials where

1219
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:17,500
they make look like credit cards
is so fucking easy. You, you're,

1220
01:11:17,501 --> 01:11:19,760
you're idiots. You're, you're,

1221
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,730
you're buying into exactly
what they want you to buy into,

1222
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:24,530
which is a cashless society.

1223
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:29,300
So they can keep track of where you
are at all fucking times and every last

1224
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:33,830
fucking dime that you make so they can
get their greedy little fucking hands on

1225
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:34,664
it.

1226
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:39,020
You're out of your mind and you're giving
up an unbelievable amount of fucking

1227
01:11:39,021 --> 01:11:43,670
privacy by creating a paper trail.
Everywhere you go,

1228
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:48,620
everywhere you go, what you're
doing, where you're at, you know,

1229
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,980
and the sea of morons who are
going to sit there and go, Whoa,

1230
01:11:51,981 --> 01:11:54,230
have you doing anything wrong?

1231
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,390
I mean, I guess maybe,
maybe I'm a paranoid cycle.

1232
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:02,900
You look at all these fucking idiots
who do reality TV's and [inaudible] and

1233
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,440
they let cameras come into their house
and they don't seem to care about it.

1234
01:12:06,441 --> 01:12:10,670
Maybe, uh, maybe the average jackass
doesn't give a shit. But sir,

1235
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:14,470
for the love of God,
you know,

1236
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,740
in the end he says,
I'm not crying conspiracy.

1237
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:22,510
It's very plain to see what they're doing.
It's not malicious or evil. Yes it is.

1238
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:25,930
It is malicious and it is
evil and it is a conspiracy.

1239
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,060
They're conspiring to get everybody's
information. Find out what they buy,

1240
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:34,690
and they're lying to you
saying that they're not going
to share the information.

1241
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:39,580
It's everything that you're saying. It's
not. It is. All right. And that's it.

1242
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:41,800
That's two weeks in a row. I'm
on the soapbox. See people,

1243
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,200
don't you like it better
when I talk about sports.

1244
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:51,220
Um, anyways, let's talk
about football this week.

1245
01:12:51,221 --> 01:12:54,400
You're going to hear me say something
this week that I've never said before ever

1246
01:12:54,401 --> 01:12:58,900
on a podcast.
I feel bad for Peyton manning.

1247
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,210
Peyton manning got fucked this week
by his own Goddamn coaching staff.

1248
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:08,860
Um, he played a great God damn
gate when they needed a score,

1249
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:13,060
he drove him right down the fucking field.
If that bomb caught that ball,

1250
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,920
they were right in there. And even
still, and by the way, Anna, Vinod Terry,

1251
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:23,230
it's a shame that jets one the Goddamn
game because that guy is the most money

1252
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:25,690
kicker of all time.

1253
01:13:25,691 --> 01:13:28,670
I was actually joking with my buddy
when I was watching the game. Um,

1254
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,720
I was saying that the most pussy ever
gotten by a professional kicker has to be

1255
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:38,800
Adam [inaudible] Vernon Terry.
It's gotta be, it's gotta be,

1256
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:43,450
and I actually learned that there's
no kicker in the NFL hall of fame and

1257
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:47,740
there's no fucking way. It's just a shame
now. Cause I even that I hate the jets.

1258
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:50,740
It's not, it's a shame that the
jets one that fucking game because

1259
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:56,990
[inaudible] people are gonna forget that
he actually hit that fucking 50 yard a

1260
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:02,230
man write down the fucking
middle right down the middle.

1261
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:05,880
But uh, I don't, I,

1262
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,030
I was right there with
Peyton manning when he was,

1263
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,630
had his hands out when they called,

1264
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:16,680
when the fucking cult called
timeout with 29 seconds to go.

1265
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:21,820
Can somebody explain why
the fuck they did that?

1266
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,660
And don't even say, well, your
point, you realize you jet,

1267
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:29,380
we're going to kick a field goal and
they want to make sure that what they'd

1268
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:32,500
have 17 seconds to get
down the fucking field.

1269
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:37,660
There wasn't gonna be enough time.
There wasn't gonna be enough time.

1270
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,530
You add a second year quarterback who had,
who,

1271
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,870
who fucking had that deer
in the headlights look,

1272
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:48,700
he was overthrown all his fucking
receivers. You take a timeout,

1273
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:53,820
you give them a chance to gather himself
for their coaches to give them the next

1274
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:57,290
three plays so we can fucking relax.
And what comes to comes right out. He,

1275
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,100
it's a fucking 18 yard pass
and that's the end of the game.

1276
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,440
And when Peyton was sitting
there with his hands out like,

1277
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:06,760
what the fuck are we call a time out for?
It was the one time I have,

1278
01:15:06,761 --> 01:15:10,060
I actually felt bad for that guy.
I just sat there and I was going,

1279
01:15:10,061 --> 01:15:12,970
I think they are in the process
of losing this fucking game,

1280
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:16,930
not just giving the game away.
Um,

1281
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,130
it was fucking brutal. Absolutely
brutal. So there you go. Pate.

1282
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:25,090
Manning did not lose that game.
He fucking stepped it up.

1283
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:29,890
He played a hell of a Goddamn game. And
I actually feel bad for the guy that he,

1284
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:34,690
that he lost. And if I'm
going to be honest now that
I think about it, about five,

1285
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:37,630
six years ago,
you know,

1286
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:41,140
he drove his team down the field and
their idiot kicker would talk shit about

1287
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:44,330
Peyton choking in the playoffs. He went
on and he missed the fucking field goes.

1288
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:48,580
So there's two years,
two losses. I, I won't,

1289
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,070
I won't blame Peyton manning
for all, right? There you go.

1290
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:55,960
See that the can make trying to
be a little more forgiving in a,

1291
01:15:55,961 --> 01:16:00,610
in this year. And, um, and
I realized this week too,

1292
01:16:00,611 --> 01:16:03,520
that I've been feeding into
exactly what Rex Ryan wants,

1293
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:07,330
which is people just talking
about him. Um, you know,

1294
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:11,710
what are the odds he think he think he's
going to say something outrageous this

1295
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:15,910
week. Uh, it's really like watching
Madonna's career. You know,

1296
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,220
where you have a woman who,
uh,

1297
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:23,550
has a mediocre voice and has made mediocre
music for the last 30 fucking years.

1298
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:27,280
Yet somehow it,

1299
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,640
whenever she wants to be is in the news.
And you know why?

1300
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:34,330
Because she knows when to
take her clam up. All right?

1301
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,790
She knows when to go on Letterman and say,

1302
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:43,660
fuck 38 times during an interview.
You know,

1303
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:47,800
when you really think about Madonna,
what does it have to do? Oh Wow,

1304
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,210
look how good shape she's in.

1305
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,950
They just see when she did the book
and she fucking spread her legs,

1306
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,610
you know? Did you see when
she said, fuck on Letterman,

1307
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,180
did you see when she did the video,
Eh,

1308
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:05,080
fucking Jesus was black
and then she kissed him?

1309
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:10,660
Of course. That's what you talk about.
What are you going to talk board a land?

1310
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,090
So you're like,
okay,

1311
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,300
bye by rarely 30 year career
off of that horse shit.

1312
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:20,960
What's his face is doing the same thing.

1313
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,870
He's doing the exact same fucking thing.

1314
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:28,550
Dropped a bunch of f
bombs during hard knocks.

1315
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:32,420
That was his Letterman episode.
All right. He put a wig on.

1316
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,730
That was him showing his clam

1317
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:43,700
and then then he made a
controversial video. Other than that,

1318
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:48,080
he lost the division,
backed into the fucking playoffs.

1319
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,550
Playoffs. I, yeah. I don't know. You
know? You know what I realized this week?

1320
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:57,020
I didn't even know what the name of
the coach was for the Atlanta Falcons.

1321
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:59,840
I given this guy no hype whatsoever.
Mike Smith.

1322
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:01,400
I had actually actually had to look it up.

1323
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:05,690
This is a guy who went 13
and three who actually has,

1324
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,960
has actually has a franchise
quarterback in Matt Ryan.

1325
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:14,210
He actually has a franchise quarterback,

1326
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:16,613
you know,

1327
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:21,920
but it's not in New York. So
who gives a fuck? Right. Um,

1328
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:28,040
with that, my predictions for
the week. Um, Pittsburgh Ravens,

1329
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:32,490
I have no fucking idea. Uh, patriots jets,

1330
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,260
I have no fucking idea.

1331
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,160
Just for the simple fact that I have no
idea which defense to patriots are going

1332
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:39,960
to show up with.
You know,

1333
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:44,220
I am not a guy if you realize that
I'm not a guy who buys into hype.

1334
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:47,760
That's why I've have not bought into
rex Ryan for half a fucking second.

1335
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:51,500
And that's why also when the
Patriots won 45 to three,

1336
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:56,270
I didn't go well there you go.
Cause I realize we also lost 28 to 14.

1337
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,060
I also know that we suck against the run.

1338
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:04,070
So I think if we're going to win,
I'll tell you, found the patriots.

1339
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:07,340
I gotta be taken. I gotta Stop
Lt. No, seriously. We, if we,

1340
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,170
if we can stop the run and,
uh, go up by a good 10,

1341
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,320
14 fucking points and put Sanchez into a
situation where he feels like he has to

1342
01:19:18,831 --> 01:19:22,880
make a play, we're going to
be in it. We're going to be,

1343
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,560
we're going to be all right. That's what
we need to do. That's what we need to do.

1344
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:29,450
And I have faith that we're
going to fucking do that.

1345
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:33,090
I hope for the love of fucking
God, because if we don't, uh,

1346
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:37,980
you're going to listen to the sounds of
a blubbering jackass next week on this

1347
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:42,360
fucking podcast. Um, and
that is it. So that's it.

1348
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:46,440
I'm really hoping, uh, oh, look at this.
Look at this. I got some offers coming in.

1349
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,690
I got some offers coming
in. Yeah. We go where,

1350
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:54,450
where am I going to be performing? Oh, by
the way, I'm actually in the process of,

1351
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:57,210
uh, of, uh,

1352
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,030
getting a Detroit and Milwaukee date.
Now.

1353
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:05,130
I have not played in Detroit since I did
the rich bitch tour way back in the day

1354
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:10,400
with Charlie Murphy and a ashy Larry
and I have not played Milwaukee ever.

1355
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:17,090
I know I did a college in that area
because a long time ago I went to a bucks

1356
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:19,250
game.
Um,

1357
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,720
but what else do I got going on here?

1358
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:24,520
Of course I don't get the
fucking Internet here.

1359
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:25,980
Yeah.

1360
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,730
My bedroom, the hell is wrong with me.
I'm stepping up my life in 2011 people.

1361
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:35,470
Um, all right, let's go with youtube
videos for the week. All right. Um,

1362
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:37,430
yeah.

1363
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,560
Oh, here's something I've been, you know,

1364
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:42,170
watching a lot of basketball lately and
Kareem Abdul Jabbar always gets credit

1365
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:45,800
for inventing the Sky Hook and a,

1366
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:47,930
I always took that as law
and I was just like, yeah,

1367
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:50,780
the guy invented the sky hook. Wow.
People must have been like, what the fuck?

1368
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:53,420
You know, they went from the
set shot to that, you know,

1369
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,820
the way they traditionally
shoot now with the one hand,

1370
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:58,700
the other hand guide the ball and
then he comes out with that shit.

1371
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,220
People must just been like,
where the fuck did that come from?

1372
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,050
And then I was looking at some old,

1373
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:08,051
a Celtics video and that was sort of a
shot that people already took in the 60s,

1374
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:12,080
but they did it from their hip and it was
one of the gayest looking shots you're

1375
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:14,930
ever gonna see.
You just sort of jumped in the air,

1376
01:21:14,931 --> 01:21:18,050
had one leg up in the
air bent at the knee.

1377
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:22,700
Like I don't think that there's a physical
way to do that shot without going.

1378
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:26,300
We as you throw it.
But uh,

1379
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,060
he just thought he changed it where
he didn't shoot it from the hip.

1380
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:32,570
He just put it over his fucking
head. So there you go. Um,

1381
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:36,650
here's a nice conspiracy theory. One
from people in the, I believe in Seattle,

1382
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:38,420
you go to a Seahawks game,

1383
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,990
they have a large beer and a
small beer in the large beer,

1384
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,260
it's like a dollar 75 more.
They come in two different glasses.

1385
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:51,220
So somebody filled up a small glass
with water and poured it into the large

1386
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:56,750
glass in it, filled it all the way
up. It was classic. The small glasses,

1387
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,240
a little fat one,
and the other one's nice and tall.

1388
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:01,850
So you think you'd get more and you're
not and they charge your next to dollar

1389
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:05,030
25 a. So we made a video of it. Um,

1390
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,930
what else? What other videos
do I have here? Oh, this is
one from a new website. Uh,

1391
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:16,060
totally crap. Totally crap.com.
They got a lot of good,

1392
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,120
good videos and there's one
there called five minute fight.

1393
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:23,700
All of these by the way will be up
on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Um,

1394
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:28,070
and what else? Oh, this one is a,

1395
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:32,330
a video also on a totally crapped.com.

1396
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,960
Uh,

1397
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,850
and it's also an underrated and
it says underrated ass whooping.

1398
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:41,410
So many things would be salt if people
would start their kids outright.

1399
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,450
And the name of this video is
old school ass whooping. And uh,

1400
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,680
I don't know how to describe this other
than this father puts on a video camera.

1401
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:55,720
He makes his kid tell him he's not going
to be in a gang and he starts beating

1402
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,560
with the belt and the kid tells his dad
he's not. The gangs are bullshit. He goes,

1403
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,840
don't tell me,
tell it to the fucking camera.

1404
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,060
And he continues to beat
his ass with a belt.

1405
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:10,060
It's a sad, it's funny. It's
everything you want it to be.

1406
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:13,360
And then there's another video that I
saw right after that five minute fight.

1407
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:19,000
And this fight is fucking hilarious.
There's two white kids,

1408
01:23:19,001 --> 01:23:22,000
they're calling each other bitch in
the colony, each other, the n word.

1409
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,080
And I swear to God,

1410
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:28,470
they might both throw 700 punches
and I think they missed 698 each.

1411
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:32,500
It's the classic thing where you've
got two people who want to fight.

1412
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,940
They don't know how to fight and all they
know is they want to punch the person,

1413
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,700
other person in the face, but they
don't want to get hit in the face.

1414
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,100
So they won't commit to coming inside.

1415
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,460
And they just sort of punching the
atmosphere around the other guy's head.

1416
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,240
Or as I like to say, uh,
an NBA basketball fight.

1417
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,480
You ever watch our NBA basketball
players fight? For the most part.

1418
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,700
They pulled their head behind
their shoulders and then they,

1419
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,170
they throw punches like they're trying
to throw a fucking baseball from the

1420
01:23:59,171 --> 01:24:02,950
outfield to home plate. Um, all right.

1421
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:06,040
I'm just really just giving information
this week. I don't feel like I'm fucking,

1422
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:12,370
Oh, here we go. Nope. That
was from last week. Oh,

1423
01:24:12,371 --> 01:24:15,490
for Christ's sake. You Cook the shit
out of it. Where the hell am I here?

1424
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:20,140
What the fuck is my underrated
overrated for the week? Oh,

1425
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:24,130
overrated or underrated. Here we go.
Overrated. NFL celebrations. Seriously,

1426
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:28,180
how many times do we have to see these
unoriginal athletes do the jump and the

1427
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:31,330
chest bump after a touchdown?
It's been, it's been done so much.

1428
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,610
It's become lackluster and automatic.

1429
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:38,410
Remember the throat slash they would all
do before the NFL banned it for being

1430
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:39,820
too violent a gesture.

1431
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:44,920
I remember even Brett Farve doing that
one and still managing to come off too

1432
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:45,790
white when he did it.

1433
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:51,120
Or what about the fact that
the celebrations aren't
even regulated to touchdowns

1434
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:55,300
anymore? Every sack tackle
first down and catch warrants,

1435
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:59,560
a dance and a, hey look at me moment
for the player. This is the NFL.

1436
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,640
I expect defenses to wrap a
guy up and make a tackle. Uh,

1437
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,650
may expect the receivers
to catch the ball.

1438
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,400
They need to show some class and act like
they've done it before. Not to mention,

1439
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,310
yeah, I'm totally with
you on that. That whole,

1440
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,930
every time you catch a pass and
then you get up and you got it.

1441
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:20,380
You know the Jerome Bettis was,

1442
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:23,170
was the guy always stands out in my
head where he would, he would fucking,

1443
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:25,150
you know,
his first 10 carries,

1444
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,680
he get like 12 yards and then he ripped
one off for like 11 and then he get up

1445
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:33,060
and start stomping around,
taken off his fucking Chin strap.

1446
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:38,260
I can't stand that shit. Braylin
Edwards does that Shit, you know,

1447
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:43,180
drops like nine passes and then catches
one for a first down, gets up fucking,

1448
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,470
ah, it's the worst thing ever. The
key, Shawn, the Keyshawn Johnson will,

1449
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:52,280
you stomp around and you take off you
fucking Chin strap. It's like, well, I,

1450
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,560
I, I hate that shit. I hate it. I
can't say, I don't mind actually,

1451
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,870
if you catch a touchdown, you do
a little fucking dance. Actually,

1452
01:25:58,871 --> 01:26:03,530
I've always liked that shit.
But like the, uh, the first,

1453
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:07,490
you know what's even worse is when your
team is kicking the shit out of another

1454
01:26:07,491 --> 01:26:11,690
team and then the other team makes a good
defensive play and then that guy gets

1455
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:16,270
up. Ah, I'm screaming at the people in the
end zone. It's like, dude, you're, you're,

1456
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:18,680
you're down 28 to six.
All right. Why don't,

1457
01:26:18,681 --> 01:26:21,830
why don't you go back to the defense of
Huddle and figure out why the fuck you

1458
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:24,320
weren't doing that for the first
three and a half quarters, you know,

1459
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,150
so I'd go with you. Um, uh, yeah,

1460
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,180
I'm over all of that shit. And, uh,

1461
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:36,630
I think the worst thing I saw this
year was the t o show show. Well,

1462
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,200
you had a team that was
absolutely shitting the bed,

1463
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:44,070
yet there are two best players had
the time to do a reality show, uh,

1464
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,790
during the fucking, uh, during the season.

1465
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,730
Do you think bill Bellacheck
would put up with that?

1466
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,870
Do you think that those guys would not
be shipped out for third round draft

1467
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:56,300
picks?
It's unfucking believable,

1468
01:26:56,540 --> 01:27:00,650
the level of disrespect that
that is to do that fucking show

1469
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:07,100
during the goddamn season as you proceed
to Lee lose fucking eight games in a

1470
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:09,530
row.
Uh Oh.

1471
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:12,440
And then you go on the show and you
throw your coaches under the bus.

1472
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,533
There you go.

1473
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:22,370
Um, and for those of you who wonder why
Randy Moss was traded for a third round

1474
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:25,880
draft pick, that's why, because of
that type of shit, because it's really,

1475
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:30,170
it's just not worth it. Like you ever
see a beautiful girl in a bar, okay.

1476
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:33,920
Or whatever. Or you start
dating a beautiful girl and
no matter how hot she is,

1477
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:37,130
she's just such a cunt.
It's not fucking worth it.

1478
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,590
She's just so fucking high maintenance.

1479
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:42,410
That's what all those players
are like in all the, all the,

1480
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,340
all those types of sports.
It's at the end of the day,

1481
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:48,920
no matter how fucking good they
are, they, they just not worth it.

1482
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:53,570
They just not worth it. Kind of like
listening to the rest of this podcast.

1483
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:54,950
It's really not worth it.

1484
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,920
I feel like I haven't had anything to
say for the last fucking 12 minutes.

1485
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:01,400
Alright. Underrated,
uh, bat baseball's code,

1486
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,510
although it's definitely
borderline juvenile sometimes.

1487
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:10,190
I do like that in baseball. If you show
up a pitcher by celebrating your home,

1488
01:28:10,191 --> 01:28:11,450
run a little bit too much,

1489
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,320
you can guarantee he's throwing
at you the next time you're up.

1490
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:19,190
I liked that players get to police
themselves a little bit. Well, sir,

1491
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,640
why don't you come over to the NHL?
You'd love Nhl Hockey.

1492
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:27,910
You just basically described why
there's fighting and hockey and why.

1493
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:32,330
That's why hockey's awesome and uh,
you know,

1494
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,830
cause they let the players police each
other and I know people who don't like

1495
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:40,520
the NHL, they're going to be like
by fighting. Yes. By fighting.

1496
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:44,180
It has to be done.
Okay.

1497
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,920
You got a guy skating around the ice
if fucking 20 miles an hour with the

1498
01:28:48,921 --> 01:28:52,130
goddamn club in his hand.
Okay.

1499
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:56,270
If you don't slap the shit out of them,
every couple of games,

1500
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,560
he's going to hurt somebody severely.
You know? So that's, that's,

1501
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,620
that's what needs to be done.
You know,

1502
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,240
think of all the pieces of shit players
that are cheap fox in the NBA. All right?

1503
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,920
And in the NFL and all that,

1504
01:29:10,921 --> 01:29:15,570
just imagine if they actually had a club
in their hand and they could walk up to

1505
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:19,590
your best player and just
fucking slam 'em over the head,

1506
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:23,160
right in the fucking grill or
in the side of his fucking leg.

1507
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,130
You know,
you'd have to beat the shit though,

1508
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,930
or you have to be allowed to
beat the shit out of that guy.

1509
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:33,480
So it wouldn't happen.
And I know what you guys were thinking.

1510
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:36,420
Well if anybody does that just banned
him for life out of the league.

1511
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,070
Well then you would end up with nobody
playing hockey because I don't know what

1512
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:44,490
it is. If you've ever played
hockey, there's something about it.

1513
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:47,700
It's just a very physical game. And at
some point you're going to think about it,

1514
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:51,540
that mother fucker gets you for
like the fifth God damn time.

1515
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:55,850
You just that you got this club in
your hand and you just used the,

1516
01:29:55,851 --> 01:29:57,080
I'm going to fucking come over there.

1517
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:00,980
I'm just going to fucking take two
hander right to his fucking neck.

1518
01:30:00,981 --> 01:30:05,540
But you doubt because their biggest
player will come over there and beat the

1519
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:09,110
living shit out of you in front of your
fucking girlfriend or wife who's in the

1520
01:30:09,111 --> 01:30:12,660
stance. Did that makes
sense? Speaking of which,

1521
01:30:12,661 --> 01:30:17,280
I'm actually playing hockey tonight and
yes I do suck. I am upon hockey player.

1522
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:21,000
I can only go frontwards and
crossover on one side both. Okay.

1523
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,620
I got the helmet with the full cage,

1524
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,470
you know that's,

1525
01:30:26,471 --> 01:30:29,260
that's usually a sign that someone's
going to be a cheap piece of shit.

1526
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,180
Anybody who has all the extra padding,

1527
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,160
that's because they know somebody is
going to come up and try to retaliate.

1528
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:37,260
So they want to make sure that
their directs to protect it.

1529
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,720
I actually wear it because I know that my,

1530
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:42,600
if I was ever gonna make it to the NHL,
that would have happened by now.

1531
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,230
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say that as a 42 year old,

1532
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:47,790
I don't think I'm going to make it.

1533
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:53,150
So there's really no point in me getting
the required 18 stitches that starts

1534
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,350
above my upper lip,
goes through my lips and comes down.

1535
01:30:58,351 --> 01:31:02,820
I remember the Gary Galley one that was
the most insane fucking scar I've ever

1536
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:07,500
seen. Gary Galley, former Bruins,
he's playing for the Boston,

1537
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,020
then went to the kinks, right?
He's playing for the Bruins.

1538
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,490
He's in front of the net.

1539
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,480
Somebody gets crosschecked in their chest.

1540
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:20,540
The guy like he gets hit so hard that
both his legs fly up into the air.

1541
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:25,410
He's like in the air in this
seated position. He basically kicks

1542
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,970
Gary Galley in the face with his skate,
just sorta

1543
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:36,000
like as his legs are going up, the blade
of the guys skate catches Gary galleys.

1544
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:40,890
Fucking Chin goes right through both his
lips and right up the side of his face

1545
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:45,480
and he had stitches from,
I think the side of his nose,

1546
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,860
right down and right.
Yeah, through both lips.

1547
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:55,180
In a, I was one of the worst ones
I ever saw. And uh, you know,

1548
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:59,110
and I think that's good to conclude one
of the worst podcasts I've ever fucking,

1549
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:04,750
uh, I felt like a Sanchez
during this whole podcast.

1550
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:07,840
At no point that I feel comfortable.
I don't feel like I settled down.

1551
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,440
I feel like all my jokes went 10
feet over everybody's fucking head.

1552
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:15,100
And if I could have handled this mic off
to somebody for the second half of it,

1553
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,530
you know, and let somebody kick the last
joke through the uprights I would have.

1554
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:25,210
Yeah. Fuck, I got to redeem myself. Did
anything funny happen to me this week?

1555
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,850
I went out,
I looked at some houses.

1556
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:32,350
I think I'm getting ready to go right
back on the wheel again. You know,

1557
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:34,720
have to talking about
having no god damn dead.

1558
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:38,380
I'm thinking about just
going out and buying a house,
maybe buying a fucking car.

1559
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,170
I want to buy something.
You know,

1560
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,510
I want to fill the void
like only an American can.

1561
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:48,940
Somebody sent me an email talking
about how America is over, you know,

1562
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,690
talking about how China is now. Now
there now they're going to be the shit.

1563
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:58,210
And you know what I say? Well,
it's about fucking time. You know,

1564
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:59,103
China,

1565
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:03,130
how many Goddamn fucking people the have
to make before he can take over some

1566
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:05,890
shit.
China,

1567
01:33:05,891 --> 01:33:10,120
that's the most overrated Goddamn
fucking country out there. You know,

1568
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:15,820
they got like a third of the world's
population. How the fuck are you?

1569
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:19,780
Not the best. You should have the
best guitar players, the best singers,

1570
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:23,830
the best actors, the best scientist.
Just out of sheer fucking numbers.

1571
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:28,510
What do you guys been doing over there?
I've been slacking off.

1572
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:34,240
Slacking off with your fucking awful
food and your dirty goddamn restaurants.

1573
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,020
Do you know I won't eat
Chinese food because of that.

1574
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:42,310
I'm not saying Chinese people. A bad
food or bad people. Bad food, bad people.

1575
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:45,340
It was like a,
that was like a Jeffrey Dahmer comment.

1576
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:49,180
I'm not saying Chinese people are bad
food. I'm not saying that they're,

1577
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:53,000
that they're bad people.
I'm not saying then that's my,

1578
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,600
I'm just saying I lived
in New York City and uh,

1579
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:02,530
I used to be a fan of Chinese food.
I am not a fan anymore.

1580
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:07,060
All right. And until they start getting
some clean goddamn restaurants out there,

1581
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:11,320
I'm not, I'm not fucking eat him. That's
it. I'm not saying you're bad people.

1582
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,720
I'm just saying what the fuck.

1583
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,370
Filthy. I'll only, I'll only
eat Chinese food. Who's getting,

1584
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,510
if I'm shit faced, I'll lead
anything. I don't give a fuck,

1585
01:34:23,511 --> 01:34:28,040
but if I'm sober or the only way I'll eat
Chinese food is if it's a cloth napkin.

1586
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:32,480
Sit down. Nice fucking place. All right.

1587
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:35,360
And it'd be fair.
That's why I don't eat barbecue.

1588
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:40,580
I'm not going into those goddamn
shacks with those fucking flies

1589
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:47,530
the size of Goddamn bumblebees.
I'm not going in there. And again,

1590
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:52,100
it, that's the whole year. You poor
people food. Yeah. It looks like it.

1591
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,080
It looks like it. It looks like you've
been dominated on some fucking level.

1592
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,680
Oh, with the dirty floors
and the peanut shells.

1593
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:06,950
Fuck Barbecue and fuck Chinese food. All
right. Actually had some Lebanese food,

1594
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:11,570
uh, yesterday, which is just sort of
all like Middle Eastern food like that,

1595
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:16,571
that a chicken kabobs and all that
stuff was fucking insane to bully salad.

1596
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,240
All right. I sign off on that.
I sign off on Indian food.

1597
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:27,060
I sign off on a, these are all the
ones I'll give you the that I like.

1598
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:31,710
I like a Japanese,
I'll go with Korean barbecue.

1599
01:35:31,711 --> 01:35:36,600
We'll go with that. Thai food.
I like that shit. Chinese,

1600
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,750
I think Chinese was the only
one I won't fuck with. You know,

1601
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:41,911
and I'm Mexican food.

1602
01:35:41,911 --> 01:35:44,760
Mexican food has to be a certain
cut or I'm not fucking with it.

1603
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:48,150
You know when you go to the,
so some of those,

1604
01:35:48,151 --> 01:35:52,290
some of those little shits shacks there
and they get the refi re fried beans and

1605
01:35:52,291 --> 01:35:54,540
it just looks like, you know, it's like,

1606
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:58,200
does the health department even
know this place exists? Okay.

1607
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:00,570
This is like a restaurant slash

1608
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:06,880
it's like you turn the garage area
house into a fucking burrito factory.

1609
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:07,714
I'm not eating here.

1610
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,390
Macro likes to gives me shit because
I'll never get Chinese food, you know?

1611
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:13,740
And she thinks it's that,

1612
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:17,190
that there's something like borderline
racist that I won't eat Chinese food.

1613
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,860
It's like I have no problem
with those people. You know,

1614
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:23,290
that's like over like
overly think it's something.

1615
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:28,540
What I'm saying is is I want to clean
God damn restaurant. Is that so wrong?

1616
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:34,360
All right. That's the podcast for
this fucking week. Um, I dunno.

1617
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:37,660
I am. I am I wrong about that shit? I
just don't want, I think Chinese food.

1618
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:39,010
I think dirty restaurant.
That's,

1619
01:36:39,011 --> 01:36:43,180
that's what the fuck I think because
that has been my experience. So go ahead.

1620
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,500
We're going to take the next call
or after this break. Uh, hey.

1621
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:50,380
What would you guys do if I started doing
commercials on my podcast as a way to

1622
01:36:50,381 --> 01:36:54,010
make money if right in the middle
of calling somebody a cunt.

1623
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,920
I just did something for
like true value hardware.

1624
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,610
Do they still exist or where they
bought out? Bought up by best buy.

1625
01:37:01,210 --> 01:37:04,480
Do they still exist? All right.
Anyways. Oh, you know what?

1626
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:08,970
I actually forgot tonight that
I can't see this shit because I

1627
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,390
know, fuck it. I'm going to say it.

1628
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:16,590
I'm actually gonna go see one of my
favorite drummers of all time tonight.

1629
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,030
Okay.
And Joe.

1630
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:23,340
Joe Mayor is doing a drum clinic and
I'm going to go check that shit out.

1631
01:37:24,150 --> 01:37:26,670
And uh, if you want to see
this guy drummers out there,

1632
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:28,790
you got to fucking check this guy out.
This is going to,

1633
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:32,250
I'm going to have this up on
the [inaudible] podcast.com. Uh,

1634
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,900
Joe Joe mayor performing,

1635
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:39,280
I plays like that drum in a drum and bass
music and it's him performing at the,

1636
01:37:39,511 --> 01:37:43,920
I believe 2005 modern drummer festival.
It's just a three minute clip.

1637
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:48,210
He could do like a role with one hand.
He's got that push poll molar thing.

1638
01:37:48,211 --> 01:37:51,750
I don't know what the fuck he's doing,
but uh,

1639
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:56,460
this guy is the shit and I'm
actually starting to like,

1640
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,490
I can't get into drum and bass,

1641
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:03,300
but I'm downloading some of his shit
just because it's played by human beings.

1642
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:08,250
And I'm actually fascinated
with drum and bass because it,

1643
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:13,251
it melds both the capabilities of
technology and then the abilities of human

1644
01:38:15,841 --> 01:38:20,580
beings to adapt to the
technology and raise their
level of performance. You know,

1645
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,810
remember that time when I told you
guys about that, that whole, uh,

1646
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,720
have drum and bass music, that whole
video that basically explained it,

1647
01:38:27,721 --> 01:38:31,500
it was like a fucking drum
brake from a B side of a 45.

1648
01:38:31,501 --> 01:38:35,460
And then Djs took that drum loop,
isolated every sound,

1649
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:39,030
and then switched it all up and created
a whole bunch of different beats and

1650
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:44,031
then sped it up to the point that no
human being could play it until a guy like

1651
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:48,470
Joe Joe mayor sat down and figured
out how to fucking do it. It's,

1652
01:38:48,471 --> 01:38:51,440
it's incredible. It's absolutely
incredible. I'm going to
watch that guy tonight.

1653
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:55,320
I'm going to get my ass kicked out
on the ice tonight, play in hockey,

1654
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:59,010
and that's it. I'm going to be in New
York and I'm gonna be doing spots, uh,

1655
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,060
around the city before I
go down to Atlantic city.

1656
01:39:03,061 --> 01:39:05,760
So I make sure that I am in shape for my,
uh,

1657
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:10,250
my big gig down there with Jim Norton.
Jim Breuer and David Tell Eh,

1658
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,280
uh, I will probably be popping
in at Gotham comedy club.

1659
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:17,820
I will be popping in at the comedy cellar

1660
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,210
and a stand up New York and Co the comic
strip and danger fields and be doing

1661
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:29,160
the whole fucking loop. Like
I used to back in the old
days, back in the old days,

1662
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:30,870
which I guess they don't
do that anymore now.

1663
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:34,270
They booked the club's a month out
and they just want you to work at the,

1664
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,320
at the same club the whole week.
But back in the day,

1665
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:43,490
he used to use to work like three, four
clubs. If you could on a weekend and you,

1666
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:44,340
you,

1667
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:49,340
you'd have a nine o'clock here at nine
45 at another club at 10 20 here and 1130

1668
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:54,951
here all the way to like two o'clock in
the morning and you get $50 a spot and

1669
01:39:56,611 --> 01:40:00,960
you'd blow like a third of it on cabs
just driving all around the city and you'd

1670
01:40:00,961 --> 01:40:04,590
have a new idea for a bit.
And uh,

1671
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:09,970
in one night you can hash
it out just doing like, you
know, sometimes up, up, up.

1672
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:12,390
I think the most,
every day I do like eight sets in a night.

1673
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:17,730
Who's fucking unbelievable and it just
caused you to write because you didn't

1674
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:22,620
want to say the same thing eight
times in one night and uh, you could,

1675
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:26,970
you could flesh out a bit.
I mean that was basically like doing,

1676
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:30,630
you know, almost headline
weekends you only do six shows,

1677
01:40:30,631 --> 01:40:33,540
so you would get eight
shows on average six.

1678
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:38,540
So it was like doing an entire weekend
worth of shows in one night as far as

1679
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:41,940
running that same new bit.
And it's incredible.

1680
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,260
And I wish the New York clubs would go
back to doing that because I really think

1681
01:40:46,261 --> 01:40:51,261
that that was the system that created all
the great comics that I watched when I

1682
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,650
came to New York.
That's just my,

1683
01:40:52,651 --> 01:40:56,590
that's my 2 cents and I'll fucking
sticker what that, that's it.

1684
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,330
You guys watch 60 minutes,
by the way,

1685
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:01,410
that just reminded me of fucking
Andy Rooney guys been watching the I,

1686
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:02,620
we watched that every week.

1687
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:06,760
Me In the there and we just laugh our
asses off at that curmudgeony old bastard.

1688
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,340
And what the fuck is going
on with his upper lip?

1689
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,680
It's receded on both sides yet.
The middle part's still is fleshy.

1690
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:20,290
So now it looks like he has a pimple.
This upper lip.

1691
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:21,790
All right,
I got nothing people.

1692
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:25,840
I'm talking about fucking Andy Rooney's
upper lip. Okay. The podcast is overbuilt.

1693
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,830
Tap Out. It's over. Oh,
congratulations to Pete Carroll.

1694
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:33,940
I was wrong about that.
Docker wearing white shoes.

1695
01:41:33,941 --> 01:41:36,970
Jerry Seinfeld sneakers,
son of a bitch.

1696
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,400
They came out to fucking play.

1697
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:44,560
Worse defensive performance I've
ever seen with the saints at uh,

1698
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:48,340
I don't know. I don't even know who
the fuck they're playing next week.

1699
01:41:48,341 --> 01:41:51,520
I'm just hoping that my patriots and
praying that we're going to beat the jets

1700
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:54,310
cause I have no fucking idea
which defense is going to show up.

1701
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:58,900
But I'll your phone, the patriots,
you gotta be taken. All right,

1702
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:02,060
that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody have a great week. Uh,

1703
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:05,350
don't give out your information to these
fucking corporation for the love of God.

1704
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:09,370
And if you want to go ahead and do it
stupid. All right, go ahead and do it.

1705
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:12,190
But then don't be surprised when a,
you know,

1706
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:16,030
some psycho you dated from high school
is standing on your front porch and has

1707
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:18,790
your fucking, uh, all your
information. All right.

1708
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,410
I couldn't even finish that sentence.
Who gives a fuck? Go Fuck Yourself.

1709
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:22,263
