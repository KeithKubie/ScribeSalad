Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.821
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:04.886
So I'm gonna share something with you that's so sweet

00:00:04.886 --> 00:00:08.686
you might actually cry, because I did the first time I saw it.

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:11.468
There's this little girl in Ohio who saw the

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:13.606
Project for Awesome video I made last year for

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:16.154
Not Forgotten, which is an orphanage we work with in Peru

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:18.160
and I make a video about it every December,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.167
and she saw the video and instead of just donating

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.197
like we usually do, you know we see something on the internet

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:25.851
and like oh yeah I'll click the button, or I'll whatever,

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.330
I'll.. couple of bucks here, whatever.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.539
She actually did something about it.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.344
Like so she saw it and she decided to take action on her own.

00:00:33.344 --> 00:00:35.459
For something called her compassion project.

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:38.139
I don't know what that is, but it's pretty amazing.

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:42.499
So what I'd like to do is show you Savannah's video,

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:44.044
her dad gave me permission to do that,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:48.630
and then after that we will just show you what our reaction

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.871
to her video was.

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.548
Hi, my name is Savannah,

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:54.872
and I'm in second grade.

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:58.370
Each kid in my class was assigned a compassion project

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.251
and here's mine.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.744
My dad and I watch a YouTube channel called Smarter Every Day.

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:12.925
Through that we learned about an organization called Not Forgotten.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.451
Not Forgotten is building an orphanage in Peru to help boys

00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.352
who have been abandoned.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.659
Peru is in South America.

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:31.197
When I heard about this, I told my dad we needed to do something.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.742
I decided to try and raise money to help them

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:38.649
build an orphanage. My goal was $100.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.859
During christmas break I talked to lots of people about Not Forgotten

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.609
and asked them to help me meet my goal.

00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:51.972
[music]

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:06.134
Everyone was VERY generous. I raised four times my original goal.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.468
Together we raised $469.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.534
I was so excited to get home to make the donation.

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.220
This will make a big difference for the boys in Peru.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.589
It might even save a boy's life.

00:02:24.247 --> 00:02:28.929
Thank you so much to everyone who helped me meet my goal.

00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:37.658
Right now we are in Iquitos Peru, you can see by the motor cars,

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.532
and we're gonna use the money that Savannah came up with

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:42.230
which was $1400 soles,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.612
and we're gonna use it for the orphans.

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:46.053
It's pretty awesome.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.685
We're gonna buy beds.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.353
(Destin) What you got?

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:05.036
- So, turns out 1450 soles pay for those 5 mattresses for that first room.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:08.416
Savannah that's the exact amount of money you raised for us last year

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.399
so we're gonna go ahead and get these mattresses,

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.590
take them out to our first house the boys are gonna use to sleep in.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.454
- Sweet.

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:15.135
- Mucho gracias.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:15.812
- Yeah.

00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:17.266
Savannah, this is awesome.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:20.130
Let's go show you the mattresses, we'll fast forward in time

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.941
and show you the mattresses in the building.

00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.525
Wowwwww!

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:29.251
Alright, come on.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:34.264
These are 5 beds that we purchased with money that you raised.

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:37.561
Got some pillows, it's a really big deal Savannah, you did that.

00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:40.365
A lot of people last year have really big fancy jobs and they

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.955
didn't do anything near as cool as that, so thank you

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.122
for your compassion project and this is the president

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:47.192
of Not Forgotten. He wants to thank you too.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:49.195
- Thank you Savannah, that was awesome.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.059
- Savannah, that was awesome.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.231
Thank you so much. Please tell your dad I said you get to stay up late tonight.

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:55.650
[laugh] I'm just kidding.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.464
Also tell him thank you for making that video for us,

00:03:58.464 --> 00:03:59.561
we really appreciate it.

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.123
For everybody else like me watching this video,

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:04.085
please check out the links in the video description.

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:05.677
You can help Not Forgotten like Savannah did.

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:08.255
She didn't just click the share something on Facebook,

00:04:08.255 --> 00:04:10.621
she actually did something, and if you don't want

00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:11.994
to help out Not Forgotten, just help out the

00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:13.410
charity of your choice.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.928
It's a good thing. Let's just make the world more awesome.

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:18.570
Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.004
Have a good one.
