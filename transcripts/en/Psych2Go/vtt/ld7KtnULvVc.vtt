00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.550
The art of persuasion is a subtle complex discipline which requires skill but lucky for all our viewers out there

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.800
We are gonna let you in on 15 useful tricks hidden in the enormous wealth of psychological knowledge

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.180
Millions of people all over the world have been swindling manipulating and persuading people with great success, but how do they do it?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.020
well

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.960
If you understand how the human brain works and what makes people tick

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.640
You too can learn how to make people do pretty much whatever you want

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.240
The only question is whether you'll use this power for good or for evil

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.340
1.The Reciprocity Norm

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.780
The Reciprocity norm is a pretty simple concept and one of the most powerful ways to convince others to do something for you

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.920
What it all boils down to is you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.720
Once you do a favor for someone else

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.000
They'll be more likely to help you in return with whatever you ask them

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.200
2. The Chameleon Effect

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.080
Research has also shown that mimicking someone will make them more agreeable towards you. It's called the chameleon effect

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.020
Try copying their posture or body language and they might be more likely to help you out

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.640
3. Don't get caught rambling

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.820
when it comes to the art of persuasion, less is more

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.740
Instead of listing all the various reasons why you're right and they're wrong

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.200
focus on one or two main points of the most. One good reason is ideal

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.420
4. Start small. This is known as the foot in the door technique

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.439
Basically what this means is that if you ask someone for a small favor such as borrowing a quarter

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.829
They're more likely to continue doing favors for you, even big ones!

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.820
But if you just start off with asking to borrow their car, you might have less success

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.080
5. Status

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.880
Status is important when asking people for favors

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.520
Use their official titles such as doctor mister professor

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530
And don't forget to use their name

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.320
People love to hear their own name and they like to feel respected

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.340
6. Speak faster. Are you a fast talker?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.620
Well, if you want to convince people that you're right, quickly getting your point across can be an advantage according to research

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.980
Speaking quickly overwhelms their brains and doesn't give them a chance to form a rebuttal

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.790
7. Contrasting

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.480
Every salesman knows this technique.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.140
Start big and back down, but the key here is to ask for more than what you actually want

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
Eventually, you can scale back your demands and you'll be left with what you originally wanted in the first place

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.080
8. Repetition Bias

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.040
This is also known as the Goebbels effect

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.030
Repeating the same lie often enough will eventually convince people

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.640
If you continue to repeat your opinion, even if it's wrong people will be more likely to accept it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.460
9. Wait till they're tired. If you're trying to convince someone, wait till they're tired

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.940
Research has shown that critical thinking goes out of the window when people are tired

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.280
and they're more likely to agree with whatever you're saying

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.019
10. Remind them of the benefits

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.329
When trying to convince someone to do something or to take a particular opinion always phrase your argument in terms of how they benefit

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.660
Always mention what you're offering them before you talk about what you want from them?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
11. Priming

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.020
A very interesting method is priming. There are many ways to do this and you can really get creative

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.180
What it really boils down to is substantially reminding people or encouraging people to do something or take a particular opinion

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.220
The classic example is if you want someone to write you a check make sure there's a checkbook nearby when you ask

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.980
But that's just scratching the surface when it comes to priming and there are plenty more examples of how this can work

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.880
12. Sensationalism. Get excited about whatever you're selling even if that's an opinion

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.720
Make sure the person thinks that the time is running out

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.800
There's a limited supply if they don't act now the opportunity will go away. You've probably seen this a lot in commercials

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.740
13. Make sure people are watching. This one only works if you're trying to convince someone to do the right thing and

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.960
Why wouldn't you be doing that? Anyway, when people are watching

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.380
Individuals feel like they're being judged by society at large. So they're more likely to do the right thing

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300
14. Choose your words carefully

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.080
Words have incredible power over people say please and thank you. Don't use big complicated words

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.100
It insults their intelligence. Nouns have more convincing power than Verbs. "Help her" instead of "Help".

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.460
There are countless examples of beneficial words and once to stay away from

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.900
15. Get your friends to agree with you. This is also known as the bandwagon effect

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.440
Make sure that people who you're trying to convince know that a lot of other people agree with you

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.240
Social media can be a huge help in this case.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.000
If everyone agrees with your opinion online more tend to jump on the bandwagon

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.300
So there you have it, 15 tried-and-true methods to persuade others
