00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.880
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.460
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Bangkok, Thailand,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.670
and today for lunch we're going to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.160
a restaurant called Sorn.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.180
Which specializes in
fine southern Thai food.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.693
And so the reason that
I'm so excited to eat here

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:14.440
is because southern
Thai food is my favorite

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.828
regional genre of Thai food.

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:19.040
It's a mix of spices and
herbs used in the cooking.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.320
It just always excites the taste buds.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.090
And the owners and chefs of Sorn,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.340
they're very good friends of mine,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.620
and I know for sure that they have gone

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.100
to some of the farthest
regions of southern Thailand

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.530
to source very very unique,
very rare-to-find ingredients.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.570
We are on our way to try some
amazing southern Thai food.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.237
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.120
Alright, we just arrived.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.810
It's really close to Pronghom,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.180
which is a big shopping district,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.040
but you just get back
into the neighborhood.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.818
So it's really quiet back here.

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:56.220
It's like a house compound,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.130
but you see sky-rise buildings around,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.085
and everyone should be
here soon for lunch.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:03.524
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:04.524
Thank you.

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:05.605
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:06.690
- It's almost like a museum in here.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.859
There are ingredients as
well as some artifacts.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.785
Man, that's the coconut grater.

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:15.933
A really really old one.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.220
Good to see you.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.240
- Good to see you.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.938
- [Mark] Congratulations
on opening this place.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:21.120
- Thank you.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.700
Our wood, it's big plies
from the old house wall.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.610
- Met up with Chef Yod.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.710
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.263
- He is the head chef here,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.170
and we're just walking around,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.970
and looking at the different rooms.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.200
And one of the interesting
things of all the beautiful

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.778
things is the floor.
(light instrumental music)

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:40.778
(people chattering)

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:44.965
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:45.984
- How was the dinner last night?

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:46.983
- [Mark] Really good.

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:47.988
- Were the guys taking care of you well?

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:48.984
- [Mark] Yes, very very good.
- Awesome, awesome.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:49.985
- [Mark] No, thank you man.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.412
It was so good.
- [Man] You're welcome.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:54.063
- It's really old Thai style.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.367
Oh and it remains so cold,

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.250
the metal remains so cold on your fingers.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.780
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.768
- [Mark] So really all of
the ingredients are Thai.

00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:09.263
- All ingredients from south, 100%.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:11.142
- [Mark] And they're all from Surat Thani.

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:11.975
- [Chef] From Surat, yeah.

00:02:11.975 --> 00:02:13.883
- Now I'm gonna go back into the kitchen,

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.769
and especially see them as they're making

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.970
a very very old Thai style of rice,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.360
that it's hard to find now.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.288
They have all of the
charcoal grills going.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:25.760
But immediately you step out here,

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.563
you can smell coconut,
you can smell their rice.

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:30.202
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:31.860
- [Mark] You can smell the shrimp paste.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.650
And so they cook in these clay pots.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.609
And oh, it's so fragrant.

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.470
But it's really really hard
to find this type of rice

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.535
because this type, cooked this way,

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:44.942
because you have to
continually monitor it.

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:46.546
It's so time consuming.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:49.405
You have to just sit here and monitor it,

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:50.900
taking out some of the water.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.350
And I know Ying said she
tried to make it one time,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.160
and it turned into rice soup.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.630
So you have to just monitor the water.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.480
But it wakes a lot of skill,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.770
but they're doing it
all the traditional way,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.470
which is gonna be the full flavor.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.256
Let me just quickly
introduce you to P Pup.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:07.089
- Hi.

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:12.286
- He's one of the ultimate food lovers,

00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:13.869
and just an amazing guy.

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:14.964
You gotta check out his
Instagram and his profile

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:15.797
because he eats some incredible food,

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:17.040
but we're gonna be eating together.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.830
And we're just starting the meal now.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.580
We're gonna start with small, small bites,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.130
and then proceed onto more dishes.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.170
But P Ice was telling me

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.060
there's gonna be 22 different dishes

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.816
that we're gonna try.

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:32.440
First bite, it's just a tiny little,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.620
like a slice of a cucumber,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.160
but it's stuffed with shrimp paste,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.030
and then to balance that out is a cashew,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.863
a roasted cashew on top.
(upbeat music)

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:44.343
Mm.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.860
It is almost like peanut buttery,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.380
but with that extraordinary
depth of flavor

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.044
from the shrimp paste.

00:03:53.044 --> 00:03:55.610
Okay, next course is here.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.100
Our sand mole crabs.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.180
These are just like little
tiny thumb sized crabs.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.860
A little dip into that seaweed powder.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.373
I've never had sand mole crabs before.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.953
Yeah.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.467
It almost kind of has
that fried soft shell crab

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.228
type of feel, but it just fully
crunches all the way though.

00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:19.401
How is it, Ying?

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:20.448
- It's very good.

00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:21.537
- [Mark] Have you ever had that before?

00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:23.346
- No, first time.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.179
- [Mark] How is it, P Pup?

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:25.120
- It's like popcorn.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.774
(all laughing)

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:29.047
Seven color lobster.

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.820
- Seven color lobster.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.824
- From Phuket.

00:04:31.824 --> 00:04:33.419
- And it's raw.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.417
And then what's on the top, seasoning?

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:35.418
- [Pup] It's like a
secret sauce, basically.

00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:37.663
- And just that color, that shimmer.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.783
Whoa.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.760
The texture.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.520
It's really sweet.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.000
I mean, naturally.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.440
And then like a little bit gummy,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.920
but muscular at the same time.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.160
And soft.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.330
Texture is unbelievable.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.680
So the next course you gotta eat fast,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.010
because it's sitting on a rice cracker

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.850
that's been grilled.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.200
And that is a curry,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.120
which is made from some of the
parts of the crab, I think.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.270
Oh that's lobster?

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.823
Oh it's lobster, okay.
(upbeat music)

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:15.430
Mm.

00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:19.130
Oh.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.410
Oh that's a beautiful one.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.653
So citrus-y.

00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:27.792
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:29.797
- Which is the best part
of the crab, I would say.

00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:32.540
Coat it in yellow curry.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.990
On top is actually the crab roe.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.390
Which they cook separately,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.740
because the roe and the meat itself

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.290
cook at different temperatures,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.000
so they only want the best textures.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.913
Like a bit gooey, runny
like egg yolk texture.

00:05:44.913 --> 00:05:46.050
- [Mark] It's exploding,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.180
and you can see it's
coated in curry sauce.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.250
But then the roe, which is
the really bright orange roe,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.330
that comes from the body
section of the crab,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.515
but then they've sort of
re-coated it onto the nugget.

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:59.493
- [Pup] The part of
everything of the crab.

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:00.823
- Yes.

00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:01.656
The best part of crab in one bite.

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:05.513
Cheers.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.590
- That sweetness from the meat.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.660
- Whoa.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.493
- We made it.

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:18.433
- That's just solid crab meat.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.030
Then with the richness of
the roe, and that curry,

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.970
to make it even more rich and flavorful.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.603
That was mind blowing-ly delicious.

00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:37.690
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.940
- So the next dish is
called Neua Gkaw Lae.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.570
It's a form of southern Thai grilled meat.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.300
Usually it's with chicken
you'll find in the south,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.400
but this is with beef,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.760
and you can just smell
the aroma of the garlic.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.670
It's also usually sweet,
coated in a coconut milk

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.123
kind of barbecue sauce.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.313
So rich and kinda like
fruity from the dates.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.100
Yeah, the flavor really
does keep on coming

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.641
as you keep on chewing that beef.

00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:07.641
(speaking in foreign language)
(upbeat music)

00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:21.863
- The next dish that we're
eating is called Kao Yam,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.140
which is a rice mixture, southern Thai.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.043
But this is the most beautiful
version I've ever seen.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:34.825
Oh man.

00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:36.994
Oh that's so good.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.850
It's salty, but then a little bit sweet,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.190
and again, you taste the
complexity of flavor.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.113
Especially from that dressing.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.420
The fermented fish end trail sauce

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.235
that he sprinkled on there.

00:07:51.235 --> 00:07:53.560
But then it's just wrapped
up with all of those herbs.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.163
It really is like solid herbs.

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:06.132
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.820
- The sour southern type
curry, my favorite dish.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.460
But with mangosteen, something
I've never had before.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.570
- Unripe mangosteen.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.920
- [Mark] Unripe mangosteen.

00:08:19.892 --> 00:08:23.809
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.770
- I kept thinking we were
about to start filming

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.131
and tasting but then
they kept bringing out

00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:33.471
more and more dishes.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.730
The table is now just
completely filled with food.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.080
She's about to serve me
some of the fresh rice.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.880
Right out of the clay pot.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.590
You can just, if you can just smell that.

00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.750
That aroma, it has a totally
different aroma to it.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.940
It's very very fragrant.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.400
You can smell a little bit of
the smoke and the charcoal.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.133
It's purely, purely fluffy.

00:08:57.434 --> 00:09:00.313
Oh, it's so much herbs in there too, yeah?

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:02.190
It's the Nam Prik, which is the chili dip,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.390
and this one is the one that we saw.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.370
It's the one roasted in the coconut shell.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.713
I'm gonna eat a little
bit of this with the rice.

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:12.517
Oh.

00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:18.226
The coconut-iness of that.

00:09:18.226 --> 00:09:19.059
A little bit spicy.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.870
You taste black pepper in there.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.463
Oh wow, that is superb.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.560
I love kumin khao, it's so earthy tasting.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.010
The soup that he just dished
out, so it's hot and fresh,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.933
and this is like a egg sausage.

00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:36.809
I'll try that.

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:37.793
Oh it actually floats in your spoon.

00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:38.819
Look at that.

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:39.817
You gotta make sure it doesn't

00:09:39.817 --> 00:09:40.873
float out of your spoon before you eat it.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.050
Yeah, the egg just melts in your mouth.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.710
Almost like a pudding.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.747
So it's (speaking in foreign language),

00:09:50.253 --> 00:09:52.398
or sometimes also called
(speaking in foreign language),

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:54.033
which is the sour or
yellow southern Thai curry.

00:09:54.033 --> 00:09:58.720
It's one of my favorite
dishes in all of Thailand.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.670
It's orange from turmeric,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.950
but there's a lot of chilies in there,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.133
a lot of garlic.

00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:06.960
(upbeat music)

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.793
Mm.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.600
Oh wow.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.250
It's such a depth of flavor.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.537
You get all that mustardy turmeric flavor,

00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:21.400
but you can eat the entire
mangosteen without the seeds,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.690
and as you keep on tasting it,

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.103
you start to feel a little
bit of the chili heat.

00:10:28.076 --> 00:10:29.020
- You hear that sound?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.228
- [Mark] Yeah, you're in the crunchiness.

00:10:31.228 --> 00:10:33.041
- [Pip] Oh, it's really good.

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.374
(crunching)

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.550
- The whole table can
hear you crunching that.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.970
That's what you want.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.733
Oh, but the contrast.

00:10:42.813 --> 00:10:47.813
It's so crispy, and then
so gooey, creamy, tender,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.790
melt in your mouth.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:50.840
All at the same time.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.043
Oh whoa.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.252
That's just condensed.

00:10:58.252 --> 00:11:02.210
It's like, I mean, a powerful flavor,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.723
but still very well balanced.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:05.923
- [Pup] Okay, stinky beans.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.410
- [Mark] Stink beans,
which are called Sataw,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.320
which is one of my ultimate favorite

00:11:13.558 --> 00:11:15.460
single ingredients in the entire world.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.330
Paired with the squid, small squid.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.163
Are they baby squid?

00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:20.778
- [Pup] Yeah.

00:11:20.778 --> 00:11:21.776
- [Mark] Baby squid.

00:11:21.776 --> 00:11:23.480
(upbeat music)

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.280
- [Pup] If you look at
the stinky bean carefully,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.840
they cut each stinky bean.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.970
- [Mark] Oh yeah.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.833
- So the flavor can penetrate
through the stinky bean more.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:34.666
- [Mark] Okay the next
one is the Kaeng tai pla,

00:11:34.666 --> 00:11:38.070
which is the fish viscera innards curry.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.160
Another one of my favorite
southern Thai dishes.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.680
They've taken it to a very gourmet level.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.090
I mean, still remaining the same,

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.870
but adding in lots of ingredients.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.530
Prepare you with such precision,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.660
as they have done with all the dishes.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.127
There's also the (speaking
in foreign language),

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.040
which are the seeds of jack fruit,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.680
which have been roasted over charcoal,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.675
and then were turned into this curry.

00:11:58.675 --> 00:12:00.930
(upbeat music)

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.700
The jackfruit seed is
almost like potato-y.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.100
Starchy.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.430
And you got the roasted fish,

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.220
which is very aromatic.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.520
And again, the citrus-iness,
or the zesty- ness,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.930
of those (speaking in foreign language)

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.113
come in so nice.
(upbeat music)

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:21.850
Just superb flavor.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.313
What an incredible meal.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.393
Next level.

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:30.202
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.260
- If you like it more like
a lot of the curry sauce,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.380
or a little bit of the curry sauce.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.050
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.710
I like a lot of curry sauce.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.180
This is another beautiful dish,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.450
and three components to it.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.930
The rice, the shrimp
curry, and the papaya,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.120
the shredded green papaya.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.720
So you kind get a little bit of everything

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.113
onto this bite.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:57.883
Oh wow.

00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:04.530
You've got more of an undertone
of dry spice in there.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.680
And then you taste that rich coconut.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.803
It has like a Malay taste to it.

00:13:09.803 --> 00:13:14.420
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.163
It's just unbelievable flavor.

00:13:18.793 --> 00:13:19.626
Next up is a palate cleanser,

00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:21.890
so after we finish the spicy curries,

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.836
and it is made from (speaking
in foreign language)

00:13:25.836 --> 00:13:27.103
which is the torched ginger flower.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.770
That's so complimenting to the sourness.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.700
Just like a hint of,
it's almost like a floral

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.569
gingery taste to it.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:42.140
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.140
- Okay next dessert is the
coconut sugar ice cream,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.870
with roasted coconut, but
a part of the coconut.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.396
Special, I'm still not
totally sure exactly.

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:58.396
X Men, X Men coconut is
what they're telling me.

00:13:58.852 --> 00:14:01.102
(laughing)

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:05.009
Mm.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.200
Oh wow.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.650
Pinch on a little bit of
salt onto the ice cream.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.541
Alright.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:15.673
And then take another bite.

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:27.950
Oh the salt brings out the flavor.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.703
And just like magnifies it.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.560
The next dessert, I
think the final dessert.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.690
There's some fruits with some ice.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.120
Mash up the ice.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.853
So it's kind of like (speaking
in foreign language).

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.770
Fruit salad.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.345
Mash up the ice so you
get the crunchy ice.

00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:46.430
Oh this one is a--

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.330
Those are little ice cubes.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.120
I wanna get some of that pomelo.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.120
Oh there's fried shallots in there, too.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.190
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.960
- You've got that crunchy ice,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.793
which is very cool,

00:15:00.793 --> 00:15:02.520
and then all the different fruits.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.357
But it's more complex than that

00:15:04.357 --> 00:15:06.245
because you've got the ginger,

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:09.247
you've got the zest of the
(speaking in foreign language),

00:15:10.818 --> 00:15:11.920
the citrus, and the crispy shallots.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.070
Which kinda give it a
totally different twist.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.743
And so you just kinda mash up this ice.

00:15:17.743 --> 00:15:20.940
I'll try the (speaking in
foreign language) next.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.290
That's just an amazing,
refreshing combination.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.177
That ice keeps hitting
my tooth, it's so cold.

00:15:33.177 --> 00:15:35.427
(laughing)

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:39.175
(upbeat music)

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.360
It's about five hours later.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.360
We ended up hanging out and just enjoying

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.300
the atmosphere and the food at Sorn.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.570
The food was extraordinary.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.780
That was an incredible meal.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.485
And I love their philosophy of

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:56.010
preserving southern Thai food,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:58.110
but refining it at the same time.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.200
And all the dishes were--

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.860
Oh, one thing I have to mention

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.690
that I didn't mention before is that

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.310
they don't take any shortcuts.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.129
So even all of the curry
pastes are pounded by hand.

00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:11.880
No blending, no shortcuts like that.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.050
And that's what really brings
out the depth of flavor.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.460
And so you taste all of the ingredients,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.895
all the multitude of ingredients

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:22.006
that they use in their cooking.

00:16:22.006 --> 00:16:25.340
I love how almost 100% of the ingredients

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.520
are not just local from Thailand,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.560
but local from Southern Thailand,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.200
and P Ice and P Yot are just committed

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.570
to preserving the authenticity,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.530
but then refining southern Thai cuisine.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.473
I wanna say a huge thank you
to P Ice and P Yot and P Pup.

00:16:39.473 --> 00:16:42.169
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:43.770
That was just an extraordinary meal.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.530
And I'll have all the information

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.400
of the restaurant below
in the description box.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.610
But if you have a chance,
when you're in Bangkok,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.961
check out Sorn.

00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:54.000
They're doing just fantastic things

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.350
for southern Thai food,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.237
and it's for sure gonna be a meal that

00:16:58.237 --> 00:16:59.857
you will never forget.
