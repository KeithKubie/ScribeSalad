00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.480
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Look at this. I let go of the cup,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.260
and I don't even know 
if it's me or the other cups.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.560
It's me.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.320
Hey guys. I'm Nate.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.420
Welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.500
Not too long ago, we showed you how to
build a full-sized, functioning crossbow.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.100
Well, today we are going to scale
that way down, and make a desktop

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.860
crossbow using popsicle sticks,
a clothespin, and a ballpoint pen.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.500
In addition to the popsicle sticks,
clothespin, and pen, we'll also have

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.910
some strong tape and two rubber 
bands: one regular rubber band,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.440
and one wide rubber band.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.320
The first step is going to be to take
our pen apart into its individual pieces.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.100
With some pens, the back will pop off
easily, some, you'll need a small tool

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.880
like I'm using to fit in between the cap
and the body of the pen, and sometimes,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.330
it's going to be so stuck in there, you
might have to use a drill to get it out.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.230
For this build, we won't be
using the front or back cap of the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.000
pen, so you can discard those.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.170
Now we want to take the body of the pen,
and divide it into three equal pieces.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.300
A hacksaw and a vise might be overkill,
but it is going to make it pretty easy.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
And don't worry.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.610
If your divisions
aren't perfectly in thirds,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.040
it won't make a difference.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.500
Let's just clean up the 
sawed-off ends of our pens

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.880
so they're nice and smooth again.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.820
Now that we have our
three sections of pen,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.960
let's grab two of our popsicle sticks
and start attaching them together.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.560
We want to take two ends of the pen
and sandwich them between the two

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080
popsicle sticks using tape.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.900
The tape I'm using is super
sticky, and will stick to my gloves,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.780
so I'm gonna take those off for a bit.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.300
I'm just going to use a fairly
thin piece of this tape because while

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.870
I do want it to wrap all the way 
around I don't want it to cover the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.170
entire length of the popsicle sticks.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.850
Let's see if we can get this to attach.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.700
I think this is the trickiest
part of the build â€“ is getting these

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.210
pieces of pen to sandwich just
right in between the two sticks.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.470
Note that as I'm closing it, I'm
leaving a slight gap between the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.300
end of the popsicle sticks,
and the edge of the pen barrel.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.140
There we go.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.180
We've got one side pretty well
sandwiched in between there.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.900
And you can see that I've
only put tape on one edge.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.270
I'm not covering up the
entire barrel of the pen.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.610
That's because we're going to be
fitting something else in between

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.840
these popsicle sticks later, and
they need to have some flex to them.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.340
If we put tape all the way across,
they won't be able to spread out enough.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.880
This right here is going to be the
crossarm of our crossbow.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.420
Next up, we'll want two more
popsicle sticks, and a clothespin.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.670
We want to attach one popsicle
stick to either side

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.580
of the outside of our clothespin.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.279
We're going to use the tape again
to attach it to the clothespin,

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.989
but because we still need the
clothespin to be able to open,

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.099
we can't just wrap tape
around the whole thing.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.120
That would keep it closed.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.489
So we need to attach the sticks
one at a time, wrapping the tape

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.240
through the inside of the clothespin.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.500
Our popsicle stick should overlap
the clothespin by about one inch.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980
Our popsicle sticks are now attached
to the clothespin and they can still

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.780
open and close with ease.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.459
We now want to take the third piece
of the pen barrel, and secure that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.750
between the two ends of
the two popsicle sticks.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.319
However, before that gets secured
in place, we need to take our wide

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.090
rubber band, and put it
between the two sticks.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.590
Once our barrel is attached,
we won't be able to get the rubber band

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.580
in and out anymore.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.200
Before when we attach the pen
barrel between two sticks,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.360
we left a small gap between the edge
of the sticks and where the pen was.

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.500
We now want to have the barrel of
the pen extend a little bit

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.560
beyond the popsicle sticks.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.800
With the ends of the popsicle sticks,
secure it around the barrel of the pen.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.060
The clothespin can't open the same
way it did before but it should still

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.800
be able to open enough to work
as a firing mechanism.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.420
We now need to fit this end
of the pen barrel and popsicle sticks

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.380
in between these two popsicle sticks.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.620
It's gonna be a pretty tight fit,
and these popsicle sticks will need to

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.100
flex quite a bit before it
really gets in there.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.419
Let's now use our regular rubber band
to secure the attachment point between

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.100
the crossarm and the rest of the
body of our crossbow.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.060
Take the wide rubber band and stretch
it around the two ends of the crossarm.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.540
This is why we left a gap between the
end of the pen, and the

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.919
end of the popsicle sticks.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.540
It will hold the wide rubber
band securely in place.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.110
We can now see that when we draw
the rubber band back

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.979
and place it between the jaws
of the clothespin, we can squeeze

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.660
on the back, and it'll fire.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.860
We still should have this plastic
collar, that was a part of our pen,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.180
and we can fit that into the barrel
in the front of the crossbow.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.140
This will help our crossbow fire
just a little bit more accurately.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.120
Now let's draw back the rubber band
and fit the pen in through

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.540
the collar at the front.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.960
I find the easiest way to load this
thing so it will accurately fire

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.550
is to first fit the pen into the jaws
of the clothespin, and then draw

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.320
the rubber band back behind it.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.270
The rubber band should be pushing up
against the back of the pen so that

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.640
when we squeeze the
clothespin, it will fire.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200
Weeee.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.639
I think went about 25 feet.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.639
Not too bad.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.250
It may also work to take the pen
barrel and just press it all the way

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.400
back into the clothespin jaws, but
sometimes, sometimes that might happen.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.370
But also sometimes the body of the
pen isn't quite strong enough to push

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.700
against the rubber band and it may end
up bending, and you may have a hard time

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.880
getting it all the way back
into the clothespin.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.180
Worked pretty well that time.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.520
Let's shoot this styrofoam cup.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.200
This is working pretty well,
but I think we can clean this up,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.460
make it pretty, and just all-around
have a slightly nicer build.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.970
Let's see what we can come up with.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.080
Our first crossbow is built,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.750
and for our second updated one,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.000
we've got the same basic materials:
four popsicle sticks, a clothespin,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.140
a pen, and a wide rubber band.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.850
Same first step as well,
let's disassemble our pen,

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.729
and let's chop this pen down into pieces.

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.440
I'll have one piece the same length as
the three that I cut out the first time,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.600
but the other two pieces,
I'm actually going to cut a little bit

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.180
shorter so they're just attached to
the ends of the popsicle stick's arms,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.920
and not all the way into the middle.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.740
Now let's take two of our popsicle
sticks and our two short pieces,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.240
and try and secure that all together
using some super glue.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.900
To make the glue adhere a little bit
better to the pen body,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.560
let's scuff it up with some sandpaper.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.680
Super glue is quite strong but it
doesn't cure instantly,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.729
so while the first two pieces of
the pen tube are gluing on to the

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.760
popsicle stick, let's also attach our
two popsicle sticks onto our clothespin.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.240
It's holding all right, so let's put
glue on the top of the pens,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.760
and then the other side of the
popsicle stick on top of that.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.319
Let's fit our rubber band in between
our popsicle sticks into the clothespin,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.780
and then add our third piece of pen
body in between those sticks.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.020
Now, super glue can be pretty strong
stuff, but I want to make sure that

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.590
this isn't going to tear itself
apart when I'm firing,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.860
so let's reinforce it with some hot glue.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.780
We've got the two halves
of our crossbow ready,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.550
so now let's mount them together pretty
much the same way we did before,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.719
only instead of a rubber band, we're
gonna use glue to make it permanent.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.849
I find the easiest way to fit it
through the gap is to push it in

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:33.340
sideways, and then twist it.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.880
So use a couple drops of
super glue, and then reinforce

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.580
it using our hot glue.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.280
Let's insert the collar the
same way we did before.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.580
The main build of this crossbow
is coming along nicely,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.440
so it's time to add on
a few upgrades.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.279
Let's take apart another pen,
and we'll save the collar and

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.620
the ink cartridge that we
use as our ammunition.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.910
Let's take a bit of hot glue,
and use that to attach the plastic

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.460
collar underneath the
arm of the crossbow.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.020
The second collar on the bottom of
our crossbow can now be used to hold

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.889
extra ammunition so your crossbow
is just one shot before you have to

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.139
go find where your pen landed.

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.849
Another modification I want
to make to this crossbow is

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:09.469
to give it a laser sight.

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:12.360
So we're gonna mount a laser
pointer right on top of this thing.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.180
To make sure that our laser pointer
isn't pointing in the wrong direction,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.940
let's add another small piece of
popsicle stick on the back

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.480
to keep our laser perfectly level 
with the rest of our crossbow.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.640
Before we attach our 
laser pointer, you know that

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.200
we like to add some color to things 
here, so let's grab some paint,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.300
and make this thing look really fancy.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.620
I'm going to leave this spot,
and most of this stick unpainted

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.140
because that's where I'm going 
to glue the laser pointer on.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.040
But everything else,
I think is gonna get painted.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.800
This is just acrylic paint that
usually costs about one dollar for

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.540
a bottle at any craft store.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.800
Now, once we stretch our rubber band
across the front of our bow,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.400
it is ready to use.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.380
Now we need to test out our
laser-guided popsicle stick crossbow.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.560
Let's grab a target,
and start shooting.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.820
We've got our two crossbows.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.990
Let's test them out.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.980
Three. Two. One.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.780
Oh, it went -

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.580
right between the gap of the cups.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.510
All right, no, I've got
another shot right here.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.530
Wish I were that good of a shot
to do that on purpose.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.880
All right, trying this again.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.860
Three, two, one.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.260
The exact same spot.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.460
All right, let's try the other
crossbow with the laser sight.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.350
Maybe that'll fix the problem.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.320
Here we go.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.300
Three, two, one.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.580
Ha!

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.380
All right.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.340
Trying not to go through the gap.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.400
Three, two, one.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:02.820
Ha!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.880
Cleared that top cover
right off there.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.860
Perfect.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.400
A miniature crossbow made from
popsicle sticks, a clothespin,

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.850
and a rubber band.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.870
And of course, the upgraded version
where we painted it, added a laser

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.270
guidance system, and an additional
shot held on to the bottom.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.040
These things work really well.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.220
Get pretty good distance on them,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.680
about 30 feet, and of course,
they're great for target practice.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.680
Hey guys!
Thanks for watching.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.200
If you're not a subscriber yet,
just hit the bomb to get in the club.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.360
If you missed our last video or
want to watch it again,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.740
just click up here at the top.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.570
Click down there if you want to see
what the internet thinks

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.720
that you should watch next.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.600
That's it for now.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.300
Have fun, be safe,
and see you tomorrow
