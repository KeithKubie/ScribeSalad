00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.497
On August 28th, 1963,

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:13.050
Martin Luther King Jr. delivered 
his “I Have a Dream” speech

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.031
at the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom.

00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:16.953
That day,

00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.343
nearly a quarter million people

00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:19.912
gathered on the national mall

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:23.892
to demand an end to the discrimination,
segregation, violence,

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:26.740
and economic exclusion 
black people still faced

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.846
across the United States.

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.406
None of it would have been possible 
without the march’s chief organizer

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:35.183
– a man named Bayard Rustin.

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:37.035
Rustin grew up in a Quaker household,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.803
and began peacefully protesting
racial segregation in high school.

00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:43.390
He remained committed to 
pacifism throughout his life,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.809
and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious 
objector to World War II.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.432
During his two-year imprisonment,

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:54.182
he protested the segregated 
facilities from within.

00:00:54.182 --> 00:00:55.713
Wherever Rustin went,

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.586
he organized and advocated, 

00:00:57.586 --> 00:01:00.943
and was constantly attuned to the 
methods, groups, and people

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:03.587
who could help further 
messages of equality.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:04.982
He joined the Communist Party

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:08.272
when black American’s civil rights 
were one of its priorities,

00:01:08.272 --> 00:01:11.526
but soon became disillusioned by the 
party’s authoritarian leanings

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:12.964
and left.

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:14.107
In 1948,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.405
he traveled to India to learn the 
peaceful resistance strategies

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.357
of the recently assassinated 
Mahatma Gandhi.

00:01:20.357 --> 00:01:22.080
He returned to the United States

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.545
armed with strategies 
for peaceful protest,

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.094
including civil disobedience.

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:30.525
He began to work with 
Martin Luther King Jr in 1955,

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:32.536
and shared these ideas with him.

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:34.439
As King’s prominence increased,

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.514
Rustin became his main advisor,

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:39.966
as well as a key strategist in the 
broader civil rights movement.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.821
He brought his organizing expertise 

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.618
to the 1956 bus boycotts 
in Montgomery, Alabama

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:46.366
—in fact,

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.579
he had organized and participated 
in a transportation protest

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.568
that helped inspire the boycotts 
almost a decade before.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:57.526
His largest-scale organizing project 
came in 1963,

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:01.009
when he led the planning for the 
national march on Washington.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.778
The possibility of riots that could 
injure marchers

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:07.715
and undermine their message of peaceful 
protest was a huge concern.

00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:11.071
Rustin not only worked with the DC 
police and hospitals to prepare,

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:15.841
but organized and trained a volunteer 
force of 2,000 security marshals.

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:17.901
In spite of his deft management,

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.137
some of the other organizers did 
not want Rustin to march in front

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:24.962
with other leaders from the south, 
because of his homosexuality.

00:02:24.962 --> 00:02:26.321
Despite these slights,

00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:29.268
Rustin maintained his focus,
and on the day of the march

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:30.889
he delivered the
marchers' demands

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.098
in a speech directed at 
President John F. Kennedy.

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:37.628
The march itself proceeded smoothly,
without any violence.

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:41.522
It has been credited with helping pass 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act,

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:45.760
which ended segregation in public places 
and banned employment discrimination,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.974
and the 1965 Voting Rights Act,

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:51.264
which outlawed discriminatory 
voting practices.

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:53.192
In spite of his decades of service,

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:57.737
Rustin’s positions on certain political 
issues were unpopular among his peers.

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.777
Some thought he wasn’t critical enough 
of the Vietnam War,

00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:04.153
or that he was too eager to collaborate
with the political establishment

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:06.772
including the president and congress.

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:09.900
Others were uncomfortable with his 
former communist affiliation.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.709
But ultimately,

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.239
both his belief
in collaboration

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.884
with the government 
and his membership

00:03:13.884 --> 00:03:15.094
to the communist party

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.714
had been driven by his desire
to maximize tangible gains

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.424
in liberties for black Americans,

00:03:19.424 --> 00:03:21.448
and to do so as quickly as possible.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:26.161
Rustin was passed over for several 
influential roles in the 1960s and 70s,

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:28.337
but he never stopped his activism.

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:29.627
In the 1980s,

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.147
he publicly came out as gay,
and was instrumental

00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:36.660
in drawing attention to the AIDS crisis
until his death in 1987.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.923
In 2013,

00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:40.470
fifty years after the March On Washington,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.519
President Barack Obama posthumously 
awarded him

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.539
the Presidential Medal of Freedom,

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.560
praising Rustin’s 
“march towards true equality,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.400
no matter who we are 
or who we love.”
