KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.780
We are on site today at
Founder World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.500
Joining me in the studio
is Monica Phillips

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.240
from Spark Plug Labs.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.653
She's a motivational speaker
and a leadership coach.

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:13.694
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:14.650
MONICA PHILLIPS: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.441
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:17.610
So let's start with
Spark Plug Labs.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.515
Tell me about that.

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:20.098
MONICA PHILLIPS: I
started my business

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:24.630
two years ago after coaching
and leading marketing

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990
and development for 18 years.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.110
And I woke up one day, and I
knew there was something more

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.620
for me.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.210
And I really wanted to
help people every day.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.300
And so I started Spark Plug
Labs as a coaching philosophy

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.492
to help people move from
inspiration to action.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.700
And I work with a lot of
start ups and tech founders.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.260
And I find that so often,
we are our own hindrance

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.850
in the way of our success.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.100
And we have these paths
and these journeys,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.950
and we have this
saboteur-- that voice

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.940
on the side of our
shoulder that says,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.655
oh, you said you
wanted to do that,

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:01.290
but you don't really
want to do that.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.070
It would be too much work.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.190
And I work with people around
habits, accountability,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.460
challenges, values,
articulation--

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.140
so that everyone can lead
a really fulfilling life.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.260
And unapologetically take
breaks and reward themselves

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.970
and enjoy every step of the way.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.290
And sometimes it is hard.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.450
KORY JEFFREY: So let's
start at the 10,000 feet.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.190
What is the difference in the
philosophy for Spark Plug Labs

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.776
as opposed to anything else?

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.150
MONICA PHILLIPS:
So my philosophy

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.650
is do something everyday that
matters, set great habits,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.820
lead a thrilling life, and
you will hit your goals.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.350
And it's what we do and how
we show up that matters.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.210
And it is always showing
up and keeping your focus.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.820
So I was on a panel
with Sami Inkinen once,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.900
and he said don't do 90% of
the things that you're doing.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.730
And I love that.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.310
I think it is so true.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.670
So much of what we do,
we don't need to do.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.050
We could be doing
the top 2% of it.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.990
So a lot of people
I work with who

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.190
are stuck because
they're doing too much,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.169
and they can't get the
right things done-- we

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.710
look at what is they're doing.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.310
Let's write down everything
you have to do, and then

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.650
take away everything that you
could delegate to someone else.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.990
And delegate it.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.200
And what is your core list?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.550
What are the three things
you have to do this week?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.780
And honestly, when we have
more than three to five things

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.830
on our list, we get stuck
because there's so much,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.168
we don't know where to begin.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.945
KORY JEFFREY: So we talked a
little bit about habit forming,

00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.028
and you're talking a little
bit about list making.

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:38.952
How does one go about
forming good habits?

00:02:38.952 --> 00:02:40.910
MONICA PHILLIPS: So one
of my favorite examples

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.390
that I will give for
myself lately-- I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.510
was bombarded with paperwork.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.200
And I run my own business,
and I have to file taxes,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.332
and I can't even get
it to my accountant

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:52.040
because it would make
no sense to anyone.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.260
It was a mess.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.320
And actually the
biggest limitation

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.730
was just making a decision.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.940
There were so many options
that were available.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.970
I finally decided on
Shoeboxed and Xero.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.190
And Shoeboxed saved all my
receipts and business cards.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.860
It syncs with Xero, my
online bookkeeping tool,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.400
and I can send that
to any accountant.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.500
And they can make sense of
this chaos that I once had.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.860
Overnight, I created a habit.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.110
Every time I get a receipt,
I'll take a picture of it.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.370
I have the Shoeboxed app.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.440
I get a receipt, I
take a picture of it,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.370
and it automatically gets saved.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.180
It's searchable by
location, by amount--

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.790
I can identify whether it's
reimbursable or deductible.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.370
And I have gotten rid of
all my paper receipts.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.420
I also mailed a bunch
of them in-- Tissue Box

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.110
which then scans them for you.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.249
Because I had a backlog,
a drawer full of receipts.

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.040
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.490
MONICA PHILLIPS: It was my
shame corner, and that's gone.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.052
It's something like that,
where it's really easy.

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:50.510
It's not about the success of
the habit you want to create.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.310
It's about the intention.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.290
So I want to run a marathon.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.870
OK, great.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.381
That means tomorrow, I'm
going to run five miles.

00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:58.380
So what do I need to do?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.880
I need to put on
my running clothes.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.500
So after I brush my
teeth every night,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.650
I set my running clothes
out on the floor.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.811
That's the intention.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.310
When you wake up in the morning
and you see your gym clothes

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.320
on the floor, it's a lot
easier to run five miles

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.300
than if you're just waking up.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.780
You're rolling out of bed,
you're not really sure,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.600
maybe not.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.450
It's nice and warm
and cozy in your bed.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.240
It might be cold outside, or
it might be too hot outside.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.890
What is that you're
giving yourself?

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.454
And then being OK
with not doing it.

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:25.870
Maybe you don't
do it one morning.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.770
Maybe it's Sunday, and
you have brunch plans,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.470
and you don't run
the five miles.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.670
OK, let it go.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.120
Don't run 10 miles the next day.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.150
Don't make it so hard
that you can't do it.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.709
But be OK with missing a day.

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:40.500
Don't miss two days,
don't miss three days,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.470
don't miss four days.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.270
Then it's not a habit anymore.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.670
So something that's
really simple

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.350
where you set the intention.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.250
You know that there's
a vision, and you know

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.350
what the success looks like.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.300
KORY JEFFREY: So what is your
role in this when you engage?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.580
When Spark Plug Labs
engages, what do you guys

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.039
do in that equation?

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.455
MONICA PHILLIPS: The first
need I do, is I look at values.

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:02.980
And I think that's something
that's sometimes is overlooked,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.040
where we're coaching
around a specific skill.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.340
I'm looking at the
values of a person,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.060
and the values of a
team, and the culture.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.780
How do people work together?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.370
What do they want to mean?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.970
When they wake up
in five years, what

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.270
do they want people to
say about themselves?

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.120
And then what does
that mean for me today?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.870
Who am I being?

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.620
Am I being that person, or
am I being someone else?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.390
And if that's what I want,
and we're working together,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.290
and my client says one thing
and acts another way, I can say,

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.610
hey look-- you said
you wanted this.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.665
But that's not what
you're giving yourself.

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:37.290
And here's where I'm
going to challenge

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.080
you to stretch yourself more.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.490
And it could be very specific,
business growth strategies,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.900
market strategy, team
building, leadership skills.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.150
So I coach around all of those
soft skills of what it means

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.040
to build a great organization.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.400
It's also how we show up
every day for ourselves.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.150
Because if we don't
want it for ourselves,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.040
it's a lot harder to
give that someone else.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.900
KORY JEFFREY: Right.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.590
MONICA PHILLIPS: I know that
it's probably an old cliche

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.990
that you have to love
yourself before you

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.906
can love someone else.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.650
And I think that's true,
really true for start ups.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.660
You have to really
love what you're doing,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.260
so you can share that passion
with everyone who's around you.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.560
KORY JEFFREY: So, and not
to paint with broad strokes,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.998
you said you work with technical
and non-technical people,

00:06:18.998 --> 00:06:20.934
start up people,
non-start up people,

00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.390
big companies, small companies.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.300
Is there any trends
you've seen between

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.620
the technical and nontechnical?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.760
Are their ways that
certain types of people

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.960
get in their own way?

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.208
Is there anything
like that that you've

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.374
noticed through your career?

00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:36.610
MONICA PHILLIPS: It's very
similar across the board, not

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.210
industry specific.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.850
But I would say that,
with all of my clients,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.610
the biggest
differentiator I've seen

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.480
for those who are successful
and those who maybe don't get

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.240
as far in setting the habits
and seeing real shift in terms

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.270
of what they want when they set
goals or they have big dreams

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.720
is-- I work with people
who have huge dreams.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.140
And when you think about
coaching an executive

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.410
who's at a top-funded start up.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.130
They are doing a lot.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.040
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.581
MONICA PHILLIPS: What I see that
makes the most difference is

00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:10.280
writing it down.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.230
And that's across the board.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.480
Writing down your goals,
writing down your strategies,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.110
being really intentional.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.290
And it sounds harsh sometimes.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.520
But what I look at really
deeply is relationships.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.180
Because we are
surrounded by technology.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.760
Here I am talking to a
channel for Google Developers.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.072
And at the end of the
day, it's about the person

00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:32.530
sitting across from
you who's going

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.030
to make the difference
in that relationship.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.920
So do you have the
right relationships?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.045
Are you connected to people
who could introduce you

00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:41.170
to the right relationships?

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.660
If not, where do you
find those people?

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.390
And how you set intentions
around getting those people

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.870
in your life?

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.460
KORY JEFFREY: So Founder World.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.317
What attracts you to
an event like this?

00:07:52.317 --> 00:07:54.650
MONICA PHILLIPS: Oh, I love
everything about this event.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.120
I love innovation
and entrepreneurship.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.060
I came this morning
to air my radio show

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.040
live from Founder World.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.440
So I got to interview in
the same hour Bill Reichert,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.510
founder of Garage
Technology Ventures,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.910
Yvonne Cagle, a NASA astronaut.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.900
It just-- so many interesting
people, all within an hour.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.165
I interviewed 10
people, I think.

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.290
KORY JEFFREY: Sounds like--

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.877
MONICA PHILLIPS: You can find
it on-- yeah, yeah, I know.

00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:23.210
It was a really great interview.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.640
You can find it online
at SparkPlugLabs.co

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.220
and it's Powerful Conversations.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.330
It's also in the iTunes Store.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.677
Just fun conversations.

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:34.635
That's what I come for.

00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:37.960
I come to share my passion
in wanting people to succeed.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.210
I find that in other
parts of the country,

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.030
not everyone wants
mutual success.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.580
And when you come
to Silicon Valley,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.930
I find that what makes
it still really special

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.990
is that people here
want others to succeed.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.170
And so while there's,
of course, competition--

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.054
KORY JEFFREY: Sure.

00:08:55.054 --> 00:08:56.970
MONICA PHILLIPS: I'm
going to compete with you

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.610
and go ahead and make it better.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.880
I would love to see that.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.560
And it's really fun to
be surrounded by people

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.930
who are trying something new.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.064
Not because they have
the most original idea,

00:09:06.064 --> 00:09:07.480
but because they
want to work hard

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.157
for something that matters.

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:11.490
KORY JEFFREY: Obviously your
job is a lot around people,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.900
relationships,
attitudes, behaviors.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.170
But is there anything in
the world of tech right

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.320
now that excited you?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.840
Is there anything?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.050
MONICA PHILLIPS: Well, I just
went on a tour of Singularity

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.810
with my friend Pascal Finette.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.190
And it was really
cool, and I totally

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.790
loved the virtual
reality roller coaster.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.280
That was great.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.860
I brought four kids with
me, my own included.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.032
And they loved it.

00:09:38.032 --> 00:09:39.240
We all-- the adults loved it.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.880
I loved it.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.700
KORY JEFFREY:
Something for everyone.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.590
MONICA PHILLIPS: I have a
former client who runs re:3D,

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.300
the largest format 3D printer,
and is working on printing from

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.040
recycled plastic bottles.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.880
So really making a difference
in the larger scope of things.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.570
What I'm most
excited about here--

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.350
what I've seen a lot of on this
show-- is space exploration.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.440
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.940
Awesome.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.680
MONICA PHILLIPS: I got to talk
to an astronaut this morning.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.670
And talking with
Yvonne Cagle-- what

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.550
is possible in what we're
doing here on Earth,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.205
and what that means
for space exploration.

00:10:16.205 --> 00:10:18.580
It's really something I have
to put my head around still.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.260
It's kind of cool.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.745
KORY JEFFREY: So, favorite
Google technology?

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:25.120
MONICA PHILLIPS:
You know, I knew

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.245
you were going to ask that.

00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:28.045
It's a tricky one.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:31.080
Like we were saying, when
technology becomes so seamless

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.254
that you don't even
know how great it is,

00:10:33.254 --> 00:10:34.700
that's when technology's won.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.120
And for me, it's
certainly Gmail.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.775
My new favorite though, because
I work on the fly constantly,

00:10:39.775 --> 00:10:41.840
is Google Sheets.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.745
Google Docs.

00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:43.620
Google Docs is great.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.320
I use Google Sheets even more.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.660
I can share data, I
can open it anywhere.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.948
It's so easy to use.

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:49.760
KORY JEFFREY: I'm
sure the Sheets

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.900
team would love to hear that.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.585
That's awesome.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:52.210
It's a big win.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.150
Awesome.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.545
Well, thank you for joining.

00:10:54.545 --> 00:10:56.463
And thank you guys for joining.

00:10:56.463 --> 00:11:00.960
We're live on location at
Founder World in San Francisco.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.610
