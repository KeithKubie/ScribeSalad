00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.130
As of July of 2013, one and a half

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.560
million new Android devices were being activated every day.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.080
So it's hard to believe that just a few

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.960
years ago, I started all meetings with potential developers explaining

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.079
what Android was and convincing them that it was

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.560
worth their time and effort developing for the platform.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.150
It wasn't until 2010 that we even shared numbers

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.080
to indicate the growth of the platform, 100,000 daily activations

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.729
in May of that year. Which quickly grew to

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:33.290
500,000 in mid-2011 and crossed the million daily activations mark

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.340
in 2012. That represents over a billion Android devices around

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940
the world, which is why I don't start my presentations

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.320
asking if anyone in the room has an Android device

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.480
anymore. To me though, the biggest surprise in those early

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.610
days was how much effort was required to convince people

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.580
that developing for mobile at all was a worthwhile investment.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.700
A huge number of people use their phones to go

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.810
online and many of them use their phone as the main

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.808
way to do so. One study by the Pew Research

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:04.163
Internet Project in 2013 found that nearly two-thirds of mobile owners

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:07.111
use their phones to go online, double the rate found

00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:09.810
in 2009. And that a third of phone users use mostly

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.970
their phone to get online. Think about that for a second.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.730
These portable phones have become pocket computers constantly connected to the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.910
cloud to make the sum of human knowledge available

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.530
to us at a touch and a glance. It's no

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.870
wonder then that for a growing number of people,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.050
mobile isn't how to get online when you're away from

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.610
your desk. It's actually displacing PCs as their primary

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.460
computing platform. The change is so dramatic and the trend

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.150
so clear that companies like Google, who depend entirely on

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.800
the internet, have a mobile first policy, ensuring that the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.750
mobile experience is the first consideration when building

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.930
new products. This trend is particularly evident amongst younger

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.870
users who grew up using mobiles and especially

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.340
in emerging markets like Africa and Asia, where the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.530
infrastructure to support ubiquitous broadband for desktops isn't

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.300
as readily available. I saw this firsthand when I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.960
had the good fortune to visit Kenya a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.380
few years ago. Ubiquitous phones and passionate, talented developers

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.300
weren't really familiar, but what really struck me was the degree

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.300
to which mobile phones had become an integral part of people's

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.940
everyday lives. It wasn't just checking email and posting to Facebook,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.740
it was using [UNKNOWN] to buy everything from groceries to bus

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.390
fare. Mobiles was such a part of life that I heard

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.620
rather than buying someone a drink to show that you're interested,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.440
you'd send them a phone credit so that they can call

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.420
you if they felt the same way. In the transition of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.890
smartphones from tech accessory to a part of life to the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.180
main way you get online to how you pay for things,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.200
even how you flirt, represents a huge opportunity for us as

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.010
developers. The question is, how are you going to change the world?
