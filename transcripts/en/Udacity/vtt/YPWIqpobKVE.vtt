00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:05.330
A common question that
is raised is whether or

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.260
not an online program can actually be
comparable to an in-person program.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.035
Because there's no difference
between the online and

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:14.390
on-campus diplomas, we go to great
lengths to ensure their quality.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.630
&gt;&gt; Most classes in the program
are developed by the same instructors

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.930
that teach the classes on campus.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.170
These are active professors that
are world famous in their fields.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.140
And they're taking time to
develop these courses separate

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.690
from their usual teaching
responsibilities.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.009
Many of our courses use
the exact same assessments and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.220
graders as the on campus courses.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.320
We know that courses are comparable
because both groups of

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.120
students are being evaluated on the same
assignments by the same Individuals.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.170
&gt;&gt; We use state of the art technology
to ensure the integrity of the program.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.070
We know that you're here because
a degree from Georgia Tech really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.950
means something.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.640
And we want to keep it that way.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420
We use cutting edge tools to
evaluate submissions for plagiarism,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.010
to detect cheating during exams and to
ensure the identities of participants.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.380
Every semester we're able to detect and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.960
remove people engaging in unfair
copying of code or written work.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.065
So you can rest assured that everyone
receiving a Georgia Tech Masters Degree,

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:10.230
whether online or
on campus has truly earned it.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.000
In every way, we're working hard to make
sure that a degree from Georgia Tech is

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.600
a valuable credential, regardless of
whether it's earned online or on campus.
