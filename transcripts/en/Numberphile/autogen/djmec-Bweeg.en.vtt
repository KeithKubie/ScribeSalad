00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939
here's a ruler where is the center of

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949
here's a ruler where is the center of
 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530
here's a ruler where is the center of
gravity well presumably in the middle

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540
gravity well presumably in the middle
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.749
gravity well presumably in the middle
and that's certainly true if I put my

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
and that's certainly true if I put my
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.450
and that's certainly true if I put my
finger in the middle somewhere there

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
finger in the middle somewhere there
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.749

oops it balances so that's the center of

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
oops it balances so that's the center of
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150
oops it balances so that's the center of
gravity but suppose that I attach some

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
gravity but suppose that I attach some
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.250

weight at one end well where is it well

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
weight at one end well where is it well
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.890
weight at one end well where is it well
it's not so easy to guess right but

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
it's not so easy to guess right but
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.929
it's not so easy to guess right but
there is a very nice way of finding a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
there is a very nice way of finding a
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.929
there is a very nice way of finding a
center gravity which I'll start by doing

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
center gravity which I'll start by doing
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.759
center gravity which I'll start by doing
it with that way you simply put two

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
it with that way you simply put two
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.730
it with that way you simply put two
fingers and to support the object and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
fingers and to support the object and
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800
fingers and to support the object and
then you bring them toward each other

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
then you bring them toward each other
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.920
then you bring them toward each other
and automatically you see one stop

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
and automatically you see one stop
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.400
and automatically you see one stop
someone starts one stops and they meet

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410
someone starts one stops and they meet
 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.389
someone starts one stops and they meet
automatically at the center gravity and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
automatically at the center gravity and
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.729
automatically at the center gravity and
I can even do this with eyes closed

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739
 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.319
this works in general if I attach for

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
this works in general if I attach for
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.200
this works in general if I attach for
example a mass at one end I don't know

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
example a mass at one end I don't know
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270

where the center of gravity is but my

where the center of gravity is but my
fingers automatically find the center of

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
fingers automatically find the center of
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.420
fingers automatically find the center of
gravity and if I put a hefty mass at the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
gravity and if I put a hefty mass at the
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539
gravity and if I put a hefty mass at the
other end well the center gravity will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
other end well the center gravity will
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.149
other end well the center gravity will
be really close to the end and indeed it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
be really close to the end and indeed it
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.070
be really close to the end and indeed it
finds the center of gravity over here

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
finds the center of gravity over here
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350
finds the center of gravity over here
and if I put both of them at the same

them slowly toward each other and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530
them slowly toward each other and
 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.300

others start studying and one stops and
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370
others start studying and one stops and
they meet always at the center so how

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
they meet always at the center so how
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.270
they meet always at the center so how
does it work it works because of a

principle you know when two bodies

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520
principle you know when two bodies
 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.740
principle you know when two bodies
sliding against each other or they are

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
sliding against each other or they are
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660
sliding against each other or they are
sort of stopped and they want to start

sort of stopped and they want to start
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490
sort of stopped and they want to start
sliding there is something that's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
sliding there is something that's
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380
sliding there is something that's
opposing the slide and that's called

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
opposing the slide and that's called
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.539
opposing the slide and that's called
friction it turns out that the friction

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
friction it turns out that the friction
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.389
friction it turns out that the friction
is proportional to increases with the

fact when you are studying the friction

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
fact when you are studying the friction
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.309
fact when you are studying the friction
is slightly smaller than when years

top ten wanted to start sliding we

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999
top ten wanted to start sliding we
 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.130
top ten wanted to start sliding we
talked about the difference between the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
talked about the difference between the
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.929
talked about the difference between the
dynamic friction that's the friction

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939
dynamic friction that's the friction
 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.489
dynamic friction that's the friction
that's acting when the ball is already

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499
that's acting when the ball is already

that's acting when the ball is already
sliding versus static friction when

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
sliding versus static friction when
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.239
sliding versus static friction when
these two bodies are stopped at against

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249
these two bodies are stopped at against
 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.129
these two bodies are stopped at against
each other and then they want to start

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139
each other and then they want to start
 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.259
each other and then they want to start
slightly static friction is a little

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
slightly static friction is a little
 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.270
slightly static friction is a little
larger than the dynamic friction okay

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280
larger than the dynamic friction okay
 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.039
larger than the dynamic friction okay
suppose that I start bringing those two

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049
suppose that I start bringing those two
 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.569
suppose that I start bringing those two
fingers toward each other whether they

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579
fingers toward each other whether they
 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.670

some random error in the beginning so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
some random error in the beginning so
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.979
some random error in the beginning so
first this finger started moving for

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
first this finger started moving for
 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.349
first this finger started moving for
some reason okay when this finger is

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359
some reason okay when this finger is
 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.539
some reason okay when this finger is
closer to the center of gravity than

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549
closer to the center of gravity than
 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.360
closer to the center of gravity than
this finger this finger is taking more

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
this finger this finger is taking more
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.879
this finger this finger is taking more
weight over the ruler than this finger

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889
weight over the ruler than this finger
 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.099
weight over the ruler than this finger
so there is more friction there and so

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109
so there is more friction there and so
 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.569
so there is more friction there and so
because there's more friction on this

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579
because there's more friction on this
 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.709
because there's more friction on this
finger than on this finger

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719
finger than on this finger
 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.390
finger than on this finger
naturally the finger that slides is this

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
naturally the finger that slides is this
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.879
naturally the finger that slides is this
one but you see once this finger starts

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889
one but you see once this finger starts
 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.369
one but you see once this finger starts
starting it's starting with dynamic

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379
starting it's starting with dynamic
 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.689
starting it's starting with dynamic
friction whereas this is stopped at

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699
friction whereas this is stopped at
 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.229
friction whereas this is stopped at
static friction so in principle you see

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
static friction so in principle you see
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.839
static friction so in principle you see
when these are at equal distances from

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849
when these are at equal distances from
 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.119
when these are at equal distances from
it from the center of centre of gravity

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129
it from the center of centre of gravity
 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.879
it from the center of centre of gravity
they take equal weights so they should

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889
they take equal weights so they should
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.649
they take equal weights so they should
have equal frictions but that's not true

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659
have equal frictions but that's not true
 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.539
have equal frictions but that's not true
because this is already sliding so it's

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549
because this is already sliding so it's
 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.569
because this is already sliding so it's
taking the sliding friction dynamic

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579
taking the sliding friction dynamic
 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:17.929
taking the sliding friction dynamic
friction

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939
friction
 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.640
friction
whereas this is taking static friction

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
whereas this is taking static friction
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.640
whereas this is taking static friction
so this one can keep sliding although

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
so this one can keep sliding although
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.619
so this one can keep sliding although
it's taking more and more weight because

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629
it's taking more and more weight because
 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.110
it's taking more and more weight because
it's friction is a little less than this

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
it's friction is a little less than this
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.199
it's friction is a little less than this
one so it overshoots towards the center

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209
one so it overshoots towards the center
 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.569
one so it overshoots towards the center
and when it's really close then the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579
and when it's really close then the
 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.270
and when it's really close then the
other one starts moving and so on that's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
other one starts moving and so on that's
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.999
other one starts moving and so on that's
why they alternate stick-slip mechanism

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.009
why they alternate stick-slip mechanism
 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.129
why they alternate stick-slip mechanism
this is called slip sticks lip stick and

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139
this is called slip sticks lip stick and
 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.399
this is called slip sticks lip stick and
then they come toward each other so if

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409
then they come toward each other so if
 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.240
then they come toward each other so if
you take a weighted version well for a

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
you take a weighted version well for a
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.059
you take a weighted version well for a
long time this left finger slides

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069
long time this left finger slides
 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.219
long time this left finger slides
because left as seen from your sides

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229
because left as seen from your sides
 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.080
because left as seen from your sides
because it's of course far from the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090
because it's of course far from the
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.460
because it's of course far from the
center of gravity so it has a decimate

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
center of gravity so it has a decimate
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.390
center of gravity so it has a decimate
on it so it has less friction but it

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400
on it so it has less friction but it
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.559
on it so it has less friction but it
overshoots and then the other one starts

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569
overshoots and then the other one starts
 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.569
overshoots and then the other one starts
starting over shoots over shoots over

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579
starting over shoots over shoots over
 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.509
starting over shoots over shoots over
shoots and then they finally meet in the

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519
shoots and then they finally meet in the
 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.050
shoots and then they finally meet in the
center so this mechanism is using the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
center so this mechanism is using the
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.819
center so this mechanism is using the
slightly difference between the dynamic

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829
slightly difference between the dynamic
 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.189
slightly difference between the dynamic
and Static frictions and the fact that

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199
and Static frictions and the fact that
 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.009
and Static frictions and the fact that
well when you come at equal distances

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019
well when you come at equal distances
 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.990
well when you come at equal distances
from the center of gravity the one

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000
from the center of gravity the one
 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.610
from the center of gravity the one
that's already sliding come over shoot

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620
that's already sliding come over shoot
 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.790
that's already sliding come over shoot
and then once that stops it stays there

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
and then once that stops it stays there
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.780
and then once that stops it stays there
for a while and then

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790
for a while and then
 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.540
for a while and then
only when the other starting finger has

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550
only when the other starting finger has
 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.580
only when the other starting finger has
stopped

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590
stopped
 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.560
stopped
kunti this one starts sliding again and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570
kunti this one starts sliding again and
 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.150
kunti this one starts sliding again and
then overshoot and come towards them and

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160
then overshoot and come towards them and
 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.890
then overshoot and come towards them and
so on they come towards them is there an

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
so on they come towards them is there an
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.810
so on they come towards them is there an
accepted number of times there will be a

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820
accepted number of times there will be a
 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.430
accepted number of times there will be a
slip and a stick right over the course

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
slip and a stick right over the course
 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.650
slip and a stick right over the course

question I think it's a case-by-case and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010
question I think it's a case-by-case and
 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.220
question I think it's a case-by-case and
you can do a very very precise

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230
you can do a very very precise
 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.440
you can do a very very precise
calculation using a simple model of

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450
calculation using a simple model of
 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.590
calculation using a simple model of
stick slip and so forth but the fact of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600
stick slip and so forth but the fact of
 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.870
stick slip and so forth but the fact of
the matter is that it is a very unstable

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880
the matter is that it is a very unstable
 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.940
the matter is that it is a very unstable
process I mean depending on tiny tiny

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950
process I mean depending on tiny tiny
 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.650
process I mean depending on tiny tiny
regularities of the surface and so on

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660
regularities of the surface and so on
 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.230
regularities of the surface and so on
and the number seems to vary quite a lot

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240
and the number seems to vary quite a lot
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.040
and the number seems to vary quite a lot
so and I think we have to resort to just

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050
so and I think we have to resort to just
 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.630
so and I think we have to resort to just
experiments and the theoretical

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640
experiments and the theoretical
 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.850
experiments and the theoretical
calculation does give some picture but I

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
calculation does give some picture but I
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.490
calculation does give some picture but I
don't think it gives really as accurate

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500
don't think it gives really as accurate
 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.240
don't think it gives really as accurate
in a prediction as the numbers suggest

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250
in a prediction as the numbers suggest
 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.190
in a prediction as the numbers suggest

something that is working progress so

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990
something that is working progress so

something that is working progress so
far we have been linking paper clips

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480
far we have been linking paper clips
 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.590
far we have been linking paper clips
together and sometimes we refer to this

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600
together and sometimes we refer to this
 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.020
together and sometimes we refer to this
as addition
