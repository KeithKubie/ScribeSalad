00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.035
&gt;&gt; Captain's log. The siren song

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.936
of tasteless jokes
from Clusterfest

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:05.338
drew me in from the bay....area

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.708
the festival was Nyen
penetrable but smelling of
confidence

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.643
I wafted easily
through its defenses.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:13.913
I was awash with mirth

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.181
a word I definitely know.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.350
Some seafarers were looking
for the funniest act.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.518
I helped them navigate

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.254
to me. A three day festivals
a lot for any man.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.189
&gt;&gt; But this one stays fresh.

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:25.691
Old Spice Captain's
stick. Superior fragrance

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.260
with longer lasting protection.
