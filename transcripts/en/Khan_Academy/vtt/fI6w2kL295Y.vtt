00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.030
The table shows the number of
stores of a popular US coffee

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.750
chain from 2000 to 2006.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.930
The number of stores
recorded is the number

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.000
at the start of each
year on January 1.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.230
So in 2000, there was 1,996
stores, in 2005, 6,177,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.680
so on and so forth.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.060
Determine a reasonable
approximation

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.190
for the instantaneous
rate of change,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.710
in coffee stores per year
at the beginning of 2003--

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.360
so we care about
2003-- by taking

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.500
the average of two
nearby secant slopes.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.070
So let's visualize this.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.740
So this right over here, I've
plotted all of the points.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.210
Now let me make sure
that the axes are clear.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.990
This horizontal axis, this is my
t-axis that tells us the year.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.820
And then the vertical axis
is the number of stores.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.200
And we could even say that
it is a function of time.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.110
So you see in the
year 2000, there

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.510
was 1,996 stores-- 2003, 4,272.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.460
2003-- let me do that
in that blue color.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.560
2003, 4,272 stores.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.990
Now if you could imagine
that they're constantly

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.930
adding stores, you could
even imagine minute

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.710
by minute they're adding stores.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.670
So this is just
sampling the number

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.140
of stores they had on January 1.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.810
But if you were
to really plot it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.350
as a more continuous
function, it

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.790
might look something like this.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.480
I'll do my best
to approximate it.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.350
It might be more of
some type of curve

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.015
that looks something like this.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.490
And once again, I'm
just approximating

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.140
what it might
actually look like.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.520
So when they're saying the
instantaneous rate of change

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.490
in coffee stores
per year, so this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.810
is the change, the
instantaneous rate

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.830
of change of stores per time.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.770
They're really saying, we
need to approximate the slope

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.120
of the tangent line in
2003, when time is 2003.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.702
So the tangent line might
look something like that.

00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:04.160
I want to draw it so you see
that this line right over here

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.350
is tangent.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.628
Now, they say approximate.

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:08.919
We don't have the information
to figure it out exactly.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.440
But we have some data around
it, and we can figure out

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.760
the slopes of the secant
lines between this point

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.500
and those points.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.130
And then we can take the
average of the slopes

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.620
of the secant lines
to approximate

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.350
the slope of this tangent line.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.810
So for example, we could find
the slope of this secant line

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.930
right over here as we
go from 2002 to 2003.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.010
And then we can find the
slope of this secant line

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.430
as we go from 2003 to 2004.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.930
And if we average
those, that should

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.390
be a pretty good approximation
for the instantaneous rate

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.860
of change in 2003.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.510
So let's do that.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.470
So the slope of this
pink secant line,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.320
as we go from 2002
to 2003, that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.460
going to be the number
of stores in 2003

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.270
minus the number
of stores in 2002.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.840
So that's the change
in our number of stores

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.230
over the change in years,
or the change in time.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.670
So this is going to
be 2003 minus 2002.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.830
And so what is this
going to be equal to?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.630
Let' see, in 2003 we
have 4,272 stores.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.092
In 2002, we have 3,501.

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.300
It's going to be that over--
well, the denominator is

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.370
just 1.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.510
So this is going to
simplify to, let's see.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.406
I can do a little bit
of math on the side

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:27.280
here just so I don't
make a careless mistake.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.480
Minus 3501, 2 minus 1 is 1, 7
minus 0 is 7, 42 minus 35 is 7.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.950
So this is equal to 771.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.770
So their average rate of
change from 2002 to 2003

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.130
was 771 stores per year.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.750
Now let's do the same
thing for this red secant

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.350
line between 2003 and 2004.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.990
The slope of that
secant line is going

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.060
to be the number of stores
in 2004 minus the number

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.271
of stores in 2003 over 2004
minus 2003, which is equal to,

00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:12.770
let's see.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.649
They had 5,239 stores in 2004.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:21.709
They have 4,272 stores in 2003.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.240
And then only one year changes,
so 2004 minus 2003 is 1.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.320
So this is equal to-- I'll
do the subtraction problem up

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.820
here.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.930
So 5,239 minus 4,272.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.860
So this, let's see.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.540
9 minus 2 is 7.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.040
Let's see, it looks
like we're going

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.400
to do a little bit
of regrouping here.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.940
So let's say we take one of
the thousands from the 5,000,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.990
so it's 4.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.740
And then that
becomes 10 hundreds.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.000
So this becomes 1,200.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And now let's take one of those
100s and give it to the 10.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.110
So now this becomes 1,100,
and we give that 10.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.210
So then this becomes 13.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.949
We took 100 from here,
and that gave us 10 tens.

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.240
So now we're ready to subtract.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.060
13 minus 7 is 6, 11 minus 2
is 9, and then 4 minus 4 is 0.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.820
So it's 967.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.720
So this is equal to
967 stores per year.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.050
So we really just have
to take the average

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.900
of this number and that
number to approximate

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.590
the instantaneous
rate of change.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.650
So let's do that.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:41.210
So let's take 967 plus 771,
and then we can divide by 2.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.040
So let's actually
figure out what that is.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.850
So let me add 771 over here.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.450
7 plus 1 is 8.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.100
6 plus 7 is 13.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.900
And then 1, plus this
is 17 right over here.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.970
And then we're going
to divide that by 2.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:08.860
So 2 goes into 1,738,
it goes into 17 8 times.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.670
8 times 2 is 16.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.240
Subtract, we get a
13, it goes six times.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.200
12.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.300
Subtract, we get an 18.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.660
It goes nine times.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.860
And then we don't
have any remainder.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.370
So 18, no remainder.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.260
So our approximation for
the instantaneous rate

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.830
of change for the slope of our
approximation for the slope

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:40.461
of the tangent line right over
here is 869 stores per year.
