00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.884
- [Voiceover] We've already
spent a couple of videos

00:00:01.884 --> 00:00:03.858
talking about enzymes,
and what I want to do

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:06.736
in this video is dig a
little bit deeper and focus

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:09.949
on some actors that actually help enzymes.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.567
And just as a reminder, enzymes

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.493
are around to help reactions to proceed,

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.486
to lower their activation
energies, to make the reactions

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:21.574
happen more frequently
or to happen faster.

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.198
Now, we've already seen
examples of enzymes,

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:26.776
and just to frame things
in our brain properly,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.283
sometimes in a textbook you'll
see an enzyme like this,

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.070
you'll see a drawing like this.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.461
And people will call this the enzyme,

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.441
they'll call this the enzyme,

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.759
and then they'll call this right,

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.812
they'll say okay, and it's acting on

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.879
some kind of a substrate right over here,

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.435
it's going to do something to that.

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:48.986
And this is nice for a very
abstract, textbook idea

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.331
of a substrate locking
into an enzyme like this,

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.863
but this isn't actually what it

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:55.605
looks like in a biological system.

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.485
We have to remind ourselves,
when people talk about enzymes

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:00.180
they're talking about proteins.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.918
Now there are these kind of
RNA enzymes called ribozymes

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.588
but the great majority, when
we're talking about enzymes,

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:08.864
we tend to be talking about proteins.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.440
And we spent a lot of time
talking about how proteins

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.808
are these structures,
there's polypeptides,

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.503
and all the side chains
of the various amino acids

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:19.400
fold the proteins in all
sorts of different ways.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.377
So a better drawing
for something like this

00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:26.325
would be this protein that's
all folded in different ways,

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.623
maybe has some alpha helices here,

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:30.782
maybe it has some beta
sheets right over here.

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:33.754
It's all this kinda crazy
stuff right over there.

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.891
And then the substrate might be some type

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:40.837
of a molecule, that is it
gets embedded in the protein.

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.784
And you see some examples right over here.

00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:46.781
This is actually a
hexokinase model and you see,

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:49.613
at least you can see a
little bit of the ATP

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:51.912
right over there, and it's
a little harder to see

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.722
the glucose that's going
to be phosphorylated.

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:57.276
And this reaction is being
facilitated by this big

00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:59.784
protein structure, the hexokinase.

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:01.814
Now, what we're going to
focus on in this video

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:04.362
is that, when we talk about
an enzyme, and we're talking

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:07.023
about proteins, we're talking
about a chain of amino acids,

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.717
but there's often other
parts of the enzyme

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:11.668
that aren't officially proteins.

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:14.338
And we even saw that when
we talked about hexokinases,

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.962
when we talked about the
phosphorylation of glucose,

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:19.887
we said hey, the way that it
lowers the activation energy

00:02:19.887 --> 00:02:23.629
is you have these positive magnesium ions,

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.187
these positive magnesium ions,

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.825
that can keep the electrons
in the phosphate groups

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:32.192
a little bit busy, draw them away, so that

00:02:32.192 --> 00:02:35.930
this hydroxyl group
right over here can bond

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.625
with this phosphate and not be

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:38.995
interfered with these electrons.

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:42.153
Well these magnesium ions right over here,

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:45.288
they aren't officially
part of the protein.

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:48.190
These are what we call cofactors.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.836
So you might have a
cofactor right over there

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:55.969
that latches onto the
broader protein to become

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.244
part of the enzyme, and
you actually need that

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.775
for the reaction to proceed,
it plays a crucial role here.

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:03.978
So another drawing in
the textbook, you'll see

00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:06.673
something like this, or even,
they'll draw, they'll say

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.204
okay, in order for this
reaction to proceed, yes,

00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:11.943
you need the substrate, but
you also need the cofactor.

00:03:11.943 --> 00:03:14.080
The cofactor.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.121
And once again, it
sounds like a fancy word,

00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:20.790
but all it means is a
non-protein part of an enzyme.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.248
It's another molecule or
ion or atom that is involved

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.779
in letting the enzyme perform its function

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.123
that it's not formally
a part of an amino acid

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:34.373
or part of a side chain
or part of the protein,

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:35.604
but it's another thing that needs

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:37.925
to be there to help catalyze the reaction.

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:39.835
We saw that with hexokinase, you had

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:44.656
magnesium ions that the complex picks up.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:47.607
And this is why, when people
talk about your vitamins

00:03:47.607 --> 00:03:49.766
and minerals, a lot of
the vitamins and minerals

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:54.526
that you need, they actually
act as cofactors for enzymes.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.987
And so you could even see it
in this drawing over here,

00:03:56.987 --> 00:04:00.469
at least based on what I read
these are the magnesium ions

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.720
in green right over here,
and these are cofactors.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.459
These are cofactors.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.057
So cofactor, non-protein
part of your actual enzyme.

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:14.890
Now, we can subdivide cofactors even more.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.653
We can divide them into organic cofactors

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:20.142
and inorganic cofactors.

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:25.035
So if you have cofactors, we've
seen an inorganic cofactor,

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.822
a lot of these ions,
you'll see magnesium ions,

00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:29.913
you'll see sodium ions,
you'll see calcium ions,

00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:32.164
you'll see all sorts of
things acting as cofactors,

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:35.717
often times to distract
electrons, or to keep them busy

00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:37.668
so that electrons can proceed.

00:04:37.668 --> 00:04:39.107
But you can also have organic ones,

00:04:39.107 --> 00:04:41.986
you can also have organic molecules.

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:44.054
Remember, organic
molecules, these are just,

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:45.540
they'll involve carbon, they have

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.328
chains of carbons and other things.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:50.741
And cofactors that are organic molecules,

00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.054
we call them coenzymes.

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:54.771
Coenzymes.

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:58.134
And there's a bunch of
examples of coenzymes.

00:04:58.134 --> 00:05:00.787
This right over here is

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:03.967
the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:06.206
and it has a coenzyme, and this coenzyme

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:09.294
you are going to see a lot
in your biological careers,

00:05:09.294 --> 00:05:12.359
NAD, right over here.

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:15.841
Notice, this isn't just an
ion, it is an entire molecule.

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.348
It has carbon in it, that's
why we call it organic.

00:05:18.348 --> 00:05:22.550
And it is not formally
protein, it's not part

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.341
of the amino acids that
make up the protein,

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.015
so that's what makes it a cofactor,

00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:29.661
and since it's an entire organic molecule,

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.495
we call this a coenzyme.

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:34.956
Coenzyme.

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.905
But like any cofactor, it plays a role

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.762
in actually allowing the enzyme

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:41.991
to do its function, to
facilitate a reaction.

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.103
And this particular coenzyme, NAD,

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:46.518
which you're going to see a lot,

00:05:46.518 --> 00:05:49.885
it helps facilitate the
transfer of hydride ions.

00:05:49.885 --> 00:05:53.044
Hydride ions never, or very
seldom, exist by themselves,

00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:55.203
but it's a hydrogen with an extra

00:05:55.203 --> 00:05:58.918
electron, so it has a negative charge.

00:05:58.918 --> 00:06:02.603
So it allows the transfer of this group

00:06:03.443 --> 00:06:06.435
from a substrate or to a substrate,

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.361
and that's because NAD can accept

00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:14.121
a hydride anion right
over here and become NADH.

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.170
And if you want to see
its broader structure,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.656
it's actually quite fascinating.

00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:19.304
I'll probably do a whole video on NAD

00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:21.162
because in so many textbooks growing up

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:24.157
I just saw NAD and NADH and
I'm like what is this thing?

00:06:24.157 --> 00:06:25.876
And it's a fascinating molecule.

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.431
So what it can do is
it can actually pick up

00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:29.938
the hydride anion right over here

00:06:29.938 --> 00:06:32.006
at this carbon, you can
actually form another bond

00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:34.931
with the hydrogen, and I'll
do that in a future video,

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:36.695
I'll show the mechanism for it.

00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:38.228
But it's a pretty cool molecule

00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:39.459
and I like to actually
look at this molecule

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:41.363
and remember, the whole
focus of this is coenzymes,

00:06:41.363 --> 00:06:43.824
but we see these patterns
throughout biology

00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:48.467
because the name, nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:50.976
exactly describes what it is.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:55.976
Nicotinamide, right down here, that is

00:06:56.027 --> 00:07:01.027
this piece of the molecule,
and this is the part

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.987
that can accept a hydride
or let go of a hydride,

00:07:03.987 --> 00:07:07.028
so you could say this is the
active part of the molecule.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:11.487
Adenine, our good old friend,
we've seen adenine in DNA,

00:07:11.487 --> 00:07:15.898
in RNA, in ATP, so this is our

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:18.871
good old friend adenine, right over here.

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:21.593
And it says dinucleotide,
cause we actually have

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:23.635
two nucleotides paired together,

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:25.494
their phosphate groups are tied together.

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:27.188
And there's a couple cool
ways to think about this.

00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:28.721
You have an adenine right over here,

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.811
you have a ribose, you
have a phosphate group.

00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:35.527
If you just looked at this piece,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.307
right over here, if you looked
at this right over here,

00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:41.815
this is your building block,

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:46.621
or this could be a building block, of RNA,

00:07:46.621 --> 00:07:48.643
if you have an adenine right over there.

00:07:48.643 --> 00:07:53.078
And if you include, let me undo this,

00:07:53.078 --> 00:07:56.770
if you include all of
this, this right over here,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.951
this is ADP, well the reason
why it's called dinucleotide

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:01.762
is you can also divide it the other way.

00:08:01.762 --> 00:08:04.479
You can say, alright
you have one nucleotide

00:08:04.479 --> 00:08:08.635
that has nicotinamide right over here,

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.722
so that's one of the nucleotides,

00:08:11.722 --> 00:08:14.533
and then the other nucleotide
is right over here,

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:17.250
the one that involves adenine,

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.479
that's why it's called dinucleotide.

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:22.659
So hopefully this makes NAD
less of a mysterious molecule,

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:25.330
we'll see it in the future,
but I like to look at it

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.350
because it's got all these patterns,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.998
it's got all these components that you see

00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:30.460
over and over again,
and you see it in ATP,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.667
you see it in RNA, over and over again.

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:36.916
But this isn't the only
cofactor or coenzyme.

00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:39.834
There are many many others,
in fact when people say

00:08:39.834 --> 00:08:41.096
take your vitamins and your minerals,

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:43.162
that tends to be because
they are cofactors.

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:45.530
Vitamin C is a very important cofactor

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.528
to be involved in enzymes that,

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.619
well I won't go into all of the

00:08:48.619 --> 00:08:49.919
different things that it can do.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.614
These are two different
views of vitamin C,

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.797
a space-filling model and
this is a ball-and-stick

00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:55.491
model right over here of vitamin C.

00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:58.278
Folic acid, once again,
two different views,

00:08:58.278 --> 00:09:02.532
but these are all
coenzymes, they all work,

00:09:02.532 --> 00:09:05.455
you know if you have a
protein right over here

00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:09.006
that you know it's all this
really complex structure,

00:09:09.006 --> 00:09:12.444
maybe you have some substrates,
but to help facilitate,

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:14.905
let me do the substrates
in a different color,

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:18.198
so maybe you have some substrates,

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:20.080
so these are the things that the enzyme

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.682
is trying to catalyze the reactions for.

00:09:21.682 --> 00:09:23.980
But then you could have some ions,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.210
which would, you know, you
could kind of view these

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.438
as you would view these,
you would view the ions

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:34.070
as cofactors, and you could
have organic cofactors,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.503
like the vitamin C, or other
things that we talked about

00:09:37.503 --> 00:09:41.287
that are also involved and help
facilitating the mechanism,

00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:43.516
or help facilitate the reaction.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.908
And once again, sometimes
it might be to help

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.834
stabilize some charge,
sometimes it might be

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:51.318
to be an electron acceptor or donor,

00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:52.897
or a whole series of different things.

00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:56.473
They can actually act as part
of the reaction mechanism.
