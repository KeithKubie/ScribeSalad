&gt;&gt;Choir: [singing]

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:13.476
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Brookfield High
School in Canada's Capital City

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:17.256
of Ottawa, is a study in diversity.

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:19.896
&gt;&gt;Anne: If you were to walk the
halls of Brookfield High School,

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:25.306
you see a real kaleidoscope,
colors, cultures, religions,

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:28.496
and 45 to 50 different languages.

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:31.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In 2004, the school
received a technology grant

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:34.176
that provided 23 laptop computers,

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:37.076
wireless internet access,
and teacher training.

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:39.706
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Or you go to File, New,
then we can just make a new one.

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The new technology
has opened new worlds to students,

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:44.956
from global video conferences--

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, we have
another question, Mr. Davis.

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:48.986
&gt;&gt;Student: Just drop the
ball and let it bounce.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:51.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: to the
exploration of invisible forces.

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:54.576
&gt;&gt;Student: So there you can
see where the ball bounced,

00:00:54.886 --> 00:00:57.226
and then it's constant velocity.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.006
&gt;&gt;Anne: The teachers that have
been connected with the grant,

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:05.436
have really used the technology
to consider how they teach.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.256
They plan their lessons,
knowing, of course,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.526
that they've got the
technology, and therefore,

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:13.976
they're far more creative
in their teaching.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.116
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Okay, so you're
going to be going to the site

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:18.976
with the tablets, and you're
going to be doing a little bit

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:20.826
of research about the Rideau River.

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:23.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Four times a year,

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:28.756
science teacher Beverly Wilkinson
takes her biology class on the road

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:33.916
to collect data on plant and animal
species in Ottawa's Rideau River.

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.816
&gt;&gt;Beverly: Try to get one organism
at a time, and organize them

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.916
into the white egg cartons.

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:44.076
&gt;&gt;When you're entering the data
onsite, it makes it more real.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:48.706
If you wait a day or two, then
they forget, and it separates

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:51.376
from the actual science
that they are doing.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:52.966
So it's all part of the process.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:56.866
And they will use the tools that
we have in order to record all

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.176
of their data onsite, so it's like
they're acting as true scientists.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students post their data
to Ottawa's Museum of Nature Website,

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:07.866
where it can be shared with
students all over Canada,

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.666
who are doing similar studies.

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.516
&gt;&gt;Katja: There's a youth
portal that they can go to,

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:16.116
and they can input the data that
they found from this project,

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:19.286
so different types of, you know,
measurements about the water,

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:21.426
the types of invertebrates
that they found.

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:22.846
&gt;&gt;Student: That's our main specimen.

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:26.226
&gt;&gt;Katja: And so this information
is accessible to anybody

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:27.576
who has access to the web.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.276
They can take a look at
the data that's collected,

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:32.716
and compare it to their own rivers.

00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:34.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: For you,
Monsieur, delivery.

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:35.536
&gt;&gt;Gordon: Delivery.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:36.326
Thank you.

00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:40.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The tablet PCs move from
classroom to classroom in a cart

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:42.596
that includes a wireless hub.

00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:45.136
&gt;&gt;Gordon: Galileo, what
was Galileo's experiment?

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.246
Five hundred years ago, they said,

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:49.056
who's going to hit the
ground first, 500 years ago--

00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:52.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students in Gordon
Kubanek's physics class use the

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:54.256
computers to visualize
the intangible.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:57.736
&gt;&gt;Gordon: There's much, much less
mass in all that there, right?

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:01.106
&gt;&gt;Physics is, sometimes you can't
do an experiment physically,

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.996
so what you do is, you do the
experiment in your imagination,

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.996
and it adds this element of what
we call, spatial intelligence,

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.876
so when most people think about
physics, they think about math,

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.946
which is true, but actually,
math alone is insufficient.

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.256
You have to be able to
visualize these interactions

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:17.756
in three dimensions, because
there's real things happening

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:20.146
and so the technology
allows you to do that,

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:21.526
and you could never do it before.

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:24.526
&gt;&gt;We know that you have a
certain weight at the surface,

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.686
which he's drawn over here.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:27.836
And if you weigh nothing
in the middle,

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:30.186
halfway, you should weigh half.

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:31.156
It's logical, yeah?

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.386
And by the way, the diagram helps.

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.826
&gt;&gt; In the simulation, they would
change the gravitational field,

00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:38.956
Earth, Moon, Jupiter,
and see the effect.

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:43.356
The simulation would graph it, you
could accelerate different objects

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:46.026
to see, as you accelerated them,
what would their motion look like?

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:47.316
What would the graph look like?

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.796
And it visualized the ideas.

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:52.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The technology
helps students learn,

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:54.116
by explaining their work to others.

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:57.156
&gt;&gt;Student: So if you're
one there, and zero there--

00:03:57.256 --> 00:03:57.323
&gt;&gt;Gordon: Yeah.

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.446
&gt;&gt;Student: You can't be half.

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:00.496
&gt;&gt;Gordon: Research tell us,

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:04.136
whoever does the explanation does the
most learning, so in most classrooms,

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.286
teachers are learning a lot,
because they're talking a lot,

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.066
and the kids really aren't.

00:04:08.286 --> 00:04:11.336
so you want to try to discourage
the memorization kind of approach,

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:13.666
want the kids explaining
things and showing their work.

00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:16.136
The teacher wandering
around much more,

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:17.866
being more on the side guiding them.

00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:20.476
&gt;&gt;Do you weigh less, compared
to being at the surface?

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:20.546
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:21.946
&gt;&gt;Gordon: Okay, that's good.

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:22.356
&gt;&gt;Student: Wait--

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:23.936
&gt;&gt;Gordon: It does take
a lot more time

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:25.876
to design a good lesson
with technology.

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:29.146
When you have a normal lesson,
you can literally think about it

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.126
for maybe 10 or 15 minutes,
get your resources together,

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:32.836
and you're good to go.

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:36.286
With technology, you have to make
a real lesson that's designed

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:38.826
for everything, so the
students know what to do next,

00:04:39.206 --> 00:04:40.366
and that takes, like, an hour.

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:44.136
So that's the downside,
if there is any.

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:47.476
&gt;&gt;Anne: I am blessed with a staff
who's willing to take some risks,

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:51.506
and to come into my office and
say, should we give this a try?

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:55.056
And there's not a lot more that
I can ask for as a principal.

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:59.716
We're hoping that each department,
whether it be in an art classroom,

00:05:00.146 --> 00:05:03.766
an English classroom, social
science, phys ed, health,

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:08.766
we'll sort of have a technology
person who the other teachers can go

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:11.286
to and get some creative ideas from.

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:13.476
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: Okay, so do I get to
this program through the file menu?

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:18.136
&gt;&gt;I don't pretend to be an expert,
but I'm very good at asking for help,

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:21.806
and I can see the possibilities
that technology opens up,

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:24.916
even when I don't know
how to make that work yet.

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:26.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When Jeannie
Hunter needs help,

00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:29.556
she turns to colleague,
Bev Wilkinson.

00:05:29.656 --> 00:05:32.106
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: Working with Bev has been
a real asset, because she's able

00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:36.036
to take the crazy ideas that I have
and structure them and make them work

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.756
in a way that I can use them.

00:05:38.126 --> 00:05:40.126
So she gives me a level
of accessibility

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:41.736
that I wouldn't have otherwise,

00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:44.516
and makes it accessible
to the students as well.

00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:49.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Last year, the World
Voices Choir, released its first CD,

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.286
and made it available
over the internet.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:52.506
&gt;&gt;Choir: [singing]

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.646
&gt;&gt;Michael: All of a
sudden, it hits home,

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:59.516
people pretty much anywhere in
the world can begin to connect,

00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:02.086
so I mean, we could reach to
Africa, we could reach to Sudan,

00:06:02.086 --> 00:06:03.296
and we could reach to China,

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:05.416
You know, people could
start, you know, connecting,

00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:07.676
getting past the language
barrier, getting past,

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:09.086
you know, the distance barrier.

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:09.476
&gt;&gt;Choir: [singing]

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:12.886
&gt;&gt;Jeannie: We had someone
e-mail from Kenya, and say,

00:06:12.886 --> 00:06:18.696
I'm listening to your CD, and he
wrote the e-mail in Kiswahili.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:20.336
I couldn't read it.

00:06:20.886 --> 00:06:24.536
So I have two Kenyan girls in my
choir, and I sat down with them,

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.026
and I said, I'd like to
show you this e-mail.

00:06:26.026 --> 00:06:31.146
And for them, the moment where they
could read that e-mail, and go, wow,

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:36.146
somebody from home
is listening to us.

00:06:36.236 --> 00:06:42.526
The world becomes a very small
place when you're able to interact

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:46.946
with people from anywhere.

00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:48.046
&gt;&gt;Choir: [singing]

00:06:48.046 --> 00:06:49.306
