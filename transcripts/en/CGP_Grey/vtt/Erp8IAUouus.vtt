00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Americans love their independence...

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.280
a nation of pioneers living out from under the eye of government ...

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.680
(except for all the government).

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.680
As such, unlike many other countries, Americans don't have a national ID card...

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.500
...and even the idea of creating one is a political hot topic every election cycle.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.620
The results are always the same: we don't need no ID card.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.740
But suspiciously, US citizens do already have this:

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
a card with a unique number that many places will ask for to prove who you are.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.160
This is the Social Security card and number...

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.080
...and it has become a quasi ID / unique password to identify citizens...

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.440
...though that was never its intended use.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520
For Americans, keeping this number secret is super important...

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.960
because it's the key to the government and banks to identifying you as you...

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.200
… and losing control of it is the worst kind of identity theft that can happen.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860
So how did Americans end up with a national ID number…

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.400
… that isn't one and a card terribly unfit to identify?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.220
It all started in the great depression of long long ago…

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.480
… when the government created the social security program, …

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.200
… a kind of mandatory pension:

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.520
Citizens would be required to pay in during…

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.840
… their working lives and withdraw in their retirement.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320
The idea being that even if past-you didn't save…

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.000
… for the sunset years of future-you, the eventually old current you…

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.900
… would still have something to live on.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.240
Now if you want to think of social security as a benefit…

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.660
… the government provides or as a bank account that's yours …

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.580
… is… controversial, but either way this number was created …

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.120
… to track what you put in and what you take out.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.665
Now, because this was just one government program…

00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:31.720
related only to your working life, you only needed to apply…

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.700
…for a social security card when you actually started working.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.900
But over time, that changed and the younger you are,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.120
…the more likely you've had one from the moment of your birth…

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.500
…despite babies' worthlessness as child laborers.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.420
So why?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.720
Well it goes back to Americans' having no national identity card…

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.560
…with a national number, which makes it harder for institutions…

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.900
… to keep track of people over their lives.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.680
With hundreds of millions of citizens,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.440
names and birthdays aren't unique,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.080
people move, people marry, people change names.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.300
And if you're trying to keep track of everyone,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.660
as say the United States Tax department might want to do,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.620
it can be a real problem, particularly in the pre-computer days.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.160
"Hey, wait a minute, look, at *this* number just lying around,"

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.700
the tax department said.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.540
"It's not supposed to be used as an ID number,"

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.720
said the social security department.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.000
"There are security reasons you shouldn't--"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.500
"Yoink!"

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.660
Thus the tax department piggy-backed off of the work

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.980
the social security department did assigning working adults a number,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.140
which made tracking taxes easier

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.080
… and they highly encouraged parents to get a social security number…

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.400
… for their children by tying it to a tax discount.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.760
Crazily, counting children for tax rebates used to run on the honor system.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.220
The US Tax Department told people:

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.780
1. We will give you a discount on your taxes for each child you have.  And:

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.220
2. Write down your number of children, …

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.080
…please be honest, we don't have a way to check.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.920
Which was just asking, nay, begging people to lie.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.900
Which they did, birthing on paper millions of phantom children.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.620
But after requiring each kid to have a social security…

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.060
… account number connected to a birth certificate…

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.620
… before the parents could get the tax discount, …

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.100
… all those phantoms faded away.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.260
This turned the social security number into a unique number…

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.800
… that all citizens had right from the start, …

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.500
and that made it easy for lots of other places like banks …

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.340
... and schools and companies and landlords …

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.780
… to also piggy back on the number as an easy way…

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.120
… to keep track of people without having to come up…

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.000
… with their own systems and to be able to exchange information…

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200
… about people between institutions.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.180
This is super useful for institutions, so, …

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.160
…the desire of Americans to not have a national identity card led, …

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.360
…somewhat inevitably, …

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.880
…to the nearest thing available being used as a substitute…

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.280
… which ended up being worse because the social security number…

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.560
… was never designed to be used this way in the long, long ago.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.180
And you can tell because it has no security built into it.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.560
Ok, so there's this neat trick that most ID numbers use…

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.400
...where they can check themselves to see if they're invalid.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.480
The simplest way is to have the last couple digits…

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920
… match the sum of the others.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.040
All kinds of ID cards and bar codes do this because it makes it impossible…

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.500
… to enter an incorrect number in a computer, …

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.340
… and makes it harder for fraudsters to guess valid numbers.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.700
This is why if you try to buy something online by guessing…

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.660
… a credit card number, the website knows it's invalid…

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.280
… before you even click buy.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.760
But because the Social Security number started life…

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.400
… in the long, long ago, it's just a number…

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.940
… with no self-checking security built in.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.720
Worse, if you're born pre-2011 it's not that hard to just guess …

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.680
…most of the number: the first three digits are the state where the …

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.920
parents applied for the card and the last four digits just count up in order, …

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.680
… and the middle digits follow a regular pattern.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.240
So you can take your number, subtract one and that's a valid number…

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.320
… of someone who was probably born in the same hospital…

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.240
… as you around the same time.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.060
Thus a fraudster who knows your time and location of birth…

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.880
… can probably get the first five digits by just looking them up on a chart.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.540
Institutions ask for the last four digits as a code to identify you as you…

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.540
… which means it's not that hard to put together your number…

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.760
… from a security leak anywhere or just by connecting a few puzzle pieces.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.600
The physical card itself is no help either:

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.700
… just a literal piece of cardboard, …

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.280
… depending on when it was issued, not even laminated.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.960
The social security department used to print…

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.100
… 'not to be used for identification' on the cards…

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.260
… as a futile attempt to stop institutions for asking for them as IDs, …

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.080
…because there's nothing identifying a person on the card.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.440
But eventually they gave up and removed these words…

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.420
… because, unlike passports or driver's licenses, …

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.140
… you can assume all Americans will have this one card.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.800
All this means your social security card and number…

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.120
… probably have less security than your library card, …

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.560
…while being vastly more important.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.940
So it fails at being a secure number, …

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.160
… it fails at being a good ID card, …

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.260
… but at least it is universal* which is why people use it.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.000
Oh hello, asterisk, my old friend.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.900
No, of course not, this program isn't actually universal:

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.360
…not everyone has a social security account number, …

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.520
…and not everyone pays into the program.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.440
If you want to get out of paying you'll just need to:

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.780
First: Never have received any social security benefits…

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.800
… and give up your rights to getting any in the future.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.020
Which seems fair.  In addition you must also:

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.740
Be a member of a religion opposed to the idea of social security.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.380
Usually because it’s a kind of insurance, and insurance is a kind of gambling.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.080
That's harder, but you could always just start…

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.620
… your own religion if you were really serious about avoiding taxes.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.260
But your new religion must also:

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.820
Provide for its elderly and dependent members.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.020
Which means you have to re-create a social security program of sorts …

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.760
…in your religion (while also being against social security).

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.400
But if creating a contradictory religion doesn't daunt you…

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.720
Lastly, it must have existed continuously since 1950.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.500
Which is a giveaway that this exception was written pretty much exclusively…

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.920
for the Amish and Mennonites, …

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.040
… and kills dead your plans unless you’re willing …

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.780
… to undergo a serious change in lifestyle.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.200
It doesn't stop there:

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.620
…keep digging and you’ll find all sorts of other weird, weird exceptions:

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.820
… including some railroad workers, or firefighters, or police, …

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.480
… or teachers (but only in Chicago).

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.980
Usually these are groups that in the long long ago…

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.320
… were able to get out of the program at its creation date.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.400
So nothing's ever straight forward.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.200
And that's the deal with this social security card:

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.940
… containing a national number for citizens that don't want one, …

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.720
… on an identification card, that fails at identification, …

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.000
… given to all citizens -- except when it isn't -- …

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.820
…for a program that's universal, except when it's not.
