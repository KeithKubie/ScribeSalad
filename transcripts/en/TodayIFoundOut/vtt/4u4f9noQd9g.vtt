00:00:06.680 --> 00:01:19.000
As we’ve discussed before, there are a handful
of people walking around right now with a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.710
hyper-exclusive jet-black American Express
credit card in their wallets that they could

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.159
theoretically use to buy anything currently
for sale, regardless of its cost.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.670
In fact, the current record we could find
charged on such a credit card is $170 million

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.950
charged by Chinese billionaire, Liu Yiqian,
who no doubt is the world record holder for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.950
those sweet, sweet flight mileage points.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.150
But let’s imagine for a moment that a super-rich
person didn’t have such a card or for whatever

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.439
reason wanted to buy something worth millions
of dollars not with a credit card, but cash.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.439
Could they?

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.140
Well, surprisingly, in many countries no,
with some exceptions.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.439
So let’s now talk about how the uber-wealthy
actually go about paying for things worth

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.409
millions upon millions of dollars.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.369
To begin with, for the most part, paying for
something worth a pile of Ferraris is the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.510
same as paying for any other item, with the
fancy auction houses and stores we researched

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.209
all offering the same basic payment options
as stores for us peons.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.559
For example, Sotheby’s auction houses notes
that customers can pay for any items they

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:27.639
purchase “by bank transfer, cheque or cash
(subject to any restrictions and legal limits)”

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.049
while famed luxury superstore Harrods notes
that you can pay for any item they have for

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.279
sale with PayPal if you really wanted to.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.090
As for how the immeasurably wealthy actually
end up paying for such items, most of the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.150
time they just put it on their card.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.150
What about transaction limits, you say?

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.099
As you can probably imagine, the credit cards
used by millionaires and billionaires are

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.090
different to the ones doled out to us mere
mortals and come with a host of additional

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.109
benefits to ensure the holder doesn’t up
and take all of their money elsewhere.

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.779
Although the existence of these cards isn’t
exactly a secret, banks that issue them don’t

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.680
usually allow customers to apply for them,
instead in most cases invite particularly

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680
wealthy customers to use them.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.510
While the most famous of these cards is arguably
the Black American Express card alluded to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.489
at the start of this piece, there are a number
of similar credit cards out there that fulfill

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.889
essentially the same function, in that they
allow the holder to buy any item they wish

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.189
regardless of its value and provide a ridiculous
number of services that come for free with

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.790
simply having the card at all, including what
almost amounts to something of a personal

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.779
assistant in some sense, or at least someone
who can figure out how to make whatever you

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.049
want to happen, happen.

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.010
This might be something as simple as tracking
down tickets to a sold out show and acquiring

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.729
them, to more outlandish requests.

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.519
If your imagination isn’t all that great,
according to one executive at Amex asked about

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.749
the more bizarre requests the company has
fulfilled on behalf of customers holding their

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.209
Centurion card, he noted they had a card holder
once call up and ask for a handful of sand

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.340
from the Dead Sea be delivered to their address
in London.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.879
The company handled it from there, sending
an international courier to the shores of

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.389
the Dead Sea on a motorcycle.

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.069
The courier then posted the sand to the customer.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.129
Apparently the sand was to be used in a school
project for the customer’s kid.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.680
In another case, the cardholder wanted to
appear on a soap opera, but wasn’t sure

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.019
how to make this happen.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.120
The Amex representative managed to get the
woman an audition for a role in such a show.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.310
Yet another bizarre request was from someone
wanting Amex to find the horse ridden by Kevin

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.540
Costner in Dances with Wolves.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.660
They were not only able to track this down
for the customer, free of charge for this

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.300
sort of service, but were also able to arrange
for purchase of the animal and then had it

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.939
transported to Europe where the customer lived.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.729
In any event, contrary to popular opinion,
these cards do often have a maximum limit,

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.280
it’s just that this limit is informed by
the holder’s personal wealth and the relationship

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.360
they have with their respective bank.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.770
So in the case of billionaires and the like,
since any theoretical limit put in place would

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.111
exceed the value of almost any item available
for purchase on Earth, it’s easier to just

00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.900
say the card has no limit, even though the
bank would almost certainly query such an

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.960
individual trying to charge a billion dollars
to their card unless they got pre-approval

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.360
for the transaction.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.300
In the event a billionaire, for whatever reason,
decided that they instead wanted to pay for

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.930
something worth millions of dollars out of
pocket rather than putting it on a credit

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.139
card, they could just as easily also pay using
a debit card or a personal check.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.830
As with credit cards, there’s no set limit
to the amount of money an individual could

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.639
spend in this manner on a single transaction.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.550
There would just be similar caveats to the
credit card payment method of certain transactions

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.100
likely to be double checked if they were truly
outlandish and out of the ordinary for a given

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.100
account holder.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.990
And, of course, in these cases the one added
caveat of the money needing to be in their

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.819
account at the time, unlike a credit card
purchase.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.280
On that note, for anyone curious, the largest
known personal check ever written was for

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:52.889
$974,790,317.77 in 2014 by one Harold Hamm
to pay his ex-wife a court mandated settlement

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.090
after a divorce.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.139
Amazingly, Hamm’s ex-wife originally refused
to cash the check, feeling the amount was

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.740
too small given Hamm’s then net worth of
$18 billion.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.810
However, she abruptly changed her mind the
next day and cashed it anyway.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.610
According to Forbes, the process of cashing
the check went ahead mostly like any other,

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.749
with the exception of the bank calling Hamm
to make sure the check was genuine before

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:16.290
depositing the money into his ex-wife’s
account.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.289
The largest known business check on the other
hand was written in 2008 by the Mitsubishi

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.419
Financial Group to basically bail out Morgan
Stanley during the 2008 financial crisis.

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.080
The total amount?

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.189
A cool $9 billion.

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.129
It’s noted that ordinarily such a massive
amount of money would have been sent via a

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.830
wire transfer but because the day the money
was needed was Columbus Day (a day banks are

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.330
closed) Mitsubishi decided to just cut Morgan
Stanley a check instead of waiting for the

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.330
banks to reopen.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.240
You’ll note in all of this that we’ve
not yet dealt with the issue of paying cash.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.770
Interestingly, even though a billionaire could
pay for a $100 million yacht with a personal

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.419
check or use a debit or certain credit cards,
as alluded to previously, they generally couldn’t

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.419
pay with cash.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.419
Why?

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.699
Well, to put it simply, nobody would accept
it and even the payer probably wouldn’t

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:10.439
want to pay this way either as there are a
surprising number of very serious laws that

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.500
are easy to unknowingly break when talking
about handling large sums of cash.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.180
While, for example, U.S. law dictates that
any debt (regardless of size) that the debtor

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:27.029
attempts to settle with cold hard cash cannot
be refused (U.S. Code Title 31 §5103), when

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:31.400
looking at buying something directly, it would
seem no such guarantee to be able to use cash

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.830
is available, and this seems to be true in
many nations the world over.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.840
Beyond this, although most banks we researched
note that there’s generally “no limit”

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.030
to the amount of money a customer can theoretically
withdraw from their account at once, in practise

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.800
actually walking into a bank and attempting
to withdraw a million dollars, even if you

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.740
can easily afford it, is a bit of a process.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.990
For starters, many banks simply don’t have
all that much cash held in reserve at any

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.789
one time, so a request to withdraw such a
large amount quite literally couldn’t be

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.620
physically honored in many cases.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.689
For this reason, most banks the world over
ask that customers wanting to withdraw large

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:08.729
amounts of cash should call several days ahead
so that accommodations can be made.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.779
If a customer does call ahead to their bank
with a request to withdraw an especially large

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:15.949
amount of money, providing they have the money
in their account and can prove who they are

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:20.150
over the phone, there really shouldn’t be
any issues in getting money within a reasonable

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.990
time frame, though understandably the more
money you request, the longer it will take

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.620
to be delivered either to the bank or your
home.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.559
Further, most who do this should expect to
have the bank look into what they’re planning

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:33.310
on using the cash for to make sure the customer
is not being scammed.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.520
For the super wealthy, however, they’re
likely to face much less scrutiny on that

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.310
front, especially if withdrawing such large
sums is a frequent thing for them.

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.730
For example, a man known to do exactly this
is boxer Floyd Mayweather, who revealed in

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.610
an interview that he periodically has millions
of dollars in cash delivered to his home by

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.240
his bank, largely just because he can.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.699
In keeping with his nickname “Money”,
Mayweather has been known to, at least in

00:08:56.699 --> 00:09:01.250
a few instances, walk around with more than
a million dollars in cash on his person and,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.070
seemingly in desperate need of a financial
advisor he’ll actually listen to, was once

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:11.070
observed flashing a bank receipt showing that
he had over $100 million, in his checking

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.070
account.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.440
On the less flashy and more humble side of
carrying a lot of cash, keeping with his overall

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.480
“cool guy” persona, in 2013 George Clooney
gathered up 14 of his closest friends and

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.010
presented each one of them with a briefcase
containing exactly $1 million in cash.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.110
The star explained to his stunned friends
that the money was a gift to thank them for

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.480
their support when he was just a struggling
actor, reportedly stating:

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.320
Listen, I want you guys to know how much you’ve
meant to me, and how much you mean to me in

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.320
my life.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.370
I came to L.A., I slept on your couch.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.300
I’m so fortunate in my life to have all
of you, and I couldn’t be where I am today

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.540
without all of you.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.649
So, it was really important to me that, while
we’re still all here together, that I give

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:51.649
back…

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:55.370
I know we’ve all been through some hard
times, some of you are still going through

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.370
it…

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.280
You don’t have to worry about your kids;
you don’t have to worry about school; you

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.670
don’t have to worry about paying your mortgage.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.370
Going back to somewhat more non-charitable
examples, Mayweather is by no means an outlier

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.421
in this regard and numerous celebrities and
millionaires who apparently don’t understand

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:16.759
inflation and the power of compounding interest
have been observed withdrawing obscene amounts

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:21.970
of money from their checking accounts either
to show off or make it rain especially hard

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.140
that day.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.880
And don’t even get us started on Nicholas
Cage…

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.550
Something they generally don’t do, however,
is spend all that money at once in a single

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.260
place because a lot of businesses won’t
accept that much cash in one transaction.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.019
Along with the obvious issues of security
and practicality when it comes to accepting

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:42.310
payment for something worth millions of dollars
in cash, especially large cash deposits often

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:47.000
come with a lot of additional scrutiny from
both banks and the respective government of

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.480
the country you’re making them in.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.770
In the UK, for example, under current UK Money
Laundering Regulations any business or sole

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:58.370
trader that accepts cash payments in excess
of £10,000 has to register as a “high value

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.100
dealer” with HMRC and accepting a cash payment
of this magnitude without doing so carries

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.280
heavy penalties.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.410
Business and individuals who are “only ever
paid large amounts by credit card, debit card

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:13.440
or cheque” on the other hand aren’t required
to do this and as a result, many UK businesses

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.290
will simply not accept cash payments in excess
of this amount.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.339
Likewise, in the United States, banks are
required by law to report individual cash

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:27.940
transactions of $10,000 or more to the IRS
under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.100
Additionally under current US tax law, all
individuals and most (but not all) American

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:38.290
businesses are required to report any individual
cash payments of $10,000 or more to the IRS,

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.170
even if the money isn’t deposited into a
bank account.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:47.389
As in the UK, most businesses don’t want
this kind of hassle so tend to avoid accepting

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:48.860
payments in excess of this amount.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.970
And failure to follow the rules on this sort
of thing comes with both heavy fines and,

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.360
for individuals, even potential jail time.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.399
It is noteworthy that the relatively small
amount of $10,000 as the trigger point has

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:03.970
been something widely railed against in recent
years given this figure has not been adjusted

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.670
for inflation since the law was established
in 1970.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.790
For your reference, $10,000 in 1970 would
be about $65,000 today.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.850
Curiously, one of the few places we found
that doesn’t specifically seem to limit

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.480
the amount a customer can pay at once with
cash are auction houses.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.649
That said, as you may have noticed when we
listed the payment methods accepted by Sotheby’s

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:26.779
earlier, the auction house has a disclaimer
about cash payments, noting that all such

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.399
payments are “subject to any restrictions
and legal limits”.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.880
The auction house isn’t exactly forthcoming
with what exactly these supposed “legal

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.510
limits” are and it’s noted in the book
Money Laundering Through Art: A Criminal Justice

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.060
Perspective that the auction house has never
really made it clear how much cash they’re

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.130
willing to accept at once for a piece they
sell.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:49.430
The same is true of Christie’s who don’t
even make mention of a limit on cash payments

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.389
on any official documentation they’ve ever
released.

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:55.790
This is largely because auction houses in
the US are under “no specific obligation

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.579
to report any suspicious operations” to
the authorities, unlike many other institutions

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.649
that handle large sums of money.

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.899
Because of this, an auction house is likely
the only place, at least in the United States,

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:11.060
where you could conceivably pay for something
worth millions of dollars in cash and not

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.130
have it be that big of a big deal.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.670
It’s worth noting that your bank would still
report the withdrawal of the cash to pay the

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.420
auction house to the IRS who in turn would
probably be very curious about where exactly

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.110
the money went come tax season.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.060
Thus, the insanely wealthy person could very
much expect to get a call about what they

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.200
were doing with those funds, or at least their
accountant would likely get such a call.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.400
Unsurprisingly from all this, while it’s
technically possible to pay for something

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.630
worth millions of dollars at an auction house
with cash, in relatively recent history with

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.139
so many other more convenient ways to pay,
we were unable to find any evidence of such

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:49.019
a transaction ever taking place, though presumably
Floyd Mayweather has had some whopper of cash

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:53.100
payments for things over the years, unless
he’s just re-depositing that cash he withdraws

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.199
after he’s gotten sufficient “showing
off” mileage out of it.

00:13:56.199 --> 00:14:00.800
Either way, given the truly shocking number
of laws there are concerning large cash transactions,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.910
opening one’s self up for scrutiny from
the IRS is something even the obscenely wealthy

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.910
don’t enjoy.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:21.500
Those guys got Al Capone- they can get anyone.
