00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.450
It’s tempting to think of marriage as old
fashioned. Why not just live with someone

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.500
and be done with it? What need for a public
ceremony? Why the weird traditions

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.341
all those churches,
temples, hymns, vows and prayers? Marriage

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:20.100
must be a silly relic from the religious childhood
of humankind, not designed for the more logical

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.160
modern world. And yet it survives. The essence
of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.410
our wills, to put high and costly obstacles
in the way of splitting up. Why do we do this?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.350
Originally, we told ourselves that God wanted
us to stay married. But even now, when God

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.660
is not invoked, we keeping making sure that
marriage is rather hard to undo. For one thing,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.501
you carefully invite everyone you know to
watch you say you’ll stick together. You

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:57.070
willingly create a huge layer of embarrassment
were you ever to turn round and admit it might

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.350
have been a mistake. Furthermore, even though
you could keep things separate, marriage tends

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.320
to mean deep economic and legal entanglements.
You know it is going to take the work of a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.501
phalanx of accountants and lawyers to prise
you apart. It can be done, but

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:17.110
it will be ruinous. It is as if we somewhere
recognise that there might, rather strangely,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.670
be some quite good, though uncomfortable,
reasons why making it difficult to split up

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.340
a union can be an advantage for its members.
The Marshmallow

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.080
Test was a celebrated experiment in the history
of psychology designed to measure children’s

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.659
ability to delay gratification – and track
the consequences of being able to think long-term.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.390
Some three-year-old children were offered
a marshmallow, but told they would get two

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.710
if they held off from eating the first one
for five minutes. It turned out a lot of children

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.760
just couldn’t make it through this period.
It was too tempting; the less immediate benefit

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.150
of gobbling the marshmallow in front of them
was stronger than the strategy of waiting.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.979
Crucially, it was observed that these children
went on to have lives blighted by a lack of

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.229
impulse control, and fared much worse than
the children who were best at subordinating

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.340
immediate fun for long-term benefit. Relationships
are perhaps no different. Here too, many things feel

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.570
very urgent.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.849
We’re angry and want to get out. We’re
excited by a new person and need to abandon

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.800
our present partner at once. And yet as we
look around for the exit, every way seems

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.930
blocked. It would cost a fortune, it would
be so embarrassing, it would take an age.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.780
This isn’t a coincidence. Marriage is a
giant inhibitor of impulse set up by our conscience

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.980
to keep our libidinous, ungreatful, wild, desiring
selves in check. What we are essentially buying

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.379
into by submitting to its dictates is the
insight that we are (as individuals) likely

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.370
to make very poor choices under the sway of
strong short-term impulses. To marry is to

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.790
recognise that we require structure to insulate
us from our urges. It is to lock ourselves

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.680
up willingly, because we don't trust ourselves.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.880
It's a very unusual marriage indeed in which the two people
don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasising

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.709
that they weren’t in fact married. But the
point of marriage is to make these feelings

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.520
not matter very much. It is an arrangement
that protects us from what we desire and yet

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.450
know (in our more reasonable moments) we don’t
truly need or want.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.750
At their best, relationships involve
us in attempts to develop, mature and become

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.330
‘whole’. We often get drawn to people
precisely because they promise to edge us

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.294
in the right directions.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.760
But It is too easy to seem kind and normal when we  keep going out with someone

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.200
new. The truth about us, on the basis of which

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.560
self-improvement begins, only becomes clear
over time. Chances of development increase

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.240
hugely when we don’t keep running away to
people who will falsely reassure us that there’s

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.290
nothing too wrong with us.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440
Over time, the argument for marriage has shifted

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000
It’s no longer about
external forces having power over us:

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.989
What we are correctly now focused on is the psychological 
point of making it hard to throw it all in.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.720
For the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has
been

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.430
on attempting to make separation easier.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.680
The challenge now lies in another direction:
in trying to remind ourselves why immediate

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.290
flight doesn’t always make sense; in trying
to see the point of holding out for the second

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.790
marshmallow.
