00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.710
is the world's largest group gathering
of people who are sort of experts in the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720
of people who are sort of experts in the
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960
of people who are sort of experts in the
semiconductor area but I wanted to take

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970
semiconductor area but I wanted to take
 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.569
semiconductor area but I wanted to take
it up a couple of levels and you know

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579
it up a couple of levels and you know
 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.640
it up a couple of levels and you know
one of the things that IBM has

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650
one of the things that IBM has
 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.159

tremendous emphasis on is the impact of
 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.720
tremendous emphasis on is the impact of
what we do on society and if you've been

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190
I have you know you do have a concern
 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.080
I have you know you do have a concern
because we can make huge differences in

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090
because we can make huge differences in
 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.140
because we can make huge differences in
people's lives unimaginable if you just

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150
people's lives unimaginable if you just
 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.940
people's lives unimaginable if you just
pay attention it's very easy to ignore

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950
pay attention it's very easy to ignore

challenges but if you set a challenge

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450
challenges but if you set a challenge
 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.540
challenges but if you set a challenge
for yourself and you said it to be

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550
for yourself and you said it to be

something that will actually change the
way the world works and then you pull it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990
way the world works and then you pull it
 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.870
way the world works and then you pull it
off and grand challenges don't always

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880
off and grand challenges don't always
 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.250
off and grand challenges don't always
work that's why they call them grand

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260

closing out that's just how that is but

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
closing out that's just how that is but
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.279
closing out that's just how that is but
it is very important when you work in

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289
it is very important when you work in

ultimately go into that you just keep in

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159
ultimately go into that you just keep in

ultimately go into that you just keep in
the back of your mind there are places

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479
the back of your mind there are places
 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.139
the back of your mind there are places
where innovation you know the big stuff

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
where innovation you know the big stuff

you're going to do does matter will have

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310
you're going to do does matter will have
 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.699
you're going to do does matter will have
a profound impact and just keep your

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709
a profound impact and just keep your
 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.319
a profound impact and just keep your
eyes open to that because you'd be

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329
eyes open to that because you'd be
 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.129
eyes open to that because you'd be
amazed what you can miss there are a

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139
amazed what you can miss there are a

couple of rather large challenges out

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880
couple of rather large challenges out
 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.429
couple of rather large challenges out
there and I wanted to just set the stage

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439
there and I wanted to just set the stage
 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.529
there and I wanted to just set the stage
because all of these things ultimately

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539
because all of these things ultimately
 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.069
because all of these things ultimately
are basically handled believe it or not

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079
are basically handled believe it or not
 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.899
are basically handled believe it or not
as challenges through information

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069
fact I had a very interesting meeting
 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.650
fact I had a very interesting meeting
where before this in fact somebody was

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660
where before this in fact somebody was
 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.760
where before this in fact somebody was
telling me gee I'm going to work on

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770
telling me gee I'm going to work on
 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.980
telling me gee I'm going to work on
water management as part of my studies

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
water management as part of my studies
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.390
water management as part of my studies
in computer science and I think that's

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
in computer science and I think that's
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.730
in computer science and I think that's
very cool because in fact there's a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740
very cool because in fact there's a
 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.500
very cool because in fact there's a
problem here

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
problem here
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.140
problem here
right now if you ask people will you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150
right now if you ask people will you
 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.770
right now if you ask people will you
have a major crisis in water supply in

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780
have a major crisis in water supply in

this issue they say yeah in the next two
years I will at least once have a major

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
years I will at least once have a major
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.670
years I will at least once have a major
crisis in water supply okay that's way

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680
crisis in water supply okay that's way
 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.030

tell you where that was the problem is

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409
tell you where that was the problem is

tell you where that was the problem is
right now if you do quantitative

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209
right now if you do quantitative
 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.990
right now if you do quantitative
measurements here people just looking

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
measurements here people just looking
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.610
measurements here people just looking
for a parking spot in this one segment

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620
for a parking spot in this one segment
 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.920
for a parking spot in this one segment
they took a small area of LA and they

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930
they took a small area of LA and they
 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.110
they took a small area of LA and they
said how bad is it people looking for a

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120
said how bad is it people looking for a
 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.210
said how bad is it people looking for a
parking spot basically drove around the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220
parking spot basically drove around the
 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.610
things smaller faster better cheaper and
that's a really nice theory but the

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:35.620
that's a really nice theory but the
 

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.160
that's a really nice theory but the
reality is it's very hard to do so

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.170
reality is it's very hard to do so
 

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.450
reality is it's very hard to do so
you're getting into now some really

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:39.460
you're getting into now some really
 

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.820
you're getting into now some really
exotic transistors the reason these are

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:41.830
exotic transistors the reason these are
 

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.470
exotic transistors the reason these are
exotic cuz these guys are standing up

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480
exotic cuz these guys are standing up
 

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.780
exotic cuz these guys are standing up
vertically from the surface for the last

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:45.790
vertically from the surface for the last
 

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.580
vertically from the surface for the last
50 years transistors lay flat on the

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:47.590
50 years transistors lay flat on the
 

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.710
50 years transistors lay flat on the
surface the trouble is that if it lays

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720
surface the trouble is that if it lays
 

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.180
surface the trouble is that if it lays
flat on the surface you can't do enough

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:51.190
flat on the surface you can't do enough
 

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.100
flat on the surface you can't do enough
to the surface to get adequate

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.110
to the surface to get adequate
 

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.570

performance once you get down below

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:54.580
performance once you get down below
 

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.910

about 22 nanometers so what's happening

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920
about 22 nanometers so what's happening
 

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.320
about 22 nanometers so what's happening
is people are actually looking at taking

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.330
is people are actually looking at taking
 

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.120
is people are actually looking at taking
the transistor literally standing a

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.130
the transistor literally standing a
 

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.520
the transistor literally standing a
little thin thin of silicon off the

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:02.530
little thin thin of silicon off the
 

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.710
little thin thin of silicon off the
surface so they can wrap a electrically

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720
surface so they can wrap a electrically
 

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.900
surface so they can wrap a electrically
controlled and gate around it and pinch

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:06.910
controlled and gate around it and pinch
 

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.520
controlled and gate around it and pinch
off the electrical current through it to

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:08.530
off the electrical current through it to
 

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.530
off the electrical current through it to
cut down on leakage I mean these things

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:10.540
cut down on leakage I mean these things
 

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.360
cut down on leakage I mean these things
are unimaginably complicated to build

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.370
are unimaginably complicated to build
 

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.770
are unimaginably complicated to build
also there are other devices we're

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:16.780
also there are other devices we're
 

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.540
also there are other devices we're
looking at that are literally different

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:18.550
looking at that are literally different
 

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.310
looking at that are literally different
than a standard transistor this is a

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:20.320
than a standard transistor this is a
 

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.310
than a standard transistor this is a
silicon nanowire these little wires here

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:23.320
silicon nanowire these little wires here
 

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.200
silicon nanowire these little wires here
are incredibly tiny and only about five

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.210
are incredibly tiny and only about five
 

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.180
are incredibly tiny and only about five
nanometers or 50 angstroms are about a

nanometers or 50 angstroms are about a
 

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.850
nanometers or 50 angstroms are about a
hundred atoms across and there you

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:29.860
hundred atoms across and there you
 

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.500
hundred atoms across and there you
actually put a gate around the device

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:31.510
actually put a gate around the device
 

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.080
actually put a gate around the device
it's like a tube so you have a silicon

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.090
it's like a tube so you have a silicon
 

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:35.880
it's like a tube so you have a silicon
conducting to lock side around that you

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:35.890
conducting to lock side around that you
 

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.350
conducting to lock side around that you
wrap a piece of metal around that and

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360
wrap a piece of metal around that and
 

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.020
wrap a piece of metal around that and
you can turn the tube on and off I mean

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.030
you can turn the tube on and off I mean
 

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.120
you can turn the tube on and off I mean
these again are very exotic devices they

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.130
these again are very exotic devices they
 

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.580
these again are very exotic devices they
do work but you struggle to get them to

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:44.590
do work but you struggle to get them to
 

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.919
do work but you struggle to get them to

this is very difficult but you know what

00:17:46.629 --> 00:17:46.639
this is very difficult but you know what
 

00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:48.970

you haven't got a lot of choice there's
 

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.680
you haven't got a lot of choice there's
some really fancy stuff where these are

probably heard of those this is a
 

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:55.570
probably heard of those this is a

why his Buckminster Fuller really liked

00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159
why his Buckminster Fuller really liked
 

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:03.730
why his Buckminster Fuller really liked
this particular shape that the carbon

many times is reduce the number of
 

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.410
many times is reduce the number of
vehicles by a few percent and the jam
