LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.970
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.940
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.240
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.840
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.220
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.420
and why they do it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.506
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.630
Welcome to this episode of
"Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.452
I'm Laurence Moroney, and today
we have a really special show.

00:00:27.452 --> 00:00:29.910
And if you only ever watch one
episode, let it be this one,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.500
because today we have a cloud
developer advocate called

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.112
Heidi Dohse who's joining us.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:36.070
And Heidi is a whole lot
more than just a cloud

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.210
developer advocate.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.920
She's a really inspirational
woman with a great background

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.430
and a fabulous story.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.850
But before we get
to that, tell us

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.641
all about being a cloud
developer advocate.

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.271
What do you do?

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.520
HEIDI DOHSE: So I'm on our
Google Cloud Platform team,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.820
and I work with our cloud
product managers, our sales

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260
team, and our engineering
team to kind of figure out

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.170
what are we doing with
cloud, customer needs,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.320
and really how do we also
connect the dots internal

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.830
to Google to leverage what we're
doing with the Google Cloud

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.510
Platform.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.310
Do you have a particular
favorite technology in cloud?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.710
I'm an App Engine guy.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.720
HEIDI DOHSE: So what I'm really
intrigued with what we're doing

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.450
is what we're doing with
our Genomics platforms.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.470
Obviously, I have
a passion for, how

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400
do we change the delivery and
the future of health care,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.980
so Google Cloud
Platform is allowing

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.990
us to do some really
interesting things

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.410
and talk with our
Google Life Sciences

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.020
team, who is doing
some great research

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020
and interesting projects.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.120
And all of that
living on Google Cloud

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.070
Platform along with
Genomics and then

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.930
just creating an
infrastructure that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.000
will allow other companies
to build their medical tools

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.872
and products on our service.

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:50.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
you've mentioned Genomics

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.567
and medical tools
and products, and I

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.150
know you've got this
great background.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.200
You used to be like a
competitive windsurfer,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.390
and then life happened.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.750
So tell us about it.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.886
HEIDI DOHSE: Well, I did.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:03.260
I grew up in the
sports industry.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.040
I was a competitive
windsurfer, skier,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.130
I played multiple sports,
a variety of sports

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.770
as a child growing up.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.530
And then one day,
turns out I actually

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.100
was diagnosed with a really
rare heart arrhythmia,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.670
and kind of had
my engine tweaked.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.010
And next thing you
know, technology

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.854
became very important both on
the inside and the outside.

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:29.520
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Nice, and then one day

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.260
you learned something
about your heart.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.170
HEIDI DOHSE: I did.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.470
I had one of those moments in
life that changes everything.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.090
I was 18 years old,
and I was going in

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.660
between seasons, between ski
season and windsurfing season,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.740
in order to have some
surgery on my knee

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.840
to clean up a little bit
of mess I'd made in there.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.930
And I also had my first EKG as
part of the pre-surgery pre-op.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.990
So they put all the
little stickers on me,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.970
and the nurse is
there, and the strip

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.480
starts coming out
of the machine,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.620
and her eyes get
bigger and bigger.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.470
And next thing you know,
the cardiologist is there,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.724
and it turns out that 270
beats per minute is not normal.

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:10.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.230
HEIDI DOHSE: Yeah,
and so I thought, ah,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.841
that's why I couldn't
count my pulls.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:17.340
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's just so fast.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.173
HEIDI DOHSE: It was.

00:03:18.173 --> 00:03:20.740
And my heart rate, it turns
out, would go up as high as 270,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.920
but it would also go down
at like 12 and 14 beats

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.800
per minute.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.990
So it was just really irregular.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.060
So there I am-- healthy,
active, 18-year-old athlete--

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.360
and they said no knee surgery.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.650
We're sending you off to
the coronary care unit,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.080
and you're now going to
start this journey of a heart

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.810
patient.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.893
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, wow.

00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:47.047
So that led you to like
lots of pacemakers, right?

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:47.880
HEIDI DOHSE: It did.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.955
First, it led me to the-- I
spent a month in the hospital

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:54.699
while they tried to figure
out what to do with me.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.490
They tried all kinds
of experimental drugs.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.760
They tried to figure out
what it was that I had,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.570
and I ended up in
the medical journals,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.140
because it was like, well,
we found something new.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.100
And they said,
gee, we're not sure

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.680
why you lasted as
long as you did,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.957
and we don't know how
long you'll be around.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.790
And there's not much
more we can do for you.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.570
At 18, that's got to be hard.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.740
HEIDI DOHSE: It was, and so
I moved to Maui to windsurf,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.850
because I figured
business school was not

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.350
going to be as
necessary if I wasn't

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.690
going to be around very long.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.560
And then the
following year, I was

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.930
invited to participate in
an experimental surgery,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.400
and they electrocuted
my AV node,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.650
which is the part
of your heart that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.450
coordinates the atrium
and the ventricle

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.270
and makes it go duh-duh.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.330
And I became 100%
pacemaker-dependent,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.760
and that was 30-plus years ago.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.110
So I have been on the cutting
edge of pacemaker technology

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.907
for about 30 years, and
I'm on my seventh one.

00:04:48.907 --> 00:04:50.490
LAURENCE MORONEY:
On your seventh one.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.740
HEIDI DOHSE: On my seventh one.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.310
And now it's like you're
not just sitting around

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.143
with this pacemaker.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:57.390
You're doing pretty extreme and
intense sports with it, right?

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.520
HEIDI DOHSE: I am.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.100
It's interesting, because
you have a choice.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.810
You can either be a
victim of your condition,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.760
or you can figure out how
to do really cool stuff,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.750
even though you've
got to deal with it.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.580
So I was a
professional windsurfer

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.030
when I had the first one put
in, and I never considered

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.180
myself a heart patient.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.950
I just figured I was a girl
with a bad electrical system,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.640
and we fixed it, so I kept
doing what I was doing.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.320
But those first heartbeats
were really clunky,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.150
and kind of this big cigarette
pack of a battery in my chest.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.640
Over the years, the heartbeats
have gotten smoother.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.820
There's more sensors
built into the pacemaker.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.400
So every time I get a new
one, I get new technology.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.610
Just like everything else we
do, the technology gets better,

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.240
and when people ask,
oh, gosh, don't you

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.210
wish you could just get
it and have it stay in?

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.230
It's like, no.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.896
LAURENCE MORONEY: You
want the upgrades.

00:05:52.896 --> 00:05:54.271
HEIDI DOHSE: I
want the upgrades.

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:56.104
LAURENCE MORONEY: For
me, I just think about

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:58.750
getting a new phone for
the upgrades, but wow.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.477
A new pacemaker.

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:01.060
HEIDI DOHSE: No, I
get new heartbeats.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.350
And then the heartbeats
do more, and in 2010, due

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.820
to unintended consequences
of lots of surgeries,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.260
I had to have open
heart surgery.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.820
And I decided to be a
competitive cyclist.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.970
And that's when this journey
of extreme endurance sports

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.121
started.

00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:20.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
not the usual thing

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.810
people go is like, I
had open heart surgery,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.500
so I'm deciding to become
a competitive cyclist.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.990
Where did you make
that connection?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.050
HEIDI DOHSE: You know, because
I had grown up playing sports,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.750
I didn't want to lose being me.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.390
And I just, I think I
was too stubborn to let

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.415
heart issues take the life
that I really liked away.

00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:44.790
So I just thought,
what the heck?

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.876
Let's see how much I can do.

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:48.750
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
just pretty amazing.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.300
Now one of the things
is to be able to cycle

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.190
and to enhance your ability to
cycle you're using technology.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.007
There's a lot of sensors
in the pacemaker,

00:06:57.007 --> 00:06:58.840
and you're using that
to manage your health.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.290
Can you tell us a little bit
about how all of that works?

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.040
HEIDI DOHSE: Sure.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.120
So there's a couple of things.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.890
There is what happens inside
my chest with the pacemaker,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.520
and that is the pacemaker
has a gyroscope.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.950
It has oxygen utilization,
muscle stimulation,

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.530
electrical impulses.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.990
It takes all of this information
and quickly determines,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.140
hey, this is either
a tachycardia,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.800
or oh, it's actually exercise.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.560
And it does a bit
of machine learning.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.630
So that first 30
minutes of something,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.070
it's kind of taking all this
information in and saying,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.180
OK, great, go do
what you need to do.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.960
And so if I'm doing
a mountain bike race,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.690
and I've got a two-hour
climb in front of me,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.090
my pacemaker will
know what's going on.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.980
So that's what's
happening inside.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.330
But it can still be really
scary just mentally for me,

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.060
like how hard can I push
before I explode something?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.375
Which I'd prefer not
to explode something.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.100
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Yeah, I can see that.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.700
HEIDI DOHSE: So now we have
all these really great wearable

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.520
technologies.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.170
We've got between my-- exactly.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:13.120
So performance athletes,
we've had access

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.510
to chest straps and
the polar devices,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.340
or Garmin has some things, but
because of my heart failure

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.950
medication and my pacemaker,
the chest straps don't work.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.600
So it took a long
time until we finally

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.080
got to where they have
these optical light sensors.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.950
So Mio, Global, couple
different companies

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.480
make a really great
wrist-based heart

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.730
rate monitor that I use
that I can then determine

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.270
when I'm cycling, am I safe?

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.419
Am I in that realm
that I need to be?

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.360
And then also,
can I push harder?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.040
What more should I be doing?

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.010
And that's how it's
really important

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.500
to give me the confidence
as a heart patient

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.770
to feel safe that I can keep
doing what I need to do,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.140
and then as an athlete, am
I getting the performance

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.460
that I should be getting?

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.520
Can I train harder?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.219
How much harder can I train?

00:09:04.219 --> 00:09:06.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
now not just athletes

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.110
can benefit from this
technology, right?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.966
So just the average, everyday
person can have a sensor.

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:11.840
HEIDI DOHSE: Exactly.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.330
And I found being a heart
patient for as many years

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.390
as I've been and having to
deal with the initial surgery,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.400
new pacemakers being
implanted, open heart surgery,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.800
heart failure, there's a
lot of really scary moments.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.280
There's these times
where it's like, gosh,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.470
is my heart doing what
it's supposed to be doing?

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.850
Should I just stay safe,
get in the fetal position,

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.460
and lay on the couch,
because you don't

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.360
know what's going on inside.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.440
And with these devices and
these sensors and things,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.100
I now have that window
inside of what's happening,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.800
so that makes me feel safer.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.250
And with that safety,
I'm more confident,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.910
and I'm less apt to have that
anxiety that starts to spin,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.500
and then there's anxiety,
and the fear turns

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.710
into panic attacks,
and for anyone

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.460
that's ever had a
panic attack, you truly

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.110
feel like you're dying.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.360
And that can oftentimes,
for an individual,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.580
and I've done it
myself, that ends up

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.520
being a trip to the cardiologist
or the emergency room.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.830
There you are consuming these
really expensive health care

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.570
dollars, because
you're just sure

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.900
you're having a heart
issue, when really you're

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.410
kind of having a scary issue.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.810
And the sensors allow you
to catch that and stop

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.380
that before it
turns into an issue.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.900
And they also, would they
allow the doctor to preempt,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.860
instead of maybe
you visiting monthly

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.320
or every three
months or something

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.230
like that, that they can take
a look at your data constantly,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.990
and then they go, ah, I need to
see her now instead of waiting.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.980
HEIDI DOHSE: Exactly.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.930
So two things there is
that I can eliminate

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.790
having to go in for pacer checks
as often, because my Boston

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.450
Scientific device has
something called the Latitude

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.110
Communicator, and it's
a passive interrogator

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.820
that I can just have in my home.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.590
It's collecting data
from my pacemaker

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.160
and sending it to my
physician, and they can kind of

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.090
look at that.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.980
Everything's
working as intended.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.290
Big thumbs up.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.760
If not, if there's
actually an issue,

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.980
they can proactively
call me and say, hey,

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.510
let's just check that out.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.680
The other thing is that no one
ever found my heart issue until

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.010
I went in for something else,
because it never happens when

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.670
you're at the doctor's.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.630
Now people have the ability
to collect more information

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.630
on their health, and if they do
see something that's going on,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.780
they can go to their
physician, and they can say,

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.090
see this event?

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.400
This is what happened.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.705
Here's the actual data,
and here's how I felt. Now

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:50.340
it becomes something
that's actionable.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.100
And you find things
much quicker, et cetera.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.300
Wow.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.357
And I just still find it
amazing though that despite all

00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:00.190
of this, despite this
background that you've

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.416
had that these cycle races that
you do, they're tough races.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:06.540
I saw the one in Vancouver.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.665
You effectively climbed
the height of Mount Everest

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:10.630
over the period of a few days.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.596
HEIDI DOHSE: Yeah.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:14.740
So I just finished--
it's called BC Bike Race,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.400
and it's a seven-day
mountain bike stage race,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.090
and it's through some of
the most technical mountain

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:27.130
biking in the North
Vancouver, Whistler, Squamish

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.160
area, kind of the birth
of mountain biking.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.830
And we did seven
back-to-back days,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.729
over 32,000 feet of climbing--

00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:38.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's
the Mount Everest.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.560
HEIDI DOHSE: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.760
And then this last
weekend I just

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.350
did Leadville Stage
Race, where we were doing

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.895
climbs up to over 12,500
feet in elevation.

00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:55.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: And technology
has made all of this possible.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.780
Obviously, you've put
your hard work in as well,

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.279
but the technology's been
one of the enablers for you.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.070
HEIDI DOHSE: It is.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.820
Without technology, I couldn't
be doing what I'm doing.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.930
Without the improvement
in technology

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.970
that the pacemaker company does,
I wouldn't have the heartbeats,

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.140
and without the technology that
things like our mobile devices,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.480
the sensors allow me as a
heart patient to be safe,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.272
and as an athlete to
have more performance.

00:13:22.272 --> 00:13:23.230
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.630
Now you're a developer
advocate on the cloud platform.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.050
HEIDI DOHSE: Yes.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: How are you
bringing your cloud skills

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:28.240
to this?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.130
HEIDI DOHSE: So all
this data is great,

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.970
but how do you actually
get it to the right people?

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.520
Well, it has to
live in the cloud.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.250
So I look at what we're doing
with the Google Cloud Platform

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.980
as enabling technology
that will really

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.300
allow the future
of digital health

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.280
and customize personal
health to happen,

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.420
because our Google
Cloud Platform

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.950
is where the data can be
ingested from the devices,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.900
from the doctor's
office, from the devices.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.230
It can be analyzed, and then
it can be made actionable,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.330
and those actionable bits
can be delivered to a health

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.620
care professional, researchers,
individual patients,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.167
and whoever needs to use it.

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:10.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we're
really only getting started.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.680
HEIDI DOHSE: We're
just getting started.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.596
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
it's-- thank you so much.

00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:15.470
It's such an
inspirational story.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.480
I mean, I find myself like hard
to ride my bicycle at times,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.150
and I'm on my zeroth pacemaker.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.080
And so just thanks for the
inspiration, and best of luck.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.170
I know you've got some
great races coming up soon,

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.128
so hopefully we'll get
to see a little bit more

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:31.790
of what you do in
them, and we'll

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.140
get to see a little bit
more of how you continue

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.890
to use technology to
push the edge of how it

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.660
can make your life
better as well

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.990
as other people's life better.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.948
HEIDI DOHSE: Wonderful.

00:14:40.948 --> 00:14:42.260
Well, thank you so much.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.570
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
thanks, everybody.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.778
I hope you really enjoyed
this show as much as I did.

00:14:45.778 --> 00:14:47.520
Heidi's just such an
inspiration to me,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.280
and it's making me
get up off the couch

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.690
and ride my bike this weekend.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.750
Thanks, Heidi.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.316
And if you have any
questions for me,

00:14:53.316 --> 00:14:54.940
or if you have any
questions for Heidi,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.000
please just leave them
in the comments below.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.330
And if you want to watch any
more of the great content

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.150
that we have for
Google Developers,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.920
take a look at the Google
Developers Channel.
