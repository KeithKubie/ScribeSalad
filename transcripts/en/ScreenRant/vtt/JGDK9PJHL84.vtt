00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.070
Winning an Oscar is the highest honor an actor
or actress can receive, but unfortunately,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.719
there are only four acting trophies handed
out at each ceremony.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.090
This means that there are plenty of stellar
performances that go home empty handed every

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.640
year, even if millions of viewers deem them
awards worthy.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.870
It’s always an honor just to be nominated,
but some thespians out there would love to

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.660
receive a little gold man of their own one
day very soon, and their fans are constantly

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
rooting for them.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.080
Here are 10 amazing actors who are long overdue
to win an Oscar.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
Amy Adams

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.370
Now that Leonardo DiCaprio has claimed his
first Best Actor prize, Amy Adams has arguably

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.660
seized the overdue narrative all for herself.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.910
One of the finest actresses of her generation,
Adams has been nominated five times five times,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.280
most recently for 2013’s American Hustle.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.900
She always gives it her all, but she still
hasn’t emerged from an Oscar race victorious

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.900
yet.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.670
Her best chance might have been The Fighter,
but in a cruel twist of fate, she lost to

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.080
co-star Melissa Leo, who was nominated in
the same category.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.989
Adams headlines Arrival and Nocturnal Animals
this fall, two projects building Academy Award

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.430
buzz, so maybe her cold streak will end in
2016.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
Andy Serkis

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.920
Chances are, you’ve heard the name Andy
Serkis, but are unfamiliar with what he actually

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
looks like.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.860
Serkis was one of the leading pioneers in
the art of motion-capture acting, bringing

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.880
a new sense of realism to digital characters.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.840
His standout roles include Gollum in Lord
of the Rings and Caesar in the new Planet

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.920
of the Apes films.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.670
The Internet has been campaigning for Serkis
to get an Oscar for years, but Academy rules

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.560
disqualify him since he doesn’t actually
physically appear on-screen.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.479
Still, many are hoping that he receives a
Special Achievement award one day for his

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.479
contributions to the industry, which has made
so much possible in a short amount of time.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.479
Gary Oldman

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.770
Oldman is one of those actors who can truly
transform and fully embody his roles, so it’s

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.159
shocking that he’s only been nominated for
one Oscar – his performance in the drama

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.450
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.150
Oldman is a generational talent; it’s hard
to believe Commissioner Gordon from The Dark

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.450
Knight once played Sid Vicious or was the
villain in The Professional.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.950
He always commands one’s attention with
his dedication to his parts and constantly

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.300
knocks it out of the park.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.049
Hopefully one day the right script comes across
his desk and the Academy can make up for this

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.049
error.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.020
They have a tendency to reward longtime veterans,
so maybe Oldman’s time will come soon.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.310
Samuel L. Jackson

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.040
Jackson has built a career featuring one great
performance after another and boasts just

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.950
a single Oscar nomination on his résumé
for Pulp Fiction.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.099
Some of his best work has gone overlooked
by the Academy, such as his other Tarantino

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.849
collaborations Django Unchained and The Hateful
Eight.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.530
Jackson is known for his shouting, but he’s
more than capable of delivering an emotionally

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
rich turn.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.400
His performances in films like Black Snake
Moan and Unbreakable are exemplary, and many

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.660
would be in agreement that Jackson deserves
an Oscar.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.400
As he balances his time in the MCU with more
“prestigious” roles, maybe his fortunes

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.180
will change eventually.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180
Glenn Close

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.220
Close holds an Academy record, and not the
kind one would want.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.879
She’s been nominated six times in her career,
which is the most without securing at least

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.879
one win.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.180
Close is an extremely versatile performer,
playing a wide range of characters over the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.180
years.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.190
She’s received recognition for playing a
crazy stalker in Fatal Attraction, a woman

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.640
passing herself as a man in Albert Nobbs,
and everything in between.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.129
She’s clearly one of a kind and has been
waiting a long time for her name to be called.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.440
You’d think she’ll eventually break through,
since she’s established as a legend who

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.959
has proven her worth time and time again.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.260
Robert Downey, Jr.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.269
RDJ is firmly entrenched as the face of the
Marvel Cinematic Universe, but cinephiles

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.890
know his talents go well beyond playing Tony
Stark.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.489
Downey has turned in numerous outstanding
performances, earning two Oscar nominations

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.489
along the way.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.640
His first came in the biopic Chaplin, where
he played the film’s namesake.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.129
He also famously was a Best Supporting Actor
candidate for his controversial turn as Kirk

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.720
Lazarus in Tropic Thunder, and might have
won if it wasn’t also the year Heath Ledger

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.880
was in The Dark Knight.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.560
Though Downey may never win for being Iron
Man, the Academy may look to reward him if

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.849
the right role comes his way.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.160
He’s a fan-favorite and well liked in the
industry.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.190
Tom Cruise

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.670
Before he went into full action hero mode,
Tom Cruise was one of the better dramatic

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.970
actors out there, earning praise for his turns
in films like Rain Man and A Few Good Men.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.269
He’s been nominated three times in his career:
Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire,

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.269
and Magnolia.

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.840
Regardless of what one things of his personal
life, Cruise is fiercely dedicated to his

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.690
craft, and if he took a break from Jack Reacher
and Ethan Hunt to go back to drama, he could

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.250
clinch himself an Oscar win.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.129
Cruise’s main goal is to constantly make
movies general audiences enjoy, but he certainly

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.290
wouldn’t turn down an Academy Award if one
came his way.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.290
Michael Keaton

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.050
Keaton has had a starring role in the last
two Best Picture winners, Birdman and Spotlight,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.140
but he remains without an Oscar of his own.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.650
In fact, despite multiple outstanding performances,
he’s only been nominated once.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.629
Many had pegged Keaton as the favorite for
Best Actor in 2014, the year of Birdman, but

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.800
it was strictly a sentimental choice of moviegoers.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.360
Keaton lost to Eddie Redmayne, who played
Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.460
Keaton is back at it this year as McDonald’s
founder Ray Kroc in The Founder, and he could

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.729
have another shot if everything falls into
place.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.259
Three other Batmen are Oscar winners, so why
not make it four?

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.360
Viola Davis

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.539
Davis has been nominated twice in her long,
successful career for her turns in Doubt and

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:45.539
The Help.

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.229
She’s been delivering powerful performance
after powerful performance for more than a

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.789
decade, and now the Academy is starting to
take notice.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.039
Though she remains without an Oscar – few
can stop the Meryl Streep train when that

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.919
gets rolling – many believe Davis’ time
is coming shortly.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.439
She stars alongside Academy favorite Denzel
Washington in this year’s Fences, reprising

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.999
a role that earned her a Tony award during
the stage production.

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.580
If the film is anything like the play, she
could end up on the stage on Oscar night.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.580
Harrison Ford

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.479
An icon thanks to his geek-friendly roles
of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Ford is a strong

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.819
actor and can be much more than a charming
rogue.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.370
He’s earned one Oscar nomination in his
storied career, playing a cop gone hiding

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.099
in an Amish village in Witness.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.879
The Golden Globes are fonder of his talents,
giving Ford four Best Actor nominations – including

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.699
Best Picture nominee The Fugitive - and the
Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2012.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.139
His legacy in films is without question, but
it would please many to see Ford’s status

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.689
as one of the all-time greats cemented with
an Academy Award.

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.460
He’s free from Star Wars now, so maybe he
can chase gold until he retires.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.930
Those are just some of the actors who are
overdue for an Oscar win.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.330
Are there any we missed?

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.719
Which ones do you hope receive an Academy
Award one day?
