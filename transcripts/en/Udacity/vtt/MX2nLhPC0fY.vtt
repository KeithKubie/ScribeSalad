[Dave] So question 8 also tests how well you understand the find method

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
as well as using variables.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The question is assume that text is a variable that holds any string value.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Your goal is to write Python code that prints out the position

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of the second occurrence of the string "zip" in text

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or prints out -1 if the string "zip" does not occur at least twice in text.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So there are 2 examples.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If text is "zip files are zipped,"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the output should be 14, which is where the second zip appears.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If the text value is "zip files are compressed,"

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the output should be -1 since zip only appears once.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And this is a pretty tough question,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so I'm going to give this one a single gold star.
