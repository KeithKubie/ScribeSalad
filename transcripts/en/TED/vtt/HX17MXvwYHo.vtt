00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:18.769
There are about 5,000 women here today.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:26.654
Among us, 1,250 have been
or will be sexually assaulted

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:29.667
at some point in our lives.

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:33.621
One in four.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.906
Only 10 percent will report it.

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:45.832
The other 90 percent
take refuge in silence --

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:52.714
half of them, because the incident
involves a close family member

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:55.149
or someone they know,

00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:59.956
and that makes it much more difficult
to deal with and talk about.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.669
The other half don't talk about it

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.689
because they fear they wonâ€™t be believed.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.217
And they're right -- because we don't.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:19.094
Today I want to share with you
why I think we don't believe them.

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:24.999
We don't believe them because when
a woman tells what happened to her,

00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:27.672
she tells us things we can't imagine,

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.053
things that disturb us,

00:01:30.077 --> 00:01:32.325
things we don't expect to hear,

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:33.966
things that shock us.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.380
We expect to hear stories like this one:

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:44.569
"Girl raped near
the Mitre Railroad tracks.

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:48.123
It happened at midnight
as she was on her way home.

00:01:48.147 --> 00:01:52.343
She said that someone
attacked her from behind,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:56.663
told her not to scream, said he had a gun
and that she shouldn't move.

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:59.219
He raped her and then fled the scene."

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:05.908
When we hear or read a story like this,

00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:08.958
we immediately visualize it:

00:02:10.212 --> 00:02:13.960
the rapist, a depraved lower-class man.

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:20.733
And the victim, a young, attractive woman.

00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:27.699
The image only lasts 10 or 20 seconds,
and it's dark and two-dimensional;

00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:32.523
there's no movement, no sound;
it's as if there were no people involved.

00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:39.505
But when a woman tells her story,
it doesn't fit in 10 or 20 seconds.

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:45.390
The following is the testimony
of a woman I'll call "Ana."

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:49.585
She's one of the 85 women I interviewed

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.927
while conducting research
on sexual assault.

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.703
Ana told me:

00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:05.841
"I had gone with the girls in the office
to the same pub we always go to.

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:07.991
We met some guys,

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:12.507
and I hooked up with this super
cool guy; we talked a lot.

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:16.904
Around 4am, I told my friends
it was time to go.

00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.703
They wanted to stay.

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:21.626
So, the guy asked me where I lived

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.477
and said if it was OK with me,
he'd drive me home.

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.524
I agreed, and we left.

00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:31.685
At a stoplight, he told me
he liked me and touched my leg.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.320
I don't like a guy
to approach me that way,

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:38.349
but he had been affectionate all night.

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:41.214
I thought, 'I shouldn't be so paranoid.

00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:43.998
What if I say something but he
didn't mean anything by it,

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:45.440
and I offend him?'

00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:49.293
When he should have made a turn,
he kept going straight.

00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:51.680
I thought he had made
a mistake, and I said,

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:53.485
'You should have turned there.'

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.288
But something felt off.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:58.721
Thinking back, I wonder,

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:01.774
'Why didn't I pay attention
to what I was feeling?'

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:06.592
When he pulled over near the highway,

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.481
that's when I got scared.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.409
But he told me to relax, that he liked me,

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:14.991
and that nothing would happen
unless I wanted it to.

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:16.545
He was nice.

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:18.460
I didn't say anything,

00:04:18.484 --> 00:04:20.556
because I was afraid he would get angry,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.363
and that things would get worse.

00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:25.745
I thought he might have a gun
in the glove compartment.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.111
Suddenly, he jumped on me
and tried to kiss me.

00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:35.100
I said no. I wanted to push him away,
but he was holding my arms down.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:39.248
When I wriggled free, I tried to open
the door, but it was locked.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.941
And even if I had gotten out,
where would I have gone?

00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:51.202
I told him he wasn't the kind of guy
who needed to do that to be with a girl,

00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:54.217
and that I liked him, too,
but not in that way.

00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.042
I tried to calm him down.

00:04:56.901 --> 00:04:59.293
I said nice things about him.

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:02.205
I talked to him as if
I were his older sister.

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:06.980
Suddenly, he covered
my mouth with one hand

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:09.715
and with the other hand
he unbuckled his belt.

00:05:11.043 --> 00:05:16.062
I thought right then he would kill me,
strangle me, you know?

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.517
I never felt so alone,

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:21.774
like I had been kidnapped.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.203
I asked him to finish quickly
and then take me home."

00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:30.654
How did you feel listening to this story?

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:36.596
Surely, several questions arose.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.457
For example: Why didn't she roll down
the window and call for help?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.650
Why didn't she get out of the car
when she felt something bad might happen?

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.802
How could she ask him to take her home?

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:59.447
Now, when we hear this kind
of story not on the news

00:05:59.471 --> 00:06:04.992
or from someone like me,
presenting it on a stage like this --

00:06:06.396 --> 00:06:09.219
when we're hearing it from someone we know

00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:16.356
who chose to entrust us
with the story of what happened to them,

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:19.577
we'll have to listen.

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:26.205
And we'll hear things
we won't be able to understand --

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.648
or accept.

00:06:28.957 --> 00:06:35.028
And then doubts, questions
and suspicion will creep in.

00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:41.013
And that is going to make us feel
really bad and guilty.

00:06:42.122 --> 00:06:46.877
So to protect ourselves
from the discomfort, we have an option.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.994
We turn up the volume
on all the parts of the story

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.445
that we expected to hear:

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:02.052
a gun in the glove compartment,
the locked doors, the isolated location.

00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:07.708
And we turn down the volume
on all the parts of the story

00:07:07.732 --> 00:07:09.870
that we didn't expect to hear

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:12.097
and that we don't want to hear;

00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:18.376
like when she tells him
that she liked him, too,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.502
or when she tells us she spoke to him
as if she were his older sister,

00:07:22.526 --> 00:07:25.079
or that she asked him to take her home.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:29.048
Why do we do this?

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.560
It's so we can believe her;

00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:37.436
so we can feel confident
that she really was a victim.

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:44.088
I call this "victimization of the victim."

00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:48.894
"Victimization," because in order
to believe she's innocent,

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:50.678
that she's a victim,

00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:57.598
we need to think of her
as helpless, paralyzed, mute.

00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:03.098
But there's another way
to avoid the discomfort.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.228
And it's exactly the opposite:

00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:12.087
we turn up the volume on the things
we didn't expect to hear,

00:08:12.111 --> 00:08:15.719
such as "I spoke nicely to him,"
"I asked him to take me home,"

00:08:15.743 --> 00:08:17.665
"I asked him to finish quickly,"

00:08:18.683 --> 00:08:22.984
and we turn down the volume
on the things we did expect to hear:

00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:25.185
the gun in the glove compartment,

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:26.662
the isolation.

00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:31.900
Why do we do this?

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:37.582
We do it so we can cling to the doubts

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:40.286
and feel more comfortable about them.

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:46.215
Then, new questions arise, for instance:

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:50.027
Who told her go to those clubs?

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:55.026
You saw how she and her friends
were dressed, right?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.461
Those miniskirts, those necklines?

00:08:58.164 --> 00:08:59.638
What do you expect?

00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:05.927
Questions that aren't really questions,
but rather, judgments --

00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:10.091
judgments that end in a verdict:

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:13.332
she asked for it.

00:09:15.164 --> 00:09:18.521
That finding would be verified by the fact

00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:24.451
that she didn't mention having
struggled to avoid being raped.

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:26.910
So that means she didn't resist.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.167
It means she consented.

00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:35.919
If she asked for it and allowed it,

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.558
how are we calling it rape?

00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:43.450
I call this "blaming the victim."

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:52.220
These arguments that serve us
both to blame and to victimize,

00:09:52.244 --> 00:09:57.016
we all have them in our heads, at hand --

00:09:57.777 --> 00:10:01.046
including victims and perpetrators.

00:10:01.853 --> 00:10:05.757
So much so, that when Ana came to me,

00:10:06.592 --> 00:10:09.803
she told me she didn't know

00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:12.640
if her testimony was going
to be of any use,

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:20.640
because she wasn't sure
if what happened to her qualified as rape.

00:10:22.294 --> 00:10:24.954
Ana believed, like most of us,

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:29.354
that rape is more like armed robbery --

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:33.462
a violent act that lasts 4 or 5 minutes --

00:10:34.254 --> 00:10:37.936
and not smooth talking from a nice guy

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.559
that lasts all night and ends
in a kidnapping.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.896
When she felt afraid she might be killed,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.443
she was afraid to be left with scars,

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:56.051
and she had to give her body to avoid it.

00:10:56.075 --> 00:10:58.908
That's when she knew that rape
was something different.

00:11:02.317 --> 00:11:05.829
Ana had never talked
about this with anyone.

00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:09.540
She could have turned to her family,

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:12.061
but she didn't.

00:11:12.811 --> 00:11:15.235
She didn't because she was afraid.

00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:22.048
She was afraid the person
she'd choose to tell her story to

00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:26.186
would have the same reaction
as the rest of us:

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.468
they'd have doubts, suspicions;

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.505
those same questions we always have
when it comes to things like this.

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:37.453
And if that had happened,

00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:41.076
it would have been worse, perhaps,
than the rape itself.

00:11:42.195 --> 00:11:46.014
She could have talked
to a friend or a sister.

00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:50.267
And with her partner, it would
have been extremely difficult:

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:55.505
the slightest hint of doubt
on his face or in his voice

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:58.203
would have been devastating for her

00:11:58.227 --> 00:12:01.074
and would have probably meant
the end of their relationship.

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:06.879
Ana keeps silent
because deep down she knows

00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:13.946
that nobody -- none of us,
not her family or therapists,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.031
let alone the police or judges --

00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:24.732
are willing to hear what Ana
actually did in that moment.

00:12:26.784 --> 00:12:30.232
First and foremost, Ana said, "No."

00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:34.603
When she saw that her "no" didn't help,

00:12:35.264 --> 00:12:36.683
she spoke nicely to him.

00:12:37.483 --> 00:12:40.706
She tried not to exacerbate his violence

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.519
or give him ideas.

00:12:44.028 --> 00:12:49.918
She talked to him as if everything
that was happening were normal,

00:12:49.942 --> 00:12:55.089
so he wouldn't be thinking
that she would turn him in later.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.952
Now, I wonder and I ask all of you:

00:13:05.857 --> 00:13:08.409
All those things she did --

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.301
isn't that considered resisting?

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.231
No.

00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:17.799
For all or at least most of us, it's not,

00:13:17.823 --> 00:13:21.055
probably because it's not "resisting"
in the eyes of the law.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.020
In most countries,

00:13:24.044 --> 00:13:30.368
the laws still require
that the victim prove her innocence --

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:34.780
that's right: the victim needs
to prove her innocence --

00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:37.680
by showing marks on her body

00:13:37.704 --> 00:13:42.674
as evidence that she engaged
in a vigorous and continuous fight

00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:44.187
with her aggressor.

00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:50.478
I can assure you, in most court cases,

00:13:50.502 --> 00:13:52.755
no amount of marks is ever enough.

00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:58.105
I listened to many women's stories.

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:06.382
And I didn't hear any of them
talking about themselves

00:14:06.406 --> 00:14:09.481
as if they had been reduced to a thing,

00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:12.835
totally subjected
to the will of the other.

00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:20.888
Rather, they sounded astonished
and even a little proud

00:14:20.912 --> 00:14:22.407
looking back

00:14:23.978 --> 00:14:27.110
and thinking how clear-headed
they had been at the time,

00:14:28.057 --> 00:14:31.223
of how much attention
they paid to every detail,

00:14:31.247 --> 00:14:36.473
as if that would allow them to exert
some control over what was happening.

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:40.818
Then I realized,

00:14:42.086 --> 00:14:43.245
of course --

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.212
what women are doing in these situations

00:14:47.805 --> 00:14:49.675
is negotiating.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.901
They're trading sex for life.

00:14:57.822 --> 00:15:01.718
They ask the aggressor to finish quickly,

00:15:02.506 --> 00:15:07.280
so everything is over as soon as possible
and at the lowest cost.

00:15:08.024 --> 00:15:12.648
They subject themselves to penetration,

00:15:13.708 --> 00:15:17.152
because believe it or not,

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:21.512
penetration is what keeps them furthest

00:15:21.536 --> 00:15:24.510
from a sexual or emotional scenario.

00:15:26.397 --> 00:15:29.449
They subject themselves to penetration,

00:15:29.473 --> 00:15:33.328
because penetration is less painful

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:38.512
than kisses, caresses and gentle words.

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:46.092
Now, if we continue to expect

00:15:47.051 --> 00:15:50.958
rape to be what it very rarely is --

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:55.551
with the rapist as a depraved
lower-class man

00:15:56.682 --> 00:16:00.610
and not a university student
or a businessman

00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:03.399
who goes out chasing after girls
on a Friday or Saturday;

00:16:04.607 --> 00:16:09.973
if we keep expecting
the victims to be demure women

00:16:09.997 --> 00:16:13.040
who faint on the scene,

00:16:13.064 --> 00:16:15.410
and not self-confident women --

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:20.905
we will continue to be unable to listen.

00:16:22.017 --> 00:16:25.899
Women will continue to be unable to speak.

00:16:26.963 --> 00:16:31.833
And we will all continue to be responsible

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:33.581
for that silence

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:35.762
and their solitude.

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:44.297
(Applause)
