00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
Down to brass tacks, friend.

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.040
Last week we covered several techniques
for improving your ability to focus on your
work and resist distractions.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.300
This week we’re digging into a related issue,
which is in fact the most pernicious problem that
perpetually plagues pupils… procrastination.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.240
Nick, I still think that intro needs more
alliteration. And cowbell.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:24.420
[Theme Music]

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.480
Before we dive into specific solutions, it’s
useful to know why we procrastinate.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.800
Now, we could go deep on the biological battle
between your prefrontal cortex and your limbic
system, or in a million other directions,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.580
but since our focus is on solving the
procrastination problem, one recent explanation
that I find to be particularly useful is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.420
Temporal Motivation Theory, which is
laid out by Dr. Piers Steele in his book
The Procrastination Equation.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.100
This theory suggests that a person’s motivation
to complete a task or assignment can be
represented by – you guessed it – an equation.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.660
And that equation is:

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.960
Motivation = (Expectancy * Value) / (Impulsiveness
* Delay)

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.540
Now, while I don’t really think all the
complexities of human behavior can be boiled
down into a neat little equation,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.840
I do think that this Procrastination Equation
is a useful mental model for pinpointing the
specific causes of our procrastination.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.220
So let’s go ahead and break it down.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.340
Expectancy is a term that represents how strongly
you believe that you’re able to complete a task, and it
has an inverse correlation with your procrastination.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.060
If you feel competent at what you’re doing,
your expectancy will be high and that will
increase your motivation to get to work.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.860
If the task looks really difficult, though,
expectancy will be low and you’ll be more
likely to procrastinate.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.980
The other place where you’ll find that inverse
correlation is between procrastination and Value,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.720
which includes the rewards you get for completing
the task, as well as how pleasant – or unpleasant –
the experience of actually doing it is.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.080
Impulsiveness is how susceptible you are to
distractions and, well, impulses to do other things,
and it’s directly correlated with procrastination.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.520
The less able you are to resist that sudden
desire to go check Twitter, the more you’re going
to put off working on that English paper.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.220
And if you’re thinking about going to check
Twitter right now, remember:

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.620
if you can resist that impulse, you’ll actually
be strengthening your brain’s ability to focus.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.700
So fight it, friend.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.420
Finally, there’s Delay, which is the amount
of time between now and when you’ll get
the reward for completing the task.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.680
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.640
The longer the delay is, the more you’ll
tend to procrastinate.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.320
This happens because human beings
naturally place far more value on the short-term
rather than long-term rewards –

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.780
even if those long-term rewards are
objectively greater.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.700
For most of human history, this was a helpful
bit of brain programming.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.120
If you were a hunter-gatherer living in 10,000
BCE, you had no reason to care about the antelopes
you were gonna hunt in 3 years –

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.520
all that mattered was the one in front of you right now.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.760
But today, when your success in life depends more
on studying for tests and remembering to put money
in an IRA than on your antelope-hunting skills,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.320
your brain’s hard-wired preference for
short-term rewards becomes a hinderance.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.020
It’s the main reason why you consistently find
yourself cramming for tests the night before;

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.930
rationally, you know you should start studying
a few weeks in advance, but most of your brain
is like, “Eh, is that really necessary?”

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.200
And to make matters worse, Delay is the hardest
factor in the equation to control, since the time at
which we’ll get a task’s reward is often set in stone.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.780
This is especially true when you’re in school,
since almost everything has a due date.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.940
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.740
It’s useful to simply be able to recognize that the delay between now and when you’ll reap a task’s reward matters a lot when it comes to your procrastination.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.640
And, really, that’s the value of the equation
as a whole; it’s a mental model that makes it
easy to pinpoint why you’re procrastinating.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.000
If it’s because you feel like you’re not
skilled enough to actually complete the task, then
you need to find a way to increase Expectancy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.040
Or, if you notice that your attention is constantly
being pulled in other directions, then it’s time to
figure out how to decrease your Impulsiveness.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.440
So now let’s go over some specific ideas for
manipulating those three most malleable factors.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.700
To raise Expectancy you can do several things.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.440
One of the most helpful is to break the task
down into smaller sub-tasks.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.400
Doing this allows you to narrow your focus
to something that’s not nearly as daunting,

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.650
and it also lets you more clearly define the
specific actions you have to take.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.460
So if you’re writing a paper, realize that
“write a paper” is a project that can – and
should – be broken down.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.280
You’ve got the research phase, the rough draft
phase – which you can break further down into
sections, like the intro, arguments, and conclusion –

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.040
and then you’ve got the editing phase.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.980
Once you’ve defined these actions and know
what order to tackle them in, you’ll have a much
clearer vision of what should be done right now.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.440
Plus, writing the rough draft of an intro
paragraph is much easier than trying to
write the entire paper all at once.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.800
Another great way to raise Expectancy is to
simply ask for help.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800
While being able to figure things out on
your own is definitely a useful skill,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.900
there comes a point when refusing to reach
out to someone else only slows you down.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.420
So go to your teacher’s office hours, or
find a friend to form a study group with.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.260
Now when it comes to improving a task’s
Value, there are a few things you can do:

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.080
1. Improve the actual reward for
completing the task

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.220
2. Improve the experience of doing the work itself

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.360
3. Add additional rewards, or mini-rewards
for completing sub-tasks

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.420
The best way to improve the first item on the
list is to choose work that’s more fulfilling to you.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.460
Now, you have some amount of control over
this when you’re selecting your classes,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.980
and as you move into your career and build
up more experience, that amount of control
will definitely increase.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.900
However, when you’re a student, there are
still a ton of required classes and things
that you just have to do.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.860
And once you’ve started, it’s pretty difficult to
improve the actual reward – it’s usually set in stone.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.560
If you finish a math assignment, you’ll get the
credit for it and you’ll improve your math skills.
Pretty simple.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.460
But you do have a lot of control over the
other two items.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.900
To make the experience of doing the work itself
more pleasant, you could choose a study location
that you enjoy being in –

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.040
like a coffee shop or your favorite spot in
the library.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.620
You can also find a good study music playlist,
work with a friend, or go for a quick walk beforehand
to raise your energy levels before you start.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.920
And additional rewards can further boost your
motivation.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.390
There are several ways to create these, including
gamification, which is the idea of taking elements
from games and applying them to your work.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.580
One of my favorite ways to do this is
with Habitica, an app that essentially turns
productivity into a role-playing game.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.740
Habitica takes all the elements that make
RPGs like Pokemon and Final Fantasy so addicting

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.690
– leveling up, experience points, gear – and
it applies them to real life.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.500
I use Habitica as a tool for sticking to my morning
routine and making sure I work out enough,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.740
but there’s also a to-do list function, which you
can use for individual assignments and tasks.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.400
Now, if you don’t want to do that, you can keep
things simpler by just setting up small rewards
for finishing sub-tasks –

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.580
like letting yourself watch a movie or go out with
friends after you finish taking notes on a couple of
sources for that research paper you’re working on.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.060
And it’s here that I want to talk about the
concept of low-density fun vs. high-density fun.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.500
See, a lot of students feel like they have too
much work to ever let themselves do anything
fun that takes a significant amount of time.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.900
Maybe you’ve had these kinds of thoughts
yourself, as well.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.400
You think, “Man, I’d really love to play
Horizon Zero Dawn right now, but I should
really use that time to study.”

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.400
The irony is that these same students who are
constantly denying themselves that high-density fun

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.760
are also spending a lot of time checking
Facebook, or picking new outfits for their
Bitmoji avatars, or browsing dank memes.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.080
These things represent low-density fun; they’re more
attractive than doing work, and it’s easy to convince
yourself that you’re only gonna do them for 5 minutes.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.520
But inevitably you do end up spending a ton
of time on them –

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.760
after all, these websites and apps are literally designed
from the ground up to be as addictive as possible –
and what’s worse, they’re not actually fun.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.340
They’re just distractions.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.000
And if you waste all your time on them, you
leave no time for actual, high-density fun that can
act as a true motivator for finishing your work.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.720
So the counterintuitive tip here is that you
NEED to let yourself have this high-density fun.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.660
Give yourself two hours tonight to play that
new video game.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.200
Or join that offroad dirtboarding club you’ve
had your eye on.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.840
When you allow yourself to do these things,
you create anticipation that can be used as
focusing energy for your work.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.800
And that brings us to Impulsiveness.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.540
Now, to be honest, last week’s video on Focus and Concentration provided most of the in-depth tips you’re gonna need to reducing your tendency to give into distractions.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.100
So today I’m just gonna reiterate that your
environment really matters.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.200
If you’re studying in a place where you
have access to distractions, your attention is
more likely to be pulled away by them.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.840
So find a dedicated study spot away from friends
and away from video games.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.440
Sometimes, you might even need to lock
that environment down a bit.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.960
In fact, when I was writing the script for this very
video, I used a program called Cold Turkey to literally
block most of the websites I usually visit.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.260
One thing that the Procrastination Equation
doesn’t cover is the role that willpower plays
in procrastination.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.660
Now, for a long time, it was believed that
willpower was a limited resource –

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.420
and that it drained throughout the day as
you made decisions that deviated from the
path of least resistance.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.580
This phenomenon was called ego depletion.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.780
During the past couple of years, though,
the ego depletion theory been challenged by
some conflicting research,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:56.100
so it’s tough to say whether or not willpower
itself really is this limited pool that you draw
from throughout the day.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.490
Ego depletion controversy aside, though,
your body – and, by extension, your brain –
runs on a cycle of work and rest.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.200
There’s only so much you can do in a day
before you exhaust your mental resources.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.980
Plus, when you put off a challenging assignment
in favor of doing a bunch of easy work first,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.600
it becomes really easy to convince yourself
that you’ve “done enough” for the day once
that easy work is done.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.080
That’s why one of the best ways to beat
procrastination is to just knuckle down and do the
most difficult, unpleasant thing on your to-do list first.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.540
This is often called “eating the frog”
– and as Mark Twain once said:

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.000
"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best
to do it first thing in the morning.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.300
And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's
best to eat the biggest one first."

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.840
Now, I’d prefer not to eat any frogs whatsoever.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.920
I’d much rather eat a tomato, which in
Italian would be called a “pomodoro” –

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.500
and that happens to be the name of the final
technique we’re going to discuss today.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.420
The Pomodoro Technique is a simple little hack
you can use to stop procrastinating, and all it
requires is a timer and a little piece of paper.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.640
To use it, first decide on one singular task
you’re going to work on.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.640
Then, set your timer for 25 minutes, and work
as hard as you can on that task during that time.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.220
If a distraction comes up, or if you get the
impulse to do something else, write it down on
the piece of paper and then get back to work.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.080
Finally, once the timer goes off, take a 5
minute break and then repeat the process
until you’re ready for a longer break.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.880
This method works so well because the timer
helps you to reframe your task as input-based
rather than output-based.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.720
Instead of feeling like you need to finish an entire
math assignment or that rough draft of your paper,
you know you just need to work for 25 minutes.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.700
This act of reframing cuts down on the initial
resistance you feel towards the task, since 25 minutes
of work doesn't feel like a huge investment of effort.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.560
Additionally, the timer creates an external
motivator.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.980
Instead of relying on your brain to keep
track of how long you should work, you let the
timer do it for you.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.100
It’s the next best thing to having a coach
or drill instructor there to keep you on task

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.020
– and for that reason, you need to make
sure you actually use a timer –

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.320
or at least a timer app, like tomato
timer.com, or Tide on iOS and Android.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.740
Now there are definitely more techniques for
beating procrastination that we could talk about,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.440
but there comes a point where talking about
productivity becomes a form of procrastination itself.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.880
So now it’s time to take what you’ve learned from
this video, apply it, and get to work. Good luck.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.190
