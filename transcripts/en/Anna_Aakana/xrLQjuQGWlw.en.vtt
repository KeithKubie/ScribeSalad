00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:02.852
So today I want to talk about
Social anxiety.

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:04.294
And is it just me,

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:06.438
or when you know you're gonna meet
someone for the first time,

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:09.338
are you like, freaking out about how
you're gonna greet them?

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:11.128
Do I just wave, or is that considered rude?

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:13.153
Maybe I should shake her hand, no
that's too formal..

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:14.821
Should I hug her? That's weird.

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.791
She's weirded out by you. You lost.

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:20.276
And even before that interaction
happens, if I know that I'm going

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:23.900
to meet someone, I create mock
conversations in my head

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.189
to be prepared.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.821
It's sorta like doing imaginary improv with
yourself to prepare for the "big show"

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.943
even though the "big show" is really just
meeting someone face to face

00:00:32.943 --> 00:00:34.698
rather than face to screen.

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:37.182
And I'm so weird around strangers.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:39.713
I become overcompensatingly polite,

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:42.683
like, DISGUSTINGLY polite.

00:00:42.683 --> 00:00:44.274
But this comes with a negative aspect

00:00:44.274 --> 00:00:46.198
because if I'm polite to someone

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:47.939
and they don't reciprocate,

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:49.351
then I get really upset.

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:50.290
Hey!

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.153
Asshole!

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.938
I held open this fucking door for you
and you don't even want to say "thanks"?

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:56.229
Who do you think YOU are?

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.139
Next time, you could just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.259
hold open this fucking door
by yourself, okay?!

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.019
Have a nice life!

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:01.820
Bitch.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.884
I'm exaggerating, it really goes like..

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:05.643
Oh, let me get that.

00:01:09.228 --> 00:01:10.030
Bitch.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.205
Lately, social interation..

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.958
or, even just the idea of
social interaction

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.852
has given me the same anxiety

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:19.198
that I used to feel right before

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:21.388
I went on stage.

00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:23.698
And that is ridiculous, alright?

00:01:23.698 --> 00:01:25.592
Those are not the same thing.

00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:27.973
And look, I mean this video
is very lighthearted, obviously

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:28.943
it's for comedy.

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.938
There's a lot of generalizations
and ridiculous jokes in it.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:36.111
Um, but anxiety is something that
I need to laugh at, and I need

00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:38.111
to make jokes about, in order to

00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:41.705
convince myself that I have a really
solid grip on it.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.355
If you are suffering from anxiety,

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.126
uh, what I found works best for me,

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:47.142
is try to change my perspective on it.

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:49.141
So you have to convince yourself

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.760
that it is not frightening, no,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
it is an exciting adventure~

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.172
And yeah, it may sound gay,

00:01:57.172 --> 00:02:00.488
but..I really don't care at this point

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:01.989
because..

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.641
I don't know about you,

00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:04.958
but..

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.165
I don't to be a pussy for the rest of my life.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:08.772
Just saying.
