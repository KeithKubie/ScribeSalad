00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.120
We are in the home stretch.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.150
Problem number 17 on page 463.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.390
Oh, I like these with these
strange operations.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.190
Let the operation up arrow be
defined as a up arrow b is

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:26.780
equal to a plus b over a minus
b, for all numbers in a and b,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.230
where a does not equal b.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.190
And why do they to
have to say that?

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.250
Well, because otherwise, our
denominator would be 0.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:45.180
So we know that 1 up 2 is equal
to 2 up x, what is x?

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.920
So let's set up the equation.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.640
So what is 1 up arrow 2?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.140
So that's 1 plus 2
over 1 minus 2.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.960
So it's 1 plus 2
over 1 minus 2.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.230
I just used this formula,
1 is a, 2 is be, right?

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.750
What's 2 up arrow x?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.560
That's 2 plus x over
2 minus x.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.900
So 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.340
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.530
So it's negative 1 is equal to
2 plus x over 2 minus x, and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.020
of course this is just
equal to negative 3.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.540
And now we can multiply both
sides of this equation by 2

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.560
minus x, because we know that x
can't be equal to 2, because

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.330
it says a can't be equal to b.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.820
So we know we're not multiplying
both sides of this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.590
equation by 0.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.180
2 minus x.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.730
That's all I'm doing, I'm
just multiplying both

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.440
sides by 2 minus x.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.700
On the left-hand side, I
get negative 3 minus 3,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.130
times 2 minus x.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.870
And on the right-hand side, the
2 minus x's cancel out,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.560
and I get 2 plus x.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.390
And then I distribute the 3.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.009
Minus 6 plus 3x is equal
to 2 plus x.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.310
And let's see, where
do I want my x's?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.150
Let's add 6 to both sides.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.360
3x is equal to 8 plus x.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.070
Subtract x from both sides.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.950
2x is equal to 8.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.540
x is equal to 4.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.590
Choice A.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.050
OK, problem number 18.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.530
I'm going to switch colors, too,
because this color is not

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.710
appealing to me.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.830
Let's see, green.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.880
18, looks like this involves
money, so green is good.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.050
During a sale, a customer can
buy one shirt for x dollars.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.330
So 1 for x.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.120
Each additional shirt
costs z dollars less

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480
than the first shirt.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.650
soon.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:11.130
So additional z less than first.
For example, the cost

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.990
of the second shirt
is x minus z.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.570
All right, fair enough.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.030
Which of the following
represents the customer's cost

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.910
in dollars for n shirts bought
during the sale?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.280
So the first shirt is
going to cost x.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.475
The first shirt's
going to cost x.

00:03:33.475 --> 00:03:35.860
And then how many
shirts are left?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.390
Well, there's n minus 1 shirts,
that aren't the first

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.880
shirt, right?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.360
They buy 1 shirt at x and then
they're going to buy n minus 1

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.230
at the other price.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.710
And then the other price
is x minus z.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.990
Because it's not like the third
shirt costs z less than

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.925
the second, and then the fourth
shirt costs z less

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:02.110
than-- they all cost z less
than the first, right?

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.910
So every other shirt
costs x minus z.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.960
So we have n minus
1 other shirts.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.210
The first one costs x, then we
have n minus 1 shirts that

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.140
cost x minus z dollars.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.410
And did they draw it
right like that?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.320
Yes, that is choice A.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.220
I thought maybe they might have
multiplied it out and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.300
we'd have to look for something
similar, but they

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.160
give it just the way it is.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.070
All right, next problem.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:43.060
Problem number 19.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.510
I don't need to draw
it neatly.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.110
I can draw this thing
freehand.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.070
OK, so this is P, 30
degrees, Q, and R.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.960
In the figure above, QR is the
arc of a circle with center P.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:12.870
If the length of QR is 6 pi,
what is the area of sector P?

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.440
So this length is 6 pi,
so they want to know

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.220
what this area is.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.870
Well, the important realization
is is that this is

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.440
part of a larger circle.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.940
So if I were to draw the entire
circle like that, and

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.290
then I would draw-- let me do
it in a different color.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:43.750
This is part of a larger circle,
where this is P, Q, R,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.100
and 30 degrees.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.830
And this 30 degrees is important
because it tells us

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.180
what fraction of the larger
circle this is.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.440
Well, how many degrees are there
in a total circle? you

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.570
Well there are 360, right?

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.330
If we were to go all the way
around, there's 360.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.990
So the fraction that this is
of the full circle is 30

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.400
degrees over 360.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.550
And this is 1/12.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.540
I haven't drawn it to scale.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.760
The way I drew it, it looks more
like 60 degrees, but you

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.970
should be able draw 12 pies
of 30 degrees here.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.110
I hope I'm not confusing you,
because there are 360 degrees

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.170
in the circle.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.520
So if this slice is 1/12 of the
whole circle, then this

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.980
arc length, this 6 pi right
here, is going to be 1/12 of

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.540
the entire circumference.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.830
So what's the circumference?

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.340
The circumference is going
to be 12 times this.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.160
So the circumference
is 12 times 6 pi,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.950
which equals 72 pi.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:56.520
If the circumference is 72
pi, what is the radius?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.770
What's the formula?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.200
Circumference is equal
to 2 pi r.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.290
So we could say that also
is equal to 72 pi.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.810
So you could divide both sides
by pi, and then divide both

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.450
sides by 2.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.490
And you have the radius
is equal to 36.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.170
So this radius right here-- let
me do it in a different

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.260
color-- this radius
is equal to 36.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.220
All I did is I figured out this
arc length is 1/12 of the

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.940
entire circumference.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.610
And so the entire circumference
is 72 pi.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.260
And then I used that to
figure out that the

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.000
radius must be 36.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.390
Now we want to know the area
of just this piece.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.310
So we could just figure out the
area of the whole thing

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.980
and then divide by 12, because
this is 1/12 the area of the

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.260
circle as well.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.720
So what's the area?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.580
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:00.050
That equals pi times 36
squared-- I'm going to write

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.220
36 times 36.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.320
I don't want multiply
big numbers.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.230
And then that's the area of the
whole thing, is pi times

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.190
36, times 36.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.820
So the area of just this
fraction will be the area of

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.880
the whole thing divided by 12.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.760
And the reason why I didn't
multiply it out is because I

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.580
can actually cancel.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.600
I can say, well, this
is 3, this is 1.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.330
So it's pi times 3, times 36.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.570
And what's 3 times 36?

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.940
90 plus 18 is 108, so
it equals 108 pi,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.539
which is choice A.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.850
Let's see if I can squeeze
in the last problem.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.799
Probably not.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.890
Actually, I will save the last
problem for a video of its

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.640
own, because I only have
a minute left.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.890
