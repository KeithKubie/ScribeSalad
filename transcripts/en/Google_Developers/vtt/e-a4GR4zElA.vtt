NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I'm Natalie Villalobos,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.860
and I have the extreme honor
of leading the Women Techmakers

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.497
program here at Google.

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:12.830
I love that she shared that
story about Megan, because I

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.860
remember when Megan had
said, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.890
That job you interviewed
for-- you came in second.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.490
And I'm like, that's
not the same as first.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.680
But when her and I were creating
this opportunity of Women

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.750
Techmakers, she was
such an incredible woman

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.080
in saying yes to me.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.230
And when you're
taking on a big idea--

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.960
when you're taking
on a project--

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.914
you really need people to get
behind you to make it happen.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:41.580
And Megan was one of
those people for me

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.290
and I'm forever supportive
and grateful for her guidance.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.900
And a lot of times, I feel like
Women Techmakers is actually

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.300
my startup within Google.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.230
It's about creating an
opportunity for other people

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.350
to thrive with something--
even though it's not a product,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.540
it's really an organization
and an opportunity

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.260
for people around the world.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.910
We have an incredible team.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.990
I still have to go
raise money and have

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870
a budget like everybody
else and have metrics

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.380
like everybody else,
and so I'm going

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.945
to hold that as my startup.

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.320
It's not like any
of the startups

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.750
that these women have created.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.737
They have different obstacles.

00:01:20.737 --> 00:01:22.820
And so we want to explore
some of those obstacles,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.880
but also some of those meaty
nuggets of knowledge in case

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.730
you want to start your own
initiative or something

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.390
within your company, or maybe
even start your own company.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.760
I have a handy dandy-- let's
see if they're in here.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.710
It's like a magic show.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.790
All right.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.979
A couple questions.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.020
I haven't introduced any
of y'all because I think

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.670
it's actually more powerful
when women introduce themselves.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120
Will you tell me your
name and your company

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.750
and what you're solving for?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.750
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Sure.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.640
Well, my name is
Susan Gregg Koger.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.814
I am the chief creative officer
and co-founder of ModCloth.

00:01:57.814 --> 00:02:01.400
We inspire personal
style and help

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.580
our customers feel like the
best versions of themselves.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.950
And we do that by
designing clothing,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.840
like the dress that
I'm wearing today,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.470
working with
independent designers

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.200
to carry their products,
like the beautiful jumpsuit--

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.574
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I also
happen to be wearing ModCloth.

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.490
SUSAN GREGG KOGER:
Thank you for that.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.900
I appreciate that.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.972
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: No problem.

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:22.720
She did not pay me
for that, by the way.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.530
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: I offered to.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.400
But you're supporting my
business, which I love.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.440
And yeah, that's about--
and I actually-- I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.780
started ModCloth when I was 17.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.910
So ModCloth is
basically my career.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.490
So I have a unique perspective.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.764
I've been doing it for
14 years this summer.

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.930
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.620
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.970
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.620
Melissa?

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.980
MELISSA WONG: Great.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.480
Hi.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.690
I'm Melissa, the CEO and
co-founder of Retail Zipline.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.680
And different than Susan--
my background, actually,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.960
was 10 years working
at Gap, Inc.,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.310
always focused on solving the
store execution problem, which

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.170
is how do you get stores to do
the work that headquarters is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.800
asking them to do when you
have thousands of locations

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100
and tens of thousands
of employees?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.140
And so I started
a Retail Zipline

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.720
to help retailers also achieve
the best version of themselves,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.180
but in their store environments
and with their store teams.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.900
I've been doing this
for about a year.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.120
And it was a very big jump
going from enterprise,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.530
like a large Fortune
500 retailer,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.380
into a very small startup.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.630
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Beautiful.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.207
And Bri?

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:31.040
BRI JAMES: Hey, all.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.460
My name is Bri James, and
I'm the CEO and co-founder

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.470
of Scrumpt.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.110
We're a lunch kit
subscription service for kids.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.650
And my pediatrician
mom is my co-founder,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.380
which is fun and awesome.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.720
And we're on a mission
to make lunches for kids

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.740
awesome and super easy.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.824
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Great.

00:03:47.824 --> 00:03:50.031
That opportunity that I was
talking to you about when

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.610
Melody all of a
sudden appears-- now

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.126
is going to be the time when
we greet her to the stage.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:56.038
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.200
Welcome.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.870
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Hi, thanks.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.730
Oh, sorry.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.520
Excuse me.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.186
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's OK.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:07.430
We're going to edit that out.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.620
I actually was scared I was
going to slip out on my heels,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.420
so you did it for me.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.586
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Excuse me.

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:13.319
I mean shoot, goodness.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.860
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Stuff and things.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.837
Fun fact before Melody
introduces herself

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:19.670
and her company and
what you're solving for,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.450
I have actually known
Melody for many years.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.158
We actually went to
high school together.

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:25.179
So it's a privilege
for me to be able to--

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:26.720
as with a lot of
the work that I do--

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.400
shine a spotlight
on incredible women,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.864
even if I happen to have
known them for half my life.

00:04:30.864 --> 00:04:32.530
Melody, will you tell
us about StyleSeat

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.480
and what you're solving for?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.688
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Absolutely.

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:38.150
In addition to being late,
my name is Melody McCloskey.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.610
My company is StyleSeat, which
is like Open Table for hair

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.100
salons and spas.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.140
In addition to the fact that
we help women look and feel

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.930
good and try to make it
as easy easy as possible,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.100
we're also an amazing platform
for female entrepreneurs.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.230
75% of the business owners that
run their business on StyleSeat

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.500
and double their revenue
in the first yeay-- they're

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500
female business owners.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.010
So we help women
in the beauty space

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.110
run their businesses
more effectively,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.604
better support their families,
and be more successful.

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:11.770
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.030
And we'll get into a
little bit of creating

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.077
a mission-driven company.

00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:18.160
Let's actually go to that.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.570
Why did you start StyleSeat?

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.220
What was the opportunity
that you saw?

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.720
Because really, the theme of
this panel is building an idea.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.700
So what was the idea
that you had and you're

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.322
like-- got the crazy feeling
of, this needs to be a company.

00:05:29.322 --> 00:05:30.280
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Yeah.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.571
I'll tell you, I didn't know
that much about the beauty

00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:34.260
industry before I started.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.520
I had been in tech.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.170
I had worked in
product for a while.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.850
But I looked around the room,
or the scene of Silicon Valley

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.610
back in 2010, 2011,
and I personally

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.310
didn't know a single
female founder.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.680
I knew tons of guys-- dozens--
I mean hundreds of guys--

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.900
that had started companies.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.191
And I know that there were
female founders at the time.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:58.920
I just didn't know
any personally.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.517
And so I knew that I
wanted to start a company

00:06:01.517 --> 00:06:03.600
and I was surrounded by
really supportive friends.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.530
But I thought, OK,
let me start a company

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.660
in a female-driven sector
because I think I'll

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.250
have a competitive advantage.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.660
And beauty is a
massive industry.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.720
So that's how I started into it.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.300
And I think what's been so
surprising is, after we started

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.080
to get big and we
built a product

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.770
that there was a lot of
need for and our customers

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.780
started to freak out and
love it, it went from,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.200
I'm starting this because it's
a big financial opportunity,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.640
I want to build a big business.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.990
And turned into me
having conversations

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.370
with these women
who are saying, I've

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.514
been in the beauty
industry for 10 years,

00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:41.180
but I've always had
to have a second job

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.060
because I'm too scared
to really make the leap.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.560
I have to be a
paralegal's assistant

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.640
or I have to work second
hours at this other company

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.460
because I'm too scared to
have my family be fully

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.700
dependent on this
because my business isn't

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.720
as effective as it could be.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.510
And now, with StyleSeat,
it is and I've

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.718
been doing this full time
and I'm making more revenue

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:00.830
than I ever have.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.200
And all of a sudden, it was
like, wow, this surprised me.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.860
And now it's this
really meaningful thing

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.120
for our customers.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.350
And now that is definitely
the core driver of who we are.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.080
And it's so much
more interesting

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.172
and profound than the
money opportunity.

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:21.380
And that's what drives
everyone at the company today.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.780
They don't care as much about
the revenue opportunity.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.460
It's really about
helping people.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Bri, how about you?

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.720
BRI JAMES: I was a
lawyer once upon a time

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.880
and had a buddy who was starting
a company who gave me a job.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.780
And it was awesome.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.450
It got acquired and
I had another buddy

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.010
who started another company
and the opposite happened.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.800
It folded like that.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.990
But I had seen both ends
of the startup spectrum

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.070
and knew I wanted
to start something.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.120
What that was was still
a big question mark.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.340
But my mom was retiring.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.890
We had always talked about
starting something together.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.450
And she says, if you want me
on board, it has to be healthy

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.700
and it has to be for kids.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.595
And I was like OK, noted.

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:00.970
And I knew I wanted to do
something in the product space.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.910
I don't have a tech background,
so building something quickly

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.760
that we can move to the
market was important.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.250
So we just boiled all
of our passions together

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.550
and then that's how
Scrumpt came to be.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.800
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Beautiful.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.590
Melissa?

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.423
MELISSA WONG: Great.

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:17.850
I actually never thought that
I would be an entrepreneur.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.420
I didn't think I
was in my blood.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.790
I never dreamed of it
when I was a child.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.680
Even probably three years ago,
I never really thought about it.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.570
But the way that
Retail Zipline came

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.590
is I kept on facing the
same problem within the Gap

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.760
about store execution.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.570
Started talking to a lot of
other people in the industry.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.330
Everyone had the same problem.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.690
So why we exist is really
to solve the problem

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.487
that retailers face
across the board.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.890
SUSAN GREGG KOGER:
I started ModCloth

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.480
in the summer between
high school and college.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.990
And it really was a fun project.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.190
I grew up in South
Florida and actually, I

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.300
started-- my co-founder
is my husband today, who

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.129
was my boyfriend at the time.

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:02.920
I married the guy that
I went to prom with,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.279
which is a whole other story.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.320
You can find me later and
we can talk about that.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.195
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's a different panel.

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:10.320
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah,
that's a different panel.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.819
Yeah.

00:09:10.819 --> 00:09:14.640
He's wonderful and
amazing-- Eric.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.830
Yeah.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:21.460
He had two friends in high
school that got together

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.550
and they started a web hosting,
web development business.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.270
Basically, going to small
businesses in South Florida

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.860
and telling them,
hey, it's 2001.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.260
Let's get on the internet.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.770
I'll help you build a website.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.580
So he had built a
few e-commerce sites

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.490
and had designed a
few different sites.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.810
And I just always loved fashion.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.720
I always had an eye for it.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.340
I remember being
very young and having

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.870
a very strong opinion of this
pair of shoes versus that one.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.610
I was always just-- I remembered
every single piece of clothing

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.410
I ever saw.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.020
It took me years and years to
realize that that was actually

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.980
a skill and wasn't
just something

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.150
that everyone could do.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.430
I'd be like, you don't
remember that thing

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.395
that you wore yesterday
and when you bought it

00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:09.860
and how much it was and what
other colors it came in?

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.000
Turns out, that's really
good stuff that's not normal.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.160
It took me a while
to figure that out.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.300
So yeah, long story
short, I had to shop

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.430
for a whole new wardrobe because
I got into Carnegie Mellon

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.680
University in Pittsburgh.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.921
Those of you who grew
up in warm climates

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.295
and then had to move to a cold
climate for the first time

00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:36.072
like I did-- you have to
buy coats and scarves.

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:37.530
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Thicker things.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:38.530
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.165
And I went to thrift
stores because I

00:10:41.165 --> 00:10:42.290
didn't have a lot of money.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.245
I found amazing vintage.

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:46.979
And Eric actually the one
that suggested, why don't you

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.270
try to sell some of this stuff?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.110
And eBay wasn't so
exciting for me,

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.360
but the idea of building a
website seemed kind of cool.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.070
So I taught myself
Photoshop and I

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.700
think I used Microsoft
FrontPage to design

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.480
the first version of the site.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.980
We just hacked it onto an
open source shopping cart

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.870
and it was nuts.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.190
But it was really fun.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.080
And as I kept-- as I
was an undergraduate,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.960
I was a business and
German double major.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.810
Honestly because I didn't
even know that you could

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.310
work in the fashion industry.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.430
I just thought you
can be a designer

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.900
or you can-- I don't
know, work at a store.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.526
And I was like, I
don't know that I

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:26.900
want to do either
of those things

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.760
and I'm not sure that
I can really draw.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.730
So I had no idea
that what I was doing

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.230
was going to be able
to turn into something

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.520
that I could actually grow.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:43.150
But I was at school between 2002
and 2006 and Facebook launched.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.080
The world was changing
and my business

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.290
started to really gain traction.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.000
And honestly, for
me, it's always

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.480
been-- my job's gone from
doing everything to now,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.490
today, I get to-- I've been
able to create my dream job.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.930
And when I say that, I mean
29 days out of the month,

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.270
it's like, this is my dream job.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.170
And then I have the one day
where I'm like, oh, my god,

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.150
who put me in charge?

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.270
This is insane and I just
want to get back into bed

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.900
and pull the covers up.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.210
But I think everyone goes
through that, no matter

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.950
where they are and
whether they're

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.090
running a tiny startup
in a big company

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:23.155
or running their own thing, or
just trying to proceed in life.

00:12:23.155 --> 00:12:25.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: We
all have our bad days.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.580
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:25.940
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.860
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.590
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
But at least, I think,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.083
in wearing ModCloth, I would
look good having a bad day.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:30.910
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: That's true.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.700
I would hope so.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:31.990
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.990
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.448
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Bri, you
had mentioned that your mom is

00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:36.170
your co-founder.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.440
BRI JAMES: Yeah.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:36.860
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Will you talk to us

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.430
a little bit about what
life is like having

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.620
your mom as your co-founder?

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.430
BRI JAMES: Sure.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.980
It's difficult
because you always

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.490
have a mother-daughter dynamic.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.440
Sometimes she's just
going to say no,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.940
and eventually,
you're going to win.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.356
But you just have
to let her think

00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:52.900
that she's winning for a while.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.400
But no, in all
honesty, it's great.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.485
And I think people are
very taken aback by that--

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.560
that we've done this now
for two years together

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.440
and it hasn't come to blows.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.300
But no one wants to see you
succeed more than your parents.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.940
And there's no one who
you want to make prouder

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.990
than your parents.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.200
So I think there's definitely
a very powerful energy there.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.394
And if you have that
relationship with your mother

00:13:18.394 --> 00:13:20.060
or your father or
someone in your family

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.010
and you can make it
work, then I think

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.730
it's a really powerful
and beautiful thing.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.230
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
A few of you had

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.836
touched on-- you mentioned that
you were a lawyer before, you

00:13:29.836 --> 00:13:31.460
said you were kind
of naturally attuned

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.620
to the world of curating--
you had a curatorial eye.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.630
When you jumped into taking an
idea and building a company,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.760
did you have to have a
bunch of things in place

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.740
before you made the leap?

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.240
Or did you make the leap and
then everything came to you?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.130
How did that work?

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.742
MELISSA WONG: I
guess-- are you--

00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:57.476
I'll actually-- I'll address
that because I think,

00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:58.850
a lot of times,
one of the things

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.570
that had frustrated me
earlier when I was at Gap

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.760
is everyone talks about
doing something different.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.100
And waking up in the middle of
the night and kind of pivoting

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.260
and knowing what
you're supposed to do.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.270
And I think, for me, it was
such a gradual process of,

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.020
I have an idea.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.120
I think I can do it.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.500
No, I don't think I can do it.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.090
And then I'll find out more
information and I'm like,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.990
yes, I can do it.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.050
And then it's like,
no, I can't do it.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.674
And I find out more information,
and I'm like, actually, I can.

00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:25.660
So it's just a very
gradual, incremental process

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.530
of learning what I
needed as I went.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.790
Just taking one step at a time.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.470
Finding the confidence
to take the next step.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.220
And then, eventually,
you get to the point

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.830
where you're like, I've
done all of the things

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.820
that I never thought were
possible when I look back.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.850
And I think this
is the time for me

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.290
to actually take
the biggest step

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.664
and to take the biggest risk.

00:14:45.664 --> 00:14:47.080
But I've done a
lot of my homework

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.210
and I've found like
my footing and now I

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.384
can actually move forward.

00:14:50.384 --> 00:14:51.425
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.210
Any--

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.876
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: I
feel really similar.

00:14:53.876 --> 00:14:56.722
I think the biggest
struggle and battles

00:14:56.722 --> 00:14:58.596
you have, especially in
the first year or two

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:00.450
of the business--
and maybe the year

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.940
leading up to the
business-- is just

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.365
having the confidence to do it.

00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:06.990
I thought about
StyleSeat for two years

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.470
before I started the company.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.230
And there was always--
I just never believed

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.030
that I could do it.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.363
It was like, everyone I know
is so much smarter than me.

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:17.320
All these guys are engineers
and I'm not, so I can't do it.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.510
Or they're more
analytical than me,

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.000
and it's just not my skill set.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.570
I should just pack
up and go home.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.069
And then, finally,
I woke up one day

00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:29.860
and I was like, if someone else
starts this company that's not

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.424
me, I'm going to lose my shit.

00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:35.904
I'm going to freak out and I'm
going to regret that really,

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:36.820
really, really deeply.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.340
That will be the biggest
regret of my life.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.370
Trying it and falling
on my face and failing

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.930
in front of everyone
is less-- that's

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.160
not as bad as not doing it
and having someone else do it.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.880
And now, I feel like through
the state of the business,

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.790
it continues to
be that way, where

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.360
OK, now we have to
raise a Series A.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.610
I don't know if I can do this.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.700
This seems impossible.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.650
And then you do it.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.280
Or we have to go recruit
a really big executive

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.825
or we have to go sign a massive
deal with a big company.

00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:06.200
And then a bunch
of those happen,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.410
and then you get to this
point where you're like,

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.860
anything that gets thrown
at me-- I know that I

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.080
can try my best to get it done.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.060
And I'm not fearful
of it anymore.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.754
And that's been the
biggest transformation,

00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:20.420
I think, for me.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.711
That's been like the biggest
gift of running a company.

00:16:22.711 --> 00:16:26.050
I know now-- no
matter what happens,

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.680
it can't get as dark as
it did in the beginning

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.525
stages of starting the company.

00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:31.650
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Totally.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.750
And something you
said-- I think you

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.310
said you were scared of
going out there and falling

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.090
flat on your face.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.360
And one of the biggest
learnings for me has been--

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.790
even when you're--
this is cliche,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.260
but there are no
overnight success stories.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.400
You will fall flat on your
face, even as you succeed.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.980
Part of succeeding is failing.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.790
And we talk about this in
building technology quickly.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.710
This is a general
life lesson that

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.480
is easy to understand
intellectually,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.250
I've found, but is hard to
internalize and actually

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.020
put into practice.

00:17:06.038 --> 00:17:06.579
I don't know.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.440
I think five years
ago in my career,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.089
I would look at those dudes who
have very successful companies.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.230
Let's just say-- am I allowed
to say Zuckerberg here?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.730
OK.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.410
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's
not a bad word here.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.201
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: He's
the same age as me.

00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:23.520
He was the same year at school.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.915
So I'm like, oh,
man, I'm not him.

00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:28.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: You're not
a billionaire by 23 or whatever.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.360
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: But
I'm doing pretty good.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.310
So you do always look
around and you're like,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.540
oh, man, I'm not doing
it right because I'm not

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.280
this successful.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.610
But then, as it starts to happen
to you, you're like, oh, right,

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.440
it is running and falling
and running and falling.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.697
And sometimes you
just say, OK, I'm

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:47.280
not going to be on
this track anymore.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.446
I'm going do something else.

00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:53.820
And that is life, in business--
professionally, personally,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.320
all of that.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.819
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: And there's
been a lot of times in my life

00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:59.550
where maybe a company
came out after us.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.260
And they had this big press
story or this big, seemingly

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.740
public success.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.910
And I would beat
myself up and say,

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.859
they raised their round faster,
they got to traction faster.

00:18:09.859 --> 00:18:12.150
What could I have-- and I'd
really just beat myself up.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.730
And then that company wouldn't
be around a year later.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.130
And that happened
a bunch of times.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.940
And I guess the point is
you can't compare yourself

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.484
to others because you have
no idea what's happening

00:18:22.484 --> 00:18:23.400
underneath the scenes.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.300
You can just concentrate on
yourself and run forward.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.841
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
One of the things

00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:31.730
that came up when we were having
our prep panel conversation is,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.680
I was sharing a life lesson
that I try to live by,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.440
but is also difficult,
which is I am not my work.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.640
My work is something I do.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.410
And that's really hard
when you have this passion

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.749
and you need to be birth
this company into the world.

00:18:47.749 --> 00:18:50.290
Are you able to-- and it sounds
like it might be a little bit

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:55.610
difficult-- to detach your
self-worth from your company?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.690
So that if it's having
a hard day, you can say,

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.810
hard day, we're
putting that over here.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:03.510
I'm actually going
to go to Pilates

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.470
and I'm going to rock
the crap out of Pilates.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.881
I'm going to be good.

00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:08.130
And you take care of yourself.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.020
How do you-- can
you do that when

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.380
you're running a company
where all bets are off

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.920
and you are having to
meet investor need?

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:20.040
MELISSA WONG: I was actually
thinking about that a lot

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.410
because it's like, you're
so passionate about what

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:21.951
you're doing.

00:19:21.951 --> 00:19:23.800
How do you not get
so consumed by it

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.350
and then just get
dragged down when

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.060
the going gets really tough?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.470
And I think it's really
important to maintain

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.140
those other sides of yourself.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.340
Yes, I'm a founder.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.080
Yes, I'm an innovator,
I'm a creator.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.370
But then, I'm also a traveler.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.500
I'm also a cook.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.170
I'm a reader.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.690
I think it's the balance.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.510
You can't ever detach
yourself from the company

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.260
that you've created
and what you've built,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.490
but you can balance it
out by identifying deeply

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.520
with those other
sides of yourself

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.740
so you don't just get so
consumed by one thing.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.410
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: I
was incapable of it.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.860
I think it took me like
four, four and a half years

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:06.100
to finally have an identity for
myself outside of the business.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.600
Even taking time to
work out, for example.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.700
Now, I wake up at 5:45, I
go to the gym immediately,

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.320
I work out pretty intensely.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.410
And I don't do that-- it
took me a while to say,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.500
I'm going to sleep early.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.875
I'm not going to--
I'm only going

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:24.929
to do two work dinners
a week because I need

00:20:24.929 --> 00:20:26.470
to go to sleep early
so I can wake up

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.590
and I can do this
and be a sane person.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.742
But I'm a better founder
because I do those things.

00:20:34.742 --> 00:20:36.950
And I want my team to do
those things for themselves.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.746
So I'm setting a bad example
if I don't take care of myself.

00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:41.620
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: One
of my favorite things

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.840
that you do to take
care of yourself is--

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.350
This is something that,
similarly, took me a really

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.800
long time to figure out.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.612
Because I think when
you're a founder--

00:20:50.612 --> 00:20:52.070
or when you do
anything that you're

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.320
passionate about, whether you're
starting it yourself or not,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.950
you feel like, oh,
well, I will work harder

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:59.370
and then it will be better.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.634
And so you don't allow yourself
to take that time to recharge.

00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.550
When actually, what you
need to do is recharge

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.160
and then you can
actually work harder.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.180
You can't just keep going.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.860
And I think,
particularly when you're

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.030
younger-- earlier
in your career--

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.113
you feel like, I can just
do it, I can just do it.

00:21:13.113 --> 00:21:17.785
And so the whole work smart,
not hard thing, I think,

00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:18.660
is really applicable.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.600
And you have to take
care of yourself

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.400
so that you're a better team
member, you're a better boss,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.680
you're a better family member.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.931
You can be more present.

00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:27.430
Yeah.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:32.780
And one of the things that I
do that I started in the last--

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.220
probably two years now is
I'm a-- I've discovered

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.360
this passion for aerial arts.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.265
So I do flying trapeze
and trampoline.

00:21:41.265 --> 00:21:44.484
That's why I have all these
terrific bruises right now.

00:21:44.484 --> 00:21:46.650
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's
because you flung yourself.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.650
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.100
And it's the most
incredible thing

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.470
and it's not for everyone.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.820
Come talk to me about it
after if you are interested.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.284
We can go together.

00:21:54.284 --> 00:21:55.200
It's not for everyone.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.240
But I do encourage
everyone to find something

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.880
like that that does--
if I'm at the office

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.000
and I have a 6 o'clock
class, I leave.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.500
I go.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.650
I fly for an hour.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.920
It's extremely aerobic and it's
challenging and it's scary,

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.840
but I do it anyway.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.880
And then, I'm like, OK, I
couldn't think about anything

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.930
else during that hour.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.910
And now I'm ready to go back.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.210
I can choose to go back
to work if I want to.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.415
If my body is telling
me you shouldn't go back

00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:22.040
to work yet-- you're
still stressed out

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.130
even after doing all that
stuff-- I can call a friend

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.000
or do something that
will help me get there.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.190
Or just go to bed early.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.590
Sleep is so important.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.622
So, so, so important.

00:22:34.622 --> 00:22:36.330
BRI JAMES: And I think
one of the reasons

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.520
that we forsake self
care is because it

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.200
seems really aggressive.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.070
It seems like something that's
going to take a lot of time

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.716
that we have to do so
persistently and diligently,

00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:46.840
which we definitely should.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.060
But sometimes it just
takes the little things.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.245
Sometimes I'll feel
like garbage and I say,

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:53.875
I have not had any water today.

00:22:53.875 --> 00:22:55.330
Just drink a glass of water.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.420
Go for a walk.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.230
Get up and stretch.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.879
I bought this thing
called a sun lamp,

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:02.420
and if you live in the Bay where
it's always dark and gloomy,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.490
it's awesome.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.510
It emanates the sun in
your office or your house.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.510
And my co-workers will
come in and be like, it's

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.589
like the beach in here.

00:23:09.589 --> 00:23:10.755
And I'm like, yeah, exactly.

00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:12.191
And it's awesome.

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:14.190
So there's a lot of little
things for self care,

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.810
I think, that we
can do, too, that

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.999
makes it seem less overwhelming
and maybe we can ascribe to--

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:20.040
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.110
I was actually so bad
at drinking water.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.570
There's actually
an app for that.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.570
You can look it up in
the Google Play Store.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.430
I think it's like,
Drinkwater or something.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.170
And so every hour,
there's a sound

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.460
that goes off on my phone.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.950
What freaks people
out is that it

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.260
sounds like a toilet flushing.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.450
So maybe don't have
it up as high as I do,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.800
but I then describe to
people how important it

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.850
is for me to be drinking water.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.610
And so the water bottles that
you have at your tables--

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.600
definitely fill those
up with water or coffee

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.330
or whatever--
actually, I don't know.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.136
It might burn you.

00:23:54.136 --> 00:23:55.250
But double check, mates.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:58.820
But having water is actually
just this basic need

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.820
that you can do to
take care of yourself.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.274
Because when you get super
stressed out and you're in it,

00:24:03.274 --> 00:24:05.190
you literally forget to
take care of yourself.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.760
So I'm so thankful that you
shared a lot of these tips.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.070
OK.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.590
You went to trapeze,
you feel super strong,

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.690
you're feeling good.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.670
You did the self care.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.200
You meditate a little bit.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.070
Now you're stepping
into your company

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.360
and you have the
next big project

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.630
you need someone to ship or
your team to follow your vision.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.980
How do you convince a team of
people to follow you that way?

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.440
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: I think,
for me-- my personal style--

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.250
and I'm still-- I think one
of the most interesting things

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.380
about running a company is that
you get leadership training.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.450
You're just thrown
into figuring out how

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.920
to be a leader and a manager.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.140
For me, it's about working hard
and just being very honest,

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:57.230
even when it feels
very uncomfortable.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.690
Because for me, it is-- I
do feel kind of awkward.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.160
I'm not like, I can't wait
to get in front of 30 people

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.815
and talk to them.

00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:05.940
You guys are really lovely.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.050
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: With
your Superwoman pose.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.049
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:09.790
I do that.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.450
At my company and doing
external stuff like this.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.840
But I care so much
about it and I

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.950
care about-- I've seen
women that have inspired me,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.300
so I come and I get over
my fear and I do this

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.090
because I want to
help other people.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:26.970
Similarly, for me to rally
the troops, rally the team,

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:31.320
it's just expressing how
passionate I am about it

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.660
and just putting that out
there and being vulnerable.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.660
Being vulnerable and like,
oh, my god, you guys,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.820
I'm so excited about this.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.330
This is amazing.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.288
Even if I sound really
dumb and I just said oh,

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:46.500
my god four times, that--
if you're at ModCloth,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.600
that is something--
that's why you're there.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.580
Because you saw
me at some point.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.609
Or you saw people that
I've hired that have

00:25:54.609 --> 00:25:55.650
brought that same energy.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.880
So for me, it's really just
being vulnerable and putting it

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.620
out there and looking
around and making sure

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.159
that others are coming with me.

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.700
BRI JAMES: I think,
in the beginning,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.750
most people are excited.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.450
I think the hard part comes
when you're six weeks in

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.060
and you're shipping
in eight weeks

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.740
and it seems like it's
not going to happen.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.860
And everyone's
kind of panicking.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.797
And so we try to celebrate
the little wins along the way,

00:26:21.797 --> 00:26:23.380
because it's those
nuggets that-- when

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.270
you're in that panic--
carry you through.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.320
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Absolutely.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.695
BRI JAMES: A fun
thing that we do

00:26:27.695 --> 00:26:30.690
is-- every sort of piece of
positive customer feedback,

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.920
we put in this giant mason jar
that we call a gratitude jar.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.640
And so when you're
feeling horrible,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.090
you can read something
sweet that a customer says.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.910
And it gives you just
a little pick-me-up

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.520
to get through the next
step and make sure that you

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.187
make those ship deadlines.

00:26:47.187 --> 00:26:48.770
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: I
think being really

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.320
data-driven and transparent
is where we come from.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.820
So if people are like, why
did we make this decision?

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.630
Well, we made this
decision because-- let

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.870
me give you what the options
were, let me tell you

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.727
the data behind it.

00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:04.060
I know that that might not
be something that you wanted,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.215
but this is why
we did it and this

00:27:05.215 --> 00:27:07.173
is why it's in the greater
good of the company.

00:27:07.173 --> 00:27:10.760
I think that goes a long way,
especially with engineers.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.340
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yes.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.882
You've got to know how to
sell to the right audience.

00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:15.090
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.820
MELISSA WONG: I just think
clear-- what I'm hearing

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.240
and what I experience--
just clear communication.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.810
Knowing what your intent
is and just being authentic

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.070
and just being yourself.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.330
Like, hey, I'm scared
about this also.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.100
I'm also nervous
about running behind.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.695
But it's so important to the
success of our customers.

00:27:30.695 --> 00:27:33.710
It's like, you're not-- you're
meeting people where they're at

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.405
and sharing your own experience.

00:27:35.405 --> 00:27:36.780
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
We're getting

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.830
to the very end of our
panel-- and honestly, I

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.090
can hang out with all
these ladies up here,

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.790
but I know that they also
want to meet you at lunch.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.780
Last question.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.900
If you could have
a mantra or a quote

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.680
or a song lyric that
takes you through the day

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.080
or accurately describes what
it's like to be a founder,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.720
what would you
say that would be?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.750
Something inspirational or
something that's like this

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.634
is really founder life.

00:28:10.634 --> 00:28:11.550
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: OK.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:17.130
My song lyric that
I always-- yeah.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.150
"Mo money, mo problems."

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.560
You always think, more money.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.770
And then everything-- especially
when you're starting out,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:26.010
it's like oh, my god, if only
I can get to this fundraising.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.676
And then you do it
and then you're like,

00:28:27.676 --> 00:28:30.800
hold on, but now I have all
this other stuff I got to do.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.320
I say it-- money is great.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.820
But "mo money, mo problems"--
I just always remind myself.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.030
MELISSA WONG: I think mine
comes from a teenage song,

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.850
but it goes back to regret.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.220
It's like you only regret
the things that you don't do.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.803
And then, I think
she's like, let's do

00:28:46.803 --> 00:28:48.197
what we want to do now.

00:28:48.197 --> 00:28:50.030
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Do
you know who sang it?

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.330
MELISSA WONG: I think it's
this artist called Melanie C.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.000
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
From the Spice Girls?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.220
MELODY MCCLOSKEY:
The Spice Girl?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.220
SUSAN GREGG KOGER: Yeah.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.981
The solo work.

00:28:56.981 --> 00:28:57.480
I love that.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.820
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's awesome.

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.230
MELISSA WONG: And then
she's like, don't give me--

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.265
don't let me have
more time to back out.

00:29:02.265 --> 00:29:04.390
So that's why I'm always
like, push myself forward.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:08.500
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm a
bigger-- I was a Posh Spice.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.420
But I think I'm now
a Mel C advocate.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.200
I love it.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.850
Bri?

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.560
BRI JAMES: We got to do karaoke.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.560
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Again,
that's another panel.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.600
BRI JAMES: Yeah, singing
Spice Girls jams.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.440
There's a Goapele
song called "Closer."

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.390
And there's a line that
says, "close your eyes

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.790
and see what you believe."

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.700
And that's really powerful
to me because I've always

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.680
been a doer, not a dreamer.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.000
But as a startup
founder, my journey

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.170
has been learning
how to think big

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.360
and putting those things
together, which has been--

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.340
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I sing
that song out loud a lot.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.210
Every time it comes on
the radio, it's like--

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.080
BRI JAMES: Yeah, that's my jam.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.329
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: --soulful.

00:29:41.329 --> 00:29:42.702
Melody?

00:29:42.702 --> 00:29:44.660
MELODY MCCLOSKEY: Mine's
a little less soulful.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.760
It's "All I Do is
Win" by DJ Khaled.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.360
But I think it's
not-- the point of it

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.874
is that I think one
of the biggest reasons

00:29:53.874 --> 00:29:55.540
that we're still
here-- I think about me

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.192
and my co-founder--
is resiliency.

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:00.400
No matter how hard it gets,
it's going to get harder,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.566
it's still going to be hard.

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:03.580
When you think that
you can't move forward,

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.621
you've just got to do it.

00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:07.320
You have to win because
there's everything at stake.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.147
And so listening to that
just reminds you, all right.

00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:11.730
We've got to-- we
don't have a choice.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.439
We have to do it.

00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:13.855
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And if someone

00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:15.770
wants to make a playlist
and share that out,

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.164
that would be helpful.

00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:19.330
That's all the time we have.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.746
I know-- like I
said, I would want

00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:22.715
to hangout with these
ladies all day long,

00:30:22.715 --> 00:30:24.090
but we've got
other things to do.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.720
We've got other women
for you to meet.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.761
So can we have a round of
applause for our panel?

00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:30.320
[APPLAUSE]
