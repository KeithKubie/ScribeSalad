00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:11.895
When desert locusts are well fed,
they're solitary creatures.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:13.556
But when food becomes scarce,

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:17.264
hungry, desperate locusts
crowd onto small patches of land

00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:19.925
where they can still find 
something to eat.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:24.654
Contact between different locusts'
hind legs set off a slew of reactions

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:27.833
that change their appearance and behavior.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.710
Now, instead of shunning their peers,
they seek each other out.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.715
The locusts eventually start marching
and then fly away in large numbers

00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:37.786
seeking a better habitat.

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:40.585
These gigantic swarms can host
millions of insects

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.534
and travel thousands of miles,

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:45.265
devastating vegetation and crops.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.165
They stay close to each other,
but not too close,

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:52.304
or they might get eaten
by their hungry neighbors.

00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:55.405
When many individual organisms,
like locusts,

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:56.285
bacteria,

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:57.256
anchovies,

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.228
or bats,

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:01.415
come together and move 
as one coordinated entity,

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:03.728
that's a swarm.

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:06.657
From a handful of birds 
to billions of insects,

00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:09.537
swarms can be almost any size.

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:12.427
But what they have in common
is that there's no leader.

00:01:12.427 --> 00:01:16.007
Members of the swarm interact
only with their nearest neighbors

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.368
or through indirect cues.

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:21.008
Each individual follows simple rules:

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:23.428
Travel in the same direction 
as those around you,

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:24.438
stay close,

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:27.098
and avoid collisions.

00:01:27.098 --> 00:01:30.376
There are many benefits to traveling
in a group like this.

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:33.789
Small prey may fool predators
by assembling into a swarm

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.487
that looks like a much bigger organism.

00:01:36.487 --> 00:01:38.159
And congregating in a large group

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.150
reduces the chance that any single 
individual will be captured.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359
Moving in the same direction
as your neighbors

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.668
saves energy by sharing the effort
of fighting wind or water resistance.

00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:53.189
It may even be easier to find a mate
in a swarm.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.239
Swarming can also allow groups of animals

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.789
to accomplish tasks they couldn't do
individually.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.510
When hundreds or millions or organisms
follow the same simple rules,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.770
sophisticated behavior called
swarm intelligence may arise.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.128
A single ant can't do much on its own,

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:13.319
but an ant colony 
can solve complex problems,

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.801
like building a nest

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.551
and finding the shortest path
to a food source.

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:21.509
But sometimes, things can go wrong.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.770
In a crowd, diseases spread more easily,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.290
and some swarming organisms may start
eating each other if food is scarce.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.570
Even some of the benefits of swarms,
like more efficient navigation,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.683
can have catastrophic consequences.

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:38.471
Army ants are one example.

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.983
They lay down chemicals called pheromones

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:44.243
which signal their neighbors 
to follow the trail.

00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:47.652
This is good if the head of the group
is marching towards a food source.

00:02:47.652 --> 00:02:51.914
But occasionally the ants in the front
can veer off course.

00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:55.733
The whole swarm can get caught
in a loop following the pheromone trail

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.717
until they die of exhaustion.

00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:03.533
Humans are notoriously individualistic,
though social, animals.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:08.015
But is there anything we can learn
from collective swarm-based organization?

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:12.484
When it comes to technology,
the answer is definitely yes.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:16.873
Bats can teach drones how to navigate
confined spaces without colliding,

00:03:16.873 --> 00:03:21.033
fish can help design software
for safer driving,

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:27.603
and insects are inspiring robot teams that
can assist search and rescue missions.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:30.494
For swarms of humans, 
it's perhaps more complicated

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:33.138
and depends on the motives and leadership.

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:38.340
Swarm behavior in human populations can
sometimes manifest as a destructive mob.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.573
But collective action can also produce
a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:45.118
an artistic expression,

00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:48.419
or a peaceful global revolution.
