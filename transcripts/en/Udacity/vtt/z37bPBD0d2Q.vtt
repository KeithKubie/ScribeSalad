00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.890
The perfect form is no form.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.520
Right?

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.380
Nobody wants to fill in forms.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.770
And I mentioned before,
I wrote a book about web forms.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.920
The first two words in
the book are forms suck.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.940
Which is very true, right?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.860
Nobody wants to go through that
process of filling in a form.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.560
They want what's on the other side.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.180
They want that ride from Uber.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.860
They want the book from Amazon.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.900
They don't want to sit there retyping
their name for the bizillonth time.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.670
And ultimately it's almost
an insult to the person.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.740
Technology is supposed
to change the world, but

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.890
the damn computer doesn't even
remember what my name is?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.870
How many times must I type my name
into the same freaking computer

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.180
before it knows who I am?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.700
Like I said, it's almost insulting
to people to treat them that way.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.260
So my ultimate example of
the best form is no form.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.120
And that's why I like these things
that get you down to a single tap or

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.970
something where you can
just instinctively say,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.600
I want that and get what you want.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.000
We are a long ways away from that,
in any case, but

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.740
there are a couple examples,
which was very promising.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.975
And, usually, that's how things start.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:06.310
Or you'll see one or two examples that
people say, oh, that's unachievable, but

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.515
gradually more and more people get to
that point and it becomes the new norm.
