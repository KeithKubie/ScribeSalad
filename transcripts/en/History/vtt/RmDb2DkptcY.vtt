00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:04.371
NARRATOR: With the Philippines
under Allied control

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.673
and the Japanese
Navy in disarray,

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:10.710
the US now has a clear
run to advance on Tokyo.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.780
Ultimately, you can bring
to bear your real advantage,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.350
which is American air power.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.221
NARRATOR: And the US has
devastating new air technology.

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:25.892
The B-29 Superfortress
is the ultimate bomber,

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:29.562
flying at 31,000 feet.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.465
To help identify key
targets in Japan,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:37.704
the US Air Force turns to a
future president for help,

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:41.408
Captain Ronald Reagan,
and the first motion

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.210
picture unit in Hollywood.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.312
The unit supports the
war effort by making

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.748
recruitment and training films.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.418
And in 1944, they began
an especially sensitive

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.354
project, training
pilots for bombing runs

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.289
over mainland Japan.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.161
NARRATOR: Reagan begins
work on the assignment.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:06.933
It is known as Special
Film Project 152.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.234
It's a top secret thing.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.403
In fact, in his
memoir, Reagan later

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.472
compares it as
the kind of secret

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.507
that's comparable to
Project Manhattan,

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.811
building the atom bomb.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.846
The army first
motion picture unit

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:23.383
would take photographs of war
zones throughout the world,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.184
and that included Tokyo.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.022
From these photographs
and footage,

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.859
they built this detailed model
of Tokyo and the approach

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.761
to Tokyo.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.964
Pilots who were going to be
staging bombing raids on Tokyo

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.934
would basically watch these,
we would call them sort

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.002
of simulation films, almost.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.004
And they would say, OK, this
is what the approach to Tokyo

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.206
looks like.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.107
RONALD REAGAN: The camera
is now ready to roll.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.476
In effect, the
camera is now a B-29.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.648
NARRATOR: Reagan
voices the film.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.623
RONALD REAGAN: Your
target for this mission

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.960
will be the Japan international
Aircraft Company Hiratsuka

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.063
Plant, with the
Hiratsuka Navy Arsenal

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.365
as a secondary objective.

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:16.135
The mouth of the Sagami
River lies below this island.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:19.572
Reagan wouldn't provide
visual clues for the bombers.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.709
He would say things like, you're
approaching Honshu Island,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.511
the main island of Japan.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.347
You will see inlets
here, a river here.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.581
RONALD REAGAN: Notice
that the target

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.517
is made up of
large, single story

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:33.753
buildings set closely together.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.889
Reagan really
felt that this was

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.492
a huge contribution
to the war effort

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.762
even though he wasn't
on the battle lines.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.198
But this was it for Reagan,
who didn't have an opportunity

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.534
to actually fight in the war.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:51.170
Special project 152 gave
him a real opportunity

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.941
to play an operational part
in the success of the war.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.211
NARRATOR: Ronald Reagan's
work helps the B-29

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.913
pilots to target Tokyo.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.481
RONALD REAGAN: Upon
reaching Mount Fuji, alter

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.683
course to 94 degrees true.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:04.951
The target lies beyond--

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.588
NARRATOR: With
devastating accuracy.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:11.991
They have one of the highest
strike rates of the war.
