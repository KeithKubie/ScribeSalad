00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.110
Self driving cars are on the horizon.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.810
They’re getting nearer and nearer.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:14.440
They’re coming right for us, Ahhhh!

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.790
Hello automatons, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.810
When Google unveiled its prototype for a self
driving car in 2014, they kicked off a race.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.509
A very slow, steady, cautious race to make
cars that could function without any human

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.509
input.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.590
Since Google’s cute little fully automated
“auto” mobile debuted, the closest competition

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.390
they have is from electric car company Tesla,
and the two manufacturers have taken radically

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.620
different approaches to how a self driving
car should look, both inside and out.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.720
Google’s line of thinking is people who
are used to being in control might not like

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.870
a computer in charge of their destination
and destiny.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.230
So their car needs to be as friendly and approachable
as possible.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.060
That’s why they went out of their way to
give it a koala face instead of making it

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.570
look like a normal car.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.030
Tesla’s Model S on the other hand looks
very car-ish.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.730
There’s nothing to suggest it’s out of
the ordinary because when Tesla launched the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.049
electric Model S, they had no real brand identity
yet.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.859
Rather than making an outrageous statement
to appeal to a niche market like other electric

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.770
car manufacturers, Tesla wanted one that would
be broadly appealing from the get go.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.159
The looks were conservative, but they hid
some very advanced technology underneath.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.159
That tech allowed Tesla to give the cars some
self-driving capabilities overnight with just

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.390
a software update.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.659
The update didn’t make the car fully autonomous
though, it just took advantage of some existing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.140
sensors to take over the car’s speed and
make sure the driver doesn’t change lanes

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.119
when there’s another car in it’s blind
spot.8 The Society of Automotive Engineers

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.631
(SAE) actually standardized a scale from 0
to 5 of how self driving a car is, and the

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:46.770
Model S in it’s current state is at level
2.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.179
That means a driver still needs to take over
in certain situations.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.619
But Google turned the knob all the way to
11… or I guess, “5”.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.819
That means the interior has no need for a
steering wheel or pedals so google decided

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.149
to leave those parts out.10 But to have the
car fully take over means it needs sensors

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.450
and a brain that can do everything a human
can do, and that’s the final piece of the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.700
design puzzle.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.230
Google threw just about every sensor they
could onto their little go-bot.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.000
Like the Tesla, it uses optical cameras and
radar, but unlike the Tesla there is an array

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.450
of 64 spinning lasers mounted on the roof.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.500
This LIDAR is accurate up to a range of 100
meters and is the car’s main tool for “seeing”

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.580
and understanding its environment.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.610
Even with all these sensors, there are challenges
to overcome.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.920
The car needs to travel in an area that’s
been thoroughly mapped beforehand, so country

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.550
back roads would still require a steering
wheel.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.930
The LIDAR doesn’t work well in inclement
weather, the car may not be ready to deal

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.620
with construction zones, and the sensors aren’t
so great at picking up one very important

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.390
thing: people.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.950
In case the car does run into a “people,”
Google has patented a sticky skin under an

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.290
eggshell exterior.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.100
If someone gets hit, the skin cracks, and
the person is glued to the car instead of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.540
being knocked to the concrete.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.290
That’s just one possible solution though,
and not necessarily the one Google will pursue.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.350
Still, if Google can iron out the kinks, it’s
possible the cars of the future will be adorable,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.440
gumdrop hat wearing, steering wheel-less bubbles
with people stuck on the outside.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.060
It takes a lot of effort to keep your car
clean.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.000
Techron by Chevron’s patented Precision
Clean Technology targets and removes deposits

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.160
left by lower tier gasolines.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.290
It bonds with and breaks apart carbon deposits,
more effectively than other additive technologies.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.460
Techron gets into the deepest parts of the
engine, where the most destructive deposits

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.860
built up, and sweeps them away.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.690
Driverless cars may look very different, but
can they ever really be as safe as a human

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.900
operated one?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:56.450
Trace goes over the numbers here.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.370
Would you be comfortable getting in a fully
automated car, or do you still need that steering

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.920
wheel in front of you?Tell us down in the
