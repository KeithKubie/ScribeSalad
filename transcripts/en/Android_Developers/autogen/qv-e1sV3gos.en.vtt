this talk well I've been talking lots of
developers out there and I say hey have

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
developers out there and I say hey have
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.439

so I thought wouldn't it be great if we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
so I thought wouldn't it be great if we
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.050
so I thought wouldn't it be great if we
did a talk about this and to show you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
did a talk about this and to show you
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120
did a talk about this and to show you
the small steps that are needed to get

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
the small steps that are needed to get
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.749
the small steps that are needed to get
your app onto the big screen so if

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759
your app onto the big screen so if
 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.429
your app onto the big screen so if
developers aren't doing this why is this

so to quote my very famous colleague

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849
so to quote my very famous colleague
 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.280
so to quote my very famous colleague
Ryan here it's just Android and so it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
Ryan here it's just Android and so it
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.979
Ryan here it's just Android and so it
uses the same SDKs the same tools that

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989
uses the same SDKs the same tools that
 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.660
uses the same SDKs the same tools that
you're familiar with same Android studio

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
you're familiar with same Android studio
 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.630
you're familiar with same Android studio
and the same emulator tools so you can

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640
and the same emulator tools so you can
 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.070
and the same emulator tools so you can
get started really easy if you're

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
get started really easy if you're
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.470
get started really easy if you're
familiar with Android right now and so

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
familiar with Android right now and so
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.930
familiar with Android right now and so
the basics are you tweak your manifest

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940
the basics are you tweak your manifest
 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.970
the basics are you tweak your manifest

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.490
file check a box in Google Play and your
apps ready so that's the really cool

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500
apps ready so that's the really cool
 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.479
apps ready so that's the really cool
thing about it that's what we're going

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489
thing about it that's what we're going
 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.819
thing about it that's what we're going
to talk about today so the other thing

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829
to talk about today so the other thing
 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.220
to talk about today so the other thing
is that you can actually make a single

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
is that you can actually make a single
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.650
is that you can actually make a single
APK that you upload to Google Play that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660
APK that you upload to Google Play that
 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.440
APK that you upload to Google Play that
supports both TV and phone that sounds

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450
supports both TV and phone that sounds
 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.619
supports both TV and phone that sounds
similar these things up so the first

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629
similar these things up so the first
 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:51.910
similar these things up so the first
thing with this talk that I wanted to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
thing with this talk that I wanted to
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.259
thing with this talk that I wanted to
sort of point out is that a lot of

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269
sort of point out is that a lot of
 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.690
sort of point out is that a lot of
people think well Android TV is only

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700
people think well Android TV is only
 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.180
people think well Android TV is only
useful for watching TV shows and movies

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
useful for watching TV shows and movies
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.309
useful for watching TV shows and movies
but I really think there's so much more

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319
but I really think there's so much more
 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.800
but I really think there's so much more
possibilities for what you can do rather

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810
possibilities for what you can do rather
 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.020
possibilities for what you can do rather
than just those things so imagine you

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030
than just those things so imagine you
 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.210
than just those things so imagine you
could browse photos and artwork you

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
could browse photos and artwork you
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.369
could browse photos and artwork you
could look at restaurant menus or houses

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379
could look at restaurant menus or houses
 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.470
could look at restaurant menus or houses
that you're looking to buy or exploring

that you're looking to buy or exploring
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569
that you're looking to buy or exploring
maps or 3d models or playing computer

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579
maps or 3d models or playing computer
 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.190
maps or 3d models or playing computer
games so there's a whole bunch of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200
games so there's a whole bunch of
 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.409
games so there's a whole bunch of
possibilities that really make the

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419
possibilities that really make the
 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.050
possibilities that really make the
possibilities endless and so Android TV

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060
possibilities endless and so Android TV
 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.659
possibilities endless and so Android TV
really breaks down the possibilities of

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669
really breaks down the possibilities of
 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.460
really breaks down the possibilities of
what we thought TV could be used for

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470
what we thought TV could be used for
 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.860
what we thought TV could be used for
into so much more other things and the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
into so much more other things and the
 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.319
into so much more other things and the
other thing is that Android TV is the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329
other thing is that Android TV is the
 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.270
other thing is that Android TV is the
largest screen in your house every house

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280
largest screen in your house every house
 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.250
largest screen in your house every house
has this massive screen that's in the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
has this massive screen that's in the
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.990
has this massive screen that's in the
living room in the center of the house

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
living room in the center of the house
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.750
living room in the center of the house
and so it has huge possibilities for

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760
and so it has huge possibilities for
 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.039
and so it has huge possibilities for
what you can do with it and so that's

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049
what you can do with it and so that's
 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.449
what you can do with it and so that's
what we're trying to encourage today is

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459
what we're trying to encourage today is
 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.360
what we're trying to encourage today is
for developers to think of new platforms

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370
for developers to think of new platforms
 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.520
for developers to think of new platforms
and new ways of taking their apps and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
and new ways of taking their apps and
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.140
and new ways of taking their apps and
getting them out to consumers out there

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150
getting them out to consumers out there
 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.689
getting them out to consumers out there

so today we're gonna help you redefine
what a living room experience could be

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949
what a living room experience could be
 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.640
what a living room experience could be

go through some more of the steps of how
 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:01.390
go through some more of the steps of how
to do this

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400

Thanks so the first step in bringing
your app to Android TV is you're going

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730
your app to Android TV is you're going
 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.390
your app to Android TV is you're going
to need to add a TV banner this banner

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400
to need to add a TV banner this banner
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.979
to need to add a TV banner this banner

is going to provide the launch point for
your app on the Android TV launch screen

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849
your app on the Android TV launch screen
 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.900
your app on the Android TV launch screen
so here's an example banner that I've

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910
so here's an example banner that I've
 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.180
so here's an example banner that I've
taken directly from our sample app which

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190
taken directly from our sample app which
 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.460
taken directly from our sample app which
is available on github

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470
is available on github
 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.249
is available on github
here is our sample banner alongside some

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259
here is our sample banner alongside some
 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.860
here is our sample banner alongside some
official Android TV apps this is what it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870
official Android TV apps this is what it
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.719
official Android TV apps this is what it
would appear like on the Android TV

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729
would appear like on the Android TV
 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.570
would appear like on the Android TV
launcher itself so there are a couple

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580
launcher itself so there are a couple
 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.550
launcher itself so there are a couple
requirements that we would like you to

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560
requirements that we would like you to
 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.860
requirements that we would like you to
follow when you're creating your TV

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
follow when you're creating your TV
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.779
follow when you're creating your TV
banner the first is that the banner

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789
banner the first is that the banner
 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.020
banner the first is that the banner
should be 320 by 180 pixels that's

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
should be 320 by 180 pixels that's
 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.629
should be 320 by 180 pixels that's
because Android TV this is the size that

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639
because Android TV this is the size that
 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.339
because Android TV this is the size that
it's going to display it at and if you

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349
it's going to display it at and if you
 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.990
it's going to display it at and if you
make your banner any other size it's

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000
make your banner any other size it's
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.610
make your banner any other size it's
just gonna stretch it and skew it in a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
just gonna stretch it and skew it in a
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.189
just gonna stretch it and skew it in a
way that you wouldn't really like the

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199
way that you wouldn't really like the
 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.740
way that you wouldn't really like the
second is that your app name should

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
second is that your app name should
 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.619
second is that your app name should
appear readable in the banner itself and

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629
appear readable in the banner itself and
 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.619
appear readable in the banner itself and
the reason for this is on Android TV the

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629
the reason for this is on Android TV the
 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.110
the reason for this is on Android TV the
name of your app doesn't actually appear

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120
name of your app doesn't actually appear
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.719
name of your app doesn't actually appear
below the banner and so we ask that you

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729
below the banner and so we ask that you
 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.209
below the banner and so we ask that you
put it inside the banner itself so that

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:08.219
put it inside the banner itself so that
 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:09.980
put it inside the banner itself so that
your users can understand what app

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990
your users can understand what app
 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.709
your users can understand what app
they're clicking on when they open yours

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719
they're clicking on when they open yours
 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.899
they're clicking on when they open yours
so it's super simple to add it takes a

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909
so it's super simple to add it takes a
 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.760
so it's super simple to add it takes a
single line in your manifest I'm sure

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770
single line in your manifest I'm sure
 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.899
single line in your manifest I'm sure
you're familiar with this in your

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909
you're familiar with this in your
 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.540
you're familiar with this in your

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.430
resource super easy right um so if you
did all this and you tried to run your

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440
did all this and you tried to run your
 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.950
did all this and you tried to run your
app nothing would actually happen just

Leanback launcher the reason that we

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340
Leanback launcher the reason that we
 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.430
Leanback launcher the reason that we
actually separate launcher and Leanback

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440
actually separate launcher and Leanback
 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.680
actually separate launcher and Leanback
launcher is because our best practices

TV specific UI and layouts eventually

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
TV specific UI and layouts eventually
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.330

we're just going to say why not get

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919
we're just going to say why not get

started throw it in your existing
 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.869
started throw it in your existing
activity and see how much it works like

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879
activity and see how much it works like
 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.850
activity and see how much it works like
I said earlier it's just Android so

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860
I said earlier it's just Android so
 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.140
I said earlier it's just Android so
you'd be surprised by how much works

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150
you'd be surprised by how much works
 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.140
you'd be surprised by how much works
right out of the box the next big

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150
right out of the box the next big
 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.300
right out of the box the next big
difference on android TV is the TV

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310
difference on android TV is the TV
 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.540
difference on android TV is the TV
hardware itself so mobile devices you

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550
hardware itself so mobile devices you
 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.339
hardware itself so mobile devices you
know they can make phone calls they can

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349
know they can make phone calls they can
 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:34.910
know they can make phone calls they can
take photo

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920
take photo
 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.670
take photo
they use NFC they have touchscreens TVs

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
they use NFC they have touchscreens TVs
 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.230
they use NFC they have touchscreens TVs
don't have any of these things at least

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240
don't have any of these things at least
 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.910
don't have any of these things at least
like my TV doesn't have a touchscreen

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920
like my TV doesn't have a touchscreen
 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.940
like my TV doesn't have a touchscreen
and so for these reasons we actually

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
and so for these reasons we actually
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.280
and so for these reasons we actually
need to tell Android that these features

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290
need to tell Android that these features
 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.530
need to tell Android that these features
that we may have come to expect on a TV

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540
that we may have come to expect on a TV
 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.100
that we may have come to expect on a TV
or on a phone will not be available on a

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110
or on a phone will not be available on a
 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.120
or on a phone will not be available on a
TV so the way that we do this is through

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130
TV so the way that we do this is through
 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.400
TV so the way that we do this is through
our users feature tag and you guys I'm

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410
our users feature tag and you guys I'm
 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.230
our users feature tag and you guys I'm
sure are all familiar with this you

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240
sure are all familiar with this you
 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.330
sure are all familiar with this you
declare the hardware features that you

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340
declare the hardware features that you
 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.670
declare the hardware features that you
would like to use in your app manifest

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680
would like to use in your app manifest
 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.870
would like to use in your app manifest
and this is probably fine you know for

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880
and this is probably fine you know for
 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.130
and this is probably fine you know for
phones and tablets it's gonna

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.140
phones and tablets it's gonna
 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.860
phones and tablets it's gonna
automatically set required a true

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870
automatically set required a true
 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.200
automatically set required a true
however for Android TV and for TV

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210
however for Android TV and for TV
 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.300
however for Android TV and for TV
Hardware specifically this Hardware

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310
Hardware specifically this Hardware
 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.360
Hardware specifically this Hardware
might not be available on TVs and so we

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370
might not be available on TVs and so we
 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.750
might not be available on TVs and so we
need to update that to required false so

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760
need to update that to required false so
 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.000
need to update that to required false so
that so that the TV itself knows that

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010
that so that the TV itself knows that
 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.730
that so that the TV itself knows that
hey I can still operate without this

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740
hey I can still operate without this
 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.280
hey I can still operate without this
hardware requirement so one gotcha

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290
hardware requirement so one gotcha
 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.350
hardware requirement so one gotcha
actually is that the touchscreen

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
actually is that the touchscreen
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.270
actually is that the touchscreen
Hardware requirement is by default

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280
Hardware requirement is by default
 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.700
Hardware requirement is by default
required true even if you don't declare

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710
required true even if you don't declare
 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.850
required true even if you don't declare
that you need it and so we actually need

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860
that you need it and so we actually need
 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.980
that you need it and so we actually need
to take this snippet that you see here

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990
to take this snippet that you see here
 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.280
to take this snippet that you see here
and add it directly right into your

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290
and add it directly right into your
 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.080
and add it directly right into your
Android manifest

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.090
 
 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.260
 
so another gotcha is that some

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.270
so another gotcha is that some
 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.030
so another gotcha is that some
permissions actually if you're if you

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.040
permissions actually if you're if you
 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.040
permissions actually if you're if you
asked for like say a record audio

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050
asked for like say a record audio
 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.560
asked for like say a record audio
permission it's actually gonna imply

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.570
permission it's actually gonna imply
 

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.480
permission it's actually gonna imply
this Hardware requirement for a

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.490
this Hardware requirement for a
 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.170
this Hardware requirement for a
microphone and this makes sense right

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180
microphone and this makes sense right
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.480
microphone and this makes sense right
you want to be able to record some audio

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.490
you want to be able to record some audio
 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.830
you want to be able to record some audio
so you're gonna need a microphone but

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840
so you're gonna need a microphone but
 

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.040
so you're gonna need a microphone but
the you might not actually declare the

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.050
the you might not actually declare the
 

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.970
the you might not actually declare the
uses feature itself and so what we what

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:22.980
uses feature itself and so what we what
 

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.650
uses feature itself and so what we what
we have to do to get around this is just

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.660
we have to do to get around this is just
 

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.470
we have to do to get around this is just
go into your Android manifest declare

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:27.480
go into your Android manifest declare
 

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.810
go into your Android manifest declare
uses feature tag and set required to

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:29.820
uses feature tag and set required to
 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.610
uses feature tag and set required to
false okay so this is the most important

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620
false okay so this is the most important
 

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.650
false okay so this is the most important
part about bringing your app to Android

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:36.660
part about bringing your app to Android
 

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.530
part about bringing your app to Android
TV this is the UI navigation and

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:39.540
TV this is the UI navigation and
 

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.540
TV this is the UI navigation and
controls so with no touchscreen

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:41.550
controls so with no touchscreen
 

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.969
controls so with no touchscreen
available on TVs we have to rely on

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979
available on TVs we have to rely on
 

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.210
available on TVs we have to rely on
these minimal controls and this is

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.220
these minimal controls and this is
 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.420
these minimal controls and this is
brings us to the d-pad so the d-pad

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:49.430
brings us to the d-pad so the d-pad
 

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.699
brings us to the d-pad so the d-pad
which also stands for directional pad is

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:51.709
which also stands for directional pad is
 

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:53.920
which also stands for directional pad is
the de-facto way to navigate on Android

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:53.930
the de-facto way to navigate on Android
 

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.400
the de-facto way to navigate on Android
TV

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:54.410
TV
 

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.650
TV
now this d-pad is not an entirely new

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:56.660
now this d-pad is not an entirely new
 

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.629
now this d-pad is not an entirely new
idea some of the first phones actually

00:08:58.629 --> 00:08:58.639
idea some of the first phones actually
 

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.970
idea some of the first phones actually
use d-pad for navigation and when we say

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:00.980
use d-pad for navigation and when we say
 

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.559
use d-pad for navigation and when we say
navigation what we're really talking

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:02.569
navigation what we're really talking
 

00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:05.170
navigation what we're really talking
about here is this intuitive change of

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.180
about here is this intuitive change of
 

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.869
about here is this intuitive change of
focus touchscreens have revolutionized

00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:07.879
focus touchscreens have revolutionized
 

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:10.300
focus touchscreens have revolutionized
our ability to you know tell our

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:10.310
our ability to you know tell our
 

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.030
our ability to you know tell our
interfaces when I tap here I want you to

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040
interfaces when I tap here I want you to
 

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.699
interfaces when I tap here I want you to
focus and take action at that specific

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:15.709
focus and take action at that specific
 

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:17.980
focus and take action at that specific
point however on TVs we don't have this

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:17.990
point however on TVs we don't have this
 

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.509
point however on TVs we don't have this
same luxury because there's no

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519
same luxury because there's no
 

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.879
same luxury because there's no
touchscreen available so in order to

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:21.889
touchscreen available so in order to
 

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.230
touchscreen available so in order to
focus what we need to do is

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240
focus what we need to do is
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.910
focus what we need to do is
progressively shift our focus from

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920
progressively shift our focus from
 

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.610
progressively shift our focus from
element to element through our UI until

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:27.620
element to element through our UI until
 

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.619
element to element through our UI until
we get to the one that we want and on

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:29.629
we get to the one that we want and on
 

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:30.999
we get to the one that we want and on
Android there are a number of different

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:31.009
Android there are a number of different
 

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.499
Android there are a number of different
ways that focus is handled and

00:09:32.499 --> 00:09:32.509
ways that focus is handled and
 

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.629
ways that focus is handled and
manipulated and so I'm gonna discuss

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:34.639
manipulated and so I'm gonna discuss
 

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:38.889
manipulated and so I'm gonna discuss
each one of these briefly so first thing

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:38.899
each one of these briefly so first thing
 

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:40.179
each one of these briefly so first thing
that you need to know about Android

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:40.189
that you need to know about Android
 

00:09:40.189 --> 00:09:43.540
that you need to know about Android
focus on Android is this attribute

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:43.550
focus on Android is this attribute
 

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.220
focus on Android is this attribute
called focusable and I'm sure you're all

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.230
called focusable and I'm sure you're all
 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.900
called focusable and I'm sure you're all
familiar with this in simple terms

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:46.910
familiar with this in simple terms
 

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.600
familiar with this in simple terms
though on Android TV your users are

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:49.610
though on Android TV your users are
 

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.660
though on Android TV your users are
going to be using a remote so on with

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670
going to be using a remote so on with
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.309
going to be using a remote so on with
any element that you want them to

00:09:54.309 --> 00:09:54.319
any element that you want them to
 

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:57.160
any element that you want them to
interact with they the element itself

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:57.170
interact with they the element itself
 

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.740
interact with they the element itself
should be focused upon and to do that

00:09:59.740 --> 00:09:59.750
should be focused upon and to do that
 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.600
should be focused upon and to do that
all we do is we set this focusable

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:01.610
all we do is we set this focusable
 

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.660
all we do is we set this focusable
attribute to be true so as an example

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:04.670
attribute to be true so as an example
 

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.389
attribute to be true so as an example
use case here where you may be creating

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399
use case here where you may be creating
 

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:11.769
use case here where you may be creating
some custom playback layout and it has a

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:11.779
some custom playback layout and it has a
 

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.540
some custom playback layout and it has a
play/pause button here which we've

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:13.550
play/pause button here which we've
 

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.910
play/pause button here which we've
represented with an image view and

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920
represented with an image view and
 

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.990
represented with an image view and
you're going to want to be able to

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000
you're going to want to be able to
 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.670
you're going to want to be able to
navigate to that play pause button so

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680
navigate to that play pause button so
 

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.400
navigate to that play pause button so
that you can eventually click it so all

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.410
that you can eventually click it so all
 

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.259
that you can eventually click it so all
we do is we just set focusable to true

00:10:23.259 --> 00:10:23.269
we do is we just set focusable to true
 

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:25.749
we do is we just set focusable to true
now one thing to keep in mind here a

00:10:25.749 --> 00:10:25.759
now one thing to keep in mind here a
 

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.579
now one thing to keep in mind here a
little bit of a gotcha is that some

00:10:27.579 --> 00:10:27.589
little bit of a gotcha is that some
 

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:29.980
little bit of a gotcha is that some
views aren't they don't set focusable to

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:29.990
views aren't they don't set focusable to
 

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.740
views aren't they don't set focusable to
be true by default image view is one of

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:32.750
be true by default image view is one of
 

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.230
be true by default image view is one of
these so in this case we have to set it

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240
these so in this case we have to set it
 

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.650
these so in this case we have to set it
explicitly to true great so now we can

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:38.660
explicitly to true great so now we can
 

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.990
explicitly to true great so now we can
focus and select our play button but

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000
focus and select our play button but
 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.170
focus and select our play button but
what if we want to say press right on

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:44.180
what if we want to say press right on
 

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.400
what if we want to say press right on
the d-pad and have it focus on the

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:47.410
the d-pad and have it focus on the
 

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.809
the d-pad and have it focus on the
fast-forward button or press left and

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:49.819
fast-forward button or press left and
 

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:53.259
fast-forward button or press left and
have it focus on the rewind button so we

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:53.269
have it focus on the rewind button so we
 

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:55.090
have it focus on the rewind button so we
use these two other attributes next

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:55.100
use these two other attributes next
 

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.519
use these two other attributes next
focus right and next focus left so by

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:57.529
focus right and next focus left so by
 

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:58.990
focus right and next focus left so by
setting these two attributes as shown

00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000
setting these two attributes as shown
 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.580
setting these two attributes as shown
here

00:10:59.580 --> 00:10:59.590
here
 

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.710
here
now androids going to switch the focus

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720
now androids going to switch the focus
 

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.300
now androids going to switch the focus
automatically when you press those

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.310
automatically when you press those
 

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.330
automatically when you press those
buttons on the d-pad so there may be

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:06.340
buttons on the d-pad so there may be
 

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.430
buttons on the d-pad so there may be
other times where you want to you know

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440
other times where you want to you know
 

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.110
other times where you want to you know
create your views directly in Java code

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120
create your views directly in Java code
 

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.050
create your views directly in Java code
and so specifying this focus in the XML

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.060
and so specifying this focus in the XML
 

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.630
and so specifying this focus in the XML
is not going to be available to you for

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:15.640
is not going to be available to you for
 

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.340
is not going to be available to you for
example you may be generating a lot of

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:17.350
example you may be generating a lot of
 

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.060
example you may be generating a lot of
views like a grid shown here and you're

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.070
views like a grid shown here and you're
 

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.470
views like a grid shown here and you're
not going to necessarily be able to

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480
not going to necessarily be able to
 

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.870
not going to necessarily be able to
declare exactly what I should be

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880
declare exactly what I should be
 

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.100
declare exactly what I should be
focusing on at that specific point so we

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.110
focusing on at that specific point so we
 

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.650
focusing on at that specific point so we
need some way to ask Android to change

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:31.660
need some way to ask Android to change
 

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.690
need some way to ask Android to change
this focus and we do that through this

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:33.700
this focus and we do that through this
 

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.570
this focus and we do that through this
request focus method which is available

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:36.580
request focus method which is available
 

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.070
request focus method which is available
on the view class so request focus just

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.080
on the view class so request focus just
 

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.100
on the view class so request focus just
does exactly that it requests it asks

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:44.110
does exactly that it requests it asks
 

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.590
does exactly that it requests it asks
Android to bring that view into focus if

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600
Android to bring that view into focus if
 

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.930
Android to bring that view into focus if
it is focusable and that's a key point

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:48.940
it is focusable and that's a key point
 

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.570
it is focusable and that's a key point
if it's focusable so be sure to make

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:51.580
if it's focusable so be sure to make
 

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.720
if it's focusable so be sure to make
make sure that that view is focusable

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:54.730
make sure that that view is focusable
 

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.420
make sure that that view is focusable
set to true before you request focus or

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.430
set to true before you request focus or
 

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.930
set to true before you request focus or
else it won't do anything so the last

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:00.940
else it won't do anything so the last
 

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.460
else it won't do anything so the last
thing that I'd like to discuss here

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:02.470
thing that I'd like to discuss here
 

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.130
thing that I'd like to discuss here
about the d-pad is what if you want to

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.140
about the d-pad is what if you want to
 

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.020
about the d-pad is what if you want to
take some arbitrary actions when any key

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.030
take some arbitrary actions when any key
 

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.180
take some arbitrary actions when any key
is pressed so to do this we're gonna

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.190
is pressed so to do this we're gonna
 

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.890
is pressed so to do this we're gonna
override the activities on keydown

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:10.900
override the activities on keydown
 

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.260
override the activities on keydown
method this method fires when any key is

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.270
method this method fires when any key is
 

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.030
method this method fires when any key is
pressed that isn't already handled by

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040
pressed that isn't already handled by
 

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.280
pressed that isn't already handled by
one of these views inside of your

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.290
one of these views inside of your
 

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.400
one of these views inside of your
activity so an example here is that you

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.410
activity so an example here is that you
 

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.640
activity so an example here is that you
could combine this on this on T down

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:23.650
could combine this on this on T down
 

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.040
could combine this on this on T down
with requests focus to change focus when

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.050
with requests focus to change focus when
 

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.890
with requests focus to change focus when
any key is pressed or a really common

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:28.900
any key is pressed or a really common
 

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.810
any key is pressed or a really common
use case is if I press play pause button

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:30.820
use case is if I press play pause button
 

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.450
use case is if I press play pause button
on the remote it's going to play I'm

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:33.460
on the remote it's going to play I'm
 

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.810
on the remote it's going to play I'm
gonna play or pause my video or if

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:36.820
gonna play or pause my video or if
 

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.610
gonna play or pause my video or if
you're making a game like I'm showing

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:38.620
you're making a game like I'm showing
 

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.650
you're making a game like I'm showing
here maybe when you press the write

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:40.660
here maybe when you press the write
 

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.530
here maybe when you press the write
d-pad button you're going to move your

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:43.540
d-pad button you're going to move your
 

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.030
d-pad button you're going to move your
player to the right

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040
 
 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.350
 
okay so Brian talked you through a

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360
okay so Brian talked you through a
 

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.180
okay so Brian talked you through a
little bit about focus and moving things

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.190
little bit about focus and moving things
 

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.500
little bit about focus and moving things
around and so forth now we're going to

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:52.510
around and so forth now we're going to
 

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.530
around and so forth now we're going to
talk a bit about the screen so it turns

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.540
talk a bit about the screen so it turns
 

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.410
talk a bit about the screen so it turns
out with televisions nowadays they don't

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.420
out with televisions nowadays they don't
 

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.240
out with televisions nowadays they don't
quite operate in the same way that we

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:00.250
quite operate in the same way that we
 

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.620
quite operate in the same way that we
would expect you would think that if

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.630
would expect you would think that if
 

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.930
would expect you would think that if
you've got a 1080 HDMI signal and you

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:03.940
you've got a 1080 HDMI signal and you
 

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.610
you've got a 1080 HDMI signal and you
feed it through to a screen that you

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:05.620
feed it through to a screen that you
 

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.960
feed it through to a screen that you
would get a one-to-one mapping it turns

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:06.970
would get a one-to-one mapping it turns
 

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.640
would get a one-to-one mapping it turns
out that's not quite the case so I'm

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:08.650
out that's not quite the case so I'm
 

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.570
out that's not quite the case so I'm
going to talk a little bit about

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:09.580
going to talk a little bit about
 

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.480
going to talk a little bit about
something called overscan protection

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:11.490
something called overscan protection
 

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.490
something called overscan protection
so if we actually go back in time back

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:14.500
so if we actually go back in time back
 

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.500
so if we actually go back in time back
in the days of analog TV there were

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:16.510
in the days of analog TV there were
 

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.570
in the days of analog TV there were
these edges on the screen that we're not

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:18.580
these edges on the screen that we're not
 

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.910
these edges on the screen that we're not
used and TV stations actually used to

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920
used and TV stations actually used to
 

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.670
used and TV stations actually used to
embed little signalling and bits of data

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680
embed little signalling and bits of data
 

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.560
embed little signalling and bits of data
and things like that in that area that

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:25.570
and things like that in that area that
 

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.330
and things like that in that area that
wasn't displayed by the television it

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:27.340
wasn't displayed by the television it
 

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.550
wasn't displayed by the television it
turns out then we move to HD that stuff

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560
turns out then we move to HD that stuff
 

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.500
turns out then we move to HD that stuff
still happened and so a lot of TV

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:31.510
still happened and so a lot of TV
 

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.720
still happened and so a lot of TV
manufacturers will actually take a TV

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:33.730
manufacturers will actually take a TV
 

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.790
manufacturers will actually take a TV
image and they'll chop off the edges and

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800
image and they'll chop off the edges and
 

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.860
image and they'll chop off the edges and
then stretch the image slightly so it

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:37.870
then stretch the image slightly so it
 

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.960
then stretch the image slightly so it
fits the screen so what this means is

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:39.970
fits the screen so what this means is
 

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.520
fits the screen so what this means is
that you don't get a one-to-one mapping

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:41.530
that you don't get a one-to-one mapping
 

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.250
that you don't get a one-to-one mapping
and some of the pixels on the edge

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:44.260
and some of the pixels on the edge
 

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.340
and some of the pixels on the edge
actually get chopped off so you can

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:47.350
actually get chopped off so you can
 

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.110
actually get chopped off so you can
disable this on some televisions there's

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120
disable this on some televisions there's
 

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.390
disable this on some televisions there's
overscan or some other feature like that

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.400
overscan or some other feature like that
 

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.760
overscan or some other feature like that
that you can remove with the remote but

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:53.770
that you can remove with the remote but
 

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.170
that you can remove with the remote but
a lot of users don't know how to do it

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:55.180
a lot of users don't know how to do it
 

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.180
a lot of users don't know how to do it
so you need to be aware of the fact that

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.190
so you need to be aware of the fact that
 

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.800
so you need to be aware of the fact that
there are some people out there who are

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:58.810
there are some people out there who are
 

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.420
there are some people out there who are
not going to see the edges of the screen

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.430
not going to see the edges of the screen
 

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.130
not going to see the edges of the screen
of your app and so we need to go about

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.140
of your app and so we need to go about
 

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.610
of your app and so we need to go about
dealing with that somehow and so if we

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:05.620
dealing with that somehow and so if we
 

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.530
dealing with that somehow and so if we
look at this diagram here you can see

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:07.540
look at this diagram here you can see
 

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.320
look at this diagram here you can see
that we have our 1080p overall display

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.330
that we have our 1080p overall display
 

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.900
that we have our 1080p overall display
and we've also shown it in terms of DPS

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:12.910
and we've also shown it in terms of DPS
 

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.510
and we've also shown it in terms of DPS
which is device pixels and then you can

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:15.520
which is device pixels and then you can
 

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.970
which is device pixels and then you can
show the areas that are not included and

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:17.980
show the areas that are not included and
 

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.220
show the areas that are not included and
we have a guideline which is that you

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:20.230
we have a guideline which is that you
 

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.310
we have a guideline which is that you
should roughly stick to not using the

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320
should roughly stick to not using the
 

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.440
should roughly stick to not using the
outer 5% of the image and that's usually

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:25.450
outer 5% of the image and that's usually
 

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.990
outer 5% of the image and that's usually
a safe thing so if we look here you can

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000
a safe thing so if we look here you can
 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.630
a safe thing so if we look here you can
see we've got some UI elements and we've

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:30.640
see we've got some UI elements and we've
 

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.550
see we've got some UI elements and we've
got the edges protected so that we don't

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560
got the edges protected so that we don't
 

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.580
got the edges protected so that we don't
use them so once again a 5 percent outer

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:35.590
use them so once again a 5 percent outer
 

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.170
use them so once again a 5 percent outer
area is something that you should

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:37.180
area is something that you should
 

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.330
area is something that you should
reserve that your app shouldn't put

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:39.340
reserve that your app shouldn't put
 

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.340
reserve that your app shouldn't put
anything important in now if you have a

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:41.350
anything important in now if you have a
 

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.290
anything important in now if you have a
background image that's okay if that

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:43.300
background image that's okay if that
 

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.790
background image that's okay if that
gets cropped because it's just that

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800
gets cropped because it's just that
 

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.530
gets cropped because it's just that
probably the interesting part is in the

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:46.540
probably the interesting part is in the
 

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.030
probably the interesting part is in the
center of the screen so background

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040
center of the screen so background
 

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.040
center of the screen so background
images can get cropped but important

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.050
images can get cropped but important
 

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.470
images can get cropped but important
pieces of text labels any kind of

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480
pieces of text labels any kind of
 

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.150
pieces of text labels any kind of
important information like that you've

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160
important information like that you've
 

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.860
important information like that you've
got to make sure that you keep it out of

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:55.870
got to make sure that you keep it out of
 

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.500
got to make sure that you keep it out of
that region and so here we have a custom

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:58.510
that region and so here we have a custom
 

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.510
that region and so here we have a custom
layout XML that we're showing we've got

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:00.520
layout XML that we're showing we've got
 

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.610
layout XML that we're showing we've got
to relative layouts and the inner

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:02.620
to relative layouts and the inner
 

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.770
to relative layouts and the inner
relative layout if you look at it is

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:04.780
relative layout if you look at it is
 

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.440
relative layout if you look at it is
padded with the 5% margin so you can see

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:07.450
padded with the 5% margin so you can see
 

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.870
padded with the 5% margin so you can see
we're setting margin top bottom left and

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880
we're setting margin top bottom left and
 

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.030
we're setting margin top bottom left and
right and we've set DP values that

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040
right and we've set DP values that
 

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.280
right and we've set DP values that
represent that margin and anything we

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:14.290
represent that margin and anything we
 

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.350
represent that margin and anything we
put inside that inner relative layout

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360
put inside that inner relative layout
 

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.200
put inside that inner relative layout
will not be cropped off by the

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.210
will not be cropped off by the
 

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.450
will not be cropped off by the
television for any reason anything else

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:21.460
television for any reason anything else
 

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.680
television for any reason anything else
that you don't care about like the

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:22.690
that you don't care about like the
 

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.310
that you don't care about like the
background image we talked about earlier

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320
background image we talked about earlier
 

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.900
background image we talked about earlier
you can put that in the outer

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:25.910
you can put that in the outer
 

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.560
you can put that in the outer
relativelayout at the top and that will

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:28.570
relativelayout at the top and that will
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.000
relativelayout at the top and that will
possibly be cropped by the television so

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.010
possibly be cropped by the television so
 

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.350
possibly be cropped by the television so
this is pretty easy to implement and

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360
this is pretty easy to implement and
 

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.960
this is pretty easy to implement and
it's not really a huge deal but it's

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:34.970
it's not really a huge deal but it's
 

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.980
it's not really a huge deal but it's
just something you got to keep in mind

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:35.990
just something you got to keep in mind
 

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.810
just something you got to keep in mind
so that you make sure it works for all

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:37.820
so that you make sure it works for all
 

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.100
so that you make sure it works for all
users next not every one programs their

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.110
users next not every one programs their
 

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.080
users next not every one programs their
Android TV apps using the Android IV

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.090
Android TV apps using the Android IV
 

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.510
Android TV apps using the Android IV
api's directly so there's actually a

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:46.520
api's directly so there's actually a
 

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.340
api's directly so there's actually a
cross-platform gaming engine called

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:48.350
cross-platform gaming engine called
 

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.200
cross-platform gaming engine called
unity that's quite popular amongst game

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.210
unity that's quite popular amongst game
 

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.050
unity that's quite popular amongst game
developers and so the good news for

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.060
developers and so the good news for
 

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.730
developers and so the good news for
unity developers is that it actually

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:54.740
unity developers is that it actually
 

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.980
unity developers is that it actually
supports Android TV out of the box so

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:56.990
supports Android TV out of the box so
 

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.530
supports Android TV out of the box so
unity has support for the d-pad so all

00:15:59.530 --> 00:15:59.540
unity has support for the d-pad so all
 

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.850
unity has support for the d-pad so all
that stuff Ryan talked about with

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:00.860
that stuff Ryan talked about with
 

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.590
that stuff Ryan talked about with
handling the controls that's already

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600
handling the controls that's already
 

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.260
handling the controls that's already
dealt with for you and it deals with all

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:05.270
dealt with for you and it deals with all
 

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.180
dealt with for you and it deals with all
the manifest tweaks and over scanning

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.190
the manifest tweaks and over scanning
 

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.380
the manifest tweaks and over scanning
and making sure that everything's done

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:08.390
and making sure that everything's done
 

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.080
and making sure that everything's done
right so there's actually a collab that

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.090
right so there's actually a collab that
 

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.390
right so there's actually a collab that
we've prepared for Android TV so if you

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:13.400
we've prepared for Android TV so if you
 

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.660
we've prepared for Android TV so if you
go behind this auditorium there is a

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:16.670
go behind this auditorium there is a
 

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.940
go behind this auditorium there is a
collab area where you can go and sit

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:18.950
collab area where you can go and sit
 

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.890
collab area where you can go and sit
down and try out code and mess around we

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:20.900
down and try out code and mess around we
 

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.570
down and try out code and mess around we
have a code lab for unity there as well

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:22.580
have a code lab for unity there as well
 

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.560
have a code lab for unity there as well
that you can give a try

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:23.570
that you can give a try
 

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.170
that you can give a try
so that's the nice thing is that a lot

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:26.180
so that's the nice thing is that a lot
 

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.550
so that's the nice thing is that a lot
of these extra tools and so forth

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560
of these extra tools and so forth
 

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.710
of these extra tools and so forth
support Android TV out of the box as

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720
support Android TV out of the box as
 

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.540
support Android TV out of the box as
well so if you've got a game that does

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:31.550
well so if you've got a game that does
 

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.730
well so if you've got a game that does
3d and OpenGL and all that it just works

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:33.740
3d and OpenGL and all that it just works
 

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.490
3d and OpenGL and all that it just works
so now we're going to ryan to talk more

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:36.500
so now we're going to ryan to talk more
 

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.380
so now we're going to ryan to talk more
about the Leanback library which is a

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:38.390
about the Leanback library which is a
 

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.660
about the Leanback library which is a
very popular way of implementing really

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:40.670
very popular way of implementing really
 

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.750
very popular way of implementing really
nice TV you eyes thanks rain so you know

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:43.760
nice TV you eyes thanks rain so you know
 

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.950
nice TV you eyes thanks rain so you know
at Google we're trying to make your

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:44.960
at Google we're trying to make your
 

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.170
at Google we're trying to make your
lives easier as developers and we know

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.180
lives easier as developers and we know
 

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.490
lives easier as developers and we know
that you don't really want to implement

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:48.500
that you don't really want to implement
 

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.890
that you don't really want to implement
all this stuff yourself and so to help

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:50.900
all this stuff yourself and so to help
 

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.470
all this stuff yourself and so to help
out we created the Leanback library it

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480
out we created the Leanback library it
 

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.240
out we created the Leanback library it
has a great selection of UI components

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:55.250
has a great selection of UI components
 

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.620
has a great selection of UI components
that are specifically designed for

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.630
that are specifically designed for
 

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.900
that are specifically designed for
Android TV and these components come

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:58.910
Android TV and these components come
 

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.790
Android TV and these components come
with support for d-pad as well as

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800
with support for d-pad as well as
 

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800
with support for d-pad as well as
overscan protection already baked right

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:02.810
overscan protection already baked right
 

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.140
overscan protection already baked right
in so now I'm gonna step through some of

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.150
in so now I'm gonna step through some of
 

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.510
in so now I'm gonna step through some of
these components and and explain why you

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520
these components and and explain why you
 

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.600
these components and and explain why you
may consider using this library so the

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:10.610
may consider using this library so the
 

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.220
may consider using this library so the
first component here that I want to

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:12.230
first component here that I want to
 

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.560
first component here that I want to
discuss is this browse fragment the

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:14.570
discuss is this browse fragment the
 

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.079
discuss is this browse fragment the
Browse fragment is good for good for

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:17.089
Browse fragment is good for good for
 

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.660
Browse fragment is good for good for
well browsing right it allows you to

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:19.670
well browsing right it allows you to
 

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.520
well browsing right it allows you to
showcase all of your content in one

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:21.530
showcase all of your content in one
 

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.160

search we you can also integrate with
this universal search so this is when a

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740
this universal search so this is when a
 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.340
this universal search so this is when a
user searches from the main TV launcher

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:28.350
user searches from the main TV launcher
 

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.400
user searches from the main TV launcher
for some related content and that will

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.410
for some related content and that will
 

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.290
for some related content and that will
get surface automatically by the Android

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:33.300
get surface automatically by the Android
 

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.350
get surface automatically by the Android
system so you can imagine you get home

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360
system so you can imagine you get home
 

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.540
system so you can imagine you get home

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:38.550
you turn on the TV and you search funny
 

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.030
you turn on the TV and you search funny
movies if your app has some funny movies

you're gonna want to surface that to the
 

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.930
you're gonna want to surface that to the
user and so to integrate with search

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940
user and so to integrate with search
 

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.340
user and so to integrate with search
there's just a few things that you need

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:46.350
there's just a few things that you need
 

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:49.340
there's just a few things that you need
to do the first is implementing a

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:49.350
to do the first is implementing a
 

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.050
to do the first is implementing a
content provider and you might already

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:51.060
content provider and you might already
 

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.460
content provider and you might already
have one of these maybe you're already

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.470
have one of these maybe you're already
 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.820
have one of these maybe you're already
using one for your in-app search and so

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:54.830
using one for your in-app search and so
 

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.320
using one for your in-app search and so
you can see our documentation for all

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.330
you can see our documentation for all
 

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.450
you can see our documentation for all
the specific roads that we support but

00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460
the specific roads that we support but
 

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.060
the specific roads that we support but
the key thing here is that the provider

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:02.070
the key thing here is that the provider
 

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.860
the key thing here is that the provider
that you create you should set this

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:03.870
that you create you should set this
 

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.140
that you create you should set this
attribute exported true so that Android

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:06.150
attribute exported true so that Android
 

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.470
attribute exported true so that Android
has access to it and can query it when a

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480
has access to it and can query it when a
 

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.040
has access to it and can query it when a
universal search is made and then the

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.050
universal search is made and then the
 

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.440
universal search is made and then the
next thing is this searchable XML and

again you might already have one of

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:16.830
again you might already have one of
 

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.290
again you might already have one of
these implemented in your app already

these implemented in your app already
 

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.960
these implemented in your app already
and so what you need to do here is just

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:20.970
and so what you need to do here is just
 

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.060
and so what you need to do here is just
set this include in global search

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:23.070
set this include in global search
 

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.370
set this include in global search

I hear from developers when they're

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:11.660
I hear from developers when they're
 

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.390
I hear from developers when they're
asking about Android TV is they're like

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400
asking about Android TV is they're like
 

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.890
asking about Android TV is they're like
oh hey you know I can't develop for

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:14.900
oh hey you know I can't develop for
 

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.330
oh hey you know I can't develop for
Android TV because I don't have a device

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:16.340
Android TV because I don't have a device
 

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.940
Android TV because I don't have a device
on my desk and so while it's nice to

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:18.950
on my desk and so while it's nice to
 

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:20.530
on my desk and so while it's nice to
have a device you don't actually need

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:20.540
have a device you don't actually need
 

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.960
have a device you don't actually need
one because the emulator is actually

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:22.970
one because the emulator is actually
 

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.180
one because the emulator is actually
available to help you do your testing so

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:25.190
available to help you do your testing so
 

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.010
available to help you do your testing so
a lot of people think the emulator also

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.020
a lot of people think the emulator also
 

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.240
a lot of people think the emulator also
isn't good enough but it turns out the

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.250
isn't good enough but it turns out the
 

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.950
isn't good enough but it turns out the
emulator in Android studio is actually

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960
emulator in Android studio is actually
 

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.020
emulator in Android studio is actually
really good and so for Android TV we've

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.030
really good and so for Android TV we've
 

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.310
really good and so for Android TV we've
done a lot of work in improving its

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320
done a lot of work in improving its
 

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.530
done a lot of work in improving its
performance and so it's actually really

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:35.540
performance and so it's actually really
 

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.870
performance and so it's actually really
nice to use this for development and so

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880
nice to use this for development and so
 

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.520
nice to use this for development and so
what we're gonna do now is we're going

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:39.530
what we're gonna do now is we're going
 

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.500
what we're gonna do now is we're going
to show you a quick little demo so

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:41.510
to show you a quick little demo so
 

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.460
to show you a quick little demo so
they're gonna bring it up on the screen

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:42.470
they're gonna bring it up on the screen
 

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.130
they're gonna bring it up on the screen
there this is Ryan's laptop running the

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.140
there this is Ryan's laptop running the
 

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.890
there this is Ryan's laptop running the
emulator right now and so this emulator

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:47.900
emulator right now and so this emulator
 

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.960
emulator right now and so this emulator
here is the x86 variant so it's very

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:49.970
here is the x86 variant so it's very
 

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.970
here is the x86 variant so it's very
important that you run x86 when you're

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980
important that you run x86 when you're
 

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.000
important that you run x86 when you're
on an x86 laptop so that it doesn't have

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.010
on an x86 laptop so that it doesn't have
 

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.560
on an x86 laptop so that it doesn't have
to emulate everything completely and

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:56.570
to emulate everything completely and
 

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:57.940
to emulate everything completely and
it's also important that you have the

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:57.950
it's also important that you have the
 

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.490
it's also important that you have the
Haxton driver as well so we can see here

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:00.500
Haxton driver as well so we can see here
 

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.410
Haxton driver as well so we can see here
is Ryan's running the sample that I'll

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:02.420
is Ryan's running the sample that I'll
 

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.480
is Ryan's running the sample that I'll
give you the link to later but the

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.490
give you the link to later but the
 

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:06.460
give you the link to later but the
sample has a series of video clips and

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:06.470
sample has a series of video clips and
 

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.650
sample has a series of video clips and
he's browsing around fragments and so do

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:08.660
he's browsing around fragments and so do
 

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.490
he's browsing around fragments and so do
you want to fire up a video run so this

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:12.500
you want to fire up a video run so this
 

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.680
you want to fire up a video run so this
here shows video playback happening so

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:14.690
here shows video playback happening so
 

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.830
here shows video playback happening so
it's streaming the video

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840
it's streaming the video
 

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.080
it's streaming the video
it's decoding it playing it back within

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.090
it's decoding it playing it back within
 

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.270
it's decoding it playing it back within
the emulator so as you can see here it's

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280
the emulator so as you can see here it's
 

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.370
the emulator so as you can see here it's
very performant its decoding the video

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380
very performant its decoding the video
 

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.260
very performant its decoding the video
in real time on his laptop and so the

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.270
in real time on his laptop and so the
 

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.170
in real time on his laptop and so the
emulator is quite useful also if we look

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.180
emulator is quite useful also if we look
 

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.150
emulator is quite useful also if we look
on the right of the screen there is the

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.160
on the right of the screen there is the
 

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.360
on the right of the screen there is the
extended controls so an Android TV has

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:32.370
extended controls so an Android TV has
 

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.310
extended controls so an Android TV has
its own remote with left/right up/down

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320
its own remote with left/right up/down
 

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.150
its own remote with left/right up/down
but it also has back pause play and so

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:38.160
but it also has back pause play and so
 

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.010
but it also has back pause play and so
forth all of those controls are

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020
forth all of those controls are
 

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.350
forth all of those controls are
available on the emulator as well so you

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360
available on the emulator as well so you
 

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.180
available on the emulator as well so you
can simulate every single button press

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.190
can simulate every single button press
 

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.730
can simulate every single button press
and check that your code has all the

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740
and check that your code has all the
 

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.290
and check that your code has all the
right d-pad support and things like that

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:48.300
right d-pad support and things like that
 

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.660
right d-pad support and things like that
because not every button necessarily is

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:50.670
because not every button necessarily is
 

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.110
because not every button necessarily is
mapped to the keys so the great thing is

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120
mapped to the keys so the great thing is
 

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.450
mapped to the keys so the great thing is
that the simulator does all of the

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460
that the simulator does all of the
 

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.580
that the simulator does all of the
buttons that are available and regular

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:58.590
buttons that are available and regular
 

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.160
buttons that are available and regular
devices and you don't need to purchase a

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:01.170
devices and you don't need to purchase a
 

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.100
devices and you don't need to purchase a
physical Android TV device so this is

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.110
physical Android TV device so this is
 

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.810
physical Android TV device so this is
pretty cool and it's definitely if

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820
pretty cool and it's definitely if
 

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.160
pretty cool and it's definitely if
you're interested in doing this you

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:07.170
you're interested in doing this you
 

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.680
you're interested in doing this you
should grab the sample 5 D emulator try

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:09.690
should grab the sample 5 D emulator try
 

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.630

in the resources you can just do a

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.210
in the resources you can just do a
 

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.980

single apk so we've gone through some

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:09.990
single apk so we've gone through some
 

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.859
single apk so we've gone through some
guidelines in this talk the guidelines

00:27:12.859 --> 00:27:12.869
guidelines in this talk the guidelines
 

00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:14.330
guidelines in this talk the guidelines
are actually referenced in the

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340
are actually referenced in the
 

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.889
are actually referenced in the

documentation and there's actually a
 

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:18.710
documentation and there's actually a
link here on developer.android.com which

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720
link here on developer.android.com which
 

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.960
link here on developer.android.com which
has a complete checklist of all of the

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:20.970
has a complete checklist of all of the
 

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.700
has a complete checklist of all of the
things that are important to get your

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:22.710
things that are important to get your
 

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.639
things that are important to get your
app approved to be distributed on Google

00:27:25.639 --> 00:27:25.649
app approved to be distributed on Google
 

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:27.499
app approved to be distributed on Google
Play now it's important that you get

00:27:27.499 --> 00:27:27.509
Play now it's important that you get
 

00:27:27.509 --> 00:27:28.700
Play now it's important that you get
your app approved because if it's

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:28.710
your app approved because if it's
 

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.529
your app approved because if it's
rejected it won't be visible so it's

00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539
rejected it won't be visible so it's
 

00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:31.999
rejected it won't be visible so it's
very important that you actually think

00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:32.009
very important that you actually think
 

00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:33.320
very important that you actually think
carefully about each of the guidelines

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:33.330
carefully about each of the guidelines
 

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.149
carefully about each of the guidelines
to minimize the amount of time it takes

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159
to minimize the amount of time it takes
 

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:36.950

interface so if you've got an app that's

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820
interface so if you've got an app that's
 

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.340

that you use the Leanback library

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:01.680
that you use the Leanback library
 

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.190
that you use the Leanback library
because the Leanback gives a consistent

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200

it inspiring and it sort of gave you
some ideas as to how to think about

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820
some ideas as to how to think about
 

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.070
some ideas as to how to think about
taking your app and what would be

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080
taking your app and what would be
 

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.960
taking your app and what would be
involved in making the change it's not

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:32.970

really hard to do there's just a few

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:34.560
really hard to do there's just a few
 

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.920
really hard to do there's just a few
little things so how do we get started

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:36.930
little things so how do we get started
 

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.240
