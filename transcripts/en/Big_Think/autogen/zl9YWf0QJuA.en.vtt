00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.700
we are very unusual as a species in that

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710
we are very unusual as a species in that
 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.470
we are very unusual as a species in that
not only do we have the capacity to

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480
not only do we have the capacity to
 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.199
not only do we have the capacity to
learn many species do this a fish in the

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209
learn many species do this a fish in the
 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.180

sea learns that if it swims towards the

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
sea learns that if it swims towards the
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.820
sea learns that if it swims towards the
light it will encounter prey there we

light it will encounter prey there we
 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.439

also have the capacity for social

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449
also have the capacity for social
 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.540
also have the capacity for social
learning which itself is unusual and

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550
learning which itself is unusual and
 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.550
learning which itself is unusual and
interesting that is we can learn from

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560
interesting that is we can learn from
 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.140
interesting that is we can learn from
each other and social learning is

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150
each other and social learning is
 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.409
each other and social learning is
extremely efficient for example I can

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419
extremely efficient for example I can
 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.960
extremely efficient for example I can
put my hand in the fire and learn that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970
put my hand in the fire and learn that
 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.419
put my hand in the fire and learn that
that's hot and pull my hand out so I

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429
that's hot and pull my hand out so I
 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.610
that's hot and pull my hand out so I
have gotten some benefit of knowledge

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620
have gotten some benefit of knowledge
 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.920
have gotten some benefit of knowledge
but I've paid a price or I could watch

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930
but I've paid a price or I could watch
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.920
but I've paid a price or I could watch
you put your hand in the fire get almost

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930
you put your hand in the fire get almost
 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.630
you put your hand in the fire get almost
as much benefit learning that fire is

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640
as much benefit learning that fire is
 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000
as much benefit learning that fire is
dangerous and pay none of the price so

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010
dangerous and pay none of the price so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.310
social learning and imitative learning
is extremely efficient but we not only

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320
is extremely efficient but we not only
 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.070
is extremely efficient but we not only
do that we teach each other we

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080
do that we teach each other we
 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.560

in fact this aspect of our species lies

in fact this aspect of our species lies
 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.499
in fact this aspect of our species lies
at the core of our capacity for culture

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509
at the core of our capacity for culture
 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.570
at the core of our capacity for culture
which is the capacity to transmit

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580
which is the capacity to transmit
 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.560
which is the capacity to transmit
knowledge across place and time so we

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570
knowledge across place and time so we
 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.990
knowledge across place and time so we
carry with us the benefits of all the
