00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.870
about the Islamic state. A story ripped from
the headlines!

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.720
Mr. Green? Wait. No, no, no, no this
is not history this is news and also for me

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.690
it’s not even news - it’s the future.
Yeah, Me from the Past, it turns out that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.750
history is a continuous process, and that
even current events have a history.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.020
All right, let’s begin with the headlines.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.540
In 2014 ISIS – the Islamic State In Iraq
and Syria, also known as ISIL and Islamic

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.900
State, and many other things. Anyway, they
declared a caliphate in the territory that

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.310
the group controls, prompting many Americans
to wonder what a Caliphate is.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.460
Well, if you’ve seen our episode on the
emergence of Islam, the caliphate is an Islamic

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.050
state, modeled on the original Islamic community
that was founded by the prophet Muhammad in

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.160
the 7th century.
Now Muhammad was not a caliph, because the

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.070
word means successor and they were the successors
to Muhammad.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.149
But the first four political leaders who led
the community and turned it into an empire

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.249
have come to be known as the Four Rightly
Guided caliphs.

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:12.539
And when groups like ISIS that are trying
to reestablish this kind of government look

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.280
back on it they see it as being kind of the
golden age.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.450
That this was a time of not just of growth
for the Islamic empire but also of political

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.679
stability and unity.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.299
Which as it happens it really wasn’t. Like
even under the Four Rightly Guided caliphs

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.439
the Islamic world was tremendously diverse
and had huge disagreements.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.450
I mean of the Four Rightly Guided caliphs,
three were assassinated.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.560
But anyway, the ideal version of that type
of state is what ISIS and some other Islamists

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.740
mean when they talk about reconstructing a
caliphate although what the boundaries of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.509
a modern-day Caliphate might be are far from
clear.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.200
I mean are you going to try to include Indonesia,
but anyway, according to historian Michael

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.340
Cook, “the restoration of the caliphate
is a political ideal for many Islamists – and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.189
for some a political project,”
But I want to be clear, that is not the case

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.499
for the vast majority of Muslims.
So when I use the term Islamism I mean something

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.539
very specific. For me, Islamism is the idea
that Islam can be the basis of government;

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.430
it’s not the same as fundamentalism, although
it’s often related to it.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.750
And it’s certainly not the same thing as
Islam - which is a diverse and complicated

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.700
and world wide religious tradition.
Now, Islamism is a potent political force,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.940
but it’s a relatively recent one, and in
many ways it developed as a response to our

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.860
old friend, Western-style nationalism.
That said, the idea that Islam can guide nation

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.310
states or new kinds of states is much older
than, you know, 2001. But it became much more

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.180
relevant to Americans then with the terrorist
attacks in New York and Washington.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.270
Since then there has been more and more attention
paid to the argument that Islam and Western

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.970
civilization were at-best incompatible and
at-worst locked in a mortal clash of civilizations.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.820
That clash of civilizations idea has become
so ingrained that even though I don’t really

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.190
agree with it i think we need to at least
acknowledge what we’re talking about when

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.030
we talk about us and them.
Us, usually refers to European style nation

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.980
states such as those which became dominant
in the 19th century. These states tend to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.980
value democracy or at least pluralism, and,
to varying degrees, they espouse political

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.230
values such as egalitarianism and individualism.
National identity in these states has at least

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.510
traditionally been in a sense ethnic – based
on some sense of shared language and culture

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.590
if not exactly kinship – and it’s secular
rather than religious.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.180
And then the arguments goes that the Islamic
world is the opposite of this, but I am not

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.810
convinced that that’s accurate.
For instance, there are lots of religious

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.250
connections in European style nation states and
there are lots of conversations about strengthening

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.450
those religious connections or even making
laws according to religious dictates.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.770
And in the Islamic world there are lots and
lots of nation states.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.140
But let’s start with the idea that the Islamists
are out of step with the modern political

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.010
reality of the nation state. Let’s go to
the Thought Bubble.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.110
So Islam is a universal religion that is supposed
to transcend ethnic identity. According to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.370
the Quran, “The believers indeed are brothers.”
(Q49:10)

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.150
The universal nature of Islam didn’t mean
that ethnicity didn’t matter at all of course;

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.000
it did. Early on and for a long time Arab
ethnicity was privileged in the Islamic world

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.400
and this was especially true during the period
of conquest. This was despite Muhammad saying

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.040
“Truly the Arab has no superiority over
the non-Arab, nor the non-Arab over the Arab,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.010
nor the black over the white, nor the white
over the black, except in piety.”

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.880
But their amazingly rapid and far reaching
conquest granted the Arabs huge prestige that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.500
lasted until the 18th century.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.200
Now, from the beginning being a Muslim meant
being part of a political community, because

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.000
unlike Jesus or the Buddha, Muhammad was also
a political leader in addition being a religious

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.090
one. But at least to an extent the tight connection
between political and religious identity really

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.160
ended with the assassination of the Fourth
Rightly Guided Caliph Ali. According to the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.270
writer Tamim Ansary, “After Ali’s death,
the khalifate was just an empire.” But as

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.310
the empire grew and became more diverse, it became
impossible to hold it together as a political unit.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.130
So, even though the idea of a caliphate doesn’t
square so well with western notions of ethnically

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.780
homogenous nation states, ethnicity has always
mattered in the Islamic world, as we can see

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.040
if we go to Turkey, or Egypt, or Pakistan.
In each of those places, the experience of

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.080
being a Muslim is affected by the experience
of one’s ethnicity.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.590
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So this idea that the
Islamic empire wasn’t always a caliphate

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.530
for much of its history, was just an empire
is really important.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.340
Because it gets to how not-different ways
of organizing people are when it comes to

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.230
like us and them.
Now I’m not trying to make a false equivalence

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.910
or say that all people are the same or whatever
But like let’s look at a defining western

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.330
political value - egalitarianism. In its earliest
incarnations, Islam was unusually egalitarian,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.750
especially for its time.
The religion structurally avoids hierarchy

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.860
except perhaps based on piety. The Quran (49:13)
states: “the noblest among you in the sight

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.260
of God is the most godfearing of you,” and
there’s a quote from Muhammad that “people

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.480
are equals like the teeth of a comb.”
To which I say. What’s a comb?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.280
Also, Islamic law, unlike, say Hammurabi’s
code, doesn’t make class distinctions among

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.460
Muslims, only between Muslims and non-Muslims,
and Muhammad is quoted as saying that the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.930
blood of believers is always of equal value.
In fact, that Islam lacks caste and formal

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.930
aristocracy was noted by many Europeans, who
thought it was weird.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.669
Now this canonical idea egalitarianism is
not the same thing as equality - at least

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.689
the equality that we’ve come to think about
in the present day.

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.720
Like in the Quran, and in the sayings of Muhammad
called Hadiths, Women and men are alike in

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.010
the performance of prayer and their obligation
to pay the alms tax and their expectations

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.190
of eternal life in paradise
And women did have some inheritance rights

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.700
in the early Islamic community that they did
not enjoy in pre-Islamic Arabic communities.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.400
And that they also wouldn’t have had in
Byzantium or, god forbid, Rome.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.389
And then there’s the inequality between
Muslims and ‘unbelievers’ which is pretty

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.650
well known; like other “peoples of the book”
Christians and Jews, could live and work in

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.900
Muslim empires provided they paid a special
tax called the jizya.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.780
Which was far better than the life of a Muslim
under Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.870
And then there’s the issue of slavery, which
the Quran accepts. In general Muslims have

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.330
avoided enslaving other Muslims, showing that
there is a sense of brotherhood and solidarity

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.190
among believers, but overall to quote a historian
“Islamic egalitarianism was … limited

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.610
to free Muslim males.”
Of course, if you’ve watched our US History

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.190
series you may remember that early American
egalitarianism was limited to like land-owning

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.010
Christian males.
My point here, is that if you look for historical

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.710
precedents, you can generally find them. That’s
true in the Islamic world, it’s also true

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.190
in the rest of the world.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.270
Now today, in Europe and the United States,
most citizens expect their states to be, in

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.889
at least some degree, democratic, and republican,
and constitutional.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.979
So when people in the west look at the early
Islamic empire we have a way of imaging Caliphs

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:47.870
as kings because, like, you know, we had kings.
But Caliphs were important in different ways,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.419
for starters, they were the successor to the
prophet.

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:54.199
Now, maybe that’s similar to what the Roman
Catholic papacy became over time but it’s

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.759
not like a king - except for the king of England.
King Henry VIII, founder of my church, who

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:02.839
was like “I need to be the head of the church
so that I can get divorced.”

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.780
But this combination of religious and political
authority is important as is, at least initially,

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.110
there was no hereditary succession of caliphs.
And then there’s the concept of bay’a

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.150
which is a kind of political allegiance, like
according to Michael Cook, “an agreement

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.090
is made between the future caliph and the
future subject whereby each party is to have

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.509
specified rights and duties.”
A closely related theme is shura, “the duty

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:29.149
of the caliph to consult with others before
making his decision.”

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:33.620
Like, according to tradition, when Abu Bakr
accepted the role of the first Caliph he claimed

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.830
that Muslims had no duty to obey him if he
disobeyed God and the Prophet.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.450
Now that’s not democracy, but it is limited
rule and it gives people some participation

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.720
in the government.
And then there’s another Western value that

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.060
is often bandied about as something that isn’t
part of the Islamic world - freedom.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:55.420
Islam, as you may know, means “submission.”
And a Muslim is a person who submits to God.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.970
And to some Westerns that seems like the opposite
of freedom.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.779
But the tradition within Islam, is that by
releasing people from domination by other

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:06.759
people, and making them servants of God - there
is freedom.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.640
Freedom is a famously abstract concept, but
if we think of it as the opposite of slavery,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.010
then being free from having to serve other
people is freedom.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:21.120
That said, in contemporary Islamism, political freedom
is not generally held in particularly high esteem.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.730
Which is one of the reasons why Islamists
were less relevant in the Arab Spring uprisings

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.040
of 2011 than people tend to think.
But in at least one way, the caliphate can

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.600
be thought of as enshrining republican (with
a little “r”) values; Islamism emphasizes

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.529
the rule of law and that even the caliph is
subject to it. Since ultimate sovereignty

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:46.720
belongs only to God, men to quote Michael
Cook, “are not entitled to exercise lordship

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.320
over each other.”
And the much talked about Shari’a law, coming

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.850
from a source outside the political process
(whether that’s God or religious scholars) acts as

00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:00.860
a huge check on rulers becoming dictators.
Right. like Iran’s government has many problems,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.110
but its president is not a dictator.
But that same complete sovereignty of God

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.709
over the people makes it difficult for Islamists
to embrace democracy, because it’s based

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.360
on the idea that the people themselves are
sovereign.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.170
And the most radical Islamists, like Ayman
al Zawahiri of Al-Qaeda really do hate democracy.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.310
He called democracy, “a new religion that
deifies the masses.” And the completely

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:27.020
extreme and absolutely horrifying Boko Haram
in Nigeria have exclaimed that they, “will

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:32.520
never accept any system of government apart
from one stipulated by Islam,” and will,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.830
“keep on fighting against democracy, capitalism,
socialism and whatever.”

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.420
Yes, the “and whatever” is a quote. If
you belong to a group that is fighting blank,

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.209
blank, blank, and whatever - you need to leave
that group.

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:50.380
So it’s easy and relatively common for people
in the West to say that Islam is inimical

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.800
to political values like freedom, equality
and democracy.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.580
And when we talk about certain groups of radical
Islamists, that’s true.

00:10:57.589 --> 00:11:02.360
But in the West we also really, really struggle
to see the other complexely, and to understand

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.480
the incredible diversity in response to the
revelation of the Quran.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.180
In my opinion, the clash of civilizations model
oversimplifies the world into this group and

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.550
that group, and imagines that this group sees
the world only that way and that group sees

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:21.100
the world only this way. In fact, it’s complicated.
For one thing, modern Islamism itself, is

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.980
a very recent phenomenon, and in large part
it’s a reaction to western imperialism and

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.280
nationalism, and it doesn’t always reflect
the ideas of Islam OR Islamic history.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.820
Humans have a storied tradition of calling
upon certain facets of our history to inspire

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:40.029
us toward what we already kind of want.
And those seeking to recreate the caliphate

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.430
want a more powerful and unified Arab world,
if not, an Islamic world.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.100
And so they look toward history for inspiration,
taking parts and leaving many others.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.690
What really happened, is that for the most
part European style nationalism took hold

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:57.220
in the Islamic world at the same time it rose
in Europe, as the creation of Turkey shows

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.360
quite clearly.
But in trying to understand the allure of

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.589
the caliphate it’s important to understand
that Islam is not just a religion. From the

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:08.200
beginning, it was a civilization.
As the historian Tamim Ansary wrote: “Islam

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.130
might just as validly be considered as one
item in a class whose other items include

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.839
communism, parliamentary democracy, fascism,
and the like, because Islam is a social project

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:24.660
like those others, an idea for how politics
and the economy ought to be managed, a complete

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.190
system of civil and criminal law.”
But it’s also a very diverse system shaped

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.120
by everything around it and everything inside
of it - like any civilization.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.370
So when we try to discuss a topic as complex
and charged as contemporary Islamic thought

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.959
and practice and political worldviews, we
don’t just need to be sure that we have

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:47.820
some sense of history. We also need to be
sure that we’re all talking about the same

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.240
thing.
There is nothing bright about the lines between

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.750
politics and religion and history and nation.
Thank you for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.959
