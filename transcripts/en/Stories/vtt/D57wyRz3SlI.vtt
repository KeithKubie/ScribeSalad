00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:04.580
[SLIDE CLICKS]

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:07.540
NARRATOR: This is an image
of the surface of Mars, taken

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.500
by NASA's Viking One
spacecraft in 1976.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.960
The picture is a triumph
of human innovation.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.740
We built a piece
of technology that

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.300
traveled all the way to
Mars, took a picture,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.360
and beamed it all the
way back to Earth.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.410
But that's not why
this picture is famous.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.380
It's famous because we all
see a face, right there,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.800
staring back at us.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.920
It's known as the
Face on Mars, and when

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.010
NASA released it to the world,
a lot of people freaked out.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.290
There's still an entire
conspiracy theory section

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.040
of the internet devoted to it.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.220
But all of that is
pretty easy to debunk.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.360
This is not an ancient
monument to some Martian god,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.940
nor is it the mask left over
from a giant race of aliens.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.600
This face was created
because of the combination

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.880
of shadows and
missing image data,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.520
known as bit errors-- which
comes with the territory when

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.100
beaming images back from
hundreds of thousands of miles

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.900
away.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.440
These bit errors helped form
that deep and creepy the eye

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.250
socket.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.440
You can see these black
holes all over the image.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.480
But releasing the simple
explanation didn't stop people

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.470
from freaking out, so
NASA returned to Mars

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.100
to capture more
updated images, in part

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.140
to silence the skeptics.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.580
Here's a photo from 1998, and
here's another one from 2001.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.960
No face, no monument,
no proof of alien life.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.890
Just a boring Mars hill,
something many NASA scientists

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.034
compare to the buttes
of the American West.

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:34.950
But there's still something
more going on here

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.260
than missing pixels
and dark shadows.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.290
Something called
pareidolia, it's

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.980
the phenomenon of
finding meaning

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.370
in an image or sound, where
that meaning doesn't exist.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.300
Like animals in the
clouds, profiles

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.530
in rocks, or satanic
messages in pop songs.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.540
This happens in part
because people see and hear

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.240
what they want to see and hear.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960
And people really want
there to be aliens.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.640
This has been
going on for years.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.310
Nikola Tesla even claimed
to hear communications

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.420
from the red planet.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.190
People today still
scour Mars rover photos

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.340
for any proof of alien life.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.590
It's hard work, and it has given
us a lot of crazy conspiracies

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.540
to deal with.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.120
There's the Mars iguana, an
ancient helmet, and the finger

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.560
bone of a deceased alien.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280
And I say it's hard work,
because when NASA delivers

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.320
high resolution
images like this,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.830
someone has to
meticulously scour them,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.910
zooming in until they
find their proof.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.500
Be it an artifact, a space man,
or the ruins of a civilization,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.830
or this guy.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.510
Wait, that is definitely
a guy walking on Mars.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.490
Mars has a Sasquatch.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.540
This is all the conspiracy
theories rolled into one.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.374
This Happened Here aims to
share compelling photos,

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:44.540
and the stories behind them.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.730
If you liked this video,
be sure to watch this one

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.520
on what it's like to take a
selfie on the edge of space.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.165
MAN: Really, in the space
suit, it was deathly quiet.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.291
And I could look up to
the blackness of sky.

00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.540
NARRATOR: Thanks for watching.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.890
