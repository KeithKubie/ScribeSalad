00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.490
Vsauce! Kevin here. Let’s split a pizza.
I’ll eat one half and you eat the other.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.750
I’m going to be using a laser guide and
a protractor to make sure that it’s perfectly,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.150
mathematically equal so that no one is complaining
that one of us got more pizza than the other

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.150
one

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.600
Okay! Here we go.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.970
There we go! Alright, let's just get this
cutting board out of the way. Perfect! These

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.420
are two exactly equal halves. So grab your
slices! Alright, I know that it doesn't look

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.780
like it but we can prove it mathematically,
but before we do that let’s analyze how

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.950
pizzas are traditionally cut… and how they
could be infinitely cut.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.390
Pizza is usually a cut right down the center
through its diameter, then cut again at a

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.290
90 degree angle perpendicular to the first
cut. Two more cuts bisect each 90 to a 45

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.061
to make 8 equal slices. That feeds 4 people
or 2 people equally… and maybe 3 if one

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:10.500
of them just isn’t as hungry. But what about
cutting one pizza to feed 13 people? Or 31?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.619
Slices won’t work. We need monohedral disk
tiles.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.641
By cutting the pizza into a pinwheel you can
get twelve identically-shaped wedges. Monohedral

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:26.790
tiling means every tile is the same shape.
In 2015, mathematicians Joel Haddley and Stephen

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.810
Worsley found you can create infinite families
of monohedral disk tilings by subtiling forever.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.890
The actual math proofs on this get rather
complicated but basically, there’s no mathematical

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.880
end to the pattern of pizza wedges you could
make. But obviously dividing up a real pizza

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.159
this way for little Billy’s birthday would
be… impractical.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.850
The pizza that I cut however is the same exact
method pizzerias use everyday... I just moved

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.060
the center. Divisors Of A Circle was a problem
proposed by L.J. Upton in 1967 and solved

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.810
in volume 41 of Mathematics Magazine challenging
readers to show that alternating divisions

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.040
of a circle with 4 lines converging on concurrent
point O add up to half of the circle. Michael

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.450
Goldberg solved Upton’s problem without
using calculus.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.370
In 1994, a follow-up piece in Mathematics
Magazine explained how this problem demonstrates

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.790
a fair way to split up pizza, and the “Pizza
Theorem” was born: If a pizza is divided

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.100
into eight slices by making cuts at 45 degree
angles from any point in the pizza, then the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.640
sums of the areas of alternate slices are
equal. That’s why if we top alternating

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.890
slices with green peppers and yellow peppers
it becomes clear we have two equal halves.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.360
We can do the math but a ‘proof without
words’ is considered by many to be the highest,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.570
most elegant form of proof. And our proof
is in the pizza.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.099
We’ll label our pizza slices A through H…
and then we’ll represent each slice as two

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.540
equal shapes. We’ll clone the four smaller
slices, while the four larger ones will be

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.460
reduced to make up for that duplication. They’ll
be weird shapes, but they’ll be equal. We’ll

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.629
label them with a capital letter and lowercase
letter to differentiate which slice is yours

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:33.549
and which slice is mine. So here’s A. Here’s
B.This is C. D. E. F. G. And finally H.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:41.480
So the large slices, G, H, A and B are divided
into two equal wedges and the small slices

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.200
F, E, D and C are duplicated within the pizza.
Proving that we split our original pizza perfectly

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.630
for two people.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.020
This will work regardless of the concurrent
point on the disk or pizza. Here’s a wonderful

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.939
proof without words visualizer created by
Christian Lawson-Perfect where you can move

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.450
the interior point and instantly see the different
slices that fulfill the Pizza Theorem.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.920
The most delicious theorem of all time.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.400
What began as an obscure math problem dividing
a circle in Mathematics Magazine, has continued

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.870
to be refined and reimagined 50 years later.
Which is impressive no matter how you slice

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.870
it.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.010
And as always, thanks for watching.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:42.790
This pizza is three days old.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.120
