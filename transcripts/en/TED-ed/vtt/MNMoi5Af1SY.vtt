00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.580
The most important walls in western history aren't even in the West.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.480
They surround the modern city of Istanbul, Constantinople as the Romans called it.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.779
And for a thousand years, the fate of Europe depended on them.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.612
Constantinople was designed to be the center of the world.

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:37.730
When the frontiers of the Roman Empire began to crumble in the 4th Century,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.497
the capital was moved to the cultured, wealthy, and still stable East.

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:48.248
There, at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, the hub of the major trade routes of the ancient world,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.213
the Emperor Constantine built his city.

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:54.330
This was the city of libraries and universities,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.696
20 times the size of London or Paris at the time.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:02.930
It contained the priceless knowledge of the classical world which was fading in the West.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.829
To protect this masterpiece from its many enemies,

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.814
Constantine's successors built the finest defensive fortifications ever made.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:15.862
The first line of protection was a moat 60 feet wide and 22 feet deep,

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:18.897
stretching all four miles from coast to coast.

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:22.430
Pipes from inside the city could fill it at the first sight of the enemy,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.700
and a short wall protected archers who could fire at the soaked soldiers trying to swim across.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.213
Those who were lucky enough to clear the moat had to contend with an unceasing barrage from the 27 foot outer wall above.

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:41.440
Arrows, spears, or far worse, Greek fire -- an ancient form of napalm that would ignite on contact

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.008
and couldn't be extinguished by water -- would rain down on them.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.973
Squads of Roman defenders would carry portable flame throwers,

00:01:48.973 --> 00:01:51.907
spraying anyone trying to climb out of the moat.

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:57.140
The terrified victims would leap back, only to find that they still burned underwater.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.623
At times, the Romans would also mount siphons onto the ramparts,

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:04.690
and launch clay pots full of Greek fire from catapults at an invading army.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.755
The front lines would turn into an inferno,

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.070
making it appear as if the earth itself was on fire.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.054
If, by some miracle, the outer wall was compromised,

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:18.154
attackers would be faced with the final defense: the great inner wall.

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:21.872
These walls were wide enough to have four men ride side by side,

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:25.287
allowing troops to be rushed wherever they were needed.

00:02:25.287 --> 00:02:30.804
Attilla the Hun, destroyer of civilizations, who named himself the Scourge of God,

00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:33.671
took one look at them and turned around.

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.856
The Avars battled the walls uselessly til their catapults ran out of rocks.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:41.904
The Turks tried to tunnel under them, but found the foundations too solid.

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:44.606
The Arabs tried to starve the city into submission,

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.122
but ran out of food themselves and had to resort to cannibalism.

00:02:48.122 --> 00:02:52.273
It took the guns of the modern world to finally bring them down.

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:55.938
In 1453, the Turks brought their super weapon:

00:02:55.938 --> 00:03:01.506
a monster cannon that could fire a 15 hundred pound stone ball over a mile.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.922
Together with more than a hundred smaller guns,

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:07.571
they kept up a steady bombardment day and night.

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.238
A section of the old walls collapsed, but even in their death throes they proved formidable.

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:16.255
The rubble absorbed the shock of the cannonballs better than the solid wall.

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:21.422
It took a month and a half of continuous blasting to finally open a breach.

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:25.305
The last Roman Emperor, Constantine the 11th, drew his sword

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.355
and jumped into the gap to stop the onrushing horde,

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:31.222
disappearing into legend.

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:35.238
The city was taken, and the Roman Empire finally disappeared.

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:38.487
But those broken walls had one last gift.

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:44.920
As the survivors fled the doomed city, they brought with them their precious books and their ancient traditions.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.773
They traveled west to Italy, reintroduced the Greek language and learning to western Europe, and ignited the Renaissance.

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:59.038
Thanks to Constantinople's walls, that pile of brick and marble that guarded them for so long,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.422
we still have our classical past.
