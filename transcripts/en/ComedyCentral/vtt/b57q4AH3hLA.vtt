00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.951
And when you're in adrenaline
junkie,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.786
it's a weird addiction to have.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.754

things intentionally

Here is the time that--this is
probably the closest call

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.476
that I've ever had, and I do
want to say,

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.313
I do not blame LSD

it's--first off,

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:14.800
I love psychedelics.

Hour three of an LSD trip, I'm
like,

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.817
"You mean I get to feel like
this

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.988

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.792
[laughter]

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:42.161
Hour ten, I'm like, "Yeah, I

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:53.072
[laughter]

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:56.375
So one drop--

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:58.311
it's usually on a sugar cube
or a piece of paper

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.846
as a hit; that's, like, you're
standard dose.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.485
One hit and you remember how
amazing trees are.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.022
You...you forgot.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:11.257
[laughter]

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.593
You used to know.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.061
When you were three years old,

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.929
you knew just how amazing trees
were.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:21.234
You just got a little
too complacent with life.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:23.736
Have a hit of LSD one day, hit
the old rest button,

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.371
and you're like, "Oh, damn, are
they breathing?

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.572
That's amazing."

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.575
[laughter]

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:33.713
That's one hit; two hits, the
trees remember

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.181
now amazing you are.

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:40.219
[laughter]

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.421
Three hits, that's kind of
getting into dangerous terr--

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:44.724
you do three hits of acid,
you're like, "Damn.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.592
Now I've got to learn how to
paint."

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.794
[laughter]

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:53.799
"I have no natural artistic
abilities."

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:55.801
Four hits, you think you're a
wizard.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.303
You start dressing like one.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.172
You have no powers.

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.742
You're super annoying to
everybody.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.911
And so this was in

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:07.313
my hometown
of La Crosse, Wisconsin,

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.949
on the border
of Minnesota and Iowa.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.719
And I had two hits of acid,

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:18.824
and it--it was reasonable.

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:20.426
Here's what's not reasonable.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.927
I went to a bar,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.264
like a real divey,
drunkard bar.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.999
You don't want to be around
a bunch of, like,

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:30.336
sloppy drunk people
when you're tripping.

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:31.837
Like, sloppy drunk people,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.172
if they figure out
that you're tripping,

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.974
they'll always try
to mess with you

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:38.911
in this weird way of how
they think tripping works.

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:41.113
"Whoa, is this crazy?

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.982
"We're not even touching you.

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:45.818
Whoa!
Is that weird?"

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.321
"Oh, yeah,
that's weird all right.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:49.855
"Yeah.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:52.525
"You're gonna want
to stop doing that now.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:55.161
You look like an idiot."

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:58.297
So we're trying--
me and my four other friends

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.166
also did two hits,
but we're all trying to keep it

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.302
on the down low so we don't
have to deal with that.

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:06.972
And what happened was,

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:11.711
my acid dealer's dealer
walked into the bar.

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.846
And this is like the guy
that makes LSD

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.051
for the state of Wisconsin
at the time.

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.953
And I recognized him.

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:22.488
He was a couple years
ahead of me in high school.

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.056
So I was like,
"Hey, Ryan, what's up, man?"

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.291
And he comes over
and he's like,

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.793
"I'm a lizard!

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:30.162
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!"

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:33.199
[laughter]

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.736
And I go, "Oh, dear.
Uh..."

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.337
I don't know
how many hits that is.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.006
That's--

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.542
That's a lot.
That's--

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:45.745
Cover blown, I guess.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:49.248
[laughter]

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:53.853
And we're panicking, 'cause we
just took two hits of LSD.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.322
LSD takes, like, an hour to
kick in,

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.225
and you never know what any one
trip is gonna be like.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.527
This is the problem with LSD
being illegal is,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.697
it's on the--you know, it's on
the underground scene

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.369
of people--it takes a real
intense knowledge of chemistry

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.004
to make good LSD.

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:15.408
You can't just look up at
couple YouTube videos

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.844
and be like, "Oh, I'll just put
in some paprika,

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:20.413
'cause I don't have the other
thing."

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.715
Like, it doesn't--it just
doesn't work like that.

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:26.719
And so you never knew what any
one trip was gonna be like.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:28.554
This dude made our acid.

00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:29.889
He's a lizard now.

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:33.125
[laughter]

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:35.127
That's...

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.731
It's not at all the experience
we were looking for.

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.735
We--we were hoping for a little
bonding, you know,

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:46.739
and maybe some deep
conversations.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:50.409
You don't want to be a reptile.

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:52.044
And, I mean, I get it.

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:54.413
You can get in some, like,
weird thought tunnels

00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:56.449
when you're trip--it's one of
the side effects--

00:06:56.482 --> 00:07:00.119
or one of the beautiful things
about psychedelics is--

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.721
one of the best lessons that
you can ever learn from them

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:04.323
is to question everything.

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.560
That's one of the most
important lessons in life,

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.994
is to question everything.

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.429
I know some of you are
skeptical.

00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:12.131
You're like, "Question
everything?"

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:14.934
Now you're getting it,
but...

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.603
[laughter]

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:23.843
But, like, there's nothing
inherently wrong

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:27.613
with asking yourself, "Am I a
lizard?"

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:31.250
[laughter]

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:34.453
So long as immediately
afterwards you conclude,

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:36.956
"Nope, not a lizard.
That's a weird idea

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.491
"popped in my head.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:41.293
"What was that about?

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:42.361
"Am I a giraffe?

00:07:42.394 --> 00:07:44.697
"No, of course not, not a
giraffe.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.965
"Am I a human?
Oh, yeah.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:47.333
"I guess I am a human.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.168
What does it mean to be
human?"

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:50.803
And then you jump down that
little rabbit hole,

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.471
and that's how you have a
successful trip.

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.807
Well, this poor fellow got
himself stuck in some

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.343
weird lizard universe.

00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:01.881
We don't know how to get him
out of it.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.149
And then he opens up
his jacket

00:08:04.182 --> 00:08:07.219
and he pulls out this vial
of liquid acid.

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:11.357
Like, 200, 300 hits of liquid
acid.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.325
And he starts unscrewing the
cap.

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:15.828
And he pulls out this big old
dropper

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.830
full of liquid acid.

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.298
And we're like, "Uh-oh."

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:24.069
[laughter]

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:29.475
Um...what are you doing
with that life sentence

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.377
in a public space?

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.814
[laughter]

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:38.183
<i> - And he's like, ""I'm a
 lizard!</i>

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:39.752
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!"

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:44.023
And then he sprays acid
on his lizard tongue.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:46.926
Guys, I don't know how many
hits

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:50.229
is in a spray of LSD.

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:54.366
He was already a lizard.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:58.203
[laughter]

00:08:58.236 --> 00:09:00.472
Then he dips back in for number
two.

00:09:00.505 --> 00:09:03.776
We're like, "Ohhh-ohh-ohh,
hey, hey."

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.611
We got him to stop.

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.913
We were like, "No," we talked
him out of it.

00:09:07.946 --> 00:09:09.281
He had just ordered beers.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:11.216
We had four beers up on the
bar.

00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:14.520
And so instead of spraying
another spray on his tongue,

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:18.757
he just sprayed
all of our beers with acid

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.461
and then crawled
out of the bar

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:25.864
like a lizard,

00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:28.867
and we never saw him again.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.637
[laughter]

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.072
In life, I mean.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.473
[laughter]

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.575
[laughs]

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:38.110
Fun update to that story.

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:42.147
I actually--I did look him up
on Facebook

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.049
to if he's still alive or
whatever.

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.551
He is.
He's still alive and well.

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:49.588
He's actually in the military
now.

00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:51.757
Yeah, you're gonna need some
structure in your life

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.328
after an experience like that.

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:59.264
Works out well for the
military as well.

00:09:59.297 --> 00:10:00.766
We do a lot of stuff in the
Middle East.

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:02.568
We probably do need
reptile-like people

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.803
that are acclimated for those
temperatures.

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:08.474
[laughter]

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:11.610
But and we're all sitting there
looking at these beers like,

00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:14.947
"Oh, my...how much acid was
that?

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.982
"That's, like--we already did
two.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:20.252
"That's, like, really the
limit.

00:10:20.285 --> 00:10:23.856
"What was that, like,
8, 20 hits in each beer?

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:26.291
"That was, like,
an insane amount.

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:29.128
We can't--no--we can't."

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.263
[laughter]

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:34.667
But you would hate to waste
that $1.50 draught beer.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.968
Wouldn't you?

00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:39.872
[laughter]

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.207
And we drank those beers,
we did,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.110
and believe it or not,
we had a fantastic time.

00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:47.646
It was--it was terrific.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.849
At one point,
I put on some Rollerblades,

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:54.353
went to a skate park.

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:56.188
A lot of people
don't know this,

00:10:56.221 --> 00:11:00.325
Rollerblading can in fact
be the second most painful

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:02.061
homosexual act.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:05.964
[laughter]

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:09.835
The first of course,
burning in hell.

00:11:09.868 --> 00:11:14.707
[laughter]

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.777
But...

00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:26.351
It was--
it was going great.

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:29.088
There was, like,
a glowing red line

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.156
in front of everything
I needed to do,

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.691
and I was doing half-pipes.

00:11:32.724 --> 00:11:35.494
And I'd never done anything.
It was amazing.

00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:38.230
And I had such a great time.

00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:39.531
We decided
we were gonna go

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:43.936
and see--
see a sunrise.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.505
And we had--

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:48.941
we scooped up a designated
driver.

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.877
One of my friend's girlfriends
is gonna drive us up there.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.914
And we walked, like, a mile to
my car.

00:11:55.947 --> 00:11:58.717
We get to my car, and she's
like, "Oh, I can't drive stick.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.452
I can't drive manual."

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:04.022
And I'm like, "Well, walked all
the way here.

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:05.691
"It has been eight hours.

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:08.560
I did just pull off
some Tony Hawk shit."

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:10.262
[laughter]

00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:11.730
"I bet I'm okay to drive.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.265
"I'll tell you what, why don't
you sit

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.801
"in the passenger seat,
navigate,

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.035
"tell me if I'm screwing up.

00:12:17.068 --> 00:12:18.737
"If I am, I'll just pull over.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.439
We'll call it there."

00:12:20.472 --> 00:12:23.041
So that's the deal, so she gets
in the passenger seat,

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:24.610
and I'm driving.

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:26.812
Three tripping dudes
in the back,

00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:28.747
and they're just
freaking out the whole--like,

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.283
"What are you drive--
Oh, this is crazy!

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:32.951
I can't believe you're--"

00:12:32.984 --> 00:12:35.988
They made some solid points.
I'm gonna be honest.

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:38.590
[laughter]

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:40.159
But everything's going fine.

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:41.660
And then we took some weird
turn.

00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:43.262
Like, I thought I knew where I
was going,

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.930
and then now I'm off in some
area

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:46.465
that I hadn't been to before.

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:49.902
And they had finally calmed
down in back,

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.437
but because they'd been giving
me such a hard time

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.107
and stressing me out, I thought
I'd get them back,

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.409
and how I decided to do that
was,

00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:59.778
there was just this long
straightaway,

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:04.249
and I was, like, I'll just
floor it down

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:06.618
this straightaway.

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:08.420
It was like--it was one of
those hills--

00:13:08.453 --> 00:13:10.022
I don't know if you've ever
been in, like,

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:12.090
the backcountry road where,
like, there's an incline

00:13:12.123 --> 00:13:14.793
and then there's, like, a hill,
and you fly up,

00:13:14.826 --> 00:13:17.429
and you got, "Whoo," and you
get a little thing in your--

00:13:17.462 --> 00:13:19.464
your belly, a little
roller-coaster thing.

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:20.933
That's all I wanted.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.534
And then we're gonna watch the
sunset.

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:24.803
So I'm, like, flying up this
hill.

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:26.705
And I'm going, like, 60, then
70,

00:13:26.738 --> 00:13:29.708
like, 80 miles an hour up this
thing.

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:31.543
What I didn't see
was there's a sign

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:33.645
on the side of the road
that said,

00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:36.481
"15 mile an hour turn ahead."

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:39.551
I--I just assumed
it kept going straight.

00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:41.153
You know who saw that sign

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:44.857
is the three tripping dudes
in back.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.325
They all saw that sign.

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.160
They tried to warn me
about that sign

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:52.231
via a series of screams.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.499
But they had already
cried spirit wolf,

00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:57.803
and I wasn't hearing it.

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.505
So this is just great.
They're screaming.

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:02.307
I'm sure showing them.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.509
And I get up
to the top of this hill,

00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:07.212
and I'm like, "Uh-oh.

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:09.348
Nothing after this."

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.049
I hit the brakes, too late.

00:14:11.082 --> 00:14:12.751
Car's in the air.

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:16.889
Somehow I landed and I,
like, made this insane turn

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:21.994
and just Tokyo Drifted
around the--

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:23.528
Like, "Oh, I got it!"

00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:25.831
And now, like, I'm trying
to straighten out my car,

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.432
and it's going all--
and I'm like,

00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:32.104
"Where's that red line
when I need it?"

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.874
Almost had it,
and then the, uh,

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:39.678
back passenger tire
caught a little bit of gravel,

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:42.514
on the shoulder of the road,

00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:45.684
which sent my car into a spin.

00:14:45.717 --> 00:14:49.755
And then we all flew off
of a cliff

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:52.925
like a Frisbee,

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.893
and, uh--I don't know why

00:14:54.926 --> 00:14:58.730
you're laughing
about this, guys.

00:14:58.763 --> 00:15:02.434
And then we just dropped
straight down, like 50 feet

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:06.738
into a farm, just a cornfield.

00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.774
Just straight down somehow.

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.542
I don't know how we didn't flip
over.

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:11.810
'Cause we definitely would have
been dead.

00:15:11.843 --> 00:15:15.881
Landed.
All four tires exploded.

00:15:15.914 --> 00:15:17.616
Both axles just snapped,

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:21.954
immediately, and I was like,
"Ohhhhh!

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:27.459
"That's what you guys
were screaming about?

00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:31.330
Oh, I'm so sorry!"

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.765
[laughter]

00:15:33.798 --> 00:15:36.435
Lost some friends that day.

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.769
Not--they're still alive.

00:15:37.802 --> 00:15:39.438
They just won't talk to me
anymore.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:43.608
And...everyone is fine.

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:47.446
And that is why
I rarely do acid.

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:51.450
Um, set and setting, everybody.
Set and setting.

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:53.485
Thank you very much.
