00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.420
&gt;&gt; Louise Baigelman:
I'm Louise Baigelman.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.200
I'm the Executive
Director of Story Shares.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.490
We're so honored
to be here today.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.420
Before I started Story
Shares I was a middle school

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.720
English teacher.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.020
Sorry.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.340
And this is Nicole.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.640
Nicole was one of my students.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.290
She had just moved
to the United States

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.290
from the Dominican Republic.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.190
She was 13 years old and she was
sassy and willful and mature,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.000
but she was reading below a
first grade level and I needed

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.220
to help Nicole improve
her reading skills

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.710
to become a more
proficient reader

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.920
so that she could do better
in school and in general.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.370
But Nicole wanted
nothing to do with books

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.900
that were written
for first graders.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.630
Stories like Barenstain
Bears were uninteresting

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.140
and embarrassing to her.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.320
But the books that were
intended for 13 year olds

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560
for her age were too
hard for her to read.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.140
So I couldn't find enough
content that was relevant

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350
to her age and interest,
but also accessible

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.210
at her much lower
reading levels.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.560
And both of us were
totally frustrated.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.220
She did not want to
read the books available

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.120
and I couldn't blame her.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.720
And we know this
is a bigger problem

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.650
that goes behind my
classroom and my students.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.460
In this country alone,
over 90 million teens

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.250
and adults lack key
literacy skills.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.560
Seventy percent of high
school students need some form

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.860
of reading remediation.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.180
Like Nicole, these students
need to read more in order

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.320
to improve their reading skills.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.550
But, like Nicole, they don't
want to have to practice reading

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.260
on books that were
intended for little kids.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.920
So, without content that's
relevant to their interests

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.600
and their age, but also
readable at their lower levels,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.890
like Nicole, these teens
and adults often give up.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260
They become disheartened.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.320
They see reading as a
negative experience.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
And instead of improving
their reading skills

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.620
because of reading,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.020
they actually fall
further and further behind.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.020
So how do we break that cycle?

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.940
What Story Shares is doing is
we've created a new category

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.610
of books, a collection
of stories specifically

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.340
for these teens and young
adults who read at lower levels.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.860
We have 500 titles so far,
culturally relevant themes,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.840
intriguing topics, age
appropriate characters,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.290
but at a range of lower
reading levels so that teens

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.380
and adults can hone in on the
books that are right for them

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.740
so that, instead of having to
choose from books that look

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.110
like baby books and make them
feel like they're reading books

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.770
for little kids, they
can choose from books

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980
that are actually aligned with
the things that they care about,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.500
that have characters that
they can see themselves in,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.510
they can get excited about and
actually deepen the engagement

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.530
and the reading experience.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.070
We have a digital library

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.990
and then our books are also
available as paperbacks

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.500
and then printable PDF versions.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.430
So it doesn't matter the format,
that the idea is giving choices

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.000
that can really hook readers.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.280
And the way that we build
this library is we use a crowd

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.860
sourcing method.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.080
We tap into the existing
community of writers

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.980
and we provide them with the
tools and guidance to create

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.310
and publish the books
that our readers need.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.800
So why are writers contributing
their stories to our library

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.100
in the numbers that they are?

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.680
We've had over 3,000
submissions so far.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.250
Because the writers get
a lot out of it too.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.680
They get published.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.170
They get an immediate
audience of eager readers.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.230
They get the chance to make
a difference in the field

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.220
of literacy, which is inherently
intriguing to writers.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.160
And they also get our
annual writing contest,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.630
the Relevant Reads
contest, with cash prizes

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.660
so that they can
potentially win.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.240
And so we've built this
community of writers

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.210
in the past three years who are
now contributing their stories

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.150
to our collection for the
readers to have books to choose

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.070
from that they really can enjoy.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.760
And what are we seeing?

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.810
We see that, when we can offer
teens and adults who struggle

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.640
with reading books that
are relevant to them,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.680
that they can connect
with, when they're able

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.420
to read books they actually
enjoy, they read more.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.960
And when you read more,
your reading skills improve.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.800
And so with better books

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.110
for these students comes
better reading skills,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.410
better academic outcomes,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.890
and then better life
outcomes more broadly.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.870
Because we all know
that you need to be able

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.010
to read proficiently to excel in
your high school science class.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.660
You also need to be able
to read proficiently

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.150
to understand instructions
on your prescription

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.330
or to sign a lease or to read a
bedtime story to your own child.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.270
Better books for the right --

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.010
the right kind of
books for readers lead

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.440
to better reading scores,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.010
better reading skills,
and better lives.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.860
We're excited by the
traction we've had so far.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.750
We're now being read by hundreds
of thousands of students

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.890
in all 50 states in
this country and more

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.370
than 75 countries
around the world.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.860
We know we have a long
way to go from here.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.190
I want to finish by
telling a quick story

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.100
about one other student, Robbie,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.060
who's also a struggling
reader and writer.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.460
And he read Jacob and
the Bee Man, which is one

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.970
of the books in our library.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.500
It's about a boy named
Jacob who starts by saying,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.880
"Last year I did something
bad, but I'm not going

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.530
to tell you what it was."

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.790
And when the book ends, he never
tells you what it was he had

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.090
done before.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.550
Well, Robbie read this
book and he wanted so badly

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.100
to know what Jacob
had done that was bad

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.560
that he decided he'd
write his own prequel.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.930
So he gave up his recess
every day to go in and work

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.310
with his teacher on
creating his own book.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.410
This is a student who wanted
nothing to do with reading

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.840
or writing, but he found
that book that hooked him,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.340
that spoke to him, and
it actually inspired him

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.880
to then write his own.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.990
So that's what we're
doing with Story Shares.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.970
We are engaging these readers
who have been overlooked,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.020
providing them with
a shelf of their own

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.460
on the library --
in the library.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.760
Thank you.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.060
[Applause]

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.660
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
