Let's build a snowman using rotation and translation. I did the first part,

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.258
stacking up the snow. Your job is to position the pole through the snowman and

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:13.032
give him arms. The center of the pole should be placed 50 units above the

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:16.253
ground. When you're done, you should see something like this.
