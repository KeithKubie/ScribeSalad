00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.230
So welcome Jeremy, thank you for
coming in and talking to us.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Of course,
I can't wait to see what you've got.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
what we've got here is essentially,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.580
a to do list, slash calendar app.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.570
And I'd just like you to take a look
at this, and try to make a new event.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.740
Sorry, a new task.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.624
&gt;&gt; Okay, so looking at the homepage,
I see I've got this sign in button, so

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:22.204
that's a nice different color,
very obvious.

00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:23.021
Let me hit it.

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.560
All right, so now I'm in the main
screen of the application and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.680
I see I've got this
big button right here.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.938
So I bet that creates a new task.

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:35.850
All right I've got a new untitled task,
see if I can get a name, or is this

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670
the prototype the text fields are-
&gt;&gt; Yes,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.560
the text fields aren't
working right now.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.090
I can see you want to
be able to use them you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.380
want to be able to type in things.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.516
&gt;&gt; So, I want to click through
all of these and then,

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:47.721
hit the big create button.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.390
&gt;&gt; Yep, awesome.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.220
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, you've made a new event.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.330
That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; That was very clear.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.253
&gt;&gt; Now, can you just sort of
navigate through the app.

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:01.710
See if there's anything that makes
sense to you as an extra feature.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.414
See if there's anything
that you want to explore.

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.430
How would you go about
exploring this app, first off?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.360
&gt;&gt; Well, let me just scroll down,
all right.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.310
So I've got my list of tasks,
there's nothing else down there.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.353
Let me see if I can move back and
forth through the days,

00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:14.919
I presume in the full
app that would work.

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:17.185
&gt;&gt; In the full app that would work,
but right now we don't have that?

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:20.866
&gt;&gt; Well the only other thing that I see
to explore is this menu button up at

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.035
the top, so let's see what we've got.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:26.565
Okay, we have a bunch of different
options, should I just pick one or?

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:28.653
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure,
just explore a little bit.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:32.859
One thing that I want to see especially,
is your reactions to certain of these

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.335
pages, so you know the overview page,
the calendar pages.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:37.899
&gt;&gt; Well let's check out
the overview page first.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have this list of,
I assume these are different collections

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.215
of tasks that I've done
stuff with in the past.

00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:50.873
And then some graph of I guess,
how often I've used things,

00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:53.042
how often I've completed things.

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:56.368
&gt;&gt; Would this be a useful thing to
use as somebody who's going to use

00:01:56.368 --> 00:01:56.990
to do apps?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.430
&gt;&gt; Not really, I don't particularly
care about when I completed tasks,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.250
I just want to look at my current
list of tasks that I have to do.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.800
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so can you go back and
find your current list of tasks?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.160
So, I think Home,
probably take me there.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890
Yeah, so
this is everything I needed to do today.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.490
This is kind of my primary
mode of interaction

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.700
with a to do list app, I think.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.400
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
And if you wanted to check off a task,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.930
say you finished your
meeting with Jacqueline,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.470
how would you go about doing that?

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.460
&gt;&gt; Well, it looks like
there's this big empty box,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.910
which I imagine is a check box.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.140
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Yeah, and in the final app,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.260
when you click that, that would check
off and something would happen there.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.532
What would you expect to happen
when you hit that check box?

00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.652
&gt;&gt; I would imagine that it would just
kind of like animate out of the list and

00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:38.850
other events would slide up and
slide into place.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.463
&gt;&gt; Awesome, thank you.

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:41.868
So you've given us great feedback.

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:42.947
I appreciate your time.

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:43.946
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this was fun.

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.142
&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you Jeremy.
