00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.397
- [Voiceover] So we're told
that g of x is equal to

00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:05.129
two x minus one over x plus three.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.276
Based on this, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:09.117
figure out what the inverse of g is.

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:10.777
g inverse of x.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.434
What is that going to be equal to?

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:15.034
Alright, I'm assuming
you've had a go at it,

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:16.331
and just as a little bit of a reminder

00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.123
of what we're talking about
when we're talking about

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:21.263
inverse of functions, or
inverses of functions.

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:23.406
If that's the domain,
the set of all inputs

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.820
that we could input into g,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.265
so that's the domain,

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:32.129
and if we consider the range
to be the set of outputs,

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.446
so that is the range,

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:40.732
for a given input, so for
a member of the domain, x,

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.029
the function g, let me do it that color,

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:49.029
the function g will map it to a point,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.183
let me do g in yellow,

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:55.107
it will map it to a member of the range.

00:00:55.107 --> 00:00:56.848
So if this is x,

00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:00.319
this value right over here we
would consider to be g of x.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.221
That's what the function g does.

00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.300
Now, the inverse function
goes the other way.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.865
You start with a member of the range

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.880
and you go back to a member of the domain.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.933
That's what g inverse does.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.985
And so, there's a couple
of ways to think about it.

00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:17.313
If we were to set,

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:18.370
if we were to say, look,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.077
let's just set y is equal to g of x.

00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:24.488
So we could just call
that point y, as well.

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:27.808
So this expression here,

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:29.726
let's just, okay, if we have
an x, this is what we do.

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:31.250
We multiply by two times
and we subtract one,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.759
divided by x plus three,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.933
and then that tells us
what the associated g of x,

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.774
what the associated y is.

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:39.340
But what if we're given
the y, or the g of x.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.758
How do we get x?

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:43.445
Well, we could just solve for x.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:44.350
So let's do that.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.118
If we said that y is equal to

00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:51.454
two x minus one

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:54.709
over x plus three, let's solve for x,

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.266
so that we know for any y we get,

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.680
what the corresponding x we'll get.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.526
So how do we do that?

00:01:59.526 --> 00:02:02.484
Well, we can multiply both
sides times x plus three.

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:04.929
So if we do that, we're going to get y,

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.543
we're going to get y times

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:10.687
x plus three,

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.429
x plus three, is equal to,

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.022
is equal to two x minus one.

00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:21.748
All I did was multiply both
sides times x plus three.

00:02:21.748 --> 00:02:24.223
x plus three, and I
multiplied x plus three

00:02:24.223 --> 00:02:25.521
on that side as well.

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.174
The x plus three cancels
out with the x plus three.

00:02:29.174 --> 00:02:30.653
And then, let's see.

00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:32.222
Let's see what we can do now.

00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:35.392
Well, we could distribute the y.

00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:38.652
We could distribute the y,

00:02:38.652 --> 00:02:40.493
and I'll switch now to a different color

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.731
because that's going to get complicated

00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:44.387
if I keep trying to separate
the ys in a different color.

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:46.560
So we're going to get y times x,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.137
y x, plus three y,

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:53.453
plus three y, is equal to two x minus one.

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:56.864
And remember, we are now
trying to solve for x.

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:59.702
So we can collect all of the x terms

00:02:59.702 --> 00:03:02.137
on one side of this equation,

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:06.574
and then all of the non-x-involved
terms on the other side.

00:03:06.574 --> 00:03:09.170
So let's get all of our x
terms on the left-hand side

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.524
and all of our non-x terms
on the right-hand side.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.034
So I want to get rid of this.

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:16.837
This doesn't involve an x, so
let me subtract three y here.

00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:19.584
And so I'll subtract
three y from this side.

00:03:19.584 --> 00:03:21.153
Minus three y.

00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:23.115
And we want to get rid of
this from the right-hand side,

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.745
so minus two x.

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:25.953
So we can put it right over here.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.432
Minus two x.

00:03:27.432 --> 00:03:30.209
And so, we are going to get,

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.080
let me scroll down a little bit.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.340
So, whoops. Sorry for that.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.544
So this is going to be y x minus two x

00:03:37.544 --> 00:03:42.334
is going to be y minus two times x.

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:44.567
These cancel out, which is their goal.

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:46.671
Is equal to two x minus two x,

00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:48.039
let's cancel that, which was the goal.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.911
And then you have one minus three y.

00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:52.446
One minus three y.

00:03:52.446 --> 00:03:53.563
And now, to solve for x,

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:56.582
you just divide both sides by y minus two.

00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:58.815
y minus two.

00:03:58.815 --> 00:04:01.351
And we're going to get x is equal to

00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:04.190
one minus three y

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.208
over y minus two.

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.049
So one way you could think about it is,

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.992
you could say, well x is equal to,

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.829
this expression is equal to

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.934
the inverse function as a function of y.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.866
You give me a y,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.734
you give me a y that's
sitting in this range,

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:26.054
I can input it into this
function definition here

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:28.318
and I can give you the corresponding x.

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:31.185
I can give you the corresponding x.

00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:33.721
Now, we didn't ask for g inverse of y.

00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:36.044
We asked for g inverse of x.

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:38.119
But the important thing to remember is

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.506
this variable that we use inside of,

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:42.547
the variable that we use inside of

00:04:42.547 --> 00:04:44.086
functions right over here,

00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:46.622
they're chosen somewhat arbitrarily.

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:49.157
They just say, okay, I'm
going to call the input y,

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.727
and if you're going to call the input y,

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:52.840
well, this is how I would
give you the output.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.349
But we could call the input a,

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.850
and that would be one minus
three a over a minus two.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.713
Or we could even call the input,

00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:01.192
so let me make this clear.

00:05:01.192 --> 00:05:04.421
So we have g inverse of y.

00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.991
Actually, since I did it in blue up here,

00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:07.893
let me write that in blue as well.

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:10.230
So if we did,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.369
if we did g inverse,

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:16.026
g inverse of y,

00:05:16.026 --> 00:05:17.806
I'm just rewriting what we already have,

00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:20.040
is equal to one minus three y

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.942
over y minus two.

00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:24.085
This choice of variable is arbitrary.

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:26.873
We could say g inverse of

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:29.932
of smiley face,

00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:31.863
of smiley face, is equal to

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:36.029
one minus three times smiley face,

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:37.357
three times smiley face,

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:40.768
over smiley face minus two.

00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:42.428
Or, if we want it in terms of,

00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:43.998
if we want to call the input x,

00:05:43.998 --> 00:05:46.956
we would just write g inverse of x

00:05:46.956 --> 00:05:49.401
is equal to one minus three x

00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:51.846
over x minus two.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.385
And we'd be done.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.351
And I really want to point out,

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:55.830
you might say, well, this is confusing,

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.849
because now we're calling
the input to this x,

00:05:58.849 --> 00:05:59.886
while, you know, we normally associate

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:01.415
y with the variables.

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:03.539
That's true, but you have
to remember these variables,

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.657
they're just labels
that we apply to things

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:08.992
so that we can keep track of them.

00:06:08.992 --> 00:06:11.467
But they're just what we call the input.

00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:14.093
So we can call the input
into the inverse function,

00:06:14.093 --> 00:06:16.569
we can call it x, smiley face, y,

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.617
you know, a, b, c, d, whatever we want.

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:22.243
So they want it in
terms of g inverse of x,

00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:24.055
so we're going to define the input as x,

00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:25.866
whatever we input into it as x.

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.401
And so this is going to be the expression

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.480
that maps back.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.838
Now another way that you
could have done this,

00:06:32.838 --> 00:06:34.468
because if you think about
what just happened here,

00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:37.608
if we said now that y
is equal to g inverse,

00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:40.294
we've essentially swapped
the x and y variables.

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:42.948
So, one way to solve
these is you can start

00:06:42.948 --> 00:06:45.445
where we started, right over there,

00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:47.619
and then you swap the xs and the ys,

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.520
which is essentially what
we did in the last step

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.728
the way I did it.

00:06:50.728 --> 00:06:54.230
And then you solve for y, after the swap,

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.920
and you would get to this same result.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.486
And you could say, y
is equal to g inverse.

00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:00.506
So I encourage you to try either way.
