00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:02.774
Voiceover:Let's say that
you wanna count the days

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:04.178
since your last birthday

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:06.441
because you just wanna
know how long its been.

00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.234
And so one day after your birthday

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:10.433
you put a mark on a wall.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.244
Then the next day you put
another mark on the wall.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:15.305
The day after that you put
another mark on the wall.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:19.445
So out that day you say well
how many days has it been?

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:20.974
Well you can say look there's
been one, two, three days.

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:21.901
So one way to think about it

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.911
is this set of symbols right over here

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:26.112
represents the number three.

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:27.500
But then you keep going.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.778
The fourth day, you put another mark.

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:31.437
Fifth day, you put another mark.

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:33.369
And then you keep going like that

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:37.910
day after day each day
you add another mark.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.558
And this is actually the earliest way,

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:43.100
the most basic way of
representing numbers.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.636
The number is represented
by the number of marks.

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:47.300
So after bunch of days you get here

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.170
and you're like on well
how many days has it been?

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.981
Well you just recount everything.

00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:54.912
You say one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:00:54.912 --> 00:01:02.445
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 days.

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:04.303
So well you know this
number representation

00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:06.174
it took me little bit of time

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:07.501
to realize that this is 17

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.974
but it seems to be working
so you just keep going.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:13.178
Day after day after day after day

00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:16.578
you just keep marking off the days

00:01:16.578 --> 00:01:19.702
on your wall just to sense
you're counting the days

00:01:19.702 --> 00:01:21.645
since your last birthday.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:24.305
But at some point you realize

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:25.112
every time you wanna know

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:26.647
how may days its been to count it

00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:28.107
is a little bit painful.

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:30.110
And not only that, is this is taking up

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.634
a lot of space on your wall.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.441
You wish that there was an easier way

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.766
to represent whatever number this is.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.573
So first of all let's just think about

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:41.367
what number this actually is.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.300
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.245
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:56.910
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.633
33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:02.306
So you wish that there was a better way

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:05.971
to represent this number
which we now call 37.

00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:07.107
And maybe when you're first trying

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:10.103
you might have even called
it something called 37.

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:13.036
You would just call it this, this number.

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:15.111
This number of days since my birthday.

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:15.969
And I say well look.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.636
What if there was an easier
way to group the numbers?

00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:21.246
You know I have 10 fingers on my hands.

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.301
What if I were to group them into 10s?

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:25.706
And then I would say just
how many groups of 10 I have

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:28.245
and then how many ones
do I have left over.

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:29.846
Maybe that would be an easier way

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:34.104
to represent, to represent
this quantity here.

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:35.641
And so let's do that.

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.836
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:44.578
So that's a group of 10 right over there.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:48.846
And then you have one, two,
three, four, five, six,

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:51.309
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:56.171
So this is another group
of 10 right over here.

00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:57.169
And then let's see.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.178
We have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:02.040
eight, nine, 10.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.777
So that is another group
of 10 right over there.

00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:09.445
And then finally you have
one, two, three, four,

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.380
five, six, seven.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.112
So you don't get a whole group of 10

00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.711
so you don't circle em.

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.708
So just by doing this very simple thing

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.446
now all of a sudden it's much easier

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:22.510
to realize how many days have passed.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.767
You don't have to count everything.

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:24.706
You just have to say okay.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:26.436
One group of 10.

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:27.844
Two groups of 10.

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:29.039
Three groups of 10.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.834
Or you can say one, two, three 10s.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.844
And so that's essentially 30.

00:03:33.844 --> 00:03:35.846
And then I have another one, two, three,

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:38.510
four, five, six, seven.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.770
And so you say oh I have 30 and then seven

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.779
if you knew to use those
words which we now use.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.244
Now this is essentially
what our number system does

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:50.775
using the 10 digits we know of.

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:54.646
The 10 digits we know of
are zero, one, two, three,

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:59.568
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:02.041
Now what our number system allows us to do

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.702
is using only these 10 digits

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.779
we can essentially
represent any number we want

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.966
in a very quick way,

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:11.101
a very easy way for our
brains to understand it.

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.779
So here if we want to represent three 10s,

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:16.433
we would have put a three

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:19.634
in what we would call the 10s place.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.978
We would put a three in the 10s place.

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:25.108
And then we would put the ones,

00:04:25.108 --> 00:04:27.305
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.776
We'd put the seven in the ones place.

00:04:30.776 --> 00:04:32.969
And so how do you know
which place is which?

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.903
Well the first place
starting from the right,

00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:39.036
the first place is the ones place.

00:04:39.036 --> 00:04:41.907
And then you go one
space to the left of it,

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:42.911
you get to the 10s place.

00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.233
And as we'll see you go one more space

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.575
you go to the 100s space.

00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:47.774
But we'll cover that in a future video.

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:50.845
So this essentially tells
us the exact same thing.

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:53.576
This tells us the exact same thing

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:55.970
as this does right over here.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.178
This tells us three 10s.

00:04:58.178 --> 00:04:59.509
One, two, three.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.633
Three 10s

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.236
Three groups of 10.

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:04.110
And then another set of ones.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.906
So we could rewrite this.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:12.909
This is equal to, this
is equal to three 10s

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:19.503
three 10s plus, plus seven ones.

00:05:19.503 --> 00:05:20.644
Or another way to think about it

00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:22.311
what are the three 10s?

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:23.778
Well if use the same number system

00:05:23.778 --> 00:05:27.571
to represent three 10s you
would write that down as 30.

00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:28.712
And then seven ones.

00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:30.709
Once again if you use
our same number system

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.514
you would represent that as seven.

00:05:33.514 --> 00:05:36.773
So these are all different
ways of representing 37.

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.710
And hopefully this
allows you to appreciate

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.094
how neat our number system is.

00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:42.513
Where even a number like 37

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:44.308
as soon as you just write
scratches on a wall,

00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:47.106
it becomes pretty hard to read.

00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:48.240
And you can imagine when you get to much

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.904
much larger numbers like 1,052

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:54.376
to have to count that
many marks every time.

00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:58.352
But our number system gives
us a way of dealing with it.
