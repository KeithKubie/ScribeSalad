00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:02.770
I tend to go back to the Yaxchilan

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.880
largely because I'm so fond of the place

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.230
I suppose almost every year for about

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.769
forty years or something

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.009
in those days to get there you had to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.959
or you almost had to

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.009
fly into a

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.499
an air field

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.199
on the banks of very close to the
banks of the Usumacinta quite a long

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.430
way

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.569
up river

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.550
and then rely on finding

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.730
a boatman who could

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.590
take one there and back

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.000
because there was no other way of getting
there really

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.930
but now there's are roads and regular
boat traffic to take tourists there

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.890
so it's

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.110
also a site that's protected and funded
by the world monuments fund

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.560
so it gets a lot of attention

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.640
there are tourists that come in boatloads
every day so we'll be

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.550
contending with a little bit of tourist
activity at the same time. It's not a 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.880
unknown, remote place that you have to chop
to get to it’s you know there are paths

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.930
it’s green there's a lot of forest
cover

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.340
but there are places that 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.159
the normal tourist doesn't climb to where
there are inscriptions and monuments and so

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.360
we'll probably get up to some of those spots
and try to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.590
work up there away from the general traffic

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.090
of course it's very exciting to be using a
new technology

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.430
I expect my notes will be a little bit out of joint 
because I won't be using my normal system

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.660
I am quite interested in one particular

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.090
item

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.430
there was a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.950
a very small

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.350
stairway and when I say small, it's only two steps

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.170
but it's quite wide

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.080
and I don't think anybody's ever recorded it
before

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.390
so that's something I'm looking forward to.
