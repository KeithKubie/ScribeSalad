This course is about me. It's about you. It's about all of us,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.890
really. It's about how our genomes, or

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.330
our genetic instructions, shape who we are.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.630
&gt;&gt; So to help, we've asked five people to

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.940
join us and share their life stories throughout this course.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.790
And hopefully, through them, you'll see how our genome can

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.280
manifest different traits that can profoundly shape our lives. Yes.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.060
&gt;&gt; As we follow their personal journeys, we hope

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.860
you'll begin to connect real stories with real traits.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.790
&gt;&gt; So let's hear your story. Give us five words. One

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.270
in each one of these boxes, to describe who you are.
