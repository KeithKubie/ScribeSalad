This video was a collaboration between me and Psych2go

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.800
Please go check out their channel

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.500
They have some really cool videos about

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.620
psychology and other topics

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.420
What is the most common mental disorder in the United States?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.940
Depression? Bipolar disorder? autism?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.200
It's actually anxiety!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.360
This affects 40 million adults in the U.S.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.220
18 percent of the population

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.240
but how this anxiety come about?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.740
The university of Wisconsin-Madison found that anxiety could be inherited

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.300
They went further into their studies

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.780
using an extended family of rhesus monkeys

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.740
to examine which regions of the brain were involved

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.880
First, let's go back to 1969 where developmental psychologist

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
Mary Ainsworth would perform an experiment known as "The strange situation"

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.340
in this experiment young children were introduced to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.280
a mildly stressful situation

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.240
being left alone with a stranger

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.040
Don't worry, the stranger was actually a research assistant

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.960
researchers were then able to derive the different temperaments of the children

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.020
when they were in that stressful situation

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.740
Children either had a secure temperament or an anxious temperament

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.280
when pared with a stranger

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.620
researchers at the university of Wisconsin-Madison did the same experiment to rhesus monkeys

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.340
scanning the brain of about 600 young monkeys

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.600
both with and without anxious temperaments

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.140
when exposed to a stranger for 30 minutes

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
They found 3 parts of the brain linked to inherited anxiety

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.700
The prefrontal cortex, the limbic system

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.760
and the amygdala in the middle of the brain

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.580
These areas were shown to have an overactive connection

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.580
which in turn links to an increase risk of developing anxiety or depression

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.100
Dr. Ned Kalin, senior author of the study explains

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.560
What we find as more activity in the anxious brains

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.800
is as if the part of the brain that we have evolved to deal with normal threats

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.840
have gone super critical responding to mild threats as if they were major

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.060
researchers were also able to trace the inheritance of anxiety

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.880
discovering 35% of the variations of anxiety can be explained by genetics

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.620
while the other percentage is determined by environment

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.100
kalin explains: â€œBasically, we think that to a certain extent, anxiety can provide an evolutionary advantage

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.240
because it helps an individual recognize and avoid danger,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.140
but when the circuits are overactive, it becomes a problem and can result in anxiety and depressive disorders"

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.180
So what are your thoughts on anxiety?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.540
Do you have anxiety?
