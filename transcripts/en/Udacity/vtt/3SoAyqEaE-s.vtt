00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is it could have been any of these,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but I think the best answer is unit testing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because what we're doing is we're taking a software module,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
testing it in isolation to see if it's up to our standards

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
before we integrate it with the rest of our software.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, the type of testing that we're actually doing 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
could have been white box testing, could have been black box testing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and could have been stress testing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But I didn't give you enough details about what we were doing 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to allow you, I believe, to conclude that any of those was definitely what we were doing,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so what I think is the best answer here is unit testing.
