00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For our second shock absorber-related problem,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
imagine that our car is driving along the road and suddenly it hits a giant bump

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and after hitting this bump, the car starts to bounce up and down on the shock absorbers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Using your knowledge of simple harmonic motion and springs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
can you tell me what the period of the oscillation of the car over the wheels is going to be?

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Put your answer here in seconds.
