00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:10.134
They're everywhere, 
but you will never see one.

00:00:10.134 --> 00:00:13.486
Trillions of them are flying 
through you right this second,

00:00:13.486 --> 00:00:15.244
but you can't feel them.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:19.545
These ghost particles are called neutrinos
and if we can catch them,

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.948
they can tell us about 
the furthest reaches

00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:25.134
and most extreme environments 
of the universe.

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:27.634
Neutrinos are elementary particles,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:32.514
meaning that they can't be subdivided
into other particles the way atoms can.

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.659
Elementary particles are the smallest
known building blocks

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.712
of everything in the universe,

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:41.639
and the neutrino is one 
of the smallest of the small.

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.114
A million times less massive 
than an electron,

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.839
neutrinos fly easily through matter,
unaffected by magnetic fields.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.916
In fact, they hardly ever 
interact with anything.

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:55.862
That means that they can travel
through the universe in a straight line

00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:58.846
for millions, or even billions, of years,

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.370
safely carrying information 
about where they came from.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.590
So where do they come from?

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.610
Pretty much everywhere.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.405
They're produced in your body
from the radioactive decay of potassium.

00:01:10.405 --> 00:01:14.002
Cosmic rays hitting atoms 
in the Earth's atmosphere

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.058
create showers of them.

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:19.149
They're produced by nuclear 
reactions inside the sun

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.130
and by radioactive 
decay inside the Earth.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.629
And we can generate them 
in nuclear reactors

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.921
and particle accelerators.

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.799
But the highest energy neutrinos
are born far out in space

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.716
in environments that 
we know very little about.

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:37.993
Something out there,
maybe supermassive black holes,

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.197
or maybe some cosmic dynamo
we've yet to discover,

00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:45.468
accelerates cosmic rays to energies
over a million times greater

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:49.156
than anything human-built
accelerators have achieved.

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:52.088
These cosmic rays, 
most of which are protons,

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:56.001
interact violently with the matter
and radiation around them,

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.149
producing high-energy neutrinos,

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.661
which propagate out 
like cosmic breadcrumbs

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:02.776
that can tell us about the locations

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:07.248
and interiors of the universe's most
powerful cosmic engines.

00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:09.487
That is, if we can catch them.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:12.090
Neutrinos' limited interactions
with other matter

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.114
might make them great messengers,

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:17.376
but it also makes them 
extremely hard to detect.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:22.401
One way to do so is to put a huge volume
of pure transparent material in their path

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.691
and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.385
by colliding with the nucleus of an atom.

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.271
That's what's happening 
in Antarctica at IceCube,

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:33.031
the world's largest neutrino telescope.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.266
It's set up within 
a cubic kilometer of ice

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.285
that has been purified by the pressure

00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:40.736
of thousands of years 
of accumulated ice and snow,

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:44.409
to the point where it's one 
of the clearest solids on Earth.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.803
And even though it's shot through with
boreholes holding over 5,000 detectors,

00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:53.956
most of the cosmic neutrinos racing
through IceCube will never leave a trace.

00:02:53.956 --> 00:02:55.581
But about ten times a year,

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:59.789
a single high-energy neutrino
collides with a molecule of ice,

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.807
shooting off sparks of charged
subatomic particles

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:06.190
that travel faster through the ice
than light does.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.750
In a similar way to how a jet
that exceeds the speed of sound

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.926
produces a sonic boom,

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:15.591
these superluminal charged particles
leave behind a cone of blue light,

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.187
kind of a photonic boom.

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.084
This light spreads through IceCube,

00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:23.969
hitting some of its detectors
located over a mile beneath the surface.

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.253
Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal,

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:32.165
which contains information about 
the charged particles' paths and energies.

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:35.079
The data are beamed 
to astrophysicists around the world

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.721
who look at the patterns of light

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.979
for clues about the neutrinos 
that produced them.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.312
These super energetic collisions
are so rare

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:46.073
that IceCube's scientists give each
neutrino nicknames,

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:49.444
like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork.

00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:50.889
IceCube has already observed

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.431
the highest energy 
cosmic neutrinos ever seen.

00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.626
The neutrinos it detects should finally
tell us where cosmic rays come from

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:02.263
and how they reached 
such extreme energies.

00:04:02.263 --> 00:04:06.205
Light, from infrared,
to x-rays, to gamma rays,

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.365
has given us increasingly energetic

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:11.358
and continuously surprising 
views of the universe.

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:14.272
We are now at the dawn
of the age of neutrino astronomy,

00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:17.068
and we have no idea 
what revelations IceCube

00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:19.698
and other neutrino telescopes may bring us

00:04:19.698 --> 00:04:24.774
about the universe's most violent,
most energetic phenomena.
