LOGAN URY: So before
we start I just

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.840
wanted to thank you all very
much for coming in person.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.850
I thought a lot about
this event and the fact

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.750
that "The Ethical
Slut" is a title

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.830
that some people may
not be familiar with

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.020
or comfortable with.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.603
And we are in a
corporate environment,

00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:16.640
so I think it's so cool
you all came in person.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.100
And I'm just so happy
to see your faces

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.370
and to have you here.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.460
And we're really lucky to
have Dossie Easton with us,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.930
so this is our third event in
this series on modern romance.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.650
And for those of
you who haven't met,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.180
my name is Logan Ury I
help lead a team here

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.100
called the "Irrational Lab" and
we're a behavioral economics

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.860
unit.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.260
And it's my pleasure to host
this modern romance series.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.040
So a little bit
more about Dossie,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.950
she is a psychotherapist,
relationship counselor,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.610
educator, and author.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.660
Along with Janet Hardy, she
has co-authored several books,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.790
including "The
Ethical Slut," a guide

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.140
to infinite sexual
possibilities.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.620
"Radical Ecstasy," SM
journeys to transcendence.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.980
"When Someone You Love is
Kinky," "The New Topping Book,"

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.550
and "The New Bottoming Book."

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.990
And I'd like to give her an
award for best book titles.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.470
And since 1969, she
has lived and worked

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.660
in sexual minority
cultures, she is

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.510
dedicated to feminist,
polyamorous, BDSM, spiritual,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.630
gender diverse, and LGBTQ
individuals and communities.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620
She also offers authentic,
respectful, and compassionate

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.990
psychotherapy and
relationship counseling

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.770
to people exploring
nontraditional lifestyles.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770
Dossie, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.770
DOSSIE EASTON: Thank
you for inviting me,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.130
I'm really glad to be here.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.338
LOGAN URY: Great to have you.

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:34.780
So I'll ask some
questions, and then we'll

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.490
save about 20 or 25 minutes
at the end for questions

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.060
from the audience.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.990
So first, let's start
at the beginning.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.180
What is polyamory, and
what is an ethical slut?

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.706
Why is that the name of
your most famous book?

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.330
DOSSIE EASTON: OK, we could get
really argumentative about what

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.220
is polyamory.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.070
To my mind, it has
become the umbrella word.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760
And people ask me
questions like,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.470
what's the difference between
polyamory and non-monogamy?

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.310
And I say I don't know.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.030
Because inside
that umbrella there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.900
should be the freedom
for everyone--

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.750
and that means each
and every one of you--

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.940
to decide how they want
their relationship to be,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.210
and how they want it to be at
any given time in their life,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.740
because those things
also change over time.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.080
So it's that freedom to
decide that I think polyamory

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.200
is about for me.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.690
It was originally coined by
Morning Glory Ravenheart-Zell--

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.960
great name-- to refer to
her lifelong lifestyle

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.070
of culturing and developing
and nurturing group marriages.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.700
And so it meant something
a little bit smaller,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.310
but what it opened the door, I
think, for a lot of people to

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.940
is to say, our
relationships, whatever

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.770
commitments we make in terms
of home finances or mortgages

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.320
or children or whatever,
whatever level of that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.000
kind of life partnership we
enjoy with any given partner,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.620
but all of our relationships
are indeed partnerships,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.310
and all of them are not only
about sex but also about love,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.810
and about connection, and
about emotional connection,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.960
and I really do believe that.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.010
At the time, because the
definition was kind of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.885
in question-- and we're
very proud, actually,

00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:13.810
that the OED actually
called Morning Glory

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.040
and asked her for a
definition of polyamory.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.600
So we're very proud of that.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.580
The only person I ever knew
that was called up by the OED

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.610
to investigate a word she
invented, a good word.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.350
This started out
as kind of a joke,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.808
we had written "The Bottoming
Book" and "The Topping Book,"

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:33.430
and we were at a MENSA
conference in Sylmar,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.704
and we had been talking
about negotiation in BDSM.

00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:38.870
And Janet and I had done
some flirting on the stage.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.619
And our partners were
there, which everybody knew

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:43.910
because we had introduced them.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.493
And we came into the
room, and instead

00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:48.020
of talking about all of
the interesting stuff

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.255
that we had talked about,
this woman was saying,

00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:51.155
did you see her?

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:52.530
She was flirting
with that woman,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.200
and her husband was
sitting right there.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.420
That was all she could see.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.680
It was all she could see.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.850
And I mean, I've been
consciously non-monogamous

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.010
since 1969.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.550
It's like a vow I took
as part of my feminism.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.300
I'm serious.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.140
I'm serious.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.840
I didn't want to spend my
life looking for a spouse

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.630
to complete me.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.950
That wasn't what I was doing.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.809
And so this became
kind of a joke.

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:16.600
We were writing it.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.391
People would say, what
are you writing now?

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:19.850
We'd say, "The Ethical Slut."

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.315
And they all knew
what that meant,

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:22.890
because they were all sluts.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.969
And then when it came time to
make a name for the book, when

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.760
we finished the book
and it needed a title,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.500
and we explored "Polyamory
for the New Millennium,"

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.930
and all that kind of stuff.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.110
And it just didn't ring.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.000
So it became "The Ethical Slut,"
it remains "The Ethical Slut,"

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.140
and I'm very proud of it
because I have a lifelong career

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.720
of laundering dirty words.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.290
LOGAN URY: So what does it
mean to be an ethical slut?

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.650
DOSSIE EASTON: It means to have
a celebratory and adventurous

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.610
approach to sexuality, to
own your own sexuality,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.450
to share it, as Janet wrote.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.450
I love this.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.830
"A slut shares her sexuality as
a philanthropist shares money."

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.000
That we go out there,
men and women alike,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.460
and we proudly grasp our
sexuality and adventure in it.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.770
And at the same time, we
do that with due respect

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.230
to all the people
who are affected by,

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.900
that we connect with,
and their people,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.650
and anybody else who's
affected by what we do.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.500
So we have a high
set of ethics, which

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.320
is how we manage to
make this sustainable.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.680
Does that makes sense?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.607
Because the culture had it
that if you went out to a club

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:29.440
and you picked somebody
up and you went home

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.022
and you fucked, and
then the next morning,

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:33.480
if you weren't
going to marry them,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.890
you could never
speak to them again.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.390
And it was all
like, then that was

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.310
all what I call sport fucking,
that was supposed to be really

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.060
distant and armored.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.780
And that wasn't
what I meant at all.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.620
I meant people
actually connecting

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.870
with each other,
which means that we

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.902
have to keep ethics in mind.

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:54.610
LOGAN URY: So as I
was doing my research,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.330
I read about a lot
of misconceptions

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.240
around polyamory,
especially the difference

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.505
between polyamory and
polygamy, and between polyamory

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:02.530
and cheating.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.970
Can you talk a bit about some of
those common misunderstandings?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.374
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah.

00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:10.040
Polygamy, by the way,
is a strange word,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.890
because usually
they mean polygyny--

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.350
which is like misogyny-- which
means one man, many women.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.690
But this has been the culture.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.610
I had a reporter
from "Salon" call me

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.030
up to ask me about three-ways.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.600
And it turned out
that it had never

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.300
occurred to him that a three-way
could happen in any way

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.800
except for one
man and two women.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.210
LOGAN URY: I'm sure you gave
him an education on that.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.710
DOSSIE EASTON: He
was quite shocked.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.579
He was horrified.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:40.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.520
LOGAN URY: That's great.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.890
DOSSIE EASTON: So
that is one aspect.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.010
And the other aspect that
differentiates us from cheating

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.710
is that we are transparent.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.875
And we make a big-- be
very careful about consent.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.440
In this, I kind of agree
with work Morning Glory.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.045
Ideally, our partners,
or at least any

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:08.180
of them we go on to
date longitudinally,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.630
meet our other partners,
because, frankly,

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.679
if I get a new lover and
they come home with me

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:15.595
and they can't be
respectful toward my partner

00:07:15.595 --> 00:07:20.830
that I live with-- or my
baby, because my baby was

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.120
three months old when I
decided this in '69-- then

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.630
that's not going to be real
sustainable in the long run.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.011
So my thoughts are that
it works a lot better,

00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:33.260
and everyone's happier, and
feels more secure and more

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.156
together if everybody
knows everybody,

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:37.530
and everybody's
there, and we all

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.300
get it that we're
all on the same side.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.987
Nobody's competing
with anybody, ideally.

00:07:44.987 --> 00:07:47.070
LOGAN URY: So, I read an
interview with you online

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.770
where you said, "I spent a
great deal of my life feeling

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.790
like this completely
isolated weirdo nut."

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.110
How did you find your
people, and how did you

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.709
come to do the work that you do?

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.250
DOSSIE EASTON: Well,
I was very lucky

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.640
that I made this
decision in San Francisco

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.586
two years after the Summer
of Love, which did help.

00:08:03.586 --> 00:08:04.478
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:06.560
LOGAN URY: Right
place, right time.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.060
DOSSIE EASTON: And
living communally

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.610
as a single mom,
that worked too,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.170
because there were
a lot of post-Summer

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.940
of Love single moms.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.550
But to pick up children
was our statement

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.347
about saying that
our culture was not

00:08:22.347 --> 00:08:24.680
something we were going to
outgrow but something that we

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.650
were going to bring on
into the future, which

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.160
makes me very exciting about.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.710
How many of you
go to Burning Man?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah right, OK.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.044
You think that has
some resemblance

00:08:35.044 --> 00:08:35.960
to the Summer of Love?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.809
I think it does.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.435
So that part, I had
friends and stuff.

00:08:42.435 --> 00:08:44.310
But what really got me
going, a lover of mine

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.530
named Maggi Rubenstein
was one of three women who

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.250
founded an institution--
that still exists--

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.810
called San Francisco
Sex Information.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.060
And Maggi said, oh, you've
got to come volunteer.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.620
So I came and volunteered.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.920
I thought I knew everything,
so the volunteer training

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.878
was a revelation to me.

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:02.200
I learned so much.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.480
It was just wonderful.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.440
And I got to join a community
of people who talk about sex

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.089
all the time, especially around
a sex information switchboard,

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:13.380
where you can call up and
ask a question if something's

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.080
on your mind.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.070
And somebody who is
trained as a peer counselor

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.680
will talk with you and
help you out with that.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.540
And so talking about sex at a
time when there was very, very

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.920
limited language, OK?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.740
SFSI is actually one
of the major agencies

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.339
in developing sex positive
language, because we were

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:37.630
talking to people on the phone.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.088
You couldn't wave
your arms around.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.000
So that gave me a core
of like 1,500 people who

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.320
wanted to radically
explore sexuality

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.250
and to take all the
oddities that we had

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.475
heard from the culture
and question them

00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:59.527
and put them up for question
and see what it took to-- I

00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:01.110
think of it as
outgrow, but maybe it's

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.609
grow beyond what we were taught
as children we were supposed

00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:05.271
to be and do around sex.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.020
Does that answer--

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.830
LOGAN URY: Yeah, it does.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.150
And it also leads right
into my next question,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.233
which is that one of my
favorite parts of the book

00:10:10.233 --> 00:10:13.326
is when you talk about all
these common romantic myths.

00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:15.450
And it made me realize all
these socialized beliefs

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.430
that I had around,
oh, you should

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.630
look for one long-term
partner, and all these things.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.080
Can you talk a little bit
more about relationship myths

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.500
and how people can
recognize and confront them?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.840
DOSSIE EASTON: Well, we
started out in a culture--

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.280
depending on where you
grew up in this country,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.230
because we now have second
and even third generation

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.040
sluts growing up.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.150
I love it.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.830
But we started out
in a culture that

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.210
said that there was one gold
standard of relationships.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.070
And that was somebody that
you got together with,

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.270
and you stayed
together with, and you

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.690
celebrated your 50th
anniversary, and so on.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.510
And that's all fine and good,
but that's not the culture

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.835
that we actually live in.

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:54.860
That's a very agrarian model of
what a relationship should be,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.290
and it is not the
only successful way

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.700
to connect and relate
to other people.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.830
There are tons and tons of ways.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.050
Most of us here in
this room can expect

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.050
to move through
several relationships,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.550
major relationships,
in a lifetime.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.233
And if we are indeed
open to it, that's

00:11:12.233 --> 00:11:14.270
a whole lot of
other relationships

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.150
that are valuable
for whatever they're

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.620
valuable for, because
we're not actually

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.180
trying to cement a
relationship to work

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.920
the farm so the
children don't starve.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.860
I mean, that's where
those values come from,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.160
this idea that we have
an invested survival

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.180
interest in stable families.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.400
And you live in a world
where you don't think a lot

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.889
about changing jobs and so on.

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:38.430
People I've worked
with who work here

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.410
think about not working
here, even though it's

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.940
a very wonderful place to work.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.610
They think about what they want
to do, and where they'll fit.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.490
And so the same is true of your
relationships, and the people

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.350
that you love and who love you.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.550
They can be fabulous
profound relationships,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.530
in a lot of different forms.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.134
I loved it when
people started talking

00:11:57.134 --> 00:11:58.300
about friends with benefits.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.105
That doesn't sound cold with me.

00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:02.100
Because through SFSI,
I wound up sharing sex

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.421
with a lot of my
friends, because we

00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:05.670
would go to parties, whatever.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.840
We were just there
and available.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.690
And so friends, and
the concept that I

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.720
got from the gay men of fuck
buddies, because, to me,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.292
that's like a partner
in exploration.

00:12:16.292 --> 00:12:17.750
We're going to
climb this mountain.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.630
We're going to delve
into this forest.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.860
We're going to take care of each
other while we go spelunking.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.810
As it were.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.930
To me, that is another aspect
of the many different ways

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.620
our relationships can
become very profound,

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.540
in not necessarily
being romantic,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.250
not necessarily
being one and only,

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.480
not necessarily even being
what we call falling in love.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.670
Interesting that we call it
falling, sort of stumble,

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:52.610
I think, but also because we
can love a lot more people.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.832
And why should we not include
sex in those connections?

00:12:55.832 --> 00:12:58.040
LOGAN URY: Can you talk a
little bit more about that?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.590
I thought that was one of
the most interesting parts

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.400
of the book, that there isn't
a starvation economy for love,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.025
that you can love
more than one person,

00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:06.700
and that doesn't mean you
love any one person less.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.205
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah.

00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:09.830
We are not taught
that there's supposed

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.830
to be sexual abundance.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.475
We're taught that
men are supposed

00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:15.100
to seek for sexual
abundance, and women

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.160
are supposed to be
the brakes and go,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.140
oh no, oh no, I don't want to,
not until that ring, and so on.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.050
I mean, it's a really dumb
system, if you think about it.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.080
But a lot of what we
have in our culture

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.070
prevents us from thinking
outside that system.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.991
And I think it's
a trap, frankly,

00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:35.970
that they don't want us to think
outside of that system anymore

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.340
than they wanted
slaves in slavery era,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.810
where it was illegal to
teach a slave how to read.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.790
It's a form of
oppression, I believe.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.329
We trap people by
belief systems.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.370
This doesn't mean that
you shouldn't fall in love

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.910
and celebrate a
50th anniversary.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.040
That's just fine and dandy.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.480
If your life goes that
way, that's just great.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.084
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:13:59.084 --> 00:14:00.750
But if your life is
different from that,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.520
there should be
room for that, too.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.839
Does that answer the question?

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:04.880
LOGAN URY: Yeah, it does.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.360
I'm really curious
to know, do you

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.920
think monogamy is
realistic for most people?

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.150
DOSSIE EASTON: If you really
want to investigate this,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.450
read a book by my friends
Judith Lipton and David Barash

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.680
called "The Myth of Monogamy."

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.340
They are evolutionary
researchers,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.360
and they did things
like do DNA testing

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.540
on all the chicks in a
bird nest to find out

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.960
that it's a wise bird who
knows their own father.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.249
They found nests, for
instance-- and this reminded me

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:32.790
of something.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.010
They found nests where the
male bird in the nest-- and you

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.350
have to have two birds if you
have a nest full of hatchlings

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.314
in bird land.

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:42.230
You can't feed them
unless you have two birds.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.120
One bird can't do it.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.650
It's too much work.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.540
They will starve.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.980
So there has to be two birds.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.704
But sometimes they would
find that the male bird

00:14:50.704 --> 00:14:53.120
in the partnership, or the
other bird in the partnership--

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.160
because there are
Amazon birds-- that they

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.430
weren't related to any of
the chicks biologically.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.260
And yeah, you laugh.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.950
And they actually
use the word cuckold,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.730
but I thought that
was really stupid.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.070
My closest life partner,
my longest life partnership

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.780
who raised my daughter with me
for eight years, was a gay man.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.260
And we were great at homemaking.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.718
I think during that
period of time,

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:20.730
we had sex three times,
always involving other people,

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.000
because our relationship
wasn't primarily sexual.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.230
It was primarily a
relationship between people

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.290
who are making home, and we were
very active as sex educators,

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.020
so we held all the meetings in
our living room, and you know,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.450
it was wonderful.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.950
LOGAN URY: So is
your answer to that

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.519
question is that the book is
called "The Myth of Monogamy"?

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.810
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.810
I didn't say that part?

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.290
LOGAN URY: No, you did,
but that answers it.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.460
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah,
"The Myth of Monogamy."

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.959
That's what they
call it, and that's

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:47.164
because they didn't
find a lot of monogamy.

00:15:47.164 --> 00:15:49.080
LOGAN URY: So this is a
question that somebody

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.230
submitted to me before hand.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.640
She said, "I'm
interested to hear

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.690
what you think the role
of gender and sexuality

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.240
is in poly relationships.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.950
My experience has
always been that there

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.730
tends to be more fluid
sexuality in poly couples,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.040
and I would love to know
what you think about that."

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.035
DOSSIE EASTON: Well, I think
I would go back a step,

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:10.390
if that makes sense.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.490
Because I think people
who are attracted to poly

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.735
have already looked
at their gender roles.

00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:18.610
I really do think that's
true, and maybe it's

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.076
particularly true of women,
because the world was supposed

00:16:22.076 --> 00:16:23.450
to operate on the
fact that women

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.589
weren't really interested in
sex and only did it for England.

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:31.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.940
But that's not true either.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.800
But the truth is that poly
doesn't work very well

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.780
with people who have not checked
out what they were taught

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.080
men women were supposed to be.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.670
And that doesn't
matter if you're

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.930
a man or woman, or
trans, or non-binary,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.070
or any other category of gender.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.460
But of course, people
who are not binary,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.690
or people who trans, have
already asked those questions.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.060
Many people grew up in
parts of the United States

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.060
where nobody questions
that men do this.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.290
I worked with a person who was
raised as a Jehovah's Witness,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.430
and she had left that and
built a wonderful life,

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.460
but she wondered questions
so far behind in her career.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.880
And I said, well,
did they educate you

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.990
for working outside the home?

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.520
Oh no, no, you
weren't supposed to.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.772
Women weren't
supposed to do that.

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.200
Did they send you to college?

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.250
No, they didn't send
women to college.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.310
So this still exists
in the United States,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.640
often with the
interesting threat,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.420
maybe, that this is
the way God wants it.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.560
It's tremendously limited.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.100
So it works better if people
have thought through what

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.480
it means to be a man, what
it means to be a woman,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.290
and how they want
to be in that area,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.084
and what work they need to
do to claim that territory.

00:17:47.084 --> 00:17:48.500
If you were raised
to believe that

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.690
you were always in some
kind of competition or race,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.690
for instance, whether
a man in his career

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.210
or a woman with other
women for desirable men.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.710
Looking at the world as if it's
not a race can be a revelation.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.150
And then how do you have
to change yourself in order

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.305
to not constantly be
wondering if you are ahead

00:18:07.305 --> 00:18:10.700
of or behind the person
you're talking to.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.692
Hierarchies kind of get
thrown out the window in here.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:15.400
LOGAN URY: Well, that's
a good transition

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.710
to my next question, which is
around when we first talked.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.150
You said you have
a lot of clients

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.380
who either work at Google or
work in the tech industry,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.810
and I'd love to hear more
about that, and maybe

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.050
the relationship between tech
and open relationships or tech

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.314
and polyamory and what you
think the connection is.

00:18:31.314 --> 00:18:32.730
DOSSIE EASTON:
Well, first of all,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.575
you are all very
intelligent people,

00:18:34.575 --> 00:18:36.350
or you wouldn't be here.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.506
And that's the first
thing on the list,

00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:41.960
that you think about things,
and you wonder about things,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.170
and you question things.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.998
And this is good stuff.

00:18:45.998 --> 00:18:47.373
You are people
who would be bored

00:18:47.373 --> 00:18:50.880
to tears working on an assembly
line or something like that,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.040
in the factory.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.105
Even if they payed you
more than they did here,

00:18:55.105 --> 00:18:56.480
you would still
be bored to tears

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.900
and not tolerate it very well.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.970
So this is an interesting
population of people.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.480
I find it interesting
because, when I was young,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.460
there was no built-in
employment for smart kids.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.540
There wasn't any place
you went that you

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.740
could avoid being bored.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.240
The corporate ladder
was kind of it,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.160
unless you went to medical
school or something like that.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.420
And so this idea
that there's now

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.290
a playground for bright
kids makes me very happy.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.960
And my understanding
is that Google

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.580
is very actively pursuing
diversity in the population

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.715
here.

00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:30.840
I know there's a lot of
activity and women in tech,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.100
and that there's outreach
to high school and even

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.530
younger middle school
students to see

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.910
the kids from all over the
place get access, whether it's

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.520
by gender or by social
strata, or whatever,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.447
get access to computers
and can learn about them.

00:19:46.447 --> 00:19:48.030
So you live in a
very privileged world

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.557
here, and at the same time,

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:50.890
It's a very high pressure world.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.490
You work really, really hard.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.877
And some of you
are in the position

00:19:55.877 --> 00:19:57.710
that a friend of mine
who's a medical doctor

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.980
told me he was told
in medical school.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.840
When he went to
medical school, they

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.730
told them-- this was
when very few women went

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.867
to medical school-- get married
right away because you're not

00:20:07.867 --> 00:20:09.200
going to have time to socialize.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.550
Well, particularly
those of you who've

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:19.140
worked in the game industry,
you could easily be in a job

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.170
where you don't have
time to socialize.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.030
Polyamory requires
an investment.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.810
And you're investing,
and I don't

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.820
like to see people look
at marriage as sort

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.420
of a convenience.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.930
My socks get washed, make
sure it's getting picked up

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.190
at the dry cleaner, so
I work and I come home

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.690
and expect to be taken care of.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.575
And who are those
people at home that

00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:41.940
are doing the taking care
of, and how do they count.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.670
Anyway, so that
is something that

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.100
is I think another question.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:53.780
A lot of you also as bright
kids in school were as I was.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.020
Kind of social outcasts.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.650
They did a research
project in a gifted program

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.500
in fourth and fifth
graders in California

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.730
when the gifted program
still existed in our schools.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.840
And they had a bunch
of grad students

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.500
looking at kids in recess
and checking out the high IQ

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.150
kids that have been
identified, and seeing

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.430
how much time in recess they
spent as leaders, followers,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.890
or outcasts.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.500
Believe it or not,
these researchers

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.090
were surprised to discover
that the bright kids were

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.320
almost never the
leaders in grade school.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.230
You all know that.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.610
And so one of the
things that happens

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.020
when you have an assembly
of very bright people,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.400
is that a lot of us were
not able to figure out

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.730
how to socialize in middle
school and high school.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.600
And we found a home
for you, I didn't

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.730
because this didn't exist when
I was young, so many of you

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.820
now found a home in front
of a computer screen.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.440
Where you could be respected,
where people could know you

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.720
by your handle or whatever
name you were using,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.270
and you could win respect
being outrageous, blogging,

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.342
or doing something very
clever with computer games

00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:09.300
or something like that.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.770
And so a lot of people, a
lot of very bright people

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:17.060
get bullied in schools
and get kind of obstacles

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.270
to learning how they
want to socialize,

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.650
and figuring out how
we want to socialize.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:23.660
So sometimes it's hard.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.669
A lot of us are kind
of shy and awkward.

00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:27.710
LOGAN URY: So I heard Dan
Savage speak last week,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.620
and he said the most
common question he gets

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.299
is, am I normal?

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:33.840
DOSSIE EASTON: My
question is, do you

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.923
want to be normal, really?

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.540
Normal, it may
interest you to know,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:44.440
is 1.75 minutes of fucking.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.380
That's normal, OK?

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.600
Do you want to be normal?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.420
I don't think so.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.790
You're way too smart for that.

00:22:52.822 --> 00:22:53.488
I throw that up.

00:22:53.488 --> 00:22:55.112
It's important when
looking at research

00:22:55.112 --> 00:23:01.650
because statistical research
has taken normal as right.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:09.250
Now, normal is an IQ of 100,
and actually that's-- in terms

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.870
of here-- that would be way low.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.030
Normal doesn't
actually include people

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.900
who are explorers,
who are looking out

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.930
of the box, who are creative
thinkers, who do something

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.480
well.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.960
You're not normal if you
do anything well, you see.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.040
You all, in intelligence, are
a couple standard deviations

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.520
above normal, three
or four, maybe.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.015
So normal is kind of deceptive.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.430
And when you think of normal in
sexuality and sexual behavior,

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.060
it's taken in a
culture with a history

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.220
of tremendous sexual oppression.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.560
Using that word normal,
say, oh no, it's not normal.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.190
When I started as
a sex educator,

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.597
it was considered
pathological to masturbate.

00:23:55.597 --> 00:23:57.180
We have changed the
world on that one.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.262
And that's crazy.

00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:02.220
LOGAN URY: That's true.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.490
It's interesting to
see what's normal now,

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.730
what was normal, what will
be normal in the future.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.346
DOSSIE EASTON: Well,
people still jack off.

00:24:10.346 --> 00:24:12.220
They were ashamed of
themselves for doing it,

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.945
which is really bad.

00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:15.570
LOGAN URY: So I'd
love to hear you talk

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:16.620
a little bit about jealousy.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.070
I think that's something that
people often wonder about.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.634
How do people manage jealousy,
and what are the expectations

00:24:22.634 --> 00:24:23.300
around jealousy?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.530
Does it not exist in a
polyamorous relationship?

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.569
Or do people just
handle it differently?

00:24:27.569 --> 00:24:29.860
DOSSIE EASTON: People handle
it differently, of course.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.651
After all these years,
I still get jealous.

00:24:31.651 --> 00:24:35.420
And I have been consciously
poly for more than 50 years now.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.430
Jealousy is not one thing.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.757
If we were to ask around this
room, we would find out--

00:24:44.757 --> 00:24:46.090
I don't have my whiteboard here.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.712
This was the white
board question.

00:24:47.712 --> 00:24:49.920
We would find out that for
one person here, when they

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.086
get jealous, they get angry.

00:24:51.086 --> 00:24:52.860
Another person gets insecure.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.540
Another person feels
very territorial.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.373
Another person
fears abandonment.

00:24:56.373 --> 00:24:57.748
Another person
goes, oh my god, I

00:24:57.748 --> 00:25:00.520
should have lost
those 20 pounds.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.470
And they're very, very
different experiences.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.340
Jealousy is interesting in that
it's not really an emotion,

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.070
it's a word we use
for a stimulus that

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.280
may cause strong emotions
and may frighten us.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.080
We've been taught
that we are supposed

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.610
to take our security from
our life partnerships,

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.850
from our marriages,
from our relationships.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.900
And that security is
supposed to include--

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.240
this is one of the biggest
myths of all-- the idea

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.830
that our partner
is not attracted

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.424
to anybody else but us, which
is really probably not true.

00:25:30.424 --> 00:25:33.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.350
Matter of fact, if
you look at this,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.940
people think people who watch
porn-- I always was very amused

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.984
by these things
about the statistics

00:25:40.984 --> 00:25:42.650
of these terrible
people who watch porn,

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.450
and they all turn into serial
killers-- you start by saying

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.955
this is a multi-billion
dollar industry of criminals,

00:25:49.955 --> 00:25:51.012
and we must stop.

00:25:51.012 --> 00:25:52.470
Well, who do you
think is providing

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.580
those multi-billion dollars
if it isn't all of us?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.712
So there's a lot
of what is normal.

00:26:02.712 --> 00:26:03.920
You were asking about normal.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.010
I'm sorry I got off track.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.470
What I look at with
jealousy is, we

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.505
start with the sort of
axiom in this society

00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.340
that jealousy is an
intolerable emotion.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.062
I recall one of my clients
coming into the office

00:26:17.062 --> 00:26:19.020
one day to say she had
talked to her girlfriend

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.061
about her boyfriend's
behavior, and her boyfriend

00:26:21.061 --> 00:26:22.832
was indeed being a jerk.

00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:24.790
And her girlfriend said,
well, he just gave you

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.810
a license to go ballistic.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.910
Ballistic?

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:31.145
I thought about that.

00:26:31.145 --> 00:26:33.660
Do you actually own a gun?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.510
And she didn't,
so we could relax.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.169
But you think about
that, hey, Joe,

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:39.960
where you going with
that gun in your hand?

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.501
I'd rather see you
dead, little girl,

00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:42.990
than see you with another man.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.900
And there's equivalent
stuff for women

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.170
as well, that the
world comes to an end

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.430
if you find that your
partner has had sex

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.010
or wants to have sex
with somebody else.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:58.820
And so we've taught ourselves
that jealousy is its own kind

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.820
of emotional tyrant.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.240
Because the belief
system is that jealousy

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.780
is intolerable, that
it is inevitable,

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.610
and that it is unchangeable.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.500
Interestingly
enough, brain science

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.600
has given us-- all those
wonderful functional MRI

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.860
research-- a different story.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.450
And the story is that when
people get jealous, often

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.840
we are triggered.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.790
An emotional
triggering is something

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.147
that, if you get upset
really fast about something,

00:27:25.147 --> 00:27:26.230
you feel very overwhelmed.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.040
You start flooding, and it
feels like a big emergency.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.542
I gotta run away, or I got to
freeze, or I have to fight,

00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:32.500
or something like that.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.583
That's what triggering is.

00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:35.370
It's actually a
physiological function

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.540
of organs called the
amygdalas in our brains

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.460
that are there to teach us
to run away from tigers.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.810
LOGAN URY: The amygdala hijacks.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.680
DOSSIE EASTON: Yep, hijacks
the whole nervous system.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.810
So when that happens, we're
all flooding with adrenaline

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.049
and norepinephrine, and
all the sugar in your cells

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:53.090
goes into your bloodstream
so you can run better.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.570
You become able to ignore
your insulin, which

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.470
is why some people in stressful
childhoods, it's now identified

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:04.400
as a cause of diabetes, because
it messes up the sugar system

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:04.970
so badly.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.230
That stuff is what
seems intolerable,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.350
but the interesting truth
is that if you accept

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:17.170
that your system's
been hijacked,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.540
and you're now no
longer able to,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.140
you can't do conflict resolution
in this state of mind.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.510
Forget it.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.420
All we want is for
that other person

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.390
to be wrong and you
to be proved right.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.810
It's a very blinding
kind of state.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.170
But if you manage to
take care of yourself

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.490
without re stimulating whatever
it was that set you off,

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:43.200
whatever that trigger was,
for as little as 15 minutes,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.412
your physiology will
return to its normal state.

00:28:46.412 --> 00:28:48.370
And if you're having a
fight with your partner,

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.770
standard couples
therapy says that what

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.390
you do separate for 15
minutes, to take a timeout,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.160
do whatever it takes
to occupy yourself

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.950
in a positive and
supportive way.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.921
Go hug a tree, whatever.

00:29:02.921 --> 00:29:04.170
Why is that a bad thing to do?

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:04.550
Tree huggers.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.120
It's weird.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.060
And then if you come back
and look at what's happening

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.160
and you will see
it more clearly.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.680
And this will get
you through a lot

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.190
of problems in partnerships.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:19.190
Really, just stop, go occupy
your mind in some positive way.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.370
I am a meditator, but I
don't find meditation-- maybe

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:27.196
I'm not good enough at it, but
I don't find it an easy thing

00:29:27.196 --> 00:29:29.570
to do in moments like that,
because I need something that

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.200
occupies my verbal thought train
while I'm starting up going,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.940
you just want me in the
corner crying, don't you?

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.750
That kind of thinking
is hard to ignore.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.610
Crossword puzzles help.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.900
But what happens when
you calm yourself down,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.200
every time you do that,
every time you self sooth,

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.560
integrating fibers grow
into the amygdala that

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.940
deliver gabapentin, which
is endogenous valium.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.440
And you get to keep the fibers.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.500
So every time you succeed
in soothing yourself

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.330
when you're triggered, you
gain in physiological resources

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.130
for calming yourself down.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.210
This makes sense.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.490
So the goal with jealousy
is not that it goes away,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:14.870
but that it is
changed from a typhoon

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:17.120
to kind of a gentle
summer shower.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.980
You go, oh well,
I'm feeling jeaous.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.830
How shall I take care of myself?

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.987
Matter of fact, it's even
affirming just to say,

00:30:24.987 --> 00:30:27.070
every time I feel jealous,
I go be nice to myself.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.350
I mean, it's interesting.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.665
It's not necessarily
logical, but it works.

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.040
LOGAN URY: That's
really helpful.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.200
I'm going to go take
a timeout next time.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.787
Yeah.

00:30:36.787 --> 00:30:38.370
So I wanted to share
a story with you.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.270
My friend told me
this story few years

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.230
ago, that she's in
an open relationship,

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.996
and her therapist is
really supportive.

00:30:43.996 --> 00:30:45.370
But then one, day
she brought out

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.180
the idea of having a
child with her primary,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.426
and the therapist
sort of freaked out.

00:30:50.426 --> 00:30:52.300
And you've talked a bit
about having a child.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.720
I'd like to hear your
thoughts on childbearing

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.994
in nontraditional environments.

00:30:56.994 --> 00:30:59.410
DOSSIE EASTON: I was very lucky
that this came to me right

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.600
after I had my daughter,
who is now in her '40s,

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.260
and we are very close,
and that's a good thing.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.800
And it all worked.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.610
But she was only
three months old then.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.640
And I wound up connecting
with a lot of other parents,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.940
a lot of extended families
of sluts that were often,

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.060
let's say, society for creating
an anachronism, Renaissance

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.320
Faire, science fiction,
computer people?

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.021
Is that familiar by any means?

00:31:26.021 --> 00:31:26.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.840
Oh, I forgot pagan.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.580
We all had kids.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.930
And what that meant was that we
were doing our initial lessons

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:40.570
in having polyamorous extended
family in a way in which we

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.110
could not compartmentalize
our relationships.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.100
Everybody knew
everybody, our children

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.000
played with everybody
else's children.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.980
We could go to sex
parties because somebody

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.310
would stay home with and throw
a pajama party for the kids.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.784
These were our children's
brothers and sisters,

00:31:56.784 --> 00:31:58.700
which took care of the
problem that many of us

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.033
were having in a one or two
child family, because that's

00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:02.610
what middle class
modern people do.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:08.500
And so our kids didn't
have as many siblings

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.550
as they might have had.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.840
So if I was dating somebody
and then we came to a bad thing

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:16.030
and we didn't want to do that
anymore, we wanted to change,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.720
we couldn't go hunt.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.260
Because we'd have to rip our
children out of their family to

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.820
do it.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.760
So much like the serial
monogamy of people who get

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.602
divorced and remarried.

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:28.560
When you have children,
there's a lot of reason

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.100
to say, well, we
should all decide

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.849
that we're on the same
side, because we're

00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:33.450
raising this child.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:37.610
And we need to figure out
what our best behavior is,

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.540
and what kind of role model we
want to present for children.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.550
And that gave us
a lot of impetus

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.554
and a lot of desire to not
act like idiots and go,

00:32:45.554 --> 00:32:46.970
I'll never speak
to you again, you

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.345
know, because I was going to
have to speak to that person

00:32:49.345 --> 00:32:53.270
again, or lose my
entire support system.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.130
And so we learned to
speak to each other,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:01.160
even after troubled breakups
and painful misconnections.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.472
I thought that was a very good
thing, our kids just benefit.

00:33:04.472 --> 00:33:06.930
Kids are designed to grow up
in little villages of maybe 40

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.420
people, in tribes.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.799
Babies are like puppies.

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.590
If you've ever had a
friend who had a puppy

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.131
and you played with the puppy
and came back six months later,

00:33:15.131 --> 00:33:17.700
it seemed like the
puppy recognized you?

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.350
Babies are like that.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.840
They can register about
40 people, possibly more.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.960
I don't know, that
was about what we had.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.479
And they love each other.

00:33:25.479 --> 00:33:26.270
They're just happy.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.480
They recognize people.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.860
They know what it is.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.760
And this means the child has
a lot of adult resources,

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.050
and the parents have
a lot of resources,

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:40.040
because that minimizes the
time we spend losing sleep

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.770
with screaming babies and
feeling like we're exhausted

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.470
or taken beyond our resources.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.727
Children are very challenging.

00:33:46.727 --> 00:33:48.310
It's very hard raising
young children.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.230
It's a lot of work,
and if you have

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.340
plenty of adults around
to share the burden,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.276
it becomes more of a
joy and a lot easier.

00:33:55.276 --> 00:33:57.400
LOGAN URY: If you're
comfortable speaking about it,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.191
I'd love to hear how
your daughter reflects

00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:00.097
on her childhood.

00:34:00.097 --> 00:34:02.430
DOSSIE EASTON: You will all
understand this, my daughter

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.210
Bea, my daughter
with me, we have

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.400
an agreement that I do not
speak in any specific way

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.637
about her life.

00:34:07.637 --> 00:34:08.136
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:08.136 --> 00:34:10.280
LOGAN URY: I figured
that might be the case.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.571
DOSSIE EASTON: You might
figure out if I were your mom,

00:34:12.571 --> 00:34:14.334
you might want it that way too.

00:34:14.334 --> 00:34:15.326
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:15.326 --> 00:34:18.179
LOGAN URY: Makes sense, yeah.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:22.334
So what's your relationship
between polyamory and feminism?

00:34:22.334 --> 00:34:24.000
DOSSIE EASTON: Well,
when I started out,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.070
that was the beginning
of my feminism.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:30.540
I was determined to, I
decided in that day--

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.320
and I was coming out of a
very scary relationship that

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.199
had really everything to do with
sexism and then nothing to do

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:37.699
with it.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.170
Because my partner,
my daughter's father,

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.389
had his first psychotic
episode after we

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.857
decided to have a
child, and became

00:34:45.857 --> 00:34:47.940
a paranoid schizophrenic,
which happens sometimes.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.480
Some forms of mental
illness occur in adulthood.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.780
We were both 25.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.580
And he became dangerous
and violent and scary,

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.810
so I was quite traumatized
when I got there.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.520
But I was also very angry.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.470
I was really aware that he was
taking out his frustrations

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.065
by hitting me, and
threatening to kill me

00:35:06.065 --> 00:35:09.100
and chasing me around, the lies,
all kinds of horrible stuff.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:09.725
I had to leave.

00:35:09.725 --> 00:35:11.460
I mean, it's like I can't
raise a child in this.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.530
This isn't possible.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:18.690
And so it was a big
lesson, because what

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:23.090
is it in the culture that says
that if you're feeling small,

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.980
one way to go about feeling
big and feeling more powerful,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.396
if you're feeling
powerless, is to take

00:35:28.396 --> 00:35:29.770
someone smaller
than you and make

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.730
them feel even smaller yet.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.730
This is one of the basic
difficulties of sexism,

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.340
and of how we look at sexuality.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.000
Prison sex is like this.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.470
The person who penetrates
is believed to gain power.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.940
The person who is
penetrated is believed

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:49.330
to lose power, become
lower in the hierarchy.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.200
Janet said this, quoted
me on this to somebody

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.506
who answered, oh yeah,
but that's true, isn't it?

00:35:55.506 --> 00:35:56.880
And she said, oh
you mean sort of

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.670
like plugging in an electrical
cord to the circuit.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.580
I like that metaphor.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.445
Where is the power?

00:36:03.445 --> 00:36:05.320
Where is the power?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.260
So it was a big part
of my feminism, both

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.800
to grasp my sexuality the
way I wanted to grasp it,

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.739
and I decided not to be
a partner for five years

00:36:13.739 --> 00:36:16.030
so that I could find out who
I was when I wasn't trying

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.335
to be somebody's wife.

00:36:17.335 --> 00:36:19.190
That was really important to me.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:23.020
I vowed to take my relationships
with women seriously,

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.890
and wound up in
relationships with women,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.650
and even identifying as a dyke.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:31.770
And all of that was part of
me finding out who I was,

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.790
and starting to value the parts
of me that I had been taught

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:37.750
were not valuable because
they were unwomanly,

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.830
like, for instance,
being intelligent.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.570
We'll get back to that one.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.200
So it was a great voyage
of exploration for me,

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.420
I consider myself a
reformed clinging vine.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.310
But what's interesting
in polyamory,

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:53.890
when you're looking at
what kind of a grownup

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:58.070
you're going to be, whatever
you were told you should be,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.150
is that every
relationship you have

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.608
to decide what you want the
boundaries of that relationship

00:37:02.608 --> 00:37:03.239
to be.

00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:04.030
You have create it.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.170
You have to be aware of what
it's limits are going to be.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.840
And this is very strengthening
because the power belongs

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.570
to each of us to make
those decisions about how

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.750
we want to regard any given
relationship in our lives,

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.100
instead of trying to be
somebody else's version of what

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.890
a relationship is
supposed to look like.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.420
LOGAN URY: Thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.110
So the first edition of "The
Ethical Slut" came out in 1999,

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.455
is that right?

00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:31.080
DOSSIE EASTON: 1997,
actually, but yes.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.913
LOGAN URY: 1997, and
then the second version

00:37:32.913 --> 00:37:35.770
came out in 2009, I'd love
to hear what changes you

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.130
made over that period of time.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.470
And then what changes
you might hope or expect

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.626
to see 10 years from now.

00:37:42.626 --> 00:37:45.250
DOSSIE EASTON: First, I want to
give a total vote of confidence

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:47.590
and thanks, thanks to
Janet, my co-author,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.570
thanks to my lovers
and my lover's lovers,

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.790
and all those people.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:52.670
But also particularly
thanks for my clients,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.586
because the difference
between those two books

00:37:54.586 --> 00:38:02.240
was, however many years it
was, 12 years or something,

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.100
me seeing people
in my office who

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.680
maybe came from
parts of the culture

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.940
that I would not
normally have met them.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.599
Maybe they were more
conservative than me.

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:12.390
That's pretty easy.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.020
So I got to learn
a lot, and a lot

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.890
of that learning--
what happened was,

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.380
because of the first edition
was popular and got around

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.590
to a lot of places, I learned
how a lot of different people

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.620
do poly.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.910
And that was something
that is reflected in here.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.270
There's a lot more
diversity in here, I think.

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.820
The other case was that I
had been doing a lot of work

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.640
so I had exercises
that I did as homework.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.820
And we included those
exercises in here.

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.590
So there's an aspect
of the second edition

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.650
that you use like a
workbook, and try things

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:49.880
and find out, that might guide
your exploration into who

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.659
you want to be as a slut.

00:38:52.659 --> 00:38:55.200
And how you want your life to
be, and what kind of agreements

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.990
you might want to make with
your various partners and so on.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.020
So that's new.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.750
We have some stuff, but not an
awful lot about internet sex.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.565
Because neither
of us are-- well,

00:39:05.565 --> 00:39:07.440
maybe I don't notice it
because she wrote it,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.356
because I don't do it.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.862
Somebody else needs
to write that book.

00:39:13.862 --> 00:39:14.820
We are not millennials.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.195
We didn't grow up
with computers.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.582
So that's not so much in
there, but there is also

00:39:22.582 --> 00:39:23.415
just some expansion.

00:39:23.415 --> 00:39:24.290
There's new chapters.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.550
There's a chapter on
being a single slut.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.910
And a nice long discussion of
the rights and responsibilities

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.420
that become sort of like saying,
well, if I'm a single slut,

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.236
and I'm an outsider to
somebody's marriage,

00:39:36.236 --> 00:39:38.860
but I'm a member that family by
virtue of fucking someone who's

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.670
in it, then what are my rights?

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.070
What are my responsibilities?

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.176
And the rights
part is important,

00:39:45.176 --> 00:39:46.800
because if you look
at these people who

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.659
say they're going to cure your
marriage of having affairs,

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:52.200
the first thing they talk about
is who they're going to dump.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.574
And they think
that other person,

00:39:53.574 --> 00:39:56.680
they treat them like
they're not human.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.180
That other person doesn't count.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.200
Get rid of them.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.360
They're a home wrecker,
or some such thing.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.590
They don't count.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.550
And in fact, everybody
counts in poly.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.510
So if I don't honor my
lovers' other relationships,

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.910
I'm failing as a poly person.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.300
If they don't honor my
presence there, than they

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.340
are feeling me.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.860
And so that part I think
is really important,

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.850
and it's in here.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.266
And the other thing
that's in here

00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:27.457
is a chapter called opening
a poly relationship.

00:40:27.457 --> 00:40:29.040
And curiously enough
that one wound up

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.440
having a big
section on cheating.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.630
The reason being, that a lot
of people came into my office

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.130
where in fact wanting to
open a relationship that

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.892
in fact was already open only
one partner didn't know that.

00:40:42.892 --> 00:40:44.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.802
Sometimes both partners
didn't know that.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.500
So I began to realize
that a lot of people

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.220
come to thinking about poly
and thinking maybe this

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.457
is an answer for me because
they have been cheating.

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.540
And I started looking at
that kind of differently.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.260
I also see a lot of sex
workers, and I haven't ever

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.990
seen this thing, but one
of my sex worker friends

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:11.210
who is a sex worker activist,
was writing her master's degree

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:14.430
or master's thesis
on family structures,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.522
including the sex workers
as members of the family.

00:41:18.522 --> 00:41:20.730
Not maybe known to most of
the members of the family,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.900
but they're there and
they're part of the ecology

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.760
of the whole system.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.360
They're providing an
important sustenance of sorts.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:32.870
And so I also got a lot
sex workers' clients.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:36.463
And in fact if you're
cheating, seeing a sex worker

00:41:36.463 --> 00:41:38.030
is a more honorable
way to cheat,

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.560
because to be honorable
and cheat your partner's

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.650
never supposed to know.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.940
That's the honorable
way of cheating.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.730
I know that sounds crazy
but there's an ethics to it.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.930
For people who felt that
their partners would never

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.880
allow them, for
instance, to explore SM,

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.700
or to explore gender,
or to explore whatever

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.120
it is, who had husbands and
wives and children and houses

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.599
and families that they valued.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:04.140
And they didn't want to have to
leave their families in order

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:08.820
to explore more completely
who they are by trying

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.120
on these various roles.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.130
Sex work becomes a way with
good boundaries that is about as

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.210
honorable so you can get.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.430
Because the other thing in
poly is that we do take it

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.705
that desire is important.

00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:25.080
That when I have
a desire, when I

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.060
have a fantasy
that calls to me, I

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.000
can benefit from
listening to that call.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.010
If I'm free, if I've set up my
life so I'm free, that I can go

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.420
and just answer that call.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.570
Because one of
things poly gives you

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.486
is that you can have
relationships with people

00:42:40.486 --> 00:42:43.070
that you would not dream of
sharing your checkbook with.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.340
But you can find out what
that call is, you can find out

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.870
who that attractive person is.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.440
And presuming that you respect
them and they respect you,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.790
you're in business.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.660
And you don't have to be
prepared to share a mortgage

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.819
or raise a child
with that person.

00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:02.610
LOGAN URY: Well, this
has been fascinating,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.920
and definitely the most times
I've heard the word fuck

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.130
use in a talk to Google.

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:09.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.430
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.930
LOGAN URY: We're
going to open it up

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.221
to questions from the audience.

00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:15.010
I see a lot of
interested faces here.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.718
DOSSIE EASTON: I do
want to say something

00:43:16.718 --> 00:43:19.350
while we're getting the mic
organized, about the word fuck.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.970
There's no other active verb
to describe that activity.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:30.186
We have sex, we get nooky,
we get lucky, we cop a feel,

00:43:30.186 --> 00:43:31.510
we often steal.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:34.090
But the language
is all about sex

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.812
as something, a
thing that you get,

00:43:35.812 --> 00:43:38.270
and so fucking is the only verb
that says this is something

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.927
that you do.

00:43:38.927 --> 00:43:39.593
AUDIENCE: Screw.

00:43:39.593 --> 00:43:39.746
Mate.

00:43:39.746 --> 00:43:39.900
Copulate.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.691
DOSSIE EASTON: That's
why I use it so much.

00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:43.589
AUDIENCE: Copulate.

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:44.880
DOSSIE EASTON: Screw, copulate.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.380
Well, copulate is another way.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.720
It's like saying the
only clean words are

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.845
ones that are multi-syllabic
and in dead languages.

00:43:49.845 --> 00:43:52.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:52.692 --> 00:43:54.650
It's true that copulate
and fornicate are fine.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.275
They are there.

00:43:55.275 --> 00:43:58.510
They sound like diseases.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.744
LOGAN URY: OK, let's start
with a question over here.

00:44:00.744 --> 00:44:02.410
AUDIENCE: Not to dis
the word polyamory,

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:04.535
but it is a multi-syllabic
word in a dead language.

00:44:04.535 --> 00:44:09.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:12.640
So I have like 60
questions I could ask.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.310
But I think the one that
probably hit me most

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:18.440
is, you're delightfully
pandering to this audience.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.190
I appreciate that.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.980
We're all smart people
yadda, yadda, yadda.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.830
We're all privileged to
be in this environment.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:32.250
In my circles, I have had often
the sort of accusation, maybe,

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.720
levied that poly is something
for rich white people,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.510
or some flavor of that.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:42.100
That you have to be in a certain
economic class or situation

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.560
in order for it to be OK.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.016
My own experience differs,
greatly, from that.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:47.890
But I'm wondering how
much you've heard that,

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.062
and what your response to
that sort of framing is.

00:44:51.062 --> 00:44:52.770
DOSSIE EASTON: Well,
I think that there's

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.186
a certain amount of truth to
it, in the sense that we have

00:44:55.186 --> 00:44:57.240
to recognize-- I talked
about agrarian families,

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.320
where they get together so
the children don't starve.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.990
Well, we have families
in this country,

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.390
often farming families.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:06.790
I'm a first generation American.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.790
My family came over
to this country.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.250
My grandparents were
domestic servants.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.280
So I come from a very
working class background.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.160
My parents worked, crawled their
way up to white collar jobs,

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.100
and were very dedicated to
getting education for us.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.944
So that kind of
cemented family has

00:45:26.944 --> 00:45:28.860
been very important for
people who are getting

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.660
a toehold in this world.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.060
Especially people
immigrate from elsewhere.

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.970
People coming into this
country from Syria,

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:39.190
the great debate now, are
going to need to their families

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.740
the way most of the
people in this room don't.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.330
Most of you could leave
your blood families,

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.220
and could leave a partner,
without putting yourself

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:53.139
in danger of starving or
having no job or no life.

00:45:53.139 --> 00:45:55.430
That doesn't mean you can
easily come out of the closet

00:45:55.430 --> 00:46:00.169
everywhere, not even here,
but you have that freedom.

00:46:00.169 --> 00:46:01.710
And many people in
the culture don't.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.130
So I think there is
a kind of, there's

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.050
a certain privilege
associated with this.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.490
Now many, many young people
of families like my family

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.380
immigrant families
that worked really

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.974
hard to get a foothold
in the culture,

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.140
including those who had a
harder job than my family.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.389
Because my family was Northern
European, so I'm white,

00:46:21.389 --> 00:46:23.645
so I have an advantage in
that, that's a privilege.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.160
We're seeing a lot more people
from immigrant families,

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.090
and from poor families, and
so on in this generation.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:40.300
In places like here
and in the sex world.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.090
It has been largely
a very white world,

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.673
the world of sex
parties and sex clubs

00:46:43.673 --> 00:46:47.070
and all that kind of stuff, and
a very middle class, educated

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.930
world.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.200
So sometimes we have to
realize, and how do we

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.446
welcome people who come from
the world that I grew up in.

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.820
This world, when
my parents lived

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.010
through two world
wars and a depression,

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:03.340
they were in danger of starving.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.402
And so their values
I came to realize

00:47:08.402 --> 00:47:10.110
were different from
mine, because they've

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.300
been endangered.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.486
And the way that they raised
me I was never in danger.

00:47:14.486 --> 00:47:16.110
So there's a lot of
privilege in there.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:18.200
I agree.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.070
That doesn't mean
we shouldn't do it.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.945
It just means that
there's a lot of privilege

00:47:21.945 --> 00:47:23.312
and we should acknowledge that.

00:47:23.312 --> 00:47:24.895
LOGAN URY: Another
question out there.

00:47:24.895 --> 00:47:27.280
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned earlier,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.220
when you talked about
educated people,

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:34.250
you talked about video game
culture, and the being outcast,

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.470
et cetera.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.760
In recent years, it's very clear
that this video game culture

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.510
has actually been very
toxic do anti feminist, very

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.320
sexist and male centric people,
even though supposedly we

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.010
are out.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:54.360
So can you say anything
about that point?

00:47:54.360 --> 00:48:01.740
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah, I think
that Mortal Combat, Black Ops,

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:05.410
is not really the best
thing to feed your children.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.910
So I really don't think
it's the best thing at all.

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.200
And I think it's an
unfortunate part of our culture

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.200
that we get, we decide
that the way we're

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.680
going to get adrenaline
raisers in this world

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.300
is not going and doing something
exciting with our friends,

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.887
which we could do, by pretending
to kill lots of people.

00:48:21.887 --> 00:48:23.470
I remember running
across a little boy

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.030
was about 10 years
old who was playing

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.571
a video game many years ago,
the first time I'd ever seen it.

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:30.322
I looked at the game, and I
said does anything ever pop up

00:48:30.322 --> 00:48:31.530
you're not supposed to shoot?

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:34.165
And he said, no,
that's interesting.

00:48:34.165 --> 00:48:40.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.490
So yeah I think there's a big
question about these, about

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:44.590
this culture.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:51.840
And yet again, I mean
these are ways that people

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.890
develop computer skills.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:56.450
They really do,
and so they are now

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.760
a part of our learning
experience for everybody.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.340
I think that the idea that
it so much about combat,

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.120
and that there's a whole
bunch of very, very

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.180
sexist with
occasional woman hero

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:13.760
you know, but that's been
happening for awhile.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.510
I recently had a
big surgery and had

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.300
to figure out how to rest a
lot, and I did 132 episodes

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.760
of Xena Warrior Princess.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:24.672 --> 00:49:27.117
LOGAN URY: Question over there.

00:49:27.117 --> 00:49:29.120
AUDIENCE: So on the
topic of jealousy,

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.840
we were talking about
how, with experience, you

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.530
develop kind of an
emotional maturity,

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.700
a physiological
maturity, but have you

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.380
in your experience
had clients in therapy

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:46.120
or elsewhere that are
younger, but have found ways

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.120
to handle jealousy
in a mature way?

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.380
DOSSIE EASTON: Of
course, absolutely.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.390
People grow up in
different circumstances.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.160
For instance, the triggers
from the amygdala,

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.590
I am a survivor of a violent
childhood so I know this.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.950
In people who are
trauma survivors,

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.430
there is a lot more,
the triggers are bigger,

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:09.380
they are a lot
harder to deal with.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.619
They're more work.

00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:13.660
So in people who have had
very unsafe childhoods,

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.590
were very triggered,
I've had people

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.890
who had a incredibly hard
time because a father

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:23.840
left the family with no
resources whatsoever.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.720
They were homeless and
whatever, terrible traumas

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.010
that can be associated
with this sort of thing.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.510
And so some people
have a much harder job

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.820
to do if they want to
overcome the triggers,

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.010
and there you have
another question.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:41.075
Because it's a lot of work.

00:50:41.075 --> 00:50:42.450
It's a lot of work
for people who

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.930
haven't been so
traumatized, but it's

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:45.760
a lot of work to learn to
operate your own triggers.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.470
Now there's a
benefit, obviously,

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:50.740
because that means that
your triggers don't own you

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:51.990
in any situation.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.450
So if you work on
them because you

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.110
want the freedom to fuck
around, here you go again

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.800
but that's what I do.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.680
Slut, one syllable
word in English.

00:51:06.432 --> 00:51:08.140
Then you want to do
that work because you

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.724
want to claim your
freedom, and one

00:51:09.724 --> 00:51:12.390
of the places where this becomes
difficult with some people that

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:17.010
come into my office are people
who actually have no desire

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.218
whatsoever to do the work.

00:51:18.218 --> 00:51:19.676
And if they were
going to do it, it

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:23.610
would only be to please or
perhaps hold onto a spouse.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.660
And that's not enough
motivation for a lot of people,

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.990
because it's painful.

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:31.800
There is no way around jealousy.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.430
You have to go
through it, you have

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.194
to be willing to experience
it, and start to work with it

00:51:36.194 --> 00:51:38.110
and take care of yourself
and nurture yourself

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:39.090
while you're having it.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.847
You can't just count
on avoiding it.

00:51:41.847 --> 00:51:43.430
And so for the person
who never wanted

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:47.610
to do this in the
first place, it

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.760
can become something
that they do not

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.570
have the resources to conquer.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:54.550
I take great pride
that some of the people

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.700
in these situations
who've come to my office

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.867
decide to be monogamous.

00:51:58.867 --> 00:52:00.700
Because I don't want
to be a therapist who's

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.280
shoving my agenda
down people's throats.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.450
I'm willing to be
there, but I'm not

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.240
willing to say that
they ought to be

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.580
different from how they are.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.038
I'm willing to say, this is
the work that needs to be done,

00:52:12.038 --> 00:52:14.700
and it's hard
because X, Y, Z. You

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.860
have to decide if it's
worth doing for you,

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.470
or if you'd rather wait 10 years
til the children are older.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:24.427
What is it, whatever
is real in your life.

00:52:24.427 --> 00:52:26.510
Thank you for that question,
it's a good question.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.490
AUDIENCE: Really appreciate
you sharing your perspective

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:33.340
from the late '60s all
the way through now

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.970
in terms of seeing the
tremendous social change that's

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:40.030
happened around how we perceive
and think about the sexuality.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.320
I want to revisit actually
the question from before,

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:46.430
so between the first and second
edition, and then maybe down

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.656
the road what kinds of
changes you might anticipate

00:52:50.656 --> 00:52:52.280
or what kinds of
developments or trends

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.840
would you see between now
and maybe the third edition,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.240
or in the decades ahead?

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.994
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah, we're
actually sort of getting it.

00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:03.410
They want you to do another
addition every 10 years or so,

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.070
it's like publicity and so on.

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.240
I'm not really sure.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.910
I think that we would
have to look at,

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.949
I kind of learned in
the process of doing it.

00:53:14.949 --> 00:53:17.240
And I don't have a clear
vision about what I could add.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.590
The one thing,
there is some stuff,

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.320
the brain science
I quoted to you,

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.632
is also quoted in this book.

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:23.340
In this addition.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.423
It's not in the first
edition because the research

00:53:25.423 --> 00:53:26.344
hadn't happened yet.

00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:27.760
And so I'm going
to assume there's

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.740
going to be more research
about emotions and about states

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.906
of consciousness by then.

00:53:33.906 --> 00:53:35.530
That's what my interest
is, I'm working

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.430
on a book called Shadow Play.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.990
About journeys into
shadow, and why

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.340
we find "Little Red Riding
and The Big Bad Wolf"

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.360
a big sexy story.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.430
And what happens if we
decide to do a role play,

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:50.860
and where do we get to go and
journey, and what happens?

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.890
So that's what I'm kind of
interested in exploring right

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.570
now, the intersection
of eros and kind

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:01.550
of Jungian shadow stuff.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:04.029
And that's what's
interesting me.

00:54:04.029 --> 00:54:05.820
I don't know what the
next book would bring

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.903
it's kind of an adventure.

00:54:06.903 --> 00:54:07.830
We go to write it.

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:12.570
We kind of live with them
when we're writing it.

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:15.220
This book brought many
surprises as well.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.220
AUDIENCE: One of the
things when I was first

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:21.820
exploring the sort of
expressions of polyamory

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:25.720
in society, I'd always felt
something along these lines.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:29.220
But by learning about how people
talk about polyamory, there

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.175
was a great deal of distinction
between rules based poly

00:54:32.175 --> 00:54:34.550
and this idea of hierarchy,
where you're primarily

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:37.510
and secondary, versus
other people who

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.237
have sort of
something some people

00:54:39.237 --> 00:54:41.320
are calling relationship
anarchy, where everything

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.740
is consistently negotiated.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.800
And there's all sorts of
different formulations.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:50.860
I guess I'm not interested in a
historical examination of that.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:54.430
But as a psychologist,
where do you

00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:58.050
find people best
make use of rules,

00:54:58.050 --> 00:54:59.640
best make use of flexibility?

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.490
Like, how does that play out
in your experience with clients

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.679
and in your own experience?

00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:05.470
DOSSIE EASTON: Well,
you'll see in the book

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.720
that I don't talk about rules.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.300
I talk about agreements.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.092
And sometimes I get
snarky with my clients.

00:55:10.092 --> 00:55:11.133
"She broke an agreement."

00:55:11.133 --> 00:55:12.640
I guess she didn't
agree about that.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.840
There we are.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.820
And sometimes that's
something that I come down on.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.570
If it's safer sex, I
care about that a lot.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.700
Sometimes it's like
something that you go, well,

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.200
how are you guys
going to negotiate?

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.965
Why don't we talk about
what the emotional cost is

00:55:28.965 --> 00:55:30.048
of both of your positions?

00:55:33.544 --> 00:55:35.460
Relationship anarchy is
an interesting notion.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.320
And I hear it in
two different ways.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.450
I have always been
a person who I

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.010
guess would be described as
a relationship anarchist.

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:53.160
But I've never used that
language, because I don't like,

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.200
in general, the kind
of dualism that's

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.680
about rankings and hierarchies.

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.240
I'm wandering around
snarkily saying,

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.770
you know, how many
Olympic athletes can you

00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:03.510
name that won bronze medals?

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.260
We only count the people
at the top of the ladder,

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.200
and that means nobody counts,
or very few people count,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.450
and that's a drag.

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.390
My understanding is
that we need agreements.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.140
And some degree-- and
this varies enormously

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:19.180
by people-- some degree of
predictability is important.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.720
Almost no one could
tolerate simply

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.030
being blindsided constantly.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:26.990
So if anarchist just means
I won't make agreements,

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.800
that's a problem.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.380
If anarchist means we negotiate
agreements as they fit,

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.140
and if we are-- I have
a wonderful poly family

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:41.910
in my practice who are
currently pregnant.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.180
There's an originating couple
who are married legally,

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.890
and then they each are married
to someone else in a way that

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:48.180
is not legal but pagan.

00:56:50.654 --> 00:56:52.070
They are planning
to have children

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.720
in all these combinations.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.590
And I have a friend who's
a family lawyer who loves

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.930
this challenge of, like, OK.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:05.090
You go visit Dylan, and have
him make whatever agreements you

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.256
guys can figure out how to
make and about how you're

00:57:07.256 --> 00:57:08.756
going to deal with
the college fund,

00:57:08.756 --> 00:57:11.530
and so on, if you're
having children

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:14.492
between all these different
sets of parents in one family.

00:57:14.492 --> 00:57:16.200
And they are doing a
beautiful job of it.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.680
It's amazing.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.340
They support each other
when people have hard times.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:22.094
They all get in
there and help out

00:57:22.094 --> 00:57:24.260
the person who's feeling
bad, even if they start out

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:26.426
by expressing it by being
very angry about something

00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:27.490
or whatever.

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.415
So it could be a very
nice thing, in that sense.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.680
It's interesting because
talking about adrenalin raisers

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.490
in the games, there's
a relationship

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:42.890
between structure
and risk that has

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:45.280
to do with how awake we get.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:48.410
There's actually an ideal,
in any situation there's

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:52.570
kind of an ideal balance between
structure, which is safety,

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.110
and risk, which is expansive
and maybe challenging.

00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:59.660
Because if it's too
structured, it feels too safe.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:00.490
It's boring.

00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:02.110
And people get restless.

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:07.242
And if it's too unstructured,
too anarchist, if you will,

00:58:07.242 --> 00:58:09.700
then people get scared because
they can't find their place.

00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.720
This comes from
research into groups.

00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.030
Where people work the
best and function the best

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:15.449
is in some balance in between.

00:58:15.449 --> 00:58:16.490
LOGAN URY: State of flow.

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:18.349
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah.

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:19.640
Does that answer your question?

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.280
It's a little abstract

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, kind of.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.200
I would quibble with some of
the ways you used the word

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.777
anarchist, but I
get what you mean.

00:58:25.777 --> 00:58:26.610
DOSSIE EASTON: Yeah.

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:28.610
You nodded to me--
by the way, he

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.139
nodded when I said
if anarchist just

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.680
means that you don't
make agreements,

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.120
you shook your head.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:33.970
And I agree.

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:34.779
That's quite true.

00:58:34.779 --> 00:58:36.320
LOGAN URY: I think
we should continue

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.780
that conversation over lunch.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.717
But I feel so grateful that you
came and that I work in a place

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:42.300
where we could have
this conversation.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.530
And it's really been eye
opening to have you here.

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.260
So thank you so
much for joining us.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:48.135
DOSSIE EASTON: No, thank
you for inviting me.

00:58:48.135 --> 00:58:49.120
