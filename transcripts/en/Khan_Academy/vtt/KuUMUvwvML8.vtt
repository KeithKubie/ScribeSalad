00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.540
Let's say I have a
magnetic field

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.220
popping out of this video.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.010
So these little brown circles
show us the tips of the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.420
vectors popping out
of our screen.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.800
And in that magnetic field I
have this wire, this off-white

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.760
colored wire.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.630
And sitting on that off-white
colored wire I have a charge

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.990
of charge Q.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.250
Let me write down
the other stuff.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.940
So this is the magnetic
field B coming out.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.520
Let's say I were to take
this whole wire.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.390
And let's say that the wire
overlaps with the magnetic

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.820
field a distance of L.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.760
So let's say the magnetic
field stops

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.800
here and stops here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.650
And let's say that this distance
right here, that

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.660
distance is L.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.300
I drew it a little bit weird
but you get the idea.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.750
From here to here is L.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.090
I have this charge sitting on
some type of conductor that we

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.170
can consider a wire.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.770
And the magnetic field is
pushing out of the page.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.720
So in this current formation,
let's say I don't have any

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.050
voltage across this
wire or anything.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.560
What's going to happen?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.500
Well, if I just have a
stationary charge sitting in a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200
magnetic field, nothing really
is going to happen, right?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.920
Because we know that the force
due to a magnetic field is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.880
equal to the charge times the
cross product of the velocity

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770
of the charge and the
magnetic field.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.480
If this wires are stationary and
there's no voltage across

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.620
it, et cetera, et cetera, the
velocity of this charge is

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.660
going to be 0.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.950
So if the velocity is 0, we know
that the magnitude of a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.670
cross product is the
same thing as--.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.960
So Q is, that's just a scalar
quantity-- so that's just Q--

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.390
times the magnitude of the
velocity times the magnitude

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.140
of B times sine theta.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.430
And in these situations where
anything that's going on in

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.780
this plane is going to
be perpendicular to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.720
this magnetic field--.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.190
So the angle between the
magnetic field and any

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.220
velocity-- if there were any
within this plane-- would be

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.710
90 degrees.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.640
So you wouldn't have to worry
about the sine theta too much.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.039
But we see if the velocity is
0 or the speed is 0, the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.850
magnitude of the velocity is 0,
that there's not going to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.570
be any net force due to the
magnetic field on this charge.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.950
And nothing interesting's
going to happen.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.650
But let's do a little
experiment.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.210
What happens if I were to move
this wire, if I were to shift

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.320
it to the left, with
the velocity V?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.020
So I take this wire and I shift
it to the left with the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.935
velocity V.

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:37.180
All right, so the whole wire
is shifting to the left.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.270
Well, if the whole wire is
shifting to the left, this

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.070
charge is sitting on that wire,
so that charge is also

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.730
going to move to the left
with the velocity V.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.870
And now things get
interesting.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.090
The charge is moving to the left
with the velocity V, so

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.340
now we can apply the
first magnetism

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.460
formula that we learned.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.630
We could apply this formula.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.490
So what's going to happen
to this charge?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.950
Well, the force of the charge
is going to be the charge

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.300
times the magnitude of the
velocity cross the magnetic

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.680
field vector.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.820
So we know that there's going
to be some net force.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.080
This is non-zero now.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.510
And this is non-zero,
we're assuming.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.670
And we're assuming the
charge is non-zero.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.170
So what direction is the
force going to be in?

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.350
So let's do our right hand rule
on the cross product.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.420
V cross B will give
us the direction.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.740
So point your index finger in
the direction of the velocity.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.330
I have to look at my own
hand to make sure

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.450
I'm doing it right.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.230
So you point your index
finger in the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.440
direction of the velocity.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.540
Point your middle finger
in the direction of

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.510
the magnetic field.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.440
The magnetic field is popping
out of the page, so your

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.630
middle finger is actually
going to be

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.710
popping out of the page.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.430
Your next two fingers
are just going to do

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.190
something like that.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.520
So you're kind of approximating
like you're

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.580
shooting a gun.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.030
And then what's your
thumb going to do?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.500
Your thumb is going to
point straight up.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.660
This is the palm of--
that's your thumb.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.710
This could be your nail,
fingernail, fingernail of your

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.160
thumb, fingernail of
your middle finger.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.940
This is the direction
of the velocity.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.120
Let me get a suitable color.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.960
The velocity is that way.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.180
The magnetic field is popping
out of the page.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.100
So the force on the particle--
on this charged particle or on

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.480
this charge-- due to the
magnetic field is going to go

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.700
in the direction
of your thumb.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.005
So the direction of the force
is in this direction.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.210
So what's going to happen?

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.630
There's going to be a
net force in this

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.330
direction on the charge.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.560
And the charge is going to
move upwards, right?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.830
I mean, when you start having
a moving-- you could imagine

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.450
also that you had multiple
charges, right?

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.040
If you had multiple charges
here and you're moving the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.670
whole wire, all of those
charges are going

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.910
to be moving upwards.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.670
And what is another way to call
a bunch of moving charges

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.010
along a conductor?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.015
Well, it's a current, depending
on how much charge

00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:56.380
is moving per second.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.940
So at least in very qualitative
terms, you see

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.810
that when you move a wire
through a magnetic field or

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140
when you move a magnetic field
past a wire, right?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.450
Because they're kind of the same
thing, it's all about the

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.530
relative motion.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.200
But if you move a wire through
a magnetic field, it is

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.950
actually going to induce
a current in the wire.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.600
It's going to induce the current
in the wire, and

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.990
actually this is how electric
generators are generated.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.080
And I'll do a whole series of
videos on how you-- you know,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.410
if you're using coal or steam or
hydropower, how that turns,

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.700
essentially that turns these
generators around and it

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.530
induces current.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.070
And that's how we get
electricity from all of these

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.040
various energy sources
that essentially just

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.020
make turbines turn.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.310
But anyway, let's go back
to what we were doing.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.240
So let me ask you a question.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.070
If this particle-- and this
all has a point-- if this

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.760
particle starts at
the beginning.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.120
Let's say the particle
is right here.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.880
So it starts right where the
magnetic field starts

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.210
affecting the wire.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.610
And how much work is going to be
done on the particle by the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.340
magnetic field?

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.080
Well, what's work?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:13.120
Work is equal to force times
distance, where the force has

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.990
to be in the same direction
as the distance, right?

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.770
Force times distance, I
won't mess with the

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.430
vectors right now.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.350
But they have to be in
the same direction.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.160
So how much work is going to
be done on this particle?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.950
So the work is going to be the
net force exerted on the

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.030
particle times the distance.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.690
Well, this distance
is L, right?

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.320
We say, once a particle gets
here there's no magnetic field

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.710
up here, so the magnetic field
will stop acting on it.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.990
So the total work done: Work,
which is equal to force times

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.480
distance, is equal to-- so the
net force is this up here.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.840
Q-- and I'll leave
some space-- V

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.060
cross B times the distance.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.190
And the distance right here is
just a scalar quantity, so we

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.830
could put it out front, right?

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.010
Q times L times V
cross B, right?

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.400
This is-- Q V cross B is the
force times the distance.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.360
That's just the work done.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.550
Now how much work is being
done per charge, right?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.510
This is how much work is being
done on this charge.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.430
But let's say there might have
been multiple charges, so we

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.050
just want to know how much
work is done per charge.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.810
So work per charge.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.990
We could divide both
sides by charge.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.350
So work per charge is equal
to this per charge.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:34.390
So it is equal to the distance
times the velocity that you're

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:41.260
pulling the wire to the left
with cross the magnetic field.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.400
This is where it gets
interesting.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.240
So what is work per charge?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.370
The units of work are
energy, right?

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.230
Joules.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.240
And charge, that's
in coulombs.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.595
So what are joules
per coulomb?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.170
This is equal to volts.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.350
Volts are joules per coulomb.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.680
So this particle, or these
charges, are going to start

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.260
moving in this direction as if
there is a voltage difference.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.840
As if there is a potential
difference between this point

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.630
and this point.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.460
As if this is the positive
voltage terminal and this is

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.230
the minus voltage terminal.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.870
So there's actually going to be
a voltage-- or a perceived

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.970
voltage-- difference between
this point and this point that

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.080
will start making the
current flow.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.870
Let's say you didn't even know
that there was a magnetic

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:29.220
field here.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.310
You would just see this
current flowing.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.530
You'd be like, oh well, there
has to be a voltage difference

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.789
there, right?

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.940
But when we're dealing with
this-- because when we talk

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.840
about voltages, that was like
a potential difference.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.900
That something-- that a particle
or a charge has a

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.990
higher potential energy and
that's why it's moving.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.100
But it's hard to-- at least for
these purposes-- say, well

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.670
you have a higher potential
energy here.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.440
It's really being created
by the magnetic field.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.450
So in this context, people
have said that instead of

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.790
saying that this is creating a
voltage difference between

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.580
this point and this point, if
the magnetic field on the

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.220
moving wire is causing that,
people say that it's creating

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.050
an electromotive force,
or an EMF.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.510
But EMF, the units are still
joules per coulomb or volts.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.350
And it really is-- in every way
when you're analyzing the

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.240
circuits-- still the same
thing as a potential

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.040
difference or as a voltage
difference.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.430
But since it seems a little bit
more proactive, it seems

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.940
like this magnetic field is
actually impacting a force on

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.030
this wire that is causing
the current to move.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.260
We call it EMF.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.300
So we could say that the EMF,
the electromotive force-- or

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.720
the voltage across from here
to here, but they're really

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.750
the same thing-- is equal to
the distance of the wire

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:47.290
that's in the magnetic field
times the velocity-- that

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.430
you're pulling the wire in--
cross the magnetic field.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.280
So let's say, I don't know,
let's just throw out a bunch

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.730
of numbers.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.780
Let's say that the magnetic
field is-- I'll

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.640
make it easy-- 2 teslas.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.340
My velocity to the left is
3 meters per second.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.000
And let's-- just for fun-- let's
give this a little bit

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.360
of a resistance, just so we
can figure out something.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.730
So let's say this resistance is,
I don't know, let's say it

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.140
is 6 ohms. There's a 6
ohm resistor here.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.000
So the resistance of the wire
from here to here is 6 ohms.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.970
All wires have some
resistance.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.920
So first of all,
what's the EMF?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.650
Oh, and let's say that
this total distance

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.420
right here is 12 meters.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.370
So the EMF induced on the-- or
the electromotive force-- put

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.950
on to the wire by the magnetic
field is going to equal the

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.980
distance of the wire
in the magnetic

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.130
field-- 12 meters-- times--.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.920
Well, when we're just taking
the cross product, we know

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.660
that the velocity is
perpendicular to

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.210
the magnetic field.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.930
So we don't have to worry about
sine theta because theta

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.240
is already 90 degrees.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.870
So we just have to worry
about the magnitudes.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.540
So it's going to be 12 meters
times the velocity, which is 3

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.660
meters per second, times the
magnetic field, or the

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.140
magnitude of the magnetic
field, that's 2 teslas.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.390
And so the EMF is 12
times 3 times 2.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.160
12 times 6.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.710
Which is 72.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.770
You could say 72 volts, or
72 joules per coulomb.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.780
And now you have that potential
difference, or that

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.640
EMF, across a 6 ohm
resistor, right?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.420
So that, you just go back to
voltage is equal to IR.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.640
Or you could write EMF
is equal to IR.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.300
So EMF divided by resistance.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.440
So if we take this EMF and we
divide it by the resistance--

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.430
divided by 6 ohms-- we get
the current, right?

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.160
EMF divided by resistance
is equal to current.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.550
So you divide 72 volts or 72
joules per coulomb divided by

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.970
6 ohms. And then you get a
current going along this wire

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.590
right here, due to the EMF, due
to the magnetic field-- I

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.770
know it's very messy at this
point-- of 12 amperes.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.450
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.490
I'll see you in the
next video.
