00:00:05.409 --> 00:00:07.950
ROB LEWORTHY: Hello, welcome to
our first ever West End event

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.130
as part of Talks at Google.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.150
My name's Rob Leworthy.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm one of the co-leads
here with Christina,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.280
and I'm very pleased to welcome
Colin Cloud and Dave Williamson

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.780
from "The Illusionists," which
is playing just over the road

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.804
at the Shaftesbury
Theatre until January 3.

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:24.720
We're going do an interview
with them shortly,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.136
but first we're
going to-- they're

00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:28.880
going to do a small
act for us-- brilliant.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.940
So let's start a round
of applause over here.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.825
You sir, could you
start applauding for me?

00:00:32.825 --> 00:00:34.950
And let's get the round of
applause going this way,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.675
this way, this way, this way.

00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:38.890
A massive [INAUDIBLE]
for Dave Williamson.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.060
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Oh!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.420
Thank you very much.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.830
There you go.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.960
That is another key difference
between the United States

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.600
and England.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.170
We always start our
applause from this side!

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.930
Amazing!

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.180
Everything's different.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.890
Well, thank you.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.960
This is great.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.620
It gives me an opportunity
to do a little magic for you,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.119
some of the things
that you wouldn't

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.130
see if you come to the show
across the street, which

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.960
we hope you do.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.870
Let me try something.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.290
Does anybody have a
piece of rope or string

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.790
about six feet in-- just
happen to have one right here.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.680
Hi, sir!

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.870
You look very intelligent
with those glasses

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.790
and sitting up front.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.930
You look like a go-getter.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.230
That's what I think you are.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.900
Would you examine
that piece of rope

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.530
and verify for all your friends
that there are no trapdoors,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.450
escaping gases, strings,
mirrors, anything like that?

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.039
No Scientology in there.

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.580
There's a little
bit on the other end

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.050
but-- does it look OK?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.090
OK, thank you very much for
dismissing the whole procedure.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.410
Oh, looks like a rope.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.270
I don't care.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.770
Because in about
two minutes, you're

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.394
going to be going,
"I wish I would have

00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:38.650
spent more time with the rope.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.150
He's doing miracles
with that thing.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.060
Obviously a trick rope, I didn't
take my job very seriously."

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.900
So here's your second chance
to really get into it.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.240
Looks like a rope.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.874
Check it out.

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:53.290
You will verify now when your
friends come to you at lunch

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.331
to go, "Really, what was
going on with the rope?"

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:58.040
You can now say with
honesty, "Looks like a rope,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.340
still looks like a rope!"

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.360
Does anybody have
a bangle or a ring

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.750
or a bracelet, solid
with no gaps or openings,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.360
about 10 inches in diameter,
steel, chrome plated?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.870
I just happened to
have one as well!

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.500
We'll use mine.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.462
Hi, sir, how are you?

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:14.420
Would you examine that?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.621
Verify that that too
is absolutely solid.

00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.870
There are no gaps or openings.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.360
There is a little
weld spot there.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.730
I see you went right to that.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.230
Yeah, very good.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.500
But I want you to make
sure it is a weld spot

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.980
and it's been chromed
over top of the weld.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.060
There are no openings
or gaps, yes.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.270
Does it look solid to you?

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.470
And I'm not going to do the hack
line, "Do you see any holes?"

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.636
And they say, "No," and I
go, "Right there, stupid."

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.440
I'm not going to do that to you.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.570
I will not insult you.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.099
And you got the memo
about the dress code.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.390
Look at this guy, look at this.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.930
He's a little David
Williamson here.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.760
Mini me!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.800
OK, Thank you.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.380
[LAUGHING]

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.140
Awesome, just
revealed my double.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.390
Now the switch will
not fool anyone.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.394
Would you hold the ring?

00:02:58.394 --> 00:02:59.810
Now here's the way
this one works.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.572
This is an old puzzle.

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:02.530
These are folk puzzles.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.140
So magicians-- modern
day magicians--

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.627
we comb through all the
archives of all the old puzzles

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:07.710
and we try to update them.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.780
How do you take the ring off the
rope without untying the knot?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.614
You can release there
Mongo, thank you.

00:03:13.614 --> 00:03:15.280
How do you take the
ring off of the rope

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.780
without untying the knot?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.364
It's kind of a Zen like concept.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.030
If you think about
it, it can't be done,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.080
but you can provide
the illusion.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.746
If I double the rope through the
ring-- when I do this for kids,

00:03:23.746 --> 00:03:25.860
I love to do magic for
people of all ages, I say,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.880
"You know, any
difficult problem is

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.794
easy to solve with
the help of a friend,

00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:31.210
and you're going
to be my friend."

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.630
I want you to hold
the ring only.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.760
Close your eyes and count
to three, seriously.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.900
He did it, nice job!

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.874
He has no idea how he
did it, but he did it.

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:43.290
So the skeptics
in the room always

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.740
say, "I know how you did that.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.320
You didn't really put
the ring on the rope.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.110
You were telling your dumb
jokes, and you went like this

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.990
and you created sort
of a confusing image.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.740
So when you pull pulled
ring off the rope,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.480
it was never really
on the rope."

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.290
And to them I say,
"That's right,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.060
that's exactly how it's done.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.560
There's no other way,
solid ring, solid rope."

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.470
I'd have to be a real
magician to actually pass

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.506
the ring through the rope.

00:04:05.506 --> 00:04:06.360
What?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.090
Here's the deal, and only
at Google would I do this,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.040
I'm going to tell
you how it's done.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.440
Yeah, because I think you
might find it interesting.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.998
Would you hold the
ring once again?

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:17.914
And what is your name?

00:04:17.914 --> 00:04:18.339
AUDIENCE: Graham.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.797
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Thank you, Graham.

00:04:19.797 --> 00:04:23.394
Pair of scissors, cutting
through the rope like that.

00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:24.810
Scissors cutting
through the rope.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.768
Sir, you act like you
see this stuff every day.

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.270
He's just like, "I see
more amazing things

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.320
on my screen every day."

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.760
This is reality, it's
not-- it is reality,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.290
it's actually happening, sir.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.400
There are two pieces of rope
which are not exactly the same.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.706
So I guess I cut it off center.

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:41.206
All right.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.684
Ab Blaster, QVC, OK thank you.

00:04:47.684 --> 00:04:48.600
Keep them stuck there.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.840
That was superglue.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.340
Bing!

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.715
No individual clapping, sir,
I appreciate that though.

00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:55.590
I don't get out much.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.470
OK, how do you--
watch the two ends

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.582
as they go into Dave's
pocket, except for this one.

00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:04.790
Stays out here with this one.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.290
Bing!

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.850
And this is the big applause
cue, the middle-- ta-dam-- bam!

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.760
Right there in the pocket.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.218
You can examine
that again, Graham.

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:11.400
Thank you very much.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.331
Thank you!

00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:12.830
OK.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.180
That went well.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.054
Let's do another one.

00:05:18.054 --> 00:05:20.200
OK, otherwise I'd just run
off and bring Colin up.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.000
But I'll try another one since
you seem to be into this stuff.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.960
Anybody shuffle cards?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.043
Does anybody know their
way around a deck of cards

00:05:26.043 --> 00:05:28.540
and know how to shuffle?

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.157
You?

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:31.240
OK, come on up here, give
him a round of applause.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.865
Thank you, sir.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.840
This is a deck of--
we call these seconds.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.870
See how it says seconds?

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.615
Shuffle them up.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:40.740
Make sure it's a real deck.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.160
At the Shaftesbury Theatre
I destroy a deck of cards

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.660
every night.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.320
We're doing over 80 performances
in the two months we're here,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.850
and I said, "I'm not bringing
80 decks of cards in my luggage.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.859
Go buy some from
the local store."

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:55.650
So they went and they
bought the cheapest--

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.390
they're called seconds,
and the printer-- there

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.360
might be little ink problems,
or there might be something

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.860
like that.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.820
That's why they're
called seconds.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.220
It doesn't look like a
regular deck of cards,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.530
but it is a regular
deck of cards.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.290
They just have some
irregular-- I don't even

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.190
know why I'm pointing that out.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.880
It's not important to the trick.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.630
Tell me your name?

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.804
AUDIENCE: Yann.

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:12.720
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Yann?

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.360
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Yann.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.530
Oh, I like that.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.120
Take any card you like, Yann.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.646
You sure?

00:06:17.646 --> 00:06:19.520
I was hoping you'd go
for the one next to it.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.886
All right, well we'll do
it a different trick, Yann.

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:23.344
Don't let me see
it, don't let me--

00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.945
[LAUGHING]

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:26.820
Yann's juggling show!

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.290
Did you get it?

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.630
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.020
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Show it to everybody.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.478
You can even show
it to the camera.

00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:37.170
I will hide my eyes here
in the blackout curtain.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.232
Can everybody see it?

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:38.852
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:40.310
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
OK, hide it, Yann.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.536
Here I come, face down.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.360
Place it back in the pack.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.660
Now let me just show
everybody, they're

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.140
all shuffled up
it's a normal deck,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.830
you put it back in the pack
anywhere you like, Yann.

00:07:01.606 --> 00:07:06.480
[LAUGHING]

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.020
--27.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.586
OK, now, Yann, your card
is shuffled into the deck.

00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:15.210
I like Yann's body
position there, he's

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.520
all closed-- never know
what to do with their hands.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.437
OK, Yann, here's
what I'm going to do.

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:20.520
Do you remember your card?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.890
DAVE WILLIAMSON: When I snap
my fingers, your card will jump

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.848
from the center of the
pack, believe it or not,

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:27.840
fly through the air, and I'll
catch it in my other hand.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.140
Are you ready for this, Yann?

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.800
I don't know this--
is it-- OK, me too.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.190
Here we go, watch.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.406
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:39.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.490
DAVE WILLIAMSON: 14 years of
my life to learn that crap.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.530
Yann, what was your card?

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.600
AUDIENCE: Spades two.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.172
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Spades
two, is that right?

00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:50.880
AUDIENCE: Sorry--

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.070
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Controversy!

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.030
AUDIENCE: Language problem here.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.199
Diamond, diamond.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.240
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Diamond?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.930
AUDIENCE: Diamond two.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.138
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Diamond two!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.790
And it's changed into
the three of clubs.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.300
That's called magic
where I come from, Yann.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.640
Was it really the spade
two, or was it the diamond

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.900
three, or what was it?

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.904
Anybody?

00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:14.320
It really was the
two of diamonds.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.174
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:15.174 --> 00:08:17.590
DAVE WILLIAMSON: OK, I'm going
to have Colin come up here,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.010
because this is not going well.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.264
There it is, right where you
left it, 27 from the top.

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:23.430
No wonder it didn't find it!

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.142
OK.

00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:27.100
When this happens-- that's
called live theater.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.994
At the Shaftesbury,
it's more rehearsed.

00:08:28.994 --> 00:08:30.410
I'm trying stuff
I've never tried.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.909
Do me a favor, put your hand
on top of the torn pieces

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.309
of the three of clubs.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:33.950
We're going to try this.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.991
It doesn't always work,
but we're going try this.

00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:39.230
We're going to take your
diamond two and stick it

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.549
under your hand.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.039
I'm going to say
the magic words.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.580
Hope to heck it works.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.170
The card that was once torn,
Yann, the three of clubs?

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.766
Ooh, a chill just went up my--

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:58.390
What could possibly
be under your hand?

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.150
Turn the pieces over,
and show the people

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.270
that you do, in fact,
have the diamond two!

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.361
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.240
There it is!

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.554
Thank you, Yann.

00:09:09.554 --> 00:09:10.220
Hold the pieces.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.870
Make a fist.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.260
Squeeze tight.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.551
Hold your hand high in the air.

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:15.040
Do you believe in
the healing powers?

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.701
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.542
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Not much.

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:20.000
No, no, where I come from you
have to have more conviction.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.900
Say, "I believe."

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.590
Repeat after me.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.420
I will never--

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420
AUDIENCE: I will never--

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.560
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Say what other--

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.410
AUDIENCE: Say what other--

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.530
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
People tell me to say.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.863
AUDIENCE: People tell me to say.

00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.000
DAVE WILLIAMSON: OK, I'm
going to blow on your hand

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.432
with my laser breath.

00:09:34.432 --> 00:09:35.750
Ooh, cool watch.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.330
Open your hand.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.520
Have those pieces indeed--
the healing powers of Yann.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.580
He will blow on your
foreheads later, and make

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.020
all the wrinkles disappear.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.140
There it is.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.422
Give it up for Yann!

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:48.420
Yann, you're awesome,
thank you so much.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.830
Wait a minute!

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.590
Go like this.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.250
Blow on your hand.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.840
Press on the card, and
say this word-- "Psst."

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.650
Like a steam press.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.150
Lift up your hand.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.240
Those wrinkles-- verify
that, Yann-- are gone.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.160
That is steam pressed
as good as new.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.340
There it is.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.000
Give it up for Yann
on one more time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.625
Thank you, sir.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.660
You can have that deck of cards.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.650
There's the box.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.660
Thanks, Yann.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.170
OK, let me try one more.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.550
I knew I was going to be coming
here for Google, technology

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.640
company, obviously.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.680
So how do you combine
magic with technology?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.780
I've done it.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.770
I figured it out.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.410
You're welcome.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.530
Take an early lunch, OK.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.820
This is a deck of
cards, and if you

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.900
think about what a deck
of cards is-- and I know

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.232
Ollie's going to give us a
close up of the table here.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:39.690
If you think about what a deck
of cards is, a deck of cards

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.550
is a collection of
information, right?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.815
Colors, numbers, suits,
kind of like a database.

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.440
Let's keep that shot
there, if we don't

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.872
mind so that everybody can see.

00:10:51.872 --> 00:10:53.580
Now, this is an
interesting deck of cards

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.260
because I've run them
through a little printer.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.550
Now let's find somebody--
an uninterested party.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.425
You haven't seemed
interested the whole time.

00:11:01.425 --> 00:11:02.507
Hi, would you help me?

00:11:02.507 --> 00:11:04.590
As I riffle my thumb
through-- what are you doing?

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.710
Why are you
approaching magic Dave?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.668
Just stay in your seat.

00:11:06.668 --> 00:11:07.520
Oh my god.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.740
Just point at you,
hey, it's all about me!

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.429
Come on.

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:13.470
Let me have some me time,
I don't get enough over

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.119
there at the
theater every night.

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:16.410
I'm kidding, what is your name?

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.310
AUDIENCE: Christina.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.210
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Christina,
all I'm going to ask you to do

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.835
is just call the word stop as I
pull my thumb through the pack.

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:24.345
That way you'll randomly
select one of the cards.

00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:24.970
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.178
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Right there?

00:11:26.178 --> 00:11:29.370
All right, that will be
your randomly selected card.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.180
Please remember it.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.904
I will avert my gaze so
I do not see what it is.

00:11:32.904 --> 00:11:35.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:36.730
I can't see that.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.920
That's too far.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.060
Five of hearts, OK.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.710
Now watch this.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.470
Now Ollie, let's see if we
get that really close shot

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.960
that we talked about earlier.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.126
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:51.260
There we go, yes,
super close, I love it.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.200
I love it.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.284
Look at that.

00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:55.450
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.040
I'm going to give
the deck a shuffle.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.836
Now, this is a very
special shuffle.

00:12:00.836 --> 00:12:02.210
Let's call it the
Google shuffle.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.010
You interleave the
cards, and if you

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.410
think of this like a
computer screen, 52

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.355
scan lines of resolution,

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:13.362
AUDIENCE: Whoa!

00:12:13.362 --> 00:12:14.820
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
It actually starts

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.100
to say the word unshuffle,
which is what I'm doing.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.960
I'm shuffling the cards but
I'm separating the four suits.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.570
Let me do that again.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:28.920
The more I shuffle, the
more unshuffled they become.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:36.040
Look at the screen, no batteries
required, beautiful resolution.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.920
One final shuffle and
it becomes very clear

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.652
that Magic Dave had a lot of
by-himself-time as a child.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.830
Sitting in his house
shuffling cards.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.970
All the other kids were
out playing football

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.970
and talking to girls.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.537
The deck is
completely unshuffled.

00:12:54.537 --> 00:12:55.870
What does that mean, unshuffled?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.430
Well if you remember, I showed
you a shuffled deck of cards,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.890
but if you look at
them now-- we'll

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.930
get that close up shot again,
if you don't mind there Ollie.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.530
They're all in order.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.190
All the spades are in order,
diamonds, clubs hearts,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.060
and spades, all the diamonds,
all the clubs, all the hearts,

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.630
all the spades,
ace through king,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.480
just like they came
from the factory.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.920
That is an unshuffled deck.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.170
But I know what you're saying.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.900
You're saying, "Wait a minute,
Dave, that's not magic,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.020
that's technology.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.910
We do that better than you."

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.110
It's true.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.420
But there was a famous quote,
and I'm sure all of you

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.837
know it, by Arthur C. Clarke.

00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:30.670
I'm going to shuffle
them again, spades into

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.650
the clubs, diamonds
into the hearts.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.090
He said very famously,
"Any sufficiently advanced

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.440
technology is
indistinguishable from magic."

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.490
I always love that quote.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.570
What was your card,
Christine, do you remember?

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.550
Don't remember?

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.591
AUDIENCE: Five of hearts.

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.050
Five of hearts.

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:46.383
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Five of hearts.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.590
There it is, thank you, folks.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.030
Thank you very much.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.550
All right, thank you.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.640
That's my time.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.020
It is my true pleasure to
introduce the next artist,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.070
and he's making huge waves
over at the Shaftesbury Theatre

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.020
in The Illusionists, and
it's a pure pleasure spending

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.060
time with him.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.750
You'll be seeing him
on your television

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.200
soon and touring live.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.300
Please welcome the
amazing Colin Cloud.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:22.900
There he is.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:24.372 --> 00:14:25.330
COLIN CLOUD: Thank you.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.930
Very good afternoon.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.142
Are you well?

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.880
COLIN CLOUD: Good, there was
almost an awkward pause there,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.510
I was worried.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.780
But before we go any
further, before I tell you

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.230
anything about you, I
think it's only right you

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.300
know a tiny bit about me.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.900
I'm not actually from
this part of the world.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.680
I'm from a place up right
in the middle of Scotland.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.730
A place that you may
have been to, heard of,

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.430
avoided, I don't know.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.080
It's a place called Harthill.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.750
That is the most
positive reaction

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.371
I've ever had for Harthill.

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:53.620
But I left there very quickly.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.460
I went to university
in Glasgow, where

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.180
I got my honors degree in what's
called forensic investigation.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.170
People usually clap or
cheer at that point.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.290
12 of you, thank you.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.440
And I specialize in what's
called criminal profiling.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.200
That's not why
you're here today.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.672
Some of you actually shifted
your position on your chair.

00:15:16.672 --> 00:15:19.130
But it has led to me learning
some pretty weird and amazing

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.296
things to do with the mind,
especially when it comes

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.730
to Sherlock Holmes, who is my
inspiration for everything I

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.230
do.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.110
Arthur Conan Doyle
once famously wrote

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.860
that "By a man's
fingernails, by his shirt

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.270
cuff, by the calluses on
his thumb and forefinger,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.540
by his expression, by each of
these things a man's calling is

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.950
plainly revealed."

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.810
Notice he only mentioned
men, because even back then,

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:42.119
he knew it was impossible
to read a woman's mind.

00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:42.660
Not an idiot.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.222
But everything he
did fascinates me.

00:15:44.222 --> 00:15:46.430
The idea of memory, knowledge,
deduction-- and that's

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.100
why I want to play with
right now with all of you.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.020
Let's just take this deck.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.026
Would you mind giving
this half a shuffle?

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:55.450
And would you do the exact same?

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.840
Just mix up those
cards, shuffle them up.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.250
In a moment, not yet, I'm
going to ask some of you

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.590
to lend weird or unusual
objects that you have with you

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.090
in your pockets or your bags.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.840
If you have-- don't
bring it out just yet,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.631
it's important that I
never see what it is.

00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:11.470
But if you could think, if you
have something weird or unusual

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.270
that isn't just an
iPhone, wallet, watch,

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.650
that would be amazing, OK?

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.290
May I take these?

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.590
And would you point out
someone here behind you

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.037
that you don't know?

00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:23.120
This gentleman right here.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.780
Would you please take
half of the cards?

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.340
Hold on to them.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.095
Don't do anything.

00:16:26.095 --> 00:16:28.220
If you want to shuffle them
one more time, you can.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.885
And behind you, someone
that you don't know.

00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:32.760
This lady right here.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.468
So you take them.

00:16:33.468 --> 00:16:36.820
Would you please take
this half of the cards?

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.320
Perfect.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.260
Right, don't do
anything with them

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.320
yet other than mix them up a
little bit more if you want to.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.210
That's totally fine.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.170
But I also need
the help of someone

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.174
who has experience
in blindfolding.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.590
Not the sort of
thing you normally

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.165
admit to at a public event,
but I notice about eight

00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:55.270
of you perked up there.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.289
Let's go for a-- lady, blonde
hair, hi, what's your name?

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.080
AUDIENCE: Caroline.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.493
COLIN CLOUD: Again?

00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:01.320
AUDIENCE: Caroline.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.278
COLIN CLOUD: Carradine?

00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:03.564
AUDIENCE: Caroline.

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:04.480
COLIN CLOUD: Caroline.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.150
AUDIENCE: Caroline, yeah.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.249
COLIN CLOUD: Caroline.

00:17:06.249 --> 00:17:06.835
Look at me.

00:17:06.835 --> 00:17:07.460
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.170
Now it's Caroline.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:10.839
Caroline?

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.839
AUDIENCE: Caroline, yes.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.260
COLIN CLOUD: Perfect.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.343
Would you please stand up?

00:17:13.343 --> 00:17:15.460
Does this lady look
like the sort of person

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.432
that we can trust?

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.260
Interesting hesitation.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.750
I'm going to trust you.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.650
Give her a huge hand as
she makes her way up.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.140
I won't embarrass you, OK?

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.000
Would you please stand
right here for me?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.940
Good, I'm going to
move this table.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.730
Wow, it's heavier than
it looked in the photos.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.630
You will see a few
things that we're

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.160
going to use, OK, in a moment.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.780
Not yet.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.200
Would you, first of all,
check these two 50p coins

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.490
are real, regular 50p coins?

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.930
Make sure there is nothing
weird or unusual about them.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.927
Just regular coins.

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:45.010
Hold them up to the light.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:48.060
Make sure no little holes,
trapdoors, anything, solid.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.019
Yeah, some people like
to bite on them as well.

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:51.310
AUDIENCE: No, that's all right.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.450
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Cool.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.499
No one's ever done that.

00:17:53.499 --> 00:17:54.540
But they are real, right?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.998
You can set them
back on the table,

00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.340
and also this is a Kevlar scarf.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.510
You can make sure that no light
comes through this, correct?

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.010
Perfect.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.676
The eyelid is one of
the weakest muscles

00:18:03.676 --> 00:18:07.820
we have in the human body,
and you can try this.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.061
If you close one eyelid,
even the slightest amount

00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:11.560
of pressure on that
eyelid will mean

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.299
that it's impossible to open
up your eye, the slightest

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.090
amount of pressure.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.680
So we're going to
lock my eyelids closed

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.850
in place with the 50p coins held
in position buy gaffer tape.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.010
Things just got very "Fifty
Shades of Grey," right?

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.670
First of all, make sure that
coin is on there solid, yes?

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.510
Perfect.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.580
Can you see the rest of
the tape all along there?

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.290
I've tried to fold
in the edges so

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.965
that you can pick it up easily
from the material in case

00:18:37.965 --> 00:18:38.504
it's stuck.

00:18:38.504 --> 00:18:40.170
But you can all see
that coin goes right

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.610
over my right eye socket.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.500
Could you hold your
right hand up like this?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.020
Use this part of your
hand to press it down.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.004
Only use that part.

00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:49.670
Don't use your fingers,
otherwise you'll

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.160
get, like, a popping sound,
and we don't want that, right?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.660
So just press that down.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.160
Perfect.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.575
Happy that that's
stuck there, yes?

00:18:55.575 --> 00:18:56.010
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's good.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.760
COLIN CLOUD: When this
next piece goes on,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.640
I will no longer,
obviously, be able to see,

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.960
but you can see the rest
of the tape here, yes?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.790
And if you do have a weird
or-- what a great time to walk

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.230
in late, I mean really.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.600
Wow.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.780
Welcome to the pirate show.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.697
If you have a weird
or unusual object,

00:19:14.697 --> 00:19:17.030
this is the time to think
about it and get it ready, OK?

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.230
So you can see this coin here
goes into this eye socket,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.540
and again would you
please press that down?

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.490
Thank you very much.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.780
Take the next piece of tape.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.614
There's a few spare.

00:19:25.614 --> 00:19:27.779
We don't need to use them
all if we don't have time,

00:19:27.779 --> 00:19:30.160
but I want to cover my face
with as much of that tape--

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.820
have you got a piece?

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.590
COLIN CLOUD: Perfect, we'll put
that where my eyes used to be.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.510
Take the next piece.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.926
You just keep
grabbing the pieces.

00:19:35.926 --> 00:19:39.050
Everyone now in the room, get
your weird or unusual object

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.670
ready, because in
a moment, we're

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.660
going to grab-- borrow
a few of these, OK?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.420
Two more pieces I
think are on there?

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.420
Yes, perfect.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.670
We'll put this part a little
bit lower for anyone that

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.380
thinks I can see down the way.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.260
And there's one more
piece on there as well.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.310
You're going to press those
all down again yourself.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.980
One more piece.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.370
We'll put that just underneath
here for anyone that

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.960
thinks that's where I can see.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.751
Could you press all
that down and make sure

00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:02.992
that it's definitely stuck?

00:20:02.992 --> 00:20:04.306
AUDIENCE: It's stuck.

00:20:04.306 --> 00:20:06.430
COLIN CLOUD: Do press around
the bottom of my eyes.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.730
Even just with your fingers
now just beneath my eyes.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.470
Make sure that it's stuck to my
flesh all the way around, yes?

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.250
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.000
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah,
she's done this before.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.170
Right, pick up the scarf.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.010
The scarf I just
showed you, yeah?

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.280
Could you lay that
across my two palms.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.530
Thank you very much.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.300
I'm going to throw
the two ends behind.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.695
Can you grab the two ends, and
tie them in a nice tight knot?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.090
Tighter, tighter, play rough.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.540
And double knot it as well.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.116

COLIN CLOUD: Lovely.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.970
Could you now go out
into the audience--

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.520
take my right hand,
first of all--

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.920
and put my fingertips on
the middle of the table

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.980
so that I get my
bearings and balance, OK?

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.600
Would you now please
very carefully

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.450
go out-- if you
have a weird object,

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.690
quietly hold it up in
the air so that she

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.850
can see where they are.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.990
Go out and collect three
of them for me, OK?

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.200
Do that now.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.550
The four of you who do now
have cards from the deck,

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.860
could you now spread them so
that you can see all the cards?

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.607
Say yes over here if
you can see yours.

00:21:07.607 --> 00:21:08.190

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.530
COLIN CLOUD: Yes,
yes, and yes, yes.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.270
So you're spreading them.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.550
I want you all to say out
loud the first card that you

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.706
can see in your spread now.

the same time, OK?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.090
So one more time.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:22.339
That's all right, that's okay.

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:23.881

What I need all four
of you to do now

00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:51.060
is sort them into the suit.

come back to you in a second.

if you can come back
up to the stage.

you're coming back

you a huge round of applause

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.712
Could you lay the
objects in a line

00:22:12.712 --> 00:22:14.170
so that everyone
else can see them?

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:18.090
Please do not say
what the objects are.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.060

did you get three?

If you see what they are, please
again don't say it out loud.

What I would like you to do
first of all-- are you still

here?

pick up any one of the objects.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.331
Hold it nice and high.

I'm going to ask the
camera just doesn't zoom in

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.916
on this just yet until we
see-- this is just slipping.

00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:40.540
I just want to make
it tighter-- right,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.260
just so that we don't
see what it is, OK?

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.880
So, the person that owns
this object, can you please

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.034
say the word hello?

COLIN CLOUD: Hello.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.940
Do you know the game
word association?

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.530
Where someone says a word and
you say a word connected to it.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.870
Like if I said, "banana,"
you could say, "apple."

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.940
But you could also say
"cherry" or "pear."

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.590
Make sense?

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.440
COLIN CLOUD: I'm going
to ask you three words,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.189
and say the next thing
that comes to mind.

00:23:02.189 --> 00:23:03.440
Do not say your object.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.460
Just keep the object at
the back of your mind, OK?

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.490
So word number one--
say the next thing

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:14.334
that comes to mind-- word
number one is the word snowman.

00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:15.270
AUDIENCE: Carrot.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.080

COLIN CLOUD: Carrot.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.683
Word number two
is the word water.

And word number three
is the word chair.

AUDIENCE: Desk.

00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:31.100
COLIN CLOUD: Quite an aggressive
desk as well there, I noticed.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.830
Right, I think I know-- I'm
going to struggle with that.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.280
Sit that one back down, I'm
going to come back to you

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.034
in a second.

00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:36.450
Pick up a different
object for me.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.230
Just still warming up.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.979
I'm going to try and
get all of these, OK?

00:23:38.979 --> 00:23:40.820
Pick up a different object.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.780
Hold it nice and high.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.400
Can the person who owns
this object say hello?

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.090
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.340
COLIN CLOUD: We'll try this
in two words with you, OK?

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:47.977
So same game.

00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:49.560
Say the next thing
that comes to mind.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:57.480
So word number one
is the word deep.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.220
AUDIENCE: Cold.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.050

you for translating.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.600
OK, I think I've got it.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.117
Set it back down, there should
be one object left, yes?

00:24:16.117 --> 00:24:16.950
Pick up that object.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.940
Can the person who
owns it say hello?

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.830

what's your main sport?

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.190

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.689
COLIN CLOUD: I'm going to try
this in one word with you, OK?

00:24:30.689 --> 00:24:33.674
The word I'm going to give
you is the word cheese.

00:24:33.674 --> 00:24:34.382

00:24:37.966 --> 00:24:39.590
COLIN CLOUD: Sit that
object back down.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.749
I think the first object--
we'll go back to that

00:24:41.749 --> 00:24:43.040
with the three words over here.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:43.956
Hold it nice and high.

00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:45.906
Is this something
sentimental with you?

00:24:45.906 --> 00:24:46.610
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:47.950
COLIN CLOUD: Yes.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.483

00:24:49.483 --> 00:24:50.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.170
COLIN CLOUD: Was
it given to you,

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.940
or did you pick it up yourself
when you were somewhere

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:53.440
specific?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.700
AUDIENCE: It was given to me.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.430
COLIN CLOUD: Given to you.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.263
It's going to be some
kind of like, I think,

00:24:57.263 --> 00:24:58.810
little charm type thing.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.670
I either thought was going to
be a little-- it's not a tennis

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.389
ball, is it?

00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.930
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.330
COLIN CLOUD: No.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.913
Is it some kind of
rock with some kind

00:25:06.913 --> 00:25:08.760
of little chain attached to it?

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.840
Is that kind of close?

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.280
AUDIENCE: Sort of.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.190
COLIN CLOUD: Sort of.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.120
I think that's as close
as I'm going to get.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.440
I'm still warming up with
you, right, but tell us,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.505
what is the object?

00:25:18.505 --> 00:25:19.345
How close am I?

You got the chain.

00:25:21.304 --> 00:25:22.719
COLIN CLOUD: What
is on the chain?

00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:24.440
Is it like a little
rock or a pebble?

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.549
AUDIENCE: No, it's
a little soft toy.

00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:27.840
COLIN CLOUD: A little soft toy.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.690
Oh!

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:29.490
But it's on a chain, though.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.460
I was right with, yeah?

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.560
AUDIENCE: Yes, you are.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.120
COLIN CLOUD: I'm
going to take that.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.480
Right.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:32.980
OK.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.000
You take my hand again.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.495
The second thing,
where were you?

00:25:39.495 --> 00:25:40.620

COLIN CLOUD: Hello.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.870
With you I'm going to be honest.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.255
Was it something--
was it a plaster?

00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:48.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.290
COLIN CLOUD: Is
that what it was?

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:50.789
Yes!

00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:52.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:56.500
And, the final one was
only one word, right?

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.580
So I don't know
exactly-- is this the man

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.691
I said the word cheese to?

00:26:04.691 --> 00:26:05.490
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.020
COLIN CLOUD: Hello.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.200
This isn't a
glasses case, is it?

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:09.860
AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.502
COLIN CLOUD: No.

00:26:11.502 --> 00:26:13.460
Then it's going to be
some kind of little glass

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.630
bottle with liquid inside.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.910
I'm going to guess probably some
kind of aftershave or fragrance

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.410
type thing.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.475
Is that pretty close?

00:26:18.475 --> 00:26:18.975
Yes?

00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:19.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.830
Excellent.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.980
Caroline, take my right hand.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.310
Could you put it back on the
middle of the table again?

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.810
Perfect.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.518
I move around quite
a lot when I do this.

00:26:29.518 --> 00:26:31.562
So would you please pick
up the three objects,

00:26:31.562 --> 00:26:33.770
give them back to the people
who just let them to us,

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.670
and you'll get a huge round
of applause for helping.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.670
Give it up for Caroline.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:37.330
Thank you!

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:42.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.620
And let me just-- this is
my least favorite part.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.450
If I look surprised
when this comes off,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.626
it's because I no
longer have eyebrows.

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:56.230
And you're all still here.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.150
Thank you.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:04.620
So, four of you-- that's a gift.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.610
Try it later.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.440
The four of you
with playing cards

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.630
sorted them into order, yes?

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.830
OK, could I ask you please
to stand up where you are.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.520
Try and cover the
backs of the cards

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.010
as well so that no one thinks
I can see what they are.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.830
In fact, just for ease
I think it will be great

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.485
if the four of you-- can we give
them a welcome onto the stage?

00:27:26.485 --> 00:27:27.860
Give them a hand
as they come up.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.810
If you'd please stand
right here for me.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.890
Can I please ask that
you just stand over here?

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:32.780
Hello.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.654
Nicely covered.

00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:36.320
And would you come
and stand right here?

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.440
OK, so this way you
can see if I'm right,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.570
and I will join all of you.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.312
Someone name a suit
in the playing cards.

00:27:43.312 --> 00:27:44.020
AUDIENCE: Hearts.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.024
COLIN CLOUD: Hearts.

00:27:46.024 --> 00:27:48.440
Could you all now hold the
cards so that you can see them?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.365
I'll warm up facing you.

00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:51.156
I will turn away in a
second, but just so I

00:27:51.156 --> 00:27:53.980
make sure I've got you in the
right way I've remembered you.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.710
Would I be right in saying that
you have the ace of hearts?

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.210
Yes.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.630
You also have the two?

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.180
Yes.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.270
But you've got the three?

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:01.770
Yeah?

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.052
You've got the four?

00:28:03.052 --> 00:28:04.285
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:28:04.285 --> 00:28:05.660
COLIN CLOUD: You've
got the five.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.930
You've got the six.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.500
You've got the
seven and the eight.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.300
You've got the nine, the 10.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.055
You got the jack.

00:28:12.055 --> 00:28:12.930
You've got the queen.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.890
You've got the king.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.012
Yes, good, right!

00:28:16.012 --> 00:28:18.254
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.660
There are two that I
have misheard, right?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.680
So I'll come back to them if
I've-- three of you were a bit

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.640
louder, but that's OK.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.680
Name a different suit.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.620
AUDIENCE: Clubs.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.411
COLIN CLOUD: Clubs.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.069
You've got the ace of clubs.

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:37.490
AUDIENCE: Which one is clubs?

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.221
COLIN CLOUD: The
one-- no, that's OK.

00:28:39.221 --> 00:28:41.012
The one that looks like
a little puppy paw.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.108
Welcome to Google.

00:28:45.108 --> 00:28:47.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.370
Something to search
later, right?

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.810
Do you see?

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.219
Perfect, thank you, thank you.

00:28:53.219 --> 00:28:55.510
It's funny, right, if you're
not used to cards, though,

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.107
so thank you so
much for helping.

00:28:57.107 --> 00:28:58.065
But you've got the ace.

00:28:58.065 --> 00:28:58.870
Yes?

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.175
You've got the two.

00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:01.050
You've got the three.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.890
You've got the four.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.920
You've also got the five.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.690
You've got the six.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:04.565
You've got the seven.

00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:05.670
You've got the eight.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.870
You've got the nine as well.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.220
You've got the 10.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:08.800
Yes?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.520
You've got the jack.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.430
You've got the queen.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.670
And you've got the king.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.640
Yes good, right.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.890
Let's get faster.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.310
Hearts and clubs,
two suits left.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.343
Name a different suit.

00:29:19.343 --> 00:29:20.230
AUDIENCE: Diamonds.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.410
COLIN CLOUD: Diamonds.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.430
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.240
Let's get faster.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.670
You've got the ace of diamonds.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.550
You've got the two.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.140
Yes?

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.015
You've got the three.

00:29:29.015 --> 00:29:30.050
You've got the four.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.310
You've got the five.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.330
Yes, you've got the six.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.020
You've got the seven,
and you've got the eight.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.180
You've got the nine, the 10.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.640
You've got the jack.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.550
You've got the queen.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.640
And you've got the king.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.440
Yes, good.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.890
One last suit, which
is obviously spades.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.680
So we'll do this
very fast, OK we'll

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.111
do this very, very
quickly, and then we--

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.209
You've got the ace of spades.

00:29:57.209 --> 00:29:58.250
Yeah, you've got the two.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.890
You've got the three.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:29:59.560
You've got the four.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.393
You've got the five.

00:30:00.393 --> 00:30:01.210
You've got the six.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.084
You've got the seven.

00:30:02.084 --> 00:30:03.107
You've got the eight.

00:30:03.107 --> 00:30:03.940
You've got the nine.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:04.580
You've got the 10.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.210
You've got the jack.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.780
You've got the queen.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.500
You've got the king, and
you've got the joker.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.005
You were wondering whether
or not I was going to say it.

00:30:09.005 --> 00:30:10.090
Is that right?

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.050
Yes!

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.190
Give them all a huge
round of applause.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.060
Leave the cards on the table.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.880
Thank you very much.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.650
Thank you.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.670
Thank you.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.760
ROB LEWORTHY: Thank you
again Colin Cloud and Dave

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:24.817
Williamson.

00:30:24.817 --> 00:30:26.150
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.570
So you're on the show
"The Illusionists."

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.010
Perhaps you could tell us
about the show and how you got

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.370
involved in it.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.980
COLIN CLOUD: So the
show essentially-- it's

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.350
like a mashup of
different genres of magic,

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.740
and in my opinion, every
performer in that show

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.030
was at the top of their game for
the genre of magic or mystery

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.090
entertainment that
it is they do.

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:47.200
And the show essentially
is a showcase

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.972
of that variety over the
course of an evening.

00:30:50.972 --> 00:30:52.175
It's fast paced.

00:30:52.175 --> 00:30:54.550
You picked up on the fact that
there's a live band there.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.310
It's made to feel very
much, to an extent,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.250
like a bit of a sort of
upbeat, energetic type piece.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.489
And yeah, it's been
going very well.

00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:06.280
ROB LEWORTHY: And it's
playing in Broadway,

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.950
and touring North America, so--

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:10.283
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah, it's quite
the commute every morning,

00:31:10.283 --> 00:31:11.050
it's hellish.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.650
ROB LEWORTHY: And
so the different

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.345
iterations of the
show, how did--

00:31:13.345 --> 00:31:17.450
Did you have to work within
a preexisting format,

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.570
or did you kind of bring
your own things to it?

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.278
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Well,
there is a format.

00:31:21.278 --> 00:31:24.580
This show started in
the Sydney Opera House

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.700
about four years ago
during a festival.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.280
And the producers put
together these genres--

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.330
they brought an illusionist,
and they brought a comedy act,

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.930
and they brought a
mentalist, and a manipulator,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.480
a classic manipulator.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.860
And it went down so well
that it was extended,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.780
and then it went on
tour in Australia,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.150
and then they realised that
there was a market for it.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.390
People just love the show,
so it has been touring

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:50.730
the world for three years.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.190
So in North America,
it's been on tour,

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.780
and when this
opportunity came up

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.730
to bring the show
to the West End,

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.930
Broadway said, "Well, bring
it to Broadway as well

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:02.680
at the same time."

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.560
So basically, the producers
took the main cast,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.440
split them in half, put each
half in a different city,

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.680
and then sort of
filled in the slots,

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.010
basically, with
other entertainers.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.080
And there's a third tour right
now happening in Australia.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.620
It's called "The
Illusionists 1903."

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.930
And that's a completely
different cast.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.220
And it's less rock
and roll, less glitzy.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.870
It's a throwback
to the Vaudeville,

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:30.009
the classic era of-- the golden
age of variety entertainment.

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:31.550
ROB LEWORTHY: And
with-- Derren Brown

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.008
is playing just
down the road here,

00:32:33.008 --> 00:32:36.540
and we've had-- "The Impossible"
was in London last year.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.110
So do you think there's a
resurgence in seeing magic

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.689
live?

00:32:40.689 --> 00:32:42.480
Is that something that's
come off recently?

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.022
Or--

00:32:43.022 --> 00:32:44.480
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah,
I think-- I mean

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.450
magic is something-- I
mean, you see it on TV

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.870
and you dismiss it right away as
a camera trick, or as stooges,

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:49.661
if you want, right?

00:32:49.661 --> 00:32:51.302
Whereas I think
it's like anything.

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.510
You can listen to a CD in
the car, but to actually go

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.819
see the band live is a
totally different experience.

00:32:55.819 --> 00:32:57.360
And certainly, with
a show like ours,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.480
what it does, as
you've seen, rely

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.454
a lot on audience interaction,
and the assistance of-- I

00:33:02.454 --> 00:33:03.870
mean it's fully
immersive, so it's

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.620
a completely
different experience

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.110
to any other type of
theater or musical

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.310
that's happening in the
West End at the moment.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.260
And I'm glad, delighted, that
it has become more popular,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.700
and people can now
go see quality,

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.372
live magic entertainment.

00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:20.830
ROB LEWORTHY: So when you're
coming up with a new illusion,

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.180
do you start with a story
that you want to tell,

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.580
or do you start
with a trick itself?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.420
Where do you start
on that journey?

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.230
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Well, I think
early on in your career you

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.510
start with the trick itself.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.426
You say, "Oh, I want to
do this amazing trick,

00:33:34.426 --> 00:33:35.590
and just amaze people."

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.660
But then as you get on and
you build a career out of it,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.530
you realize that there
are stories to tell,

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.279
and there are emotions
to tap, and there's

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:45.170
a narrative you
may want to push,

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:52.540
and I think that's an evolution
of a career that-- people who

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.180
begin in magic, it's all about
the tricks or the secrets

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.510
and, you know, worship me.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.380
I mean, I think at its
core, every entertainer

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.920
is just looking for love.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.890
Basically, it's attention
getting, you know?

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.890
"Look at me."

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:14.290
And then as you mature and your
career becomes a little more,

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.360
you know-- I need
to Google this.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.067
I'm at a loss for words here.

00:34:19.067 --> 00:34:20.650
You understand what
I'm trying to say.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.460
ROB LEWORTHY: So I think
I was blown away, perhaps,

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.869
because I've seen you
Colin at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:25.535
before, in quite a
small intimate venue.

00:34:25.535 --> 00:34:29.110
So how does working in a 1,200
seat theatre differ from either

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.830
doing close up magic,
Dave that you do,

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.405
versus kind of a
small fringe venue?

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:35.280
COLIN CLOUD: I think,
bizarrely, it's easier.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.980
Certainly the theater we are in,
it's a huge theater, you know?

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.070
1,400 seats.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.179
But it still feels
very intimate.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.320
So for me, the more people
there are, the easier it is.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.620
This is the smallest
performance I've

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.850
done now in the last few
months, and it's terrifying.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.470
I can feel you all looking
at me, and it's-- I hate it.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.725
But no, the more people
there are, the more energy,

00:34:56.725 --> 00:34:58.100
and people are
there because they

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.391
want to see that type of thing.

00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:01.540
So they're on our
team from the off,

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.640
and it's just an
absolute delight.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.830
ROB LEWORTHY: And how
did you get into magic?

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.440
COLIN CLOUD: Genuinely, I
was never really into magic

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.870
until later on, because
I was fascinated

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.660
by, genuinely, Sherlock
Holmes at eight years old.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.200
When I was 10, discovered
he never actually existed.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.760
Got it, yeah.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.830
Two people awwed, thank you.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.000
But by then the bug had bit, and
I was really big into science,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.912
and more genuinely, hypnosis
than I was ever with magic.

00:35:29.912 --> 00:35:31.370
But then I realized
Sherlock Holmes

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.100
had this wonderful
esoteric skill

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.900
set of pickpocketing, lock
picking, which then led

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.890
kind of more into that.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.940
So it was much of reading
people and situations.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.450
He had these other
skills, and my fascination

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.284
more grew from that.

00:35:43.284 --> 00:35:45.200
ROB LEWORTHY: Because I
was the eight-year-old

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.790
boy with the Paul
Daniels magic kit.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.170
I think that's kind of where
I kind of played with that--

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.419
COLIN CLOUD: See I got that,
but then my cousin Karen,

00:35:51.419 --> 00:35:54.890
she was way better at the tricks
than me, so put me right off.

00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:56.660
ROB LEWORTHY: And
Dave, what about you?

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.076
DAVE WILLIAMSON: I have the
classic story of the magic set

00:35:59.076 --> 00:36:01.807
for the birthday party
at eight years old,

00:36:01.807 --> 00:36:03.390
and then you go to
the library and you

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.725
realize that if you
don't return the books,

00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:08.350
your friends will
never see the secret.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.250
So of course, I have all the
original library books still

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.430
in my home.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.161
As do all my magician friends.

00:36:14.161 --> 00:36:15.910
They still-- I can
tell where they grew up

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:17.220
by their library books.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.150
They still contain--

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.233
But yeah, so I've been
doing it since I was a kid.

00:36:20.233 --> 00:36:21.830
I was bit by the
magic bug very early.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.320
I turned to my mother
when I was age 10

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.000
and I said, "I'm going to be
a professional magician, worry

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.100
about my brothers, that's
what I'm going to do."

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.100
And she was a great mother.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.647
This was back in the 70s.

00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:33.980
She used to drop me off at
these little magic gatherings

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.710
and festivals, or send me on
a bus to a different state

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.590
at the age of 12, and 13, and
14, with a note pinned to my--

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.760
you know?

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.510
And she let me go,
and I've been just

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.030
swimming around in this
world of magic ever since.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.655
ROB LEWORTHY: Is
there a big difference

00:36:47.655 --> 00:36:50.910
in the magic scene between the
UK in the US, do you think?

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.320
COLIN CLOUD: With regards to
the performance, the audiences?

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.080
I think every culture in
the world has areas of magic

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.146
that they strive in more.

00:37:01.146 --> 00:37:02.770
So for example, in
the UK, Derren Brown

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:04.061
has been a massive figure here.

00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:07.020
So that type of entertainment,
the more mentalism type stuff

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.720
has become more popular.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.150
We see a lot of
Asian magicians are

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.340
more interested in
the manipulation type.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.310
America, I find it's really
quality close up magic there.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.990
So I mean, really,
every country seems

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.931
to have the thing
that they are best at,

00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:23.680
and it's always nice
to visit these places

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.872
and become more inspired
by their approach.

00:37:25.872 --> 00:37:28.080
ROB LEWORTHY: And "The
Illusionists" felt like a very

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.534
international cast, which--

00:37:29.534 --> 00:37:30.950
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Absolutely, yeah.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.130
ROB LEWORTHY: Final
question from me.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.713
So if you have any
audience questions,

00:37:33.713 --> 00:37:36.600
do please go stand behind
the mic in the middle.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.290
YouTube.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.780
Google owns YouTube,
and so what do

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.700
you think of magic on YouTube?

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.200
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Well, I'll tell you

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.900
the thing that YouTube
has really done

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.290
is, obviously, promote the art.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.780
When I was a kid, when
I was 12 years old

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.950
and I wanted to learn
a move or a trick,

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.090
I had to wait until
that next magic festival

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.590
in the summertime
in Colon, Michigan

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.006
when I would meet
my friend again,

00:37:58.006 --> 00:37:59.120
and we could swap stories.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.790
Or maybe I'd write
a letter, and that's

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:04.520
how the magicians communicated.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.490
But now you have somebody in
Ohio, a 12-year-old kid, put

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:11.100
a move on YouTube, and
half an hour later,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.540
somebody in Singapore
has made an improvement,

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.890
and they're
crowdsourcing this idea.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.720
And it's amazing the rapid
advancement made possible

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.464
by YouTube.

00:38:22.464 --> 00:38:23.130
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.130
I was just wondering how often
things go wrong, if they do,

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.040
and what you normally
do to cover them?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.755
Do you admit it?

00:38:28.755 --> 00:38:30.070
Do you try and work around it?

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:30.820
Or something else.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.653
COLIN CLOUD: Some nights
in the Shaftesbury,

00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:34.890
you'll see the best illusion
show you'll ever see,

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.806
and on other nights
you'll see the best comedy

00:38:36.806 --> 00:38:38.930
show you've ever seen.

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.037
I mean that's the thing, right?

00:38:41.037 --> 00:38:43.370
Any speaker, the more you
stand in front of an audience,

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.110
you learn to just
relax, become aware.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.870
If things go wrong,
do you know what?

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.030
At the end of the day,
hopefully no one's died, right?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:54.640
We're all human,
and-- fingers crossed.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.720
So yeah, you laugh
about it, you move on,

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.080
and you make it still as
entertaining and as enjoyable

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.740
as possible, right?

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.320
It's designed to be fun.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.230
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Yeah, and for
a live show, I-- In my act,

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.980
I have the most dangerous
act in the show,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.700
because I bring up
children on stage,

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.250
and I give them the
microphone, and I

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.340
let them say whatever's
on their minds.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.300
ROB LEWORTHY: The
show I saw Saturday,

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.240
you had a four-year-old
which I thought was--

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.160
DAVE WILLIAMSON: It's fantastic.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.970
Yeah, they're right
on the knife's edge

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.310
of wetting their
pants and crying

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.650
or having a wonderful time.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.570
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.653
And I'm talking about some
of the performers, too.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.090
So I embrace the chaos.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.960
So you're almost kind of
feeding little seeds out, hoping

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.350
that something unexpected--
because as Colin says,

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.700
that's where the gold is.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.810
When something real and
human and off script happens.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.850
So that's the beauty
of having a live show.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.220
AUDIENCE: Do you guys plan
for different eventualities?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.210
Or is there always
like a fixed--

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:52.150
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Over time,
they just kind of take root.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:53.980
You have different pathways
you know you can take.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.070
You don't panic as much.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.040
But yeah, early on--

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.664
COLIN CLOUD: And
certain ad libs become

00:39:57.664 --> 00:39:58.930
learned and just in the bank.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.990
If something happens, you'll
know that you can tap into it

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.210
and just keep the show moving
in the right direction.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.001
DAVE WILLIAMSON: But
every so often, things

00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:10.697
happen that we just-- you're
gobsmacked and you stand there.

00:40:10.697 --> 00:40:12.780
Like when the train didn't
appear the other night.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.530
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah.

00:40:15.447 --> 00:40:17.280
Yeah, quite the sentence
when you don't know

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.670
what we're talking about.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.489
It sounds like we
missed our lift home.

00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:23.530
He does mean in the show.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.060
It's amazing.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.870
It's amazing, right?

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.370
But yes.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:28.360
So technical things can
happen, but you laugh about it,

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.270
you move on, and
you just pick it up,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.392
and you just do more amazing
things later to cover it.

00:40:34.392 --> 00:40:36.600
DAVE WILLIAMSON: And that's
the thing about our show.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.670
If you don't like what's
happening, don't worry.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.690
10 minutes later, something
completely different

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.672
will be happening, and
it moves very fast.

00:40:43.672 --> 00:40:45.380
ROB LEWORTHY: How do
you deal-- because I

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.280
think of the two of you, you
work with the audience most.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.330
DAVE WILLIAMSON: And
Jamie does as well.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.340
ROB LEWORTHY:
Jamie does as well.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.340
How do you deal with
different audience members?

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.500
Do you get good at picking the
right people, and so forth?

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.620
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah, I mean I
think it becomes like anything.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.100
Even standing here, I could
look out and see the people

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.200
that-- you can tell who
just wants to sit there

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.900
and watch, and pick it
apart and try and work out

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.780
what's happening.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.820
And then you get the people who
you can tell-- and thank you

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.460
for helping again-- but who are
going to be good characters,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.855
and you can tell who's going
to be difficult on stage.

00:41:14.855 --> 00:41:15.980
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Like Yann.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.730
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.070
[LAUGHING]

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.500
And more who to avoid and
more who to aim towards.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.310
And ultimately, I think
the goal of any performer

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:28.440
is to make other people look
good-- as good as possible,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.020
and bring out the
best in people.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.932
If I bring someone up and they
look bad, that reflects on me.

00:41:33.932 --> 00:41:35.890
I want to bring people
up, make them look good,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.630
feel good, because then
it just carries the show.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.630
ROB LEWORTHY: Very good.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.421
Any more questions?

00:41:40.421 --> 00:41:42.072
Yes.

00:41:42.072 --> 00:41:43.780
AUDIENCE: So since
you mentioned YouTube,

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.080
one question came to mind.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.080
Do you think that the very fact
that magic became so popular,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.560
and you can see the
explanation of so many tricks

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.670
and YouTube and the
internet in general,

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.880
do you think it affected the
show if people somehow figured

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.376
out parts of the some tricks?

00:41:59.376 --> 00:42:01.000
And do you think this
actually matters?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.230
Would the people enjoy
the show, in your opinion,

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.697
even if they figure it out?

00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:07.280
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
It's a good question.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.204
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah, I
mean, ultimately, I

00:42:09.204 --> 00:42:10.870
would hope that even
if I stand on stage

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.020
and do nothing, hopefully
I'm entertaining enough

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.492
that you'll enjoy that time.

00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:17.200
So the other things
hopefully then become

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.957
the fuel for the fire to then
make it "The Illusionists"

00:42:19.957 --> 00:42:21.790
and, you know, show
that it is, essentially.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.920
But things like YouTube
and things being picked

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.250
apart-- if people are going
to go looking for the methods,

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.150
it's because they have
a genuine interest

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:33.510
in that way of thinking
and being inspired by it.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.430
On some level, we had
to learn at some point

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.380
how things worked as well.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.200
And if people go to the lens to
find out how things are done,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.060
then it's because they
are passionate about it

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.727
to some extent.

00:42:44.727 --> 00:42:47.060
But I also think people who
just want to enjoy the magic

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.089
will never go looking
anyway, so it's fun--

00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:50.880
DAVE WILLIAMSON: But
it is a new phenomenon

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.030
to have somebody in the
audience with their phone

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.980
bringing up a video of how
they just did that trick.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.940
I mean, Houdini didn't have
to deal with that, and we do.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.190
And there's a wonderful
Asian performer.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:07.360
He's from Taiwan, but he was
on television, CCTV in China.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.170
And it's a different
culture there.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.350
They don't have a history
of theatrical magic,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.790
and when he went on the
largest television program

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.270
and did his close up
magic, before the end

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.680
of the program there
were-- I think it was Yuku?

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.180
Right?

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.470
Is that the Chinese--

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.801
ROB LEWORTHY: Baidu?

00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:25.300
Baidu?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.260
Is it Baidu?

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.010
The search engine.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.218
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Could be it.

00:43:28.218 --> 00:43:29.780
Anyway, it was viral.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.560
Somebody had made
a 3-D rendering

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.250
of how the table worked, and
that made front page news

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.050
the next day.

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.920
So it was a game
of cat and mouse.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.810
And he found himself
constantly battling--

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:48.810
and that was the narrative was
let's catch out this performer

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.600
every time he goes on
TV, rather than what

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.260
a wonderful show
and an entertainer.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.942
It was like, it's a
cat and mouse game.

00:43:55.942 --> 00:43:58.150
COLIN CLOUD: What I have
found interesting with that,

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.660
though, is that people
that see the YouTube video,

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.430
then when that conversation
comes up in a social setting,

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.590
they will try and reenact
it for their friends.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.756
And they'll try and act it
out, and they immediately

00:44:06.756 --> 00:44:08.506
see how difficult
it actually is.

00:44:08.506 --> 00:44:10.630
And what it does is even
if you know how it's done,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.421
knowing how it's done,
and being able to do

00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:14.210
it are two very
different things.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.050
And I think it's how people
realize the amount of practice

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:18.927
and dedication that
needs to go into,

00:44:18.927 --> 00:44:21.260
for example, the manipulations
that you see in the show.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.950
I mean that is-- it
looks so magical,

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:27.100
and it's utter, raw skill
that he's put in the time

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.160
to make this wonderful
artistic piece.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.354
Even my watching
it-- I introduce him,

00:44:33.354 --> 00:44:35.520
and I'm on right after him,
so I see it every night.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.870
And even seeing it
now 30 times in a row,

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.050
you still need to admire
how wonderful that

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.480
is that he's able to make--

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.590
DAVE WILLIAMSON: The most
wonderful moment in the show

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.290
is when Dne Den, our
manipulator, is on stage,

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.530
all the other magicians
are now in the wings

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.664
watching from the
wings every night.

00:44:53.664 --> 00:44:55.080
And it's just a
wonderful picture.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.205
ROB LEWORTHY: And you
close with Den Den doing--

00:44:57.205 --> 00:44:58.210
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Some close up
magic, yeah some very nice--

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.580
ROB LEWORTHY: And you're all
on stage at the same time,

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.440
and I just felt you were all
going, "This guy is amazing."

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:02.760
DAVE WILLIAMSON: He is.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.090
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:03.400
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Yeah.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.441
ROB LEWORTHY: A magician's
magician, if you will.

00:45:05.441 --> 00:45:07.520
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.256
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:45:10.256 --> 00:45:12.130
AUDIENCE: Hello, I
wondered what your opinion

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:15.060
of people like Derren Brown,
and Dynamo, and David Blaine.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.800
Are they like the best
of the field, or--

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.310
COLIN CLOUD: Who, sorry?

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.404
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
Never heard of them.

00:45:20.404 --> 00:45:21.820
AUDIENCE: Did they
just get lucky,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.594
or are they the best guys?

00:45:23.594 --> 00:45:25.010
COLIN CLOUD: I
don't think there's

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.482
anything-- luck doesn't
exactly-- I mean,

00:45:27.482 --> 00:45:28.940
these guys have
worked really hard.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:29.810
They've been dedicated.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.870
They've surrounded themselves
with the right people.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.890
They have their own
wonderful unique skill sets.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.460
But I think more importantly,
audiences have bought into them

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.312
as individuals.

00:45:38.312 --> 00:45:40.020
And for me, that's
what it's really about

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.912
is people really buying
into that performer.

00:45:41.912 --> 00:45:43.370
So regardless of
what they do, it's

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:44.953
them that you want
to hear more about.

00:45:44.953 --> 00:45:47.572
And really, if we take
Dynamo, for example,

00:45:47.572 --> 00:45:49.030
if you know who
Dynamo is, you also

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.120
know to an extent his story,
and you've bought into that.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.576
And it's all true, but you
feel like you know him,

00:45:54.576 --> 00:45:55.770
you have that association.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.010
Derren had his approach.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.950
David Blaine, when he reignited
magic on TV, certainly,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.202
in this country, had
their own approach to it

00:46:03.202 --> 00:46:05.160
and really found a dynamic
way of sharing magic

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:05.860
with audiences.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.240
So you need to absolutely, in
my opinion, respect all of that,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.119
because it all adds to it, and
it's all absolutely wonderful.

00:46:12.119 --> 00:46:14.410
ROB LEWORTHY: Do you have a
collaborator you work with?

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:17.120
Derren works with Andy Nyman
quite a lot on his shows.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.730
Do you work with someone?

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:19.480
COLIN CLOUD: Yeah.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.280
ROB LEWORTHY: Even a
director for stage presence

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:21.790
and so forth.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.331
COLIN CLOUD: For my
stage show, yeah.

00:46:23.331 --> 00:46:25.040
The guy who's my
manager, Don, also

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.090
is like the guy who I will
speak to to everything about,

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.540
essentially.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.630
Everything I've ever
written-- I mean, basically,

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.680
because some of the comedy
I use can be quite edgy,

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.370
I need to just run it past him
and he will rein it in or say,

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:41.286
"You can be a bit more
free there," and stuff.

00:46:41.286 --> 00:46:43.950
So he's a good safety net before
I go do stuff live as well

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.700
and find the right
approach, and make sure

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.366
that it stays true
to the Sherlock stuff

00:46:47.366 --> 00:46:49.310
that it is I love
doing on stage.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.850
And I'm moving more into TV.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:54.460
It's a case of still Don,
who I write everything with,

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.690
and branching out to
my colleague Mark who

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.680
sat over in the wings as well.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.800
So just because
these guys have been,

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.640
certainly, Mark, involved with
TV before, and know my bringing

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.870
what I do to TV, how to
very quickly fine tune

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.940
it and make sure that--

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.060
ROB LEWORTHY: TV is a
different medium to--

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.270
COLIN CLOUD: Absolutely,
right, so it's important.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.850
Again like Dynamo
or Darren, knowing

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:14.180
that you don't have
the entire skill set.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.110
Even in the room, knowing that
we don't know how the cameras

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.820
or lights work, you
get the right people

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.560
to do those jobs to make the
complete package as good as it

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.972
can be.

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.180
ROB LEWORTHY: Final question.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.284
AUDIENCE: Hey guys, great
performance earlier.

00:47:25.284 --> 00:47:26.700
Magic is a performance
art where I

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.230
think you're constantly
asked to prove yourself

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.620
in every setting.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.440
So if we have a
ballerina here, we

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.809
might not have asked her
to do a dance, for example.

00:47:34.809 --> 00:47:36.350
I wanted to know
how that affects you

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.294
as a performer, that pressure.

00:47:39.294 --> 00:47:42.220
COLIN CLOUD: Say the opening
again-- to prove yourself,

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.410
essentially?

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.490
In the sense of-- it's
interesting, right.

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.110
AUDIENCE: If you were
to introduce yourself

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.770
as a magician, someone would
go, "Oh, show me a trick."

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.170
COLIN CLOUD: Oh, yeah.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:49.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:52.396 --> 00:47:53.770
The good thing is
everything I do

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:57.350
pretty much involves the
mind, and memory, and stuff,

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.950
so I can very much
recreate what I do anywhere

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.919
with the right people
in the right mindset.

00:48:02.919 --> 00:48:04.710
But I don't know, how
do you feel about it?

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.642
Because--

00:48:06.642 --> 00:48:09.360
DAVE WILLIAMSON: I try to
go into these situations

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.950
by lowering their expectations,
of course, and then exceeding

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:13.820
them.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.930
And you know, I do
that by dressing

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:20.740
like this, and your general
attitude of incompetence

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.360
and so forth.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.900
And then hopefully, you have
something left in the bag

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.210
to wallop them with.

00:48:27.231 --> 00:48:29.230
ROB LEWORTHY: Well we
will leave it there, and--

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.790
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Does
that answer the question?

00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:32.030
ROB LEWORTHY: Yeah, I think so.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.084
Set expectations,
we'll take that.

00:48:34.084 --> 00:48:36.500
DAVE WILLIAMSON: I'm not saying
when you come to our show,

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.577
lower your expectations.

00:48:37.577 --> 00:48:38.410
I'm not saying that.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.020
ROB LEWORTHY: It's
really very good.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:39.780
DAVE WILLIAMSON:
It's me personally,

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.770
when you have lunch with me.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:41.630
That's what I'm saying.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.600
ROB LEWORTHY: Really very good.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.974
Please join me in
a massive round

00:48:43.974 --> 00:48:45.600
of applause for Colin and Dave.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.725
DAVE WILLIAMSON: Thank you.

00:48:46.725 --> 00:48:49.550
[APPLAUSE]
