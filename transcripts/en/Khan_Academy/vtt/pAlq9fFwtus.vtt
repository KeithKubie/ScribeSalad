00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:02.208
- [Instructor] You're probably familiar

00:00:02.208 --> 00:00:04.885
with the notion of a number line

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:08.118
where we can take a number and associate

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:10.808
it with a point on the number line.

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:13.060
So for example, the number two,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.955
I would go, I would start at zero,

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.446
I'd go one, two to the
right, and I would end up

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.101
right over there.

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.127
What we're going to do in this video

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:24.765
is think about how do we take two numbers

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:29.608
and associate them with a
point on a plane like this.

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:33.504
So for example, you might
have the two numbers

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:35.004
three, comma five.

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:39.995
How can these two numbers be represented

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:41.805
as a point on the plane,

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:45.502
or how can these tell you
where a point on the plane is?

00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:48.580
So let's first get a
little bit of terminology

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.802
out of the way.

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:52.560
So what we have here,
this is often known as

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.382
our coordinate plane.

00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:57.339
These two numbers you could
view as our coordinates.

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.717
Let me write this down.

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:00.550
These are coordinates.

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:05.225
These black lines are known as the axes.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.914
Each one is an axis and the
one that goes left right here,

00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:14.004
this is known as the X axis,

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.190
or it's typically known as the X axis.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.729
In the future it might
be called other things,

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.921
and the one that goes up down
in the vertical direction,

00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.928
this is typically known as the Y axis.

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:27.479
As you go further in math we
might call it other things,

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.844
but most of the time it's
going to be called the Y axis.

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:34.261
So how does three comma five,

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:39.173
how do these coordinates
specify a point on this plane?

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.140
Well the way that we
typically work it through,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.683
the standard way that people
will interpret these points,

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:49.491
it'll say all right,
this first coordinate,

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.916
this is our X coordinate.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.492
This is our X coordinate.

00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:57.621
You can view it as how far
do we move to the right

00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:59.038
along the X axis.

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.260
So what you would do
is you'd say all right

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.014
I'm gonna start right here

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:08.771
where my axes intersect and I'm
gonna go three to the right.

00:02:08.771 --> 00:02:10.128
One, two, three.

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:12.886
So my X coordinate says,
all right my point is

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:15.719
going to be this far to the right.

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:19.277
This far to the right.

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:21.622
So it's gonna be somewhere
on this vertical line.

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:23.350
This dotted line that I'm showing.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.011
Everything on this vertical line

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.782
has an X coordinate of three.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:29.762
Now what's the Y coordinate?

00:02:29.762 --> 00:02:31.813
Another way I should say
it, the second number

00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:32.912
right over here.

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:35.147
This is the Y coordinate.

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:36.230
Y coordinate.

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:40.085
This tells us how far do we move up.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.672
So one way to think about it,

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:44.289
you could start back
where the axes intersect.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.415
This point is actually called the origin.

00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:48.847
Let me write that down.

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:50.430
That is the origin,

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:55.171
and so starting at the
origin, move five up.

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.196
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:02.044
So everything on this
horizontal line that I'm drawing

00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:04.294
has a Y coordinate of five.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:10.178
So what point uniquely has
both an X coordinate of three

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:12.948
and a Y coordinate of five?

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:15.249
Well you can see where
those two lines intersect,

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.440
right over here.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.676
Actually let me do that same blue color

00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:20.620
that I wrote the coordinates in.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.737
So this point right over here,

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:25.968
it has an X coordinate of three,

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:29.234
and it has a Y coordinate of five.

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:32.139
That is the point three comma five.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.864
Now what is the coordinate of the origin?

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:38.629
Well the origin is zero
to the right of the origin

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.307
and it's also zero above the origin.

00:03:41.307 --> 00:03:44.024
So the coordinates there,
the X coordinate is zero,

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:47.008
the Y coordinate is also zero.

00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:49.251
Let's do a few more examples.

00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:52.211
So let's say that I
wanted to plot the point

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.461
two comma five.

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.341
Why don't you pause this.

00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:58.007
Oh let me use a different number.

00:03:58.007 --> 00:03:59.007
Two comma four.

00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:00.597
Why don't you pause this video

00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:02.680
and think about where that point would be

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.580
on this coordinate plane.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.436
All right let's do it together.

00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:11.177
So the first number is going
to be our X coordinate.

00:04:11.177 --> 00:04:13.182
It tells us how far do
we move to the right.

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:14.923
So we move two to the right,

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:18.012
and then our second number
says how far do we move up.

00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:20.138
So first we're gonna move two to the right

00:04:20.138 --> 00:04:23.613
and then we are going to move four up.

00:04:23.613 --> 00:04:25.355
So you can say one two to the right

00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:29.216
and then one two three
four right over there.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:33.363
This right over here is
the point two comma four.

00:04:33.363 --> 00:04:35.280
Notice is X coordinate.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:40.371
How far to the right of the origin it is.

00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:43.058
That is two and its Y coordinate,

00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:45.233
how far above the origin is.

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:46.316
That is four.

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:49.103
Now let's go the other way around.

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:52.155
Let's say that I were to give you,

00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:55.541
if I were to give you this
point right over here.

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.562
What would its coordinates be?

00:04:57.562 --> 00:05:01.907
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:05:01.907 --> 00:05:04.977
All right, well we know
it's gonna be two numbers.

00:05:04.977 --> 00:05:07.470
So I'll do something comma something.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.133
Now the first something,
that's going to be

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.580
our X coordinate.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.969
You could think of it,

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.644
what point on the X axis are we above?

00:05:15.644 --> 00:05:17.605
You could think about how far to the right

00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:19.266
of the origin we are,

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:22.225
and you can see that your X
coordinate right over here is

00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:24.469
if we just drop a vertical
line straight down

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:25.776
from that point

00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:27.685
it hits the X axis at four.

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:28.840
So that is four.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.412
Another way to think about
it we're one two three four

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:34.312
to the right of the Y axis.

00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:36.246
Now how high are we?

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:38.874
How high above the X axis are we?

00:05:38.874 --> 00:05:41.905
Well we're one above the X asis.

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.094
So this is gonna be four comma one.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:47.223
Another way to think about
it, if you just take a line

00:05:47.223 --> 00:05:49.113
and you go straight to the left

00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:52.407
you're going to hit the Y axis
at the one right over here.

00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:56.014
So the coordinates here
are four comma one.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:58.122
Now just so we don't get confused,

00:05:58.122 --> 00:05:59.893
and when you first learn this,

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:02.224
the main point of confusion is remembering

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:05.151
that okay the first number
is the X coordinate,

00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.703
the second number is the Y coordinate.

00:06:07.703 --> 00:06:10.367
One comma four would be a different point.

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.902
One comma four would be
okay one in the X direction

00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:16.619
and then four in the Y direction.

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.619
So this is one comma four over here.

00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:23.486
So it's very important to
realize that the standard

00:06:23.486 --> 00:06:25.606
way of interpreting these numbers

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.688
is that the first one
says how far do you move

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:30.512
to the right of the origin,

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:33.063
or how far do you move along the X axis

00:06:33.063 --> 00:06:34.900
or where are you on the X axis,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.764
and the second number
is how far do you move

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.340
in the vertical direction,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.924
or where are you relative to the Y,

00:06:40.924 --> 00:06:44.507
or where are you in
the vertical direction?
