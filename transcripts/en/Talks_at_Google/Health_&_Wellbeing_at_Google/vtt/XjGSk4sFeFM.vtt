[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.569
DERRICK CARPENTER:
This is going to suck.

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:12.110
I'm making a complete
fool of myself.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm not smart enough.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.420
I don't work fast enough.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.290
I'm not attractive enough,
not extroverted enough, not

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.519
funny enough.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.810
I don't even know why they
hired me in the first place.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.600
I'm just curious how
many of you in the room,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.280
or those are you remotely,
have had a thought, something

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.920
similar to those negative
thoughts I just shared,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.300
recently run through your mind.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.800
Yeah.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.040
So negative thoughts are part
of what it means to be human.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.540
We all have them.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.420
We all feel inadequate, and
doubt ourselves at times.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
Many of us are really
skilled at imagining

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.880
those catastrophic,
worst-case scenarios that

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.380
are going to happen as a
result of the choices we make,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.480
and all of us sometimes
worry that other people are

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.100
thinking the worst about us.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.520
Negative thoughts can
sometimes be helpful.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.340
And, I think, at times
they can motivate us.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.680
They can get us to at
least roll up our sleeves

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.140
and dig our heels
in, to pay attention

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.110
to a threat or a problem
in our environment

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.840
that we otherwise might miss.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.634
But sometimes negative thoughts
are just flat out unhelpful.

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:32.050
And then they can
even be painful.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.570
Sometimes I think our
negative thinking really

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.450
gets us to pass up
opportunities where we otherwise

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.290
might grow and learn.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.590
And I think, at the
worst, negative thinking

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.970
can sabotage our success.

00:01:51.642 --> 00:01:53.850
And I think one of the things
about negative thinking

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.550
that really makes
it toxic is that it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.970
operates in the privacy
of our own minds.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.110
If we let it, it causes
us to struggle in a way

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.680
that we can easily do alone.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.470
Just like every
person I know, I've

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.840
struggled with negative
thinking through different parts

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.380
of my life.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.210
Perhaps one of the
biggest of those times

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.980
was when I was around 19 or 20.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.890
I was a graduate of a
public high school, used

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.410
to being top of my class,
and then all of a sudden

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.340
was in an environment at an
elite East Coast college,

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.970
just trying to stay afloat.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.630
I was on the rowing team
when I was in college.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.020
And during my junior
year, my coach

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.660
noticed that we really
weren't winning our races.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.327
Actually, I bet he
probably noticed this

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:44.868
before my junior
year, because we had

00:02:44.868 --> 00:02:46.060
been losing for a long time.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.662
But this year in
particular he decided

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:49.120
to do something
different about it.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.770
He introduced us to a handful
of techniques in psychology.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.680
He taught us to meditate.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
We tried out different
exercises in visualization.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.840
We read a bunch of
sports psychology books

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.810
that taught us how to
get our mindsets in sort

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.670
of an emotional state
for peak performance.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.190
The goal of all this stuff
was to get us to row better,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.820
and to ultimately win races.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.540
So that upcoming
season, our rowing team

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.240
lost all of our races.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.250
But I noticed that there
was something inside me

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.410
that was beginning to
change a little bit.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.910
Every time I went to the
boathouse for practice,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.994
our workouts seemed just
a little bit easier.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:32.910
I mean, they weren't any
easier, but they just

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.910
felt more manageable to me.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.880
And even outside the boathouse,
when I was just getting ready

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.700
for exams that were coming
up, or had to write a big term

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.710
paper, I was noticing
that the stress

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.170
I felt leading up to those
was just a little bit more

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.830
manageable.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.800
And I actually started
implementing some better study

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.791
habits, I think, as a result,
for the first time in my life.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.290
And when I was going to class,
I noticed that I was actually

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.142
able to focus a little
bit more sharply

00:03:58.142 --> 00:03:59.850
on what the professors
were saying to me.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.550
So there was
something about what

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.310
my coach did in those
interventions that allowed me

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.010
for the first time in
my life to take control

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.290
over my own thinking.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
And to be honest, I
personally just fell in love.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.339
In the decade and
a half since then,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.570
I've spent my entire
education and career learning

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.550
and teaching people the
skills of positive psychology.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.010
So again, I'm really
curious about,

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.720
what does it take to be the kind
of person who exhibits optimism

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.610
and resilience?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.470
And how do we teach
those abilities

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.667
to people who maybe
don't do it as naturally?

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.250
So what I want to
share with you today

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.010
are a handful of
techniques that should

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.400
bear from the science in how
to overcome negative thinking

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.469
and build optimism.

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.010
I'm just going to
say up front, we're

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.760
going to cover a lot
of different things.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.980
There's a handful of different
skills and strategies

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.840
we'll talk about today,
partially because this is not

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.310
a one-size-fits-all approach.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.370
I think some of the
strategies we'll discuss

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.740
might work great
for some of you,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.360
and there just not going
to work at all for others.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.960
So I think one of the keys here
is to just digest this stuff,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.540
and maybe play around and
experiment, and ultimately find

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.210
what works for you.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.660
OK?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.080
Before we talk specifically
about negative thinking,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.620
I just want to review how
our minds work in general.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.370
So the cognitive
model really made

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.902
popular by Aaron Beck,
a psychology professor

00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:34.860
and therapist at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.710
back in the 1960s, laid out
this basic operating procedure

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.460
for our minds.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.150
So there are external
events that happen to us.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.160
Things are happening to
us all day every day.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.230
You know, we come to
a talk over lunch.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.270
We get a text message
from our friends.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.800
Our alarm goes off
in the morning.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.860
And there are
significant events that

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.520
happen across our lives, too.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.590
We get promoted.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.700
We get married.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.485
You name it.

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:03.510
So in response to
those events that

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.850
are happening all
day every day for us,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.750
we have, on the right side, a
set of behaviors and emotions--

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.150
responses to these things.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.120
Our emotions can be
all over the board.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.010
Maybe sometimes we feel
ecstatic or amused by something.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.680
We might feel irritated.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.020
Maybe we have feelings of
bittersweetness in reaction

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.160
to things.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.610
And our behaviors can
take infinite forms.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.900
We can reply back to our
friend a funny one-liner.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.770
Maybe we spend the rest of our
day sulking and complaining.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.590
Maybe we recognize an increased
heart rate and breathing

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.090
rate that's getting
us ready to take

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.740
immediate action
on something that's

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.440
happening in front of us.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.380
The cognitive model
makes the assertion

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.890
that all of those responses,
the emotions and behaviors that

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.115
show up as a result of
what's happening in our life,

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.240
are not directly coming
from the events themselves,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.100
but are coming instead
from our thoughts.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.610
So how are we
interpreting the world

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.620
and what's going on around us?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.700
So let's just say on Friday of
this week you come into work,

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.746
and your boss asks you
to take on an extra task.

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.120
It's an external
event, something

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.435
that's happening to you.

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:20.180
And you might think to
yourself, what a jerk.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.940
She knows I'm too
busy to do this.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.020
And if that's the way
you're thinking about this,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.620
you're going to have a set
of emotions and behaviors

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.690
that follow from that.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.130
The same thing might happen to
somebody else, who might think,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.010
I'm the only one that she
trusts to do this right.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.530
And I think you can imagine that
the emotions and responses that

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.410
are going to follow from
that kind of thought

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.490
are going to be quite
a bit different, even

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.530
though the event itself
was exactly the same.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.490
Now, psychologists have
done a lot of research

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.750
to help us understand the
ways our thinking really work.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.500
So one of the things that
Marty Seligman, who's

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.540
done a lot of work in
this cognitive model,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.930
also at the University of
Pennsylvania, has researched,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.200
is how people respond in
their thinking to adversity.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.150
So when a bad thing happens
to you in your life,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.520
do you tend to focus on the ways
in which you maybe contributed

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.030
to this bad thing happening?

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.640
Or do you focus
on how much effort

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.120
it's going to take to
deal with this thing,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.720
or maybe how it's
going to just ruin

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.090
your plans for the
upcoming weekend?

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.600
Or are you somebody who tends
to focus more on the resources

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.309
that are at your fingertips--

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.000
who can you turn to for support?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.370
Or, what are the
things that you can

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.440
control to make this bad
situation a little bit better,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.530
or if not better, at the very
least more bearable perhaps?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.600
And this dimension, how we
think about bad things happening

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.870
to us, is what psychologists
define as optimistic

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.470
versus pessimistic thinking.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.760
So this is a spectrum
of thinking styles.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.660
All of us have a tendency
to probably think more

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.370
on one side or the
other, but we may also

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.420
vary depending on the
situation or the event at hand.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.140
But generally, when we look at
pessimistic thinking styles,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.324
when a bad thing
happens, when we're

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.740
thinking like a
pessimist, we tend

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.210
to see adversity as threat.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.230
We immediately focus on
what's going to go wrong,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.330
how this is going to hurt us.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.270
Whereas an optimist is much
more likely to see opportunity.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.300
They might label adversity
as a challenge that

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.780
should be risen to, an
opportunity to prove ourselves,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.440
and how we can overcome it.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.560
Pessimists are more likely to
notice and expect the bad just

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560
generally.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.780
So when a pessimist is reviewing
how the last week has gone,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.300
they're more likely to
just stop and focus more

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.850
on the bad things, on
the stressful things,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.210
whereas an optimist is better
at noticing and expecting

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.970
the good, so reflecting
on the things that

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.460
are maybe the more
fortunate parts of what's

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.200
happened recently.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.240
And pessimists,
in their response,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.340
are more likely to
ruminate, to just

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.340
have negative thoughts that
are spinning around and around

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.250
without taking action, getting
stuck in a pattern of thinking,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.020
to isolate themselves.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.715
And when they do act, pessimists
are more likely to act in a way

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:19.340
where they're
misapplying their effort.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.070
They're not really tackling
the source of the problem.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.230
Whereas optimists are
more likely to act

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.870
on what they can control,
to find those little nuggets

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.820
and spaces where they
can do something.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.520
And where there are things
that they can't control,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.230
they're more likely to accept
that and move on from it.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.050
Now, why does this matter?

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.950
So there's a lot of
research on the difference

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.950
between having a pessimistic
versus an optimistic thinking

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.600
style.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.720
I mean, first off, being an
optimist tends to feel better.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.150
It leads to more positive
emotions generally.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.820
But there are a lot
of research studies

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.270
that I think break down the two
major categories through health

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.670
and success, where
optimistic thinking

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.650
styles do a lot for us.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.700
So first off, on health,
a handful of studies

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.920
have shown that
optimistic thinkers tend

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.150
to live on average about
seven to nine years longer

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:16.870
than the most pessimistic
thinkers, a huge difference.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.859
Optimistic thinkers tend to
have stronger immune systems.

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:21.400
So they've done
studies where they've

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.930
brought people into a room.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.600
They know whether you're more
optimistic or pessimistic,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.170
and they actually
sprinkle into the room

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.267
a rhino virus, something that's
going to give you a cold.

00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:33.850
And what they notice
is that the folks

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.890
who think more optimistically--

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.820
I think you have to
sign some waivers first

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.120
to take part in that study.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.337
The optimistic thinkers not
only get sick less frequently,

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:45.670
but when they do get sick,
the duration of their illness

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.710
is shorter.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.740
And I think some of the
most profound results

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.740
in the power of optimistic
thinking come in studies

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.187
on cardiovascular health.

00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:56.770
So there have been
a number of studies

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.996
looking at things like risk for
heart disease or hypertension.

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:03.120
And the general form of
these studies is like this.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.490
They take a group of people,
maybe men in their 50s,

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.720
for example, who are
otherwise fairly healthy.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.661
And they track these folks for
a period of time, say 10 years.

00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:17.410
Along with the tracking,
they know, again,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.743
who the optimistic and who
the more pessimistic thinkers

00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:20.970
in the group are.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.200
And when they compare the most
optimistic to most pessimistic,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.590
they tend to find
rates about two

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.920
to three times more
cardiovascular problems,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.614
so diagnosis of hypertension,
actually having a heart attack.

00:12:33.614 --> 00:12:35.030
And when I say two
to three times,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.210
I'm literally saying
it's 200% to 300%

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.430
increase in your
risk of developing

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.460
cardiovascular problems as
a result of having a more

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.530
pessimistic thinking style.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.250
On the success side,
they've studied everything

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.310
from productivity to
educational success.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.770
It turns out that
optimistic thinking styles

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.480
are a better
predictor of college

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.120
GPA than your high school GPA.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.950
So when they account
for that, you

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.870
tend to do better in school if
you're an optimistic thinker.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.630
They've done research studies
with insurance salespeople,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.460
where the most
optimistic of the group

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.670
have sold about
88% more insurance,

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.010
almost double, than the
pessimistic thinkers.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.930
And there was a neat study done
of an elite college swimming

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.190
team, athletes who were trying
out for the Olympic trials, who

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.730
were asked to swim their
best event by the coach.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.780
And the coach was in
on the research study.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.272
All the athletes didn't know.

00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:34.730
The athletes swam their best
event, and when they finished,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.670
they were given the time.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.100
But the coach tacked on
just a little bit of time,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.630
so they were given
false feedback.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.070
Basically enough
that the athletes

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.140
felt like it was a
failure experience,

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.120
but not so much that
they didn't believe it.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.710
They bought in, like,
wow, I obviously

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.230
didn't swim that as
well as I thought I had.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.390
So they gave the
athletes about 30 minutes

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.210
to go rest up, sit
in the locker room,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.460
do whatever they were going
to do in their own heads

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.400
and thinking, and then
come back and try again.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.680
And the most
pessimistic athletes

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.750
ended up swimming
about, I'm saying,

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.970
1.6% slower, which may
not sound like a lot,

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.180
but in the world of
elite swimming, that's

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.820
the difference between winning
a race and not even being close.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.730
The most optimistic
athletes not only

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.890
swam faster than
the pessimists, they

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.060
swam faster than they had
on their first attempt

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.750
by a slight margin.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.170
But basically, you would ask
them to swim their hardest

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.400
30 minutes ago, and
these optimistic thinkers

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.614
perceived a failure.

00:14:31.614 --> 00:14:34.030
And there's something about
the way an optimistic thinking

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.575
style works, that that failure
turned into fuel, where they

00:14:37.575 --> 00:14:38.950
were able to get
back in the pool

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.470
and actually swim a better
event on their second try.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.690
So there's clearly
a lot of reason

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.540
to have a more optimistic
thinking style.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.570
Now, I'm guessing there's
some of you thinking,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.910
wow, I'm a pessimist.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.930
I guess I'm totally
screwed here.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.420
That's not at all true.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.170
It turns out that, in terms of
different psychological traits,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.420
this thinking style of
pessimism to optimism

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.480
is one of the most learnable and
teachable traits in psychology.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.450
So if you see yourself
as maybe being more

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.030
on that pessimistic side of
the spectrum, that's fine.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.270
You can learn to do
what an optimist does

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.696
in response to adversity.

00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:20.320
And the rest of the skills we're
going to talk about here today

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.320
are ultimately about, how
do you take the skills

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.260
that natural optimists
use to handle and face

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.920
negative thinking?

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.220
So there are four
main strategies

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.750
that I want to
review with you guys,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.380
and just share some tips about,
that optimists use to fight

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.880
their negative thinking.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.000
First is to assess,
to take a look

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.950
and evaluate the negative
thoughts before we

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.480
let them control their
behavior; to distract ourselves,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.100
literally just to divert our
attention to something else;

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.580
to combat the negative
thoughts, to tackle it head on

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.940
and fight back against it;
and to distance ourselves

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.100
from our thinking altogether.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.420
So to just start off,
assessing our thoughts.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.280
Is this negative thought
something to overcome?

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.490
So I think it's really
important to know

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.400
that not all negative thoughts
are created equally, right?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.370
Some negative thoughts
are really helpful for us,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:17.400
and absolutely necessary for
us to navigate in our world.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.144
Let's say you get an email
tomorrow morning that

00:16:20.144 --> 00:16:21.560
reminds you that
you were supposed

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.770
to send in a contribution
for your team yesterday,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.940
and you had totally forgotten.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.220
You might think to
yourself, holy crap,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.840
I completely forgot about that.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.210
My team must think that
I'm not pulling my weight.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.020
I need to get this done ASAP.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.460
I mean, that's a
negative thought.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.094
It doesn't feel
comfortable to imagine

00:16:40.094 --> 00:16:41.760
that your team is
seeing you as somebody

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.170
who is not pulling your weight.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.900
But hopefully the
guilt or anxiety

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.210
or whatever you feel as
a result of that thought

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.770
is getting you to
immediately focus

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.500
on getting that thing
done and emailing it out.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.130
So there are absolutely times
when our negative thoughts are

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.530
cueing us in to what
we need to focus on,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.450
and helping us take action.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.349
I think there are also a lot
of negative thoughts we have,

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.839
and the ones that sound
much more like the "I'm

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.690
not good enough," that
really aren't helping us

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.014
in any productive way.

00:17:13.014 --> 00:17:14.680
And I think a lot of
these thoughts that

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.420
aren't helping us are at times
when we view the events that

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.910
are happening to us in
that cognitive model,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.410
and our thoughts
and interpretations

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.990
about those events are a little
bit twisted or distorted.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.910
We're not seeing the world
completely accurately.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.400
So I want to just talk through
a few of these common patterns

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.440
in which we distort our
interpretation of the world,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.100
and we're not seeing
things accurately.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.670
So cognitive distortions
is a term in a list

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.500
also develop by Aaron
Beck, the father

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.510
of cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.930
He found these
commonalities in ways

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.790
that our thinking
tends to go awry.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.860
The handful I have up
here are just a few.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.550
There are many others.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.310
But these, I think,
illustrate the ways

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.160
in which our distorted thoughts
can really get in our way.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.570
So overgeneralization is
when we take one event

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.190
and we assume that everything
else is going to play out just

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.240
like that.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.880
So maybe it's your
first day on the job,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.460
and you have a few awkward
social interactions

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.486
with people.

00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:16.860
And you start to
think, I'm never

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.970
going to make a friend here.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.630
That thought is not at
all true, you're just

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.530
taking your experience
on this first day,

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.130
and now blowing it out to assume
what the rest of your career

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.500
is going to look like
here at this company.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.350
All or nothing
thinking, where you're

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.726
doing a very black-and-white
division of the world.

00:18:33.726 --> 00:18:35.350
Either things are
one way or the other.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.434
There's no gray.

00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:38.100
Let's say you're in
a performance review

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.100
with your supervisor,
who tells you that you're

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.280
meeting expectations.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.390
Your response to that is, if
I'm not exceeding expectations,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.470
then I'm failing.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.390
And again, that's
not at all true.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.340
There's a huge, huge gap
between failing and meeting

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.760
expectations.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.340
And perhaps exceeding
expectations

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.006
is something that,
by definition, should

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.940
be a little bit more rare.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.500
Disqualifying the
positive-- so you

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.690
pass your boss in the
hallway and he tells you,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.260
you're doing a great job.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.359
And you think to yourself, you
know, he's just being nice.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.400
There were people around.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.250
He had to say that.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.454
You're taking what
is a good thing,

00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:18.120
a piece of positive
feedback, and you're

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.630
finding an excuse to
throw it in the trash,

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.767
to completely disregard it.

00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:25.100
Mind-reading-- when you're
making assumptions about what

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.280
other people are thinking.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.654
So let's say you're
in a meeting,

00:19:27.654 --> 00:19:30.530
you contribute an idea,
and nobody comments.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.077
You think to yourself, they
must all think I'm an idiot.

00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:35.660
You have no idea
what they're thinking

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.910
or why they're not responding.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.540
You're making assumptions.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.250
Emotional reasoning is when
we take our emotions as fact,

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.100
and let that color our
assessment of a situation.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.559
So maybe a new employee
is brought onto your team,

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:51.350
and you're meeting them
for the first time.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:54.579
And for whatever reason, you're
in a really good mood that day.

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:56.120
And so you're more
likely to conclude

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.160
that this person is
competent, somebody

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.269
you're excited to work with.

00:20:00.269 --> 00:20:02.560
If you had met that person
on another day when you just

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.420
happened to be in
a bad mood, you're

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.637
a lot more likely to
feel like they're not

00:20:07.637 --> 00:20:09.220
going to be a good
member of the team,

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.140
and you're going to
dread working with them.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.660
And personalization
is when we tend

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.470
to blame ourselves for the
negative things happening

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.010
around us.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.350
So maybe you noticed
that your boss seems

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.550
like he's in a bad mood today,
and your immediate thought

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.140
is, this is all my fault.
It must be something

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.210
that I did to upset him.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.400
But again, you have no evidence
to say that that's at all true.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.520
So I think it's
important to acknowledge

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.160
these distortions, these
inaccuracies in our thoughts.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.750
And I think the
best way that we can

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.600
do that is, when we
catch ourselves stuck

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.430
in negative thinking,
to just start off

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.670
by asking these two
very simple questions--

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.780
is this true?

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.430
And is this helpful?

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.040
In all those distorted
thoughts, in many cases

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.730
they're not true at all, and in
most cases they're not helpful.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.060
If your negative
thought is true,

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.830
if you really did do
something to upset your boss,

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.840
and that's why
he's in a bad mood,

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.460
and if thinking about
that is helpful,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.251
if it makes you feel
maybe a little guilty,

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:09.790
and leads you to
go and do something

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.950
to repair the
relationship, then that's

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.490
probably a perfectly good thing.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.740
You don't want to fight
against that negative thought.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.960
Just listen to it, and
let it motivate you.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.090
But in situations where our
thoughts aren't true or aren't

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.390
helpful, or in many
cases, neither, then

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.640
I think we need to do
something else to start

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.590
to push that
negative thought away

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.350
and to divert our attention
to something else, which

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.100
is the rest of these
strategies we'll talk through.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.850
So first off, to distract.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.840
Is focusing on this thought
right now in my best interest?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.410
These set of strategies
really work best

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.132
when you catch
yourself ruminating.

00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:47.590
So if you're the
kind of person who

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.437
does get stuck focusing
on negative thoughts,

00:21:50.437 --> 00:21:52.270
this allows you to just
shift your attention

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.610
to something else.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.190
One way that really works
to shift your attention

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.890
is to get into what
psychologists call flow.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:08.260
Flow is a state where you're
fully immersed in an activity.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.707
You feel like time
is passing by,

00:22:11.707 --> 00:22:13.040
and you're not even noticing it.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.373
If you guys have ever been
doing a hobby or an activity,

00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:17.159
and you feel like
it's been 15 minutes,

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:18.700
and you lift your
head up and realize

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.590
it's actually been
an hour and a half,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.090
likely you've been
in a flow state.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.650
Psychologists define
flow by activities

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:32.290
that require us to meet at
fairly high level of challenge,

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.420
but where we also have a
fairly high level of skill

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.720
to meet that challenge.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.010
So you can see how, when
we're in an activity that

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.340
forces us to be fully present to
keep focusing on the next step

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.980
to move forward, we're
not thinking much,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.320
we're just engaged
in the activity.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.020
Rock climbing tends to be one
of the stereotypical examples

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.810
people bring up, and you
can imagine a rock climber

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.514
on a wall who has to focus so
intently on maybe just shifting

00:22:56.514 --> 00:22:58.930
their weight a little bit, and
finding that next handhold.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.870
There's a rock climber I've been
following a bit more recently,

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.140
Alex Honnold.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.400
If you have seen it, he has
a new movie out right now.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.190
He free-soloed, which means
he climbed without any ropes

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.820
whatsoever, El Capitan
here in Yosemite,

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.870
a crazy, unprecedented
feat in rock climbing.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.800
And Alex Honnold calls what
he uses psychologically

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.430
as this mental armor.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.860
He talks about this fact
that, when he's climbing,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.600
he's really in the
zone, and that there's

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.280
something protecting his
head from thinking too much.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.850
He's not self-evaluating.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.300
He's not thinking about how
insane it is, what he's doing.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.400
He's just fully engaged in
the activity in the moment.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.780
And those kinds of activities
are a really great way

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.300
to shift our focus from negative
thoughts to the activity.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.470
Now, I just have a list here
of things like work, exercise,

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.230
art, music, games,
hobbies, different ways

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.260
that hopefully you
can get into flow when

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.860
the challenge meets your skill.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.280
So I would hope
for a lot of you,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.120
there are aspects of
your work where you're

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.489
able to get into a flow state.

00:24:02.489 --> 00:24:04.030
Maybe if you're a
software developer,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.880
and you're deep in code,
trying to solve a problem,

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.575
you're likely to
be in a flow state

00:24:08.575 --> 00:24:10.450
when you're really fully
immersed and engaged

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.370
in that activity.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.800
So I'd just encourage you to
find some ways for yourself,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.980
to think about ways that you tap
into flow states in your day.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.760
A second way to distract is
to build positive emotion.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.060
So negative emotions
by definition,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.400
especially negative emotions
like anger and anxiety,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.860
what they do to us is
they narrow our focus.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.190
They bring our attention
onto a problem.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.760
And positive emotions
literally do the opposite.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.830
They broaden or field of
view, and make it a lot easier

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.870
for us to step back
from those feelings

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.172
like we're stuck in a
rut of negative thought.

00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:49.380
I love the picture of the
baby, perhaps as a way just

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.510
to generate some positive
motion in itself.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.256
Things like humor,
confidence, ways

00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:57.130
to tap into those kinds
of emotions, I think,

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.260
are really fairly easy for us.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.810
I've got a handful
of YouTube channels

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.210
that I go to when I know
I need a good laugh.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:05.920
Or if I can think
about a situation

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.610
when I felt
particularly confident,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.140
and just reflect on it, put
myself back in that space,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.324
and let that emotion
come back to me.

00:25:13.324 --> 00:25:14.740
That can be a
really effective way

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.960
to fight back some
negative thoughts.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.870
And gratitude, in
particular, is an emotion

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.730
that has a lot of
research showing

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:25.930
its benefits for our well-being
and our mental health.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.210
I think there's a lot of
opportunity for all of us

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.510
to recognize how much we
have around us to truly

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.930
appreciate, and to acknowledge
the opportunities that maybe we

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.860
take for granted.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.617
And gratitude is so simple and
straightforward, yet powerful,

00:25:40.617 --> 00:25:42.700
that I actually want to
give you guys all a chance

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.916
to just try this out and
practice this skill right now.

00:25:45.916 --> 00:25:47.290
So what I'm going
to do is, first

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.290
I'm going to ask you
guys for a moment

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.880
to reflect on the question,
who am I grateful for?

00:25:57.297 --> 00:25:58.880
So whoever this is
that comes to mind,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.836
maybe somebody that did
something nice for you

00:26:00.836 --> 00:26:02.210
this week, or
maybe somebody that

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.520
just had a significant
impact on your life,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.160
who are you feeling
grateful for today?

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.880
Once you identify
somebody, I'd like

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.110
for you to turn to somebody
else in the room, and just share

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.420
who you came up with, and
what it is about this person

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.876
that you're feeling
grateful for.

00:26:22.876 --> 00:26:24.750
If you're watching this
and joining remotely,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.060
and you have somebody else
you can turn to and talk

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.920
about this with, that's great.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.690
If you're by yourself,
maybe just take

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.370
a minute to grab
a pen and paper,

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.320
or pull up Notepad
on your computer,

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.820
and just write
down your thoughts.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.695
I'm want to give you
guys about three minutes

00:26:37.695 --> 00:26:40.800
right now just to talk
quickly, and share your moments

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.220
and personal gratitude.

00:27:18.511 --> 00:27:20.510
I always hate shutting
down those conversations,

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.551
but I hope that in just--

00:27:21.551 --> 00:27:23.412
I mean, that was
two minutes maybe

00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:25.620
worth of thinking about
somebody you're grateful for,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.630
and then just taking a moment
to share and talk about it--

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.060
that I'm hoping that you guys
all feel some of that emotion,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.150
and how it can really
shift your focus if you're

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.970
feeling in a bad mood,
or maybe focusing

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.100
a lot on negative thinking.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.290
Gratitude in particular
is a really great strategy

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:43.400
to use at night.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.890
If you find yourself
ruminating on negative thoughts

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.426
and trying to fall asleep, just
recounting maybe some people

00:27:49.426 --> 00:27:51.800
or some things that you're
grateful for from the previous

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.610
day can help you calm your
body back down a little bit,

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.000
shift your emotions, and
help you fall asleep faster.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.440
A third distract strategy
is to focus outward.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.210
So I think just to,
ideally, take yourself out

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.010
of your negative thinking,
focus on helping somebody else.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.760
If you know somebody
who could use a hand,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.797
or just needs somebody who will
listen to them for a moment,

00:28:16.797 --> 00:28:18.630
I think that can be one
of the greatest ways

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.140
to just get out
of your own head.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.870
I think a specific way
that you can practice

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.850
focusing on other people is
to use what UCLA psychologist

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.610
Shelley Gable calls active,
constructive responding.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:36.346
So what she researches is
moments where people around us

00:28:36.346 --> 00:28:37.970
have had something
good happen to them.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.860
They have some good news they
want to share and talk about.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.120
And that when we
engage in those stories

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.720
and listen actively, and ask
questions, and ultimately

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.990
help them relive
that experience,

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.930
re-experience the emotion,
that we both walk away

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.976
with enhanced well-being and
a strengthened relationship.

00:28:56.976 --> 00:28:59.600
So I think it's one way just to
try to get out of our own heads

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.640
a little bit, is to focus
a bit more on finding

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.120
the opportunities to help
other people re-experience

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.490
their good news by
responding in a way that's

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.070
active and constructive,
and allows them

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.560
to re-experience that moment.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.450
So distraction
techniques are OK when we

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.057
need to just shift our focus.

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:21.140
But a lot of times our
negative thoughts, I think,

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.750
are requiring a little
bit more than that.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.320
So sometimes we need to combat
them, and ask ourselves,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.770
is this negative thought
worth taking at face value?

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:38.824
So one way we can do that
is to prove it wrong.

00:29:38.824 --> 00:29:40.240
And this is literally
just drawing

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.140
from the massive research in
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.080
It's about taking
thoughts that are untrue,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.810
and finding a way to argue
back against them by searching

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.230
for the truth, and providing
the evidence to do that.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.450
So if early this morning
you gave a presentation,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.830
and now you're just
walking around thinking,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.590
that presentation went horribly,
but you don't have any evidence

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.210
backing that thought up.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.150
It's just there.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.200
It's the way you feel
about how things went.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.912
You might be well served to
prove that thought wrong.

00:30:10.912 --> 00:30:13.120
And one way you can do that
is to just literally flip

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.350
the phrase around, and to argue
the presentation went well

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.580
because--

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.360
and to fill in the blanks.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.810
And to identify
whatever specific,

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.810
vivid piece of evidence you
have to argue against it.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:29.230
And so you might think back
to the presentation and say,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.120
you know, this
presentation did go well,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.930
because three people came up to
me afterwards and had questions

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.560
to ask, and they were obviously
engaged in what I had to say.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.150
Or maybe this
presentation went well

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.820
because I stuck to my
plan and I communicated

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.600
the issues clearly,
concisely, and people got it.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.720
Whatever it is, finding a way
to really pull on that evidence

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.250
can help us prove an untrue
negative thought wrong.

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.640
One thing to be aware of
is the confirmation bias

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.790
while you're doing this.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.790
And the confirmation
bias is just

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.520
a psychological tendency
that plays out for all of us

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.360
all the time.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.960
It operates in a way that it
maintains the beliefs and world

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.540
views that we currently have.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.160
So when you're
thinking to yourself,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.100
the presentation didn't
go well, and you're

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.060
endorsing and believing
that as your starting point,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.860
all the evidence that
supports it not going well

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.559
is going to be
much more salient.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.600
Like, you're going to
remember the two people who

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.090
spent the whole presentation
on their phones,

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.390
and you're not thinking at
all about the other 10 who

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.410
were engaged and
nodding their heads

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.100
and looking like they
were totally getting it.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.440
Or you might focus completely
on the one person who

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.074
got up and left the
room right away,

00:31:43.074 --> 00:31:45.490
rather than the three people
who came up and had questions

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:46.630
for you.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.400
So when you're trying
to find the evidence

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.800
against your thoughts,
to recognize that there's

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.010
this tendency pulling you
constantly towards why

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.430
your negative thought is true.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.513
So you have to put it in
a little bit extra effort

00:31:57.513 --> 00:31:59.860
sometimes to find that
evidence against it.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.016
But I do think that the
more you practice this,

00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:04.390
the better you can get at
fighting that confirmation bias

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.390
and thinking flexibly.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:11.290
Another way we can combat our
thoughts is to reframe them.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.050
Sometimes our thoughts
aren't exactly things

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.670
that we can prove untrue.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.732
Maybe you have a really
long to-do list when

00:32:18.732 --> 00:32:21.190
you get into work tomorrow,
and you just think to yourself,

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.080
this is going to suck.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.830
All right.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.050
Maybe we can't prove
that is untrue, exactly,

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.970
but it's probably
not going to help

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.292
you get through your to-do
list to focus on that thought.

00:32:31.292 --> 00:32:33.250
So one thing that I like
to recommend to people

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.300
is to imagine somebody
who you admire

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:40.240
for their optimism,
somebody who is constantly

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.520
seeing silver linings in
the things around them.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.860
And imagine for a
moment, how would they

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.920
be thinking about
this situation?

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.040
For me in particular, my
wife is my model of this.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.075
Whenever I'm stuck in this "I
see all the dark clouds" stuff,

00:32:54.075 --> 00:32:56.200
she really does a good job
at helping bring me back

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.910
towards the silver linings.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.610
So she might help me to
see that, you know what?

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.170
You have a lot on
your plate today,

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.940
but it's an opportunity to
prove what you're capable of,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.020
and you're probably going to
learn a lot along the way.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.850
And when you go through
your day thinking about,

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.650
what am I going to learn today?

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.580
Rather than, how is
today going to suck?

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.720
You notice very
different things,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.980
and you show up in
completely different ways.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.920
So I think it's
important to acknowledge,

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.630
when these thoughts
aren't helping us,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.790
how can we reframe
them in a way that

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.490
makes them more productive?

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.479
Lastly, and perhaps one of
the most powerful strategies

00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:34.020
we can use against
negative thinking,

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.970
is to distance ourselves.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.360
Now, these techniques generally
are a little bit harder.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.210
They often require a little
bit of practice for them

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.627
to be really effective.

00:33:43.627 --> 00:33:45.210
But when you do
practice them, I think

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:48.390
they can probably be the best
approach we have to conquering

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.720
negative thinking.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.300
And we must ask
ourselves, should I

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.670
let this negative thought
determine my response at all?

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.650
Does this not even matter?

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.750
So the first way to
think about distancing

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.210
is to just let the thought pass.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.890
If any of you are
practicers of a meditation,

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.710
meditation is exactly
about allowing a thought

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:13.239
to come into our awareness
and then pass it back away.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.330
In Buddhist philosophy,
there's this concept

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.659
of us having this monkey
mind, that when we actually

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.880
tune into what our minds
are doing all day long,

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.460
we start to recognize that
these thoughts are just flitting

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.368
everywhere out of control.

00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:27.909
And we often aren't
even aware of it,

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:30.489
because we're just engrossed
in taking the thoughts as truth

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.560
and living our lives.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.730
So this picture that I have up
of a lifeguard chair on a beach

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.460
is one that came to
me when I was first

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.949
learning to meditate, and
back with my rowing coach

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:46.449
back when I was in college,
that I just started meditating,

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:50.790
and after a while I
saw myself climbing up

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:55.060
in this lifeguard-chair
type thing where I could see

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.890
below me, just far
enough away, my thoughts,

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.840
that were playing out,
doing their crazy things.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.450
But I myself was actually
just a little bit separated

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:05.970
from those thoughts.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.870
And that started,
over time, to give me

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.300
a little bit of perspective,
that I could acknowledge

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.690
that thought as being
there, but it's not me,

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.420
and I don't have to let it
drive my behavior or my emotion

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.590
in the moments.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.470
To be frank with you,
I think it took me time

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.580
to really build that.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.080
I mean, for the
first time I did it,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.240
it felt like that
lifeguard tower didn't even

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.310
have any rungs to
get up to the top.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.770
It took time for that to
become something that I was

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.032
able to switch my mindset into.

00:35:32.032 --> 00:35:33.490
But after a while,
it was something

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.780
that I was able to do
outside meditation.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.140
That just in the moment
of thinking negatively,

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.690
that you start to recognize
that you can observe

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.760
those thoughts as just
thoughts, and they don't

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.130
have to drive your reactions.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.050
Mindfulness practices
are very similar,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.900
where we don't
necessarily have to be

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.350
mindful and observant about
what's going on in our minds.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:55.750
We could go and have
lunch, and practice

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.990
having a mindful lunch, where
we're just really noticing

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.940
the sensory perceptions
while we eat,

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.910
and what does our food really
taste like and smell like?

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:05.740
But allowing
ourselves to just be

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.260
an observer of our
experience, and that

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.075
can give you that same distance
over time if you practice it.

00:36:12.075 --> 00:36:15.610
And ACT is an acronym for
acceptance and commitment

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.890
therapy, which if you're
interested in this line

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.450
of thinking, they're
very similar.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:23.170
Where the philosophy
behind ACT is

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.350
that we allow our thoughts
to come into our awareness,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.550
but not dictate our response,
that our choice of behavior

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.590
is different than the
thought showing up.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.470
A second way we can
distance ourselves

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.050
is to just write
about our thoughts.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.550
There's a lot of research
on expressive writing,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.310
and how just putting
our thoughts on paper

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:48.790
generally can help us deal with
stress and improve our mood.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.050
In particular, when people write
about adversities or challenges

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.350
in their lives, the
ability to just find

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.880
meaning in those experiences
becomes a lot easier.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.630
And I think the basic
idea here is just

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.754
by putting your thoughts
on paper, getting them out

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:06.000
of your head, you're able to
just step back that little bit,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.650
and to reflect on
them in a way they

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:13.000
can help you process and find
different interpretations.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.770
One way in particular that
you guys might try to write

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.720
or journal,
especially when you're

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.180
stuck in a pattern
of negative thinking,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.260
is to do what we call a
self-compassion letter.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.310
Where what you do
is, just imagine

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:29.940
that you're writing a letter
to a good friend of yours who's

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.699
being too hard on themselves.

00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:33.240
But the friend that
you're writing to

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.960
is actually yourself.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.260
So you might write it
in the second person.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.560
"I think you should be
aware that you're being

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.000
too hard on yourself lately.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.980
You've been doing
a really good job."

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.590
Whatever that is, to write
yourself a letter that

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.380
engages the emotion of
compassion and forgiveness

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.790
for yourself.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.910
And they've done
research on when

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.520
people go through
experiences of failure

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.890
or have an adversity,
where things don't go well,

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.260
the people who can feel
a sense of compassion

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.710
for themselves do much
better at working through it,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:09.280
and approaching another
adversity much better.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.610
Finally, I think maybe
just one of the most

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.010
subtle and interesting ways
we can distance ourself

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.710
from negative thoughts
is just to act anyway.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.790
And one of the
meditation teachers

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.880
who is really popular
in psychology,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.550
who studied meditation in
the West, is John Kabat Zinn.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:32.260
And he talks about how
we are not our thoughts.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.960
And I think if you take
that notion far enough,

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.710
and you recognize that whatever
we're thinking in a moment

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.860
doesn't necessarily have to
drive at all how we behave

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.480
or how we show up.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.300
And I think that this
Vincent van Gogh quote,

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.800
"If you hear a voice
within you say,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.770
'You cannot paint,'
then by all means paint,

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.300
and that voice
will be silenced."

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.660
It's one that carries a lot
of weight when we're trying

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.410
to overcome negative thoughts.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.210
I've always found, I think
one of the maybe cruelest

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.270
practical jokes
of our psychology

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.920
is that when we're trying
to do something that's

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.275
a little intimidating, and
maybe brings up some fear

00:39:08.275 --> 00:39:10.240
or anxiety for
us, a lot of times

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.674
what we're wanting to feel
in that moment is confidence.

00:39:13.674 --> 00:39:15.340
In reality, the way
our psychology works

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.000
is that we do the thing, we
prove to ourselves that we can,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.770
and the confidence
comes after the fact.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.850
So that over time we can
build confidence and grow,

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.160
but in a way, our
ability to just find

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.920
a conviction to act anyway--

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.970
like, yeah, I'm afraid.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.270
Yeah, I don't want to do
this right now, but I can,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.650
and I will.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.260
And then at the tail end of
it, that confidence and belief

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.910
in yourself starts
to come over time.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:50.060
So just to review, we've got our
strategies of assess, distract,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.050
combat, and distance.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.880
As I mentioned up
front, no one of these

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.680
is going to work
perfectly for all of you.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.020
So I think experimenting some,
and finding the ones that

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.910
really do help
you in the moment,

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.320
is an individual experience.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.861
And you may have to
play around a bit

00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:07.590
to find those that do help.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.010
I want to punctuate that all
of these strategies we're

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:15.020
talking about are ways you
can manage thoughts yourself.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.160
And if these help
and they get you

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.980
far enough down the
field towards avoiding

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.530
your negative thoughts and
feeling the feelings that come

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.990
from them, that's fantastic.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.020
But you absolutely
do not have to fight

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.180
all of your negative
thinking on your own.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.880
If these strategies alone
are not helping you,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.340
I just want to make a very
clear statement that there

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.210
are resources and people
who are wanting to help

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.590
and are willing to help.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.190
I know here for you folks
working at Google and YouTube,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.590
you've got folks
in EAP, or people

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.987
at [? Go Mental Health ?] who
can be these resources when

00:40:49.987 --> 00:40:51.570
maybe you've tried
some of this stuff,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.550
and it's not working
on its own, or at least

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.716
who can help you apply some
this stuff in a way that

00:40:55.716 --> 00:40:57.630
does work better for you.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.190
So I just want to
encourage everybody

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.810
who's listening, if
you find yourself

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.226
stuck in negative thinking,
you don't have to go it alone.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.000
I do want to share with
you guys some of what

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.980
Happuify has to
offer around this.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:18.612
So Happify is a platform
where we teach and take you

00:41:18.612 --> 00:41:20.820
through a lot of the skills
and strategies we've just

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.010
discussed, where
you can practice

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.710
and begin to get a
facility with all

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.350
of these different ways of
enhancing your well-being,

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:31.380
avoid negative thoughts, to be
more productive in your work,

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.210
you name it.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.090
So you guys can go to
GoHappify, and you'd

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.990
be brought straight
to this sign up page.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.390
And I want to walk you through
the site for a minute or two.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.660
If you were to click
Start Your Journey,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.430
you would just get an
initial assessment here

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.650
that includes some questions--

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.530
"Do you have a hard time
bouncing back after adversity?"

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.030
A few other assessments
of your psychology.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.130
And based on your
assessment, we're

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.620
going to recommend some tracks
for you right off the bat.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.140
So you'll see that "Conquer
Your Negative Thoughts"

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.200
is a track that I created
a few years ago, where

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.360
basically everything
we've talked about today

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.719
is embedded in this track.

00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:12.760
If this is one you wanted
to select for yourself,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.310
you could go
through and practice

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.290
all of these skills
in a guided way.

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:21.000
And again, if you
click on a track,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.630
these tracks are developed
so that they take place over

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:26.010
about a four-week time period.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.990
They're chunked into
four different parts,

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.290
to make sure that you're taking
on a sizable piece at any given

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.150
time.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.900
So if you were to jump
in to start Part 1,

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.620
you'd see a few activities
there on that activities list,

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:41.456
things like Uplift
or Smell the Roses.

00:42:41.456 --> 00:42:43.080
An activity like
Thanks, Thanks, Thanks

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.010
is one of the first
ones you'd see here,

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.190
which is an exercise of
gratitude similar to what

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.980
we just practiced together.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.750
We're just asking you to
think about three good things

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.500
that happened to you today and
why you feel grateful for them.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.110
And then you would
just fill this in.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.136
You can also just explore
our tracks openly.

00:43:01.136 --> 00:43:03.010
So you don't have to do
the recommended ones.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.750
And we have featured
tracks, and we also

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.412
have tracks blocked
out by category.

00:43:07.412 --> 00:43:09.370
So you notice things like
Health and Well Being

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:10.900
and Relationships.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.580
We have a category
on Work and Money,

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.270
that if you were
to click in there,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.210
you'd find all kinds
of tracks on how

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.050
to be a more mindful
leader, how to develop grit,

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.360
how to feel more
energized about your job.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:28.300
And again, all of these
tracks are four-week courses

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.660
that take you through a variety
of positive psychology skills

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.570
to move you towards these goals.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.290
A few other things you just
would find on Happify's site,

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.920
in addition to the
tracks, is what

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.210
we call Happify Daily,
just a content media post

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:48.325
on stories and videos, which
are just good news things.

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:49.700
If you're in that
place where you

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.860
want to distract for a
moment and find something

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.350
to uplift you, there's
plenty of things

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.290
here on Happify Daily that will
just put you in a better mood,

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.890
and remind you that there's
plenty of good in this world

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.350
despite not always seeing it.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.720
We have a community page
with different forums

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.150
where you can go in and
just chat with other folks

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.220
about your struggles,
your successes

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.910
with these different activities.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.790
And you can also share posts
with the community at large.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:19.640
There's an Instant Play section,
where, even outside of a track,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.250
you can just go in and
do these activities.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.580
If you were to click on Guided
Meditation, for example,

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.419
these are all meditations
that are embedded

00:44:28.419 --> 00:44:30.085
in different tracks
throughout the site,

00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:33.560
but you can just go in directly
and choose a meditation.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.220
And you'll get one of
the leading facilitators

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.262
in meditation, people like
Sharon Salzberg, for example,

00:44:40.262 --> 00:44:41.720
will guide you
through a meditation

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.800
towards a specific end.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.560
You can just play around
with these freely.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.760
There's also games
on the site that

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.480
have been designed to help
enforce the psychology

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.200
interventions.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.620
So things like Uplift
is a game where

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.110
you're trying to
focus on balloons that

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.080
have positive words rather
than negative words,

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.840
and your score is going to
increase over time if you're

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.180
able to pop the
balloons with positive

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.860
and avoid the ones
with negative.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.510
So just subtly
training your mind

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:14.390
to focus more on the
good than the bad.

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:17.330
And there's a
assessment section,

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.890
you can keep track of
your happiness score.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.950
And you can also follow
your assessments over time,

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:28.450
and track your well-being.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.050
I do want to just
say, in closing,

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:33.730
that negative thoughts are
part of our human experience,

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.454
as I said up front.

00:45:35.454 --> 00:45:38.120
I don't think our goal in any of
this stuff is to stop ourselves

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.360
from thinking negatively.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.340
I mean, we're humans.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.130
These thoughts are
going to arise for us.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.030
And no matter what we
do, at times they're

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.350
going to get in our way.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.640
But to find just
small ways where

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.732
we can acknowledge
that we're not alone,

00:45:49.732 --> 00:45:51.440
we all think this way
at times, and that,

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.010
when we're really
finding ourselves stuck,

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.570
that we have plenty
of strategies,

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.320
or hopefully plenty
of people in our lives

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.700
that we can turn to who
can help us through it.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.980
So I wish you guys the
best of luck with it.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.910
Yeah, And do you guys
have any questions, too,

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.720
before we close?

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.110
I'm happy to do any
Q&amp;A for a few minutes.

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.605
AUDIENCE: I have kind
of a silly question.

00:46:11.605 --> 00:46:13.480
One of the techniques
you talk about in terms

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.064
of letting thoughts pass
is to write it down.

00:46:17.064 --> 00:46:18.730
Is there a difference
between writing it

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.790
down in paper and pen and
writing it down electronically?

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.200
Because I'm
thinking, it might be

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.720
nice during the workday,
if stuff comes up to just,

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.760
on the computer, since
I'm there already,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.660
to write it down there.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.750
But I don't know if you
have any thoughts on that.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.980
DERRICK CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.710
So I think--

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:33.990
I'll answer twofold.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.630
I think the process of writing
down your thoughts in any way

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.030
is going to gain you some
distance and some ability

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:41.034
to reflect.

00:46:41.034 --> 00:46:42.700
But I will say that
most of the research

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.740
on the power of journaling
and writing really

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:48.490
does take place with a
pen or pencil on paper,

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:50.900
where you're not only
just writing the thoughts,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.350
but you're literally
creating the words on a page.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.930
And I think that, if
for no other reason

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:58.080
than it's easier to
type on your computer,

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.070
then grab a pen and
a piece of paper.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:02.170
If you don't have access
to it, I think still

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.400
writing is going to help.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.990
But by all means,
I think to do it

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.040
on paper is probably
going to serve you better.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:07.610
Yeah.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.277
Sure.

00:47:09.277 --> 00:47:11.110
AUDIENCE: I'll ask a
question from the Dory,

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.110
and then if anyone in here has
another one we can do that.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:17.290
"With current proliferations of
meditation like Headspace and G

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:21.280
Calm, is there a risk of users
with anxiety or mental health

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:24.610
issues, mild or severe, not
addressing issues and instead

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.984
suppressing them via
meditation as opposed

00:47:26.984 --> 00:47:28.900
to approaching them with
trained professionals

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.762
or at least CBT apps at home?"

00:47:31.762 --> 00:47:32.762
DERRICK CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:47:32.762 --> 00:47:34.300
It's a fantastic question.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:38.710
I think that the
answer ultimately

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.550
may be dependent person
by person in context.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.350
But I will just highlight
again, that first strategy

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.330
I talked about was to assess.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.470
Where before we do any
of these other things,

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:50.800
I think it's important to
look at the negative thoughts

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.190
for just a moment, and
to say, is this true?

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:55.540
Is this a helpful thought?

00:47:55.540 --> 00:48:00.100
Is there something here that
I need to put my attention on?

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.190
Because if, in many cases, our
negative thoughts are trying

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:06.100
to give us messages to act
and respond in a certain way,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.130
if all we do is turn that aside
and ignore it, then absolutely,

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.280
we can create problems
that we're not addressing.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:15.460
But I think when we acknowledge
that our thoughts aren't true

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.070
and aren't helping us,
that generally, meditation

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.819
is a fantastic approach
to help us manage anxiety

00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:23.110
and some of those thoughts
that are really just getting

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:24.700
in our way.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.700
AUDIENCE: I have three more
Dory questions, but yes.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:32.470
AUDIENCE: So if we want to
become more of an optimist,

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.460
what would you say
is the first step?

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.544
Like, how would you start?

00:48:36.544 --> 00:48:38.501
DERRICK CARPENTER: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:40.240
There's a lot of
research specifically

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.990
on how optimists think, and what
they do in adverse situations.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.990
But I think just
flat out, the key

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.960
is that optimists identify
what they can control.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.740
So I think to practice
thinking more like an optimist,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.650
the next time you find yourself
in a situation that's maybe

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.200
frustrating, or maybe
you're feeling impatient,

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.250
maybe feeling anxious,
to train your mind

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.050
to immediately focus
on something you can

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.620
do to improve the situation.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.200
Even if it's, at
the very least, just

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.300
internally, to
improve your emotions

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.340
and how you're feeling--

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.470
that what an optimist does is
finds those points of control

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.520
and leverages the
heck out of those.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.600
So I think that alone
is going to get you

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.180
pretty far in terms of shifting
your thinking to a more

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.710
optimistic style.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:25.440
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.940
Another Dory
question, "How do you

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.980
balance managing
negative thoughts

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.230
without settling or
accepting situations

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.400
that you should not be?

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.220
For example, if in a
bullying work environment,

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.180
or an unhappy
personal relationship,

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.760
such as a marriage,
you definitely

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.560
want to manage thoughts,
but you may want

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.991
to maintain your standards."

00:49:41.991 --> 00:49:42.990
DERRICK CARPENTER: Yeah.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.680
I think this just goes back to
the skill of assessing first.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.320
If you're having
negative thoughts

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.190
that are honest and true
thoughts about a very hard

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.730
situation you may be facing--

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.990
the situations in life
aren't always easy.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.790
We all acknowledge
that as human beings.

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:01.560
If you're in a
situation that's not

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.320
healthy for you, the negative
thoughts that are bubbling up

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.990
around that are, I think, a
clear message that's telling

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:08.779
you, you have to do something.

00:50:08.779 --> 00:50:10.320
So those are not
the thoughts that we

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.387
want to fight back
against or try to avoid.

00:50:12.387 --> 00:50:14.220
I think the more that
we can tune into those

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.359
and allow them to guide
our responses, the better.

00:50:18.359 --> 00:50:18.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.040
Last Dory question
is, "How can people

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.500
relieve stress and
dread about things that

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.750
are or feel truly unchangeable?

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.990
For example, a project that you
know you cannot finish on time,

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.600
an exam you know you are not
prepared for, a deadline that

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.030
you just realized you missed
that will adversely affect

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.639
you."

00:50:35.639 --> 00:50:36.680
DERRICK CARPENTER: Great.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.180
Yeah.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.080
So I think this
goes back, again,

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.500
to what an optimistic thinking
style is really about,

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.510
acknowledging those
things we can't control,

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.070
and letting those things pass.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.820
Now, first off, I think
in those examples,

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.600
something like a test you're
not feeling prepared for--

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.910
by all means, even if
the test is in an hour,

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.770
an hour is a lot of
room to do something

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.710
you have control over.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:56.630
So I would say an
optimist, first

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.610
and foremost, wouldn't
let that thought go.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.484
They would do something
to prepare themselves

00:51:00.484 --> 00:51:01.920
as much as they
could in an hour.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.920
But if it's something you
really don't have control over,

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.670
I think the skills
of distancing,

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.380
to write about it
and journal about it,

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.230
or to find a mindfulness or
meditation practice where

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.082
you can just let these thoughts
come into your awareness

00:51:15.082 --> 00:51:16.790
and then acknowledge,
I can't do anything

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.662
about this, whatever
emotions are coming up

00:51:18.662 --> 00:51:21.120
around this are there, but I'm
just going to let them pass.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.536
And again, shift
my attention more

00:51:22.536 --> 00:51:24.980
towards what I can do
to improve my situation,

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.059
to get myself into
a healthy place.

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:28.100
Thank you guys very much.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.550
[APPLAUSE]
