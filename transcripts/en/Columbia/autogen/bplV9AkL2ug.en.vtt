this thing now I noticed that I brought
 

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
this thing now I noticed that I brought
in<00:26:50.580><c> Xerox</c><00:26:51.580><c> copy</c><00:26:52.030><c> that's</c><00:26:52.480><c> because</c><00:26:53.020><c> we</c><00:26:54.030><c> can't</c>

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
in Xerox copy that's because we can't
 

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.820 align:start position:0%
in Xerox copy that's because we can't

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:58.830 align:start position:0%
find we can't find it in the collection
 

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.130 align:start position:0%
find we can't find it in the collection
so<00:26:59.830><c> I'm</c><00:27:00.730><c> assuming</c><00:27:00.850><c> that</c><00:27:01.360><c> monkey</c><00:27:01.660><c> Hassan</c><00:27:01.960><c> is</c>

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:02.140 align:start position:0%
