Speaker 1:          00:01          Listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. E n. N. P. R. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage your host for this evening.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich. [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:33          Okay, so Robert and I have been on tour for the last two months. We went to city after city after city, something like 21 cities. We went to year. We were both like, yeah, sick kicked their asses, but it was so much fun and the show was called apocalyptical is about endings, which is not the most obvious topic to choose to invite people to do with theaters. Hey, we're going to just tell you different stories that end really brilliantly, but these are, this is a series of ending stories. That's what we did that night and we did it with some amazing musicians and comedians and video artists who projecting beautiful images on these massive screens above our head and also we had puppets, enormous, beautiful, articulate, gorgeous puppets, and you can see all this. We are releasing a really nicely shot video of this entire performance at the same time as this audio podcast. Go to radiolab.org/live you can watch the whole thing. He knows some of the best moments of the show were purely visual, so we'd encourage you to check it out. But what follows is the audio podcast version of that show, which we recorded live at the paramount in Seattle. This show actually

Speaker 4:          01:44          truly begins with a radical rethinking of one of the most important ending stories that has ever happened on planet earth, which is the story about the end of the dinosaur.

Speaker 1:          01:54          There's all kinds of, uh, dinosaur puppetry, beautiful stuff at the beginning, uh, which we're going to skip over. But again, you can check it out at radiolab.org/live we're going to jump to the part where we hear from scientists who had been forensically probing this moment and have a totally new way of thinking about it. Okay, we're going to start you off with a guy. Well, the guy who started it off for us, it's a guy named Jay Jay Malosh

Speaker 4:          02:14          professor at Purdue University, and I study impact craters among other things.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Not only can Jay Malosh create impact craters with his mind, but he and his colleagues have been investigating this moment almost as if it were a crime scene that happened not 60 million years ago, but yesterday. And the story that they've put together, it's more than just interesting. It's frankly, frankly terrifying and weirdly specific as it happens. Take for example the seemingly simple question of when, when did it happen? You don't mean like the year, cause that would be a little too specific. No, I don't know if you remember what Jay, you got even more specific than that. This was a casual question that I threw out. Listen to his answer. By

Speaker 5:          03:00          the way, do we know anything about seasons? Was this hit at warm particularly? Actually it was between, well this is a bit of a stretch, but it was some time between June and July. Helium, you can say that. And so specifically, how would you know that the reasoning is we can, for example, um, this was the a, this was the first surprise. Kind of a controversial idea, but that basically goes like this. J says, scientists have found some pollen in rocks, which date from that time to different kinds of pollen and based on an analysis of those two kinds of pollen,

Speaker 4:          03:30          we know that the um, impact took place between the flowering of the Lotus and the flowering of the water and only [inaudible]. Okay, so that's what Lotus you see flowering on the left gets a water, the leaf flowering on the right, you can see this. If you look at our video online fossils found at the impact site that had pollen from both of these flowers in the same rock, which suggest that the impact did in fact take place somewhere between June and July. It's one of those things in geometry, we, we get a glimpse of a a moment far, far back in time.

Speaker 5:          04:04          So let's go deeper into that moment.

Speaker 6:          04:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:14          all right, everybody, let's collectively rewind our minds back in time. 10 millions of years into the past 66 million years ago to be precise. There they are, majestic beasts hanging out on the plains, eating their lotus leaves sometime in June, June 17th let's say, and everything on this day.

Speaker 4:          04:48          Pretty much normal. This particular fateful day was no different than any of millions and millions of previous days as far as the dinosaurs were concerned, but if there were any strong numbers at the time, which they weren't, they might have had some inkling that something was coming because they looked up. They would have seen

Speaker 1:          05:09          tiny

Speaker 4:          05:10          no dot have lightened the sky wars planets, the moon move with respect to the stars. This would have had a constant bearing and the old semen could tell you that if you see something constant bearing that's on a collision course with you and that thing of course is are asteroid zeroing in on the earth. I want to say that we do know quite a bit about this asteroid from the size of the creator and from the amount of certain minerals found at the impact site. We know that the asteroid was roughly six miles wide and then again roughly six miles long, which makes it approximately the size of Manhattan island or our Mount Everest. It's roughly the size of Mount Everest. That is Doug Robertson, a geologist who knows quite a bit about this asteroid and by the way it has a and that it's, it's the asteroids called Baptist Stena Baptist Dema y that Stena Baptist in, I dunno, update the name asteroids on another subject. We do know that the Earth's moon was probably produced by a collision with something the size of Mars.

Speaker 5:          06:15          Well I just threw that in cause it's cool. It doesn't really relate to us.

Speaker 4:          06:20          Sorry, we don't have the whole evening here. Let's just stay to it. Okay. The dinosaurs are here on earth. They are eating near leaves. Meanwhile, up in space, our asteroid Baptist Dina is now hurtling towards the earth, 20,000 miles an hour area fast 20 times faster than a very fast rifle moment and scientists couldn't be sure what would happen mathematically. I mean when in a Mount Everest size bullet traveling at 20,000 miles an hour, it's our atmosphere. The atmosphere is really just a very, very thin skin over the rest of the earth.

Speaker 5:          06:49          So scientists that, all right, if we're going to construct this story, let's just take it piece by piece and first figure out what would happen when this big ball hurling through space slams into our atmosphere, which is made of gas of course. So just to approximately, let's fire a bullet through some gas

Speaker 1:          07:07          and watch what happens. Now here we basically showed a super slow motion video of a gun firing a bullet underwater. You can see it on our website, radiolab.org it's very beautiful. You see the bullet coming out and freeze it right there at the edge. Okay. Basically what you see is this bullet steaming through the water. And by the way, we use water as an approximation for gas. Cause in gas you'd have this same effect I'm about to describe creating a wake behind it and the week gets wider and wider as it trails away from the bullet. And if you imagine this shape in three dimensions,

Speaker 5:          07:37          really what you're looking at is a kind of a cone, like a funnel shape. And inside the the, the, that, the wallets of the funnel inside that cone is nothing, nothing, nothing. Because it's in water. So you're saying there's, there's, it's like a hole in the water. That's what I'm saying. There's nothing in there. It's a vacuum in there because the, the bullet is sh is shooting through the water. It pushes the water out of the way and for a beat, the water doesn't have time to come back together and so all you have is emptiness in there. Right there. This, what you're seeing is a massive hole in the water created by a tiny little bullet. Now imagine that that bullet is six miles wide and the hole that it's making is right above your head. Well, what does that mean? If you're a dinosaur looking up would, what would happen?

Speaker 4:          08:20          Well, if you were in the right place and this is going to be the wrong place in the secondary to you, we're in the right place to, to look behind the asteroid as it came in. You'd probably be able to, to see clearly through the space

Speaker 2:          08:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:40          what does that mean? You would suddenly be looking at a nighttime hole in a daytime sky. Right. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          08:49          To be fair, Jay did tell us that, uh, you would need special kinds of eyeballs to see this knight hole

Speaker 7:          08:56          in the day sky and the Dinah's didn't have that. So science still, I mean just imagine what a last image that would be to see day and night come together in the same moment. But according to Jay, you better not blink because before you could open your eyes again

Speaker 2:          09:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          09:20          the asteroid would have hit the surface. And if you are in a position to see that, then you're going to be in Gulf by the violence that is just about to occur. By the way, the audience was just laughing at a dinos de Los Muertos graphic that just came on the screens. So we know it was a big explosion, fine, and it was violent, fine. But I think we should be a little bit subtle about this because obviously if an asteroid is the size of Manhattan and it lands on your head, you're not going to feel very good about that. But if Manhattan is, is hitting the planet earth, that's a little bit like a pebble hitting an enormous beach ball. Yeah, and I can imagine that the, the little pebble size relativistically speaking the pebble would create some damage in the spot where it landed. But let's suppose that you are um, alleviating mother of three Hadrosaur living in New Zealand. Right? And you're just spent at the moment that the asteroid comes in, you're on your Antipolo going the other side of the planet. Would you have any idea that this was happening? That was the next question that we talked to Jay. How much damage would this thing actually do? Well, we can do experiments.

Speaker 1:          10:30          We can produce things, situations like this in small quantities in the laboratories gay. Y'All send in here, which brings us, we're good to hear. You're good to this guy. Peter Schultes and I like to do impact experiments. Pete Schultz basically has every 13 year olds dream job. He gets to blow shit up for living. Basically what B does is he works at this place that you're seeing right here on the screen. This is the NASA Ames laboratory in California. And uh, the thing that they're putting together, they're in the middle of frame. That is a giant three story tall canon. What beat does is he takes projectile. So for example, you're going to see him take a little glass bullet over there and he's going to load it into the top of the cannon and then he's going to fire it right into a standup for planet earth, which for him will be a sand pit. And lucky for us when we called Pete, he was just about to pull the trigger on this thing. So you're are calling you on a day in which you are trying to IX re-experience the day. I actually, yeah, but I think for him to survive, that's our plan

Speaker 8:          11:35          it in recent. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker 1:          11:38          We've got to assume the position. Okay. We have to cross our fingers.

Speaker 8:          11:42          Okay, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. We have all, I'm already like, here we go.

Speaker 2:          11:56          Rolling.

Speaker 1:          12:02          Um,

Speaker 7:          12:03          that is gorgeous. Oh my gosh. Are They gonna? Is that get instant playback thing. Oh my gosh.

Speaker 5:          12:12          That is the sound of a man. Very happy with his explosion.

Speaker 2:          12:18          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          12:18          You can see every piece of this, of what's happening. So based on experiments like this, people like p can figure out precisely what happened when the asteroid hit the earth. They can quantify the explosions power by basically leveraging up experiments like this. So according to Doug, the amount of energy that would have been on leash when that thing came rushing in onto earth

Speaker 5:          12:38          is roughly this.

Speaker 7:          12:40          Oh, we hit the earth with an explosion that's 100 million mega ton. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:48          And [inaudible]. Okay,

Speaker 7:          12:58          Sara Lips Date Sarah, our guitars Kinda swung her guitar around, had a metal moment. Don't look at her wrong or she'll do that.

Speaker 5:          13:05          Okay. So here's essentially how Doug broke that down for us. Two tons of tea and tea. We're talking tons of, you're not mega tons. Two tons of T. And. T. We'll essentially do this.

Speaker 2:          13:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:21          On one of the three screens, you see a 10 story building imploding, two tons of t and t will take down a building. Now 15,000 tons of TNT. That is what the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 on a second screen, we see archival footage of the atomic bomb. That chaos has 15,000 tons of TNT. Now these days, according to Doug Robertson, a hydrogen bomb current hydrogen bombs are typically of the order of 1 million tons of TNT equivalent. Now 1 million tons of TNT equivalent. That's what we call a mega ton. If you remember, Doug said that the asteroid impact was the equivalent of 100 million mega tons, so really what he's saying in concrete terms is that that impact was the equivalent of 100 million of those bombs going off all at once in the same spot, which is a lot.

Speaker 5:          14:19          That is true. That is true. However, it means it's, it really depends on what you mean by a lot because I was doing a little googling and I was surprised to learn that 110 million mega tons is not nearly enough to destroy the planet, to destroy the entire planet. You would need, you ready for this? 110 quadrillion mega tons of GT, which is 100 million times 110 million mega tens of t. And. T. So going back to your head resource situation, mother of three in New Zealand, if the thing came in Auntie portal to her, maybe she would feel the shake a little bit, but after a minute she'd be like whatever. And she'd go back to eating leaves. You probably wouldn't notice it.

Speaker 4:          14:57          Well, no, no, no. Cause that's not what we were taught in homeroom by Mrs McGrew or whoever your teacher was. Here's the classic explanation. There was an impact of course, and it kicked up an enormous amount of dust. You'll remember this. The Dustin kind of covers the planet. It blankets the earth, makes the earth very cold, makes the earth very nasty. All the big plants die. The little plants get sick, the dinosaurs get hungry, the dinosaurs get sick. And then gradually, you know, they get dead deader and deader and deader from different things. 10,000 years, 30,000 years, four to till you get like, oh, like 900,000 years later you've got a shivering. Last dinosaurs sitting there in the cold cold, and that's the end. That's the story we were told in school

Speaker 5:          15:41          is a long, slow wintery collapse. Yeah, no, no. Why we tell these good people that tired old story from Mrs. What does it Miss? Some recruiters make. I made her Magruder tonight. Okay. Yeah. Let us offer up a completely different Tabish night, right? Scottish. All right, we'll go with that. Let's actually flip the understanding completely. I think we should based on new science, so all right, here's what we're going to do. Keith, pull up that a ballistics video that we showed earlier with the red sand. Can you sort of pull that up and blow it up to the three screens and then, yeah, rewind it back. If you just thank, you wouldn't go back just a bit.

Speaker 5:          16:18          Okay, so this is a 6,000 frame. A second video that you're seeing here is from Pete's lab. At this point on the screen, all you're seeing is a pit of red sand. Now, what you see in the first few frames is you see the laser hitting right there, red sand flying in the air, super slow Mo. And the next frame forward, right there, you see some fire, you see a little bulb of fire erupt near the impact site, right where the laser hits the sand. There's this little clump of flame and we freeze on that spot. Now scientists can now measure the temperatures in that spot right there. Oh yeah. Right there. Okay. And just to state the obvious, we know from those measurements that that spot right there would have gotten very, very, very, very, very hot. No, we beyond the temperature of the sun, I mean we're talking temperatures, maybe 20,000 degrees, will sun's temperatures about 5,000 degrees. And if we're talking temperatures four times hotter than the sun, well anything that's that hot is going to instantly, instantly turn to gas.

Speaker 5:          17:30          A very, very high temperature, high pressure gas. It's actually rock vapor rock esteem. So imagine this thing comes barreling in his asteroid. It doesn't just bounce off the earth. It plows into the earth. It goes into the surface. Two miles in, five miles in, seven miles in, 10 miles in 20 miles into the earth. It goes all the rock that's it's plowing into is turning into a liquid and then into a gas and now watch what happens next. This is a basic physic experiment we're going to show you on the screen. You see it's very lovely video. Actually have a hand dropping a metal ball into some sand. This is just a dude dropping a ball and some sand. Watch this right here. Paul goes in and like a millisecond after it makes impact, disappears into the sand. A little spear of sand go shooting back in the opposite direction. Sort of a bounceback effect. Does this always happen? This whatever this is, it's like Newton's law of something. Yeah. Newtons love sand hook say, yeah, but what you see is you see this fine plume of Samuel shooting back in the opposite direction as a sort of rebound right now. Imagine that that ball is an asteroid and that sand over there, that's the planet earth to Keith. Play that one more time. You play the video again, but this time as the ball drops, it gradually morphs into an astroid. [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          18:55          Yes, thank you for the south where you would get the same effect you would get the

Speaker 2:          19:07          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          19:07          The simple point is just something we do. You wonder how where we get all of our sound design is out of that man's mouth. That's where you would get that same bounce back effective of fine blue shooting back in the opposite direction, but we know from what we just heard, Doug described that it would not be, would not be sand. In this case it would be rocking gas. Yes,

Speaker 9:          19:29          we'll move hot gas expands upward and pushes right on through the atmosphere up into space. Some fraction get the moon [inaudible] some fraction of that hit Mars.

Speaker 5:          19:39          Okay, so now you've got this sneeze of rock vapor. It's out in space. Basic physics says that as it travels out farther away from the earth, what's going to happen is it's going to start to cool down a bit and when it cools, Yep.

Speaker 9:          19:51          Recondense is into little droplets that a basically formed glass very quickly, little droplets of glass about the size of sand.

Speaker 5:          19:59          Now if you look at one of these little droplets of glass under a microscope, this is what it looks like right there on the screen. You see what looks kind of like a translucent snowball. That is actually an a magnified image of one of these bits of glass. It fell from space that day. Most of them didn't land on the ground. Talk about that in a second. There it is. I don't know about you but I find that totally terrifying cause that's, it looks like a little Baptist Dino, right? Tiny last joy. It's up. Now imagine trillions of these things in a cloud and a cloud of shrapnel going out out, away from the earth and what's going to happen next is that it's going to start to lose momentum. That cloud, when it does the earth's gravity is going to grab back, hold it and say come on back. And 90% of them come back to the earth.

Speaker 2:          20:47          Well

Speaker 4:          20:48          does falling glass do harm? Yes. Because what happens is that the, the glass out in space starts to spread out like north and south and east and west and eventually it will appear in the sky over

Speaker 5:          21:01          New Zealand. It's now a global phenomenon and you know, it's really hard to imagine what the Hadrosaur would've seen. But the thing to keep in mind is that these things, as they're coming in, these bits of glass, a 90 some odd percent are burning up in the atmosphere. So very few of them are hitting the ground. So from her point of view, probably would have looked like the greatest media shower any one has ever seen with one significant bummer, which is this, when these little bits of glass come in, each one that burns up is the positing a little bit of heat into the sky. And collectively there's such a massive rain of these things coming in.

Speaker 4:          21:42          Well, the heat would build up, the sky would turn red, that would be getting hotter and hotter.

Speaker 2:          21:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          21:54          and at a certain point, Jay wondered, well, how hard exactly would it have gotten the how much heat exactly would have built up there in the sky and then started to radiate down.

Speaker 4:          22:07          Um, we, uh, calculated the amount of heat that would come down, uh, number 10 kilowatts per square meter and yeah. Okay, well we get this number. Well, what, what does that mean? Well, I went home and I, um, hooked up a, uh, uh, current meter and pride to measure the amount of heat produced in my oven for different amounts of power. And I could get about seven kilowatts per square meter in my oven on broil.

Speaker 5:          22:35          Oh, like 500 degrees broil you mean? But that wasn't quite enough. Not nearly. So Jay started measuring other kinds of ovens

Speaker 4:          22:44          and then I finally found out that the heat would be in fact, like being in a pizza oven,

Speaker 5:          22:50          a pizza oven is about right. Which means that if you were addressed real dinosaur anywhere above the ground on the earth on that day, you would have experienced some heat. It is almost unimaginable. Maybe it started at a hundred degrees because it was June, it was summer, but within minutes it would have been 300 degrees, 500 degrees, 700 degrees, 900 degrees. Estimates are on that day. Temperatures topped out at something like 1200 degrees at that temperature. Nothing can protect you, your scales, your for whatever you got, it's not going to do any good. Your blood will literally start to boil inside your body and you will die. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          23:58          [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          24:15          so essentially according to this theory, the dinosaurs and everything else on earth that day would have been incinerated. Doug thinks that's what the domain, not so much the impact, but all that objective, it went up into the sky, came down as glass rain and created that heat. That's what did the men, he would argue it didn't just do some of the men or even many of them in. He would say it did all of them in all at once. There is zero evidence that any dinosaur made it through. And the crazy part of this theory is that Jay and Doug thinks that the whole process from the impact of the glass rain to the incineration of all of these species on the planet, it would have taken a few hours. His best guess, he thinks maybe two hours. I mean, that's less time than a a business lunch.

Speaker 4:          25:11          Yeah. You try getting east northwest anywhere on Mercer Street at rush hour in too,

Speaker 5:          25:17          and do that. I mean, if you think about it, that is less time than you will spend in this theater tonight.

Speaker 10:         25:41          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          25:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         25:58          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:58          that means that you're saying that

Speaker 10:         26:01          an animal that had been supreme

Speaker 4:          26:04          on the planet for 200 million

Speaker 10:         26:08          disappears in a few hours. Completely. Yes. Yup. That's

Speaker 4:          26:14          what the evidence suggests. That's right.

Speaker 10:         26:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          26:24          well, you can consider the evidence, but also you could consider common sense. I mean, we've got a world filled with terrestrial dinosaurs. They were on every continent. They were even in Antarctica. And to say that they all disappeared in two hours. I mean all that would, that suggests that there's

Speaker 5:          26:44          none of them out of harm's way. None of them, many caves somewhere. None of them in the grotto, none of them in a, in a protected forest of any kind. The word all in that connection, it's just too much a, I just don't buy it. But yeah, I mean the truth is that the science is never going to be so exact as to say. Yeah, all of them disappeared or it happened on a single day or on an afternoon. I mean now no tool that we have is that precise, but what Jay is saying is that it happened fast, very fast. Nothing made it through. What I find interesting is that ultimately you don't need the ballistics or anything. We've shown you so far to know that something major and sudden happened because you can see evidence of it literally etched into the earth. Here's the thought where we first found within the boundary, you can see it really well out in Colorado actually. We sent one of our producers, Molly Webster out there to meet a paleontologist named Kirk Johnson. They hiked over a couple of hills. They found this one specific spot, Mike ready for a dinosaur to come around the corner and the minute they started to dig,

Speaker 2:          28:00          taking down like a foot from where we were.

Speaker 5:          28:05          Turns out for every three feet you get down 10,000 years in time. See, the earth has layers, kind of like a tree has rings and every three feet down you go. You're going back in time about 10,000 years and when you go all the way down, all the way back to 66.0 9 million years, you will find this one little skinny strip of rock.

Speaker 2:          28:27          Okay?

Speaker 5:          28:34          That's the kiddie boundary that this one skinny gray line, this, this gray, crappy, this. No, in a very real way, that line that you're seeing that represents the day the asteroid hit the day just above that line. That's a little bit after the day. Just below that line was a little bit before today. The line is called the KT boundary. And what's cool is you can actually touch it. You can touch evidence of that moment. And in fact, Kirk, what he did that day was he took his finger and he dug a piece out and he handed it to Molly.

Speaker 11:         29:07          We're hold, I'm holding. You're holding the shake. It's like a, it's almost like chunks of coal. Yeah, but it's not what you're holding.

Speaker 5:          29:18          Dark Gray mudstone the carbon rich bud stone. And in that mudstone you'll find all kinds of things. I mean, you'll find very rare minerals like iridium that probably came in on the astroid and got smooshed into that line. Those little glass balls I was talking about this a little hell balls. Well, if you get out a microscope and you look at that rock, you will see them in there. We put a funny

Speaker 7:          29:42          cartoon of the little hell balls. They're all in that line. How thick do you think that line is? Which is about an inch is like hidden in there. It's sort of a story of that day. Absolutely. And here's the crazy thing. If this is the line right here, this little strip here, Robert traces a picture of the KT boundary with his finger and then you dig just below the line you were going to find over and over again, dinosaurs everywhere. I mean not going to be alive. Of course he says putting some toy dinosaurs under the line and making them move by giving them a certain amount of energy, which I shouldn't, but they are fossils and you will find dinosaur fossils from Europe and Idaho and Montana. This one says it was made in China, but if you just go above the line, you don't find any done so, so below the line, scientists have looked everywhere above the line and they haven't. Well, everywhere they have looked anyway, they found nothing, nothing, nothing. It's a different world. That's the amazing thing is a different world and it's pretty rude, young. This is one world. Nothing. You're literally just pointing Pinky to point. Your fingers spread. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          30:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          30:57          this is another moment where I would urge you at some point, not now keep listening, but at some point watch the video of this performance. Cause what Sarah, Darren, Glen and Keith do in this moment digitally. It's pretty amazing.

Speaker 2:          31:09          A [inaudible] [inaudible] eh, a [inaudible]. Okay. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         34:25          before we go to break, I just want to give a very special thanks to the people who shared the stage with us. Sarah lip state from no velour. Darren grey on the base in Glen Coachee and the drums. They're both from the band on Fillmore. We were so lucky to share the stage with those guys along with, um, uh, video maestro key scratch who was doing the live video. [inaudible] brilliant puppet here, Myron Guso. Oh my God. That guy. So good. Check out all of them.

Speaker 3:          34:51          Radio lab.org/live. You can see them doing what they do. Uh, visually it's pretty, it's pretty worth watching. Anyhow, we'll be back in a second.
