00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.040
&gt;&gt;Reto: Good afternoon and welcome again to
the Friday review of apps.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.240
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.480
And joining me in the studio I have with me
Trevor Jones.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.480
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Hi there everyone.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.669
&gt;&gt;Reto: And via the miracle of modern technology
joining us from his new abode in New York

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.980
City, we have Romain Yurik.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.599
&gt;&gt;Romain: Hello everyone.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hey Romain.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.449
Thank you for joining us in your flickery
self.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.550
So we're going to take a look at a few apps
today.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.670
And while Ian tries to figure out what the
flickering is about.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.010
We may start off by having a look at Samo
Color.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.800
So we're also going to look at GPS.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.690
Test a couple of notes apps.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930
And some exercise apps as well . Run Double.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.550
So we've got quite an interesting and eclectic
collection for you today.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.930
So shall we get started.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.309
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Sure, Let's, go ahead.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.300
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's have a look at Samo Color.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.719
So we're going to fire this up on the phone
over here.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.730
So, I'll wait 'til Ian gets a chance.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.730
Excellent.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.160
Oops, I had that space.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160
Alright.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160
Perfect.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.160
So here we go.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.460
So Samo Color by Code Carpet.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.009
Tap three times to buy.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.330
I wonder what my alternatives are.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.870
So I can see an arrow here so I'm gonna slide
across.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.250
And I can see a number of different options
here.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.430
Not entirely sure what they are.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.430
OK.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.430
So they're locked.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.430
Alright.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.430
So we'll go here and click.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.430
Oh, OK.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.430
Interesting.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.700
So this is, in case it wasn't obvious, this
is an app which is targeted towards children.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.479
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Hence the tap three times to buy.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.479
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] Indeed.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.479
Mostly children who can't read.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Actually, it's not a bad idea.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.950
'Cause a lot of times people, you know we
hear from people who write apps or directed

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.280
towards apps who are targeted towards children
is that there's these "buy" buttons and children

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.200
just go and hit on them accidentally.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.450
So I like that you have, like, kids are just
going to go and mash on the screen.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.880
So anything to go and prevent them from accidentally
buying is probably a good thing.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Probably a good thing.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.880
Absolutely.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.369
Although I wonder, I wonder if you wanna go
a step further and actually hide that behind

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.539
a menu option or something like that.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.539
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.860
It's probably a good idea to actually go all
the way to turn on the pin lock and mark it.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.860
But.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.860
That's a very good point.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.410
But still it's a good point you make.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.660
So the idea here is that you can color in
the little guy on screen.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.430
Using the colors at our disposal.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310
Let's see, give him green ears.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.310
Blue.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.510
&gt;&gt;Trevor: There are actually more colors.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: There are more colors?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080
Oh, look at that.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080
I can swipe to get more colors.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Took me a moment to figure that
out.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Interesting.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I mean it is a little widget down
there to go and show you more pages.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.150
&gt;&gt;Trevor: But amongst all the noise of all
the colors, it's actually really easy to miss.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: It didn't occur to me that the pager
was resp-- was talking about the colors themselves.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.030
That's interesting.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.490
So, OK, so what I would say is, in a particular
for something just color in here.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.600
&gt;&gt;Trevor: There's also a menu too, by the
way.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: I saw it does have a menu.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720
&gt;&gt;Trevor: No, not that menu.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.000
&gt;&gt;Trevor: See the little black thing with
eyes.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ooooh.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280
It's a menu.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280
That's interesting.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
So two points here.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.470
First is, let me just, scroll up slightly.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.801
Menu button of shame.

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.150
Because it's there but doesn't do anything.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.221
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Especially, especially because there
isn't anything, there's really no reason to

00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:05.221
have that.

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.221
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.790
So that's the big hate we have for the menu
button being there, is if it actually doesn't

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.790
do anything.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.900
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Even if it still does something,
you shouldn't have it anymore.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900
That's true.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.470
&gt;&gt;Trevor: There is no excuse for having a
menu button at this point.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.730
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, I think we've got, I think we've
moved on far enough now.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.730
With Jellybean coming out.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.350
&gt;&gt;Trevor: With Jellybean now, yes, now our
second release where the menu button.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.350
Well, if you can't.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.350
There you go.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.610
Third release where the menu button is just
deprecated.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.940
So yeah, at this point we really shouldn't
be seeing that anymore.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.380
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, so that would be step one
is remove that menu button.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.940
Now, having the little eyes, that's interesting.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.700
So, now, I see, you actually drag it.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.960
&gt;&gt;Trevor: You can click as well.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Click-tug doesn't seem to be working
100 percent of the time.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.210
So that's a bit fade back.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.210
But.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.210
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yes.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: It also works.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.210
The dragging is quite nice.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.210
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.210
The other thing that confused me to.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.210
Now, that back button, what would, would you
think that's "back"?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah, that's a good question.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.960
It's just above the other back button.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.020
I would probably think undo.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.020
&gt;&gt;Trevor: It is undo.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.020
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.020
&gt;&gt;Trevor: But it took me a while.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.120
I was like, what's gonna happen if I push
this button?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, definitely.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.040
Anything which looks like a back button I
think you're kind of taking your usability

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.530
into your own hands here.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.050
'Cause you suddenly go, oooh, is this gonna
exit?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.620
Now clearly kids aren't gonna think that.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.990
They're probably also not gonna think "undo."

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.700
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Well, they might think the regular
back button thing is "undo".

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.700
That's a good point.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.650
Particularly once you've made it ambiguous
here that maybe "back" means "undo".

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.030
You probably wanna simplify that.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.350
So I don't think this is discoverable at all.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.780
It would never have occurred to me to press
the googly eyes.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.070
Now, in fairness a six year old probably would
think to hit pretty much everything on the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.070
screen.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.070
So that would help.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.070
But, there's an awful lot--

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.100
&gt;&gt;Trevor: let me ask if there's multi level
undo.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.320
But it's a children's app, so we'll give them
a pass on that.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320
Exactly.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320
That would be nice.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.721
And particularly like, so once you hit undo
having that stay onscreen so that you can

00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:47.850
do multilevel undo would be nice.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.260
But maybe, maybe have these as, as an action
bar along the top might be interesting.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.900
I guess you wanna keep the screen clutter
down.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.100
You don't want to have people accidentally
pressing buttons.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.590
So having it hidden in a way is useful, but.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.190
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Again, there is the argument that
kids are going to mash everything on the screen.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.160
So I can sort of see the argument for hiding
it.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.260
But I think the discoverability could really
be improved.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260
What do you think Romain?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.000
Do you have a, from a usability perspective,
an idea here of how you can maybe make this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.070
more or less obvious?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.760
&gt;&gt;Romain: Yeah, I mean, I think the first
thing is that, asking kids to discover slidy

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.530
things, like sliding drawers, that's, I think
that's asking a little too much.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.080
You know in general we recommend using gestures
to uncover things.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.710
Sliding drawers, I personally am kind of against.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.810
But you know, using gestures is normally ok.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.720
Like paging between screens and things like
that.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.840
But for kids, you know kids kind of, they
understand you know, simple gestures.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840
Like sliding.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.810
But it has to be really really really obvious.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.140
And I don't think it's obvious in this case.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.900
What I'd probably do instead is really just
put it on screen.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.630
And for thinks like "back".

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.840
For things like navigating to other pieces
of art, it's actually like right now, once

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.420
you're in a drawing, there's no real way to
get to other drawings.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.450
So for that you may wanna use gestures.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.910
Like maybe slide left to kind of go back to
the top level screen.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.090
But you know, sliding up a thing to reveal
actions or even at the very bottom something

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.290
as simple as using a view pager to slide between
different colors.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.300
Even that may be a little too unobvious.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.170
So in that case maybe just have left and right
buttons.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.170
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Right.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.170
&gt;&gt;Romain: [inaudible]

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.350
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Well there's already two people
that didn't notice you could slide the colors.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.350
So.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.100
[laughs] 'Cause that's, actually that gesture
you described is what I assumed the pager

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.100
was for.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.380
If I started swiping left or right it would
take me to a different pictures.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.050
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's why the visual cue wasn't obvious
to me that it was [inaudible]

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.139
&gt;&gt;Romain: I think, just, like in generally
when dealing with kids apps you wanna put

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:58.200
more stuff in a fun, like friendly, like picture
form onscreen.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.120
Rather than rely on gestures too much.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.810
So I think in this case kids may get confused.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.040
Like "Oh, how do I get back to whatever."

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200
And obviously grownups will know that oh,
you press the back button.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.630
It's the android back button.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.970
But kids aren't as, they're not as used to
using the smart phones.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:12.970
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Hm.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.520
&gt;&gt;Romain: So don't assume that's standard,
kind of android patterns apply.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, I think that's particularly
through because while it's good that they

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.400
put this consistent approach to using the
pager.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.010
And you know I'm quite a fan of having this
indicator to show you what page you're on.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.370
They use it to me, sort of different things
on different pages.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.780
Oops, managed to exit.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.860
Oh if you, that's another tip.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.360
If I exit from a particular drawing.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.210
So if I exit from here when hitting back,
when I reload the app I should go back to

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.639
that, to the same place I was.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.740
'cause the chances of someone, particularly
a kid, hitting back and being like "Oh, I've

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.740
lost everything."

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.740
Is high.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.110
But yeah, so they've used it up here to page
between pictures and once you go in they use

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.139
it to page between colors.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.990
Which I think is somewhat confusing.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.710
Particularly 'cause this isn't, is it a proper
pager?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.710
I guess it is.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.610
It's showing a set of different colors each
time.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.610
But yeah.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.090
Having that same visual metaphor meaning two
different things can be a little bit confusing.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.810
&gt;&gt;Romain: Yeah, what you may wanna do is,
when having lots of colors.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.030
In this case there's lots and lots of colors.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.030
There's a lot to choose from.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.370
You may wanna just have like, when you touch
the color it expands up to this larger palette

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.510
to choose from.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:33.931
Or something even like, have them smaller
so that you, a kid can just drag their finger

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:36.630
around like this massive color palette.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.229
The bottom shows them a preview of what color
their finger is on.

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:42.450
Almost like a magnifying glass.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.240
That may make a little more sense than kind
of swiping left and right.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.240
I think so too.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.900
Otherwise it's a, I really like the simplicity
of the app so it's, there's no ambiguity as

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.900
to what you need to do.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900
How it's gonna work.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.170
You get the immediate benefit.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.940
You hit the screen and things start to happen
which is really night.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.420
Pictures are nice.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.420
Cute too.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.200
Otherwise, yeah, I think its' quite a nice
app otherwise.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.120
&gt;&gt;Romain: There's one more thing I wanted
to add.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: Please.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.230
&gt;&gt;Romain: there's this one part of the app.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.890
I think it might be the page where the teacher
is standing and looking at a chalkboard.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.640
There's a bunch of different shapes there.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.210
So it's basically free form, you just draw
free form.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.540
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Oh really?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.400
&gt;&gt;Romain: And in that case what I would

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ahhh.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880
Nice.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.680
&gt;&gt;Romain: So, you should probably support
multitouch there.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.240
Kids love like placing all their fingers all
at once on the screen and dragging them.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.230
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Actually, I'd take that a step further
and try and detect pressure.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.230
&gt;&gt;Romain: Yes.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.860
So there's actually an open source app called
Markers that was recently released by Daniel

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.800
Sandler who's on the Android team.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.090
And that shows how to do all sorts of crazy
pressure sensitivity, and as well as multitouch.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.350
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And this is on normal screens.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.370
Just a normal capacitor screen.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.140
You can actually still get some pressure data.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.140
So.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140
&gt;&gt;Romain: Yeah.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.180
&gt;&gt;Trevor: It's not the same as your wacom
tablet where you have you know, 500 levels

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.860
of pressure sensitivity.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.820
But it's good enough to get you an nice UI.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, that's--

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.210
&gt;&gt;Romain: Also you may wanna consider having
a single, just like massive, just like take

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.890
over the entire screen.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.580
And just give like kids a playground to just
draw on.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.580
Just free form drawing.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.350
&gt;&gt;Romain: Completely not like a rectangle
or a circle or shape or anything it just gives

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.910
them a giant canvas to draw on.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah absolutely.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:26.910
I think it more obvious too.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:32.140
Because it would never occur to me that if
I hit one of the three objects on the right

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.370
here that that would mean that I get free
form drawing.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.750
Whereas that would seem like one of the, something
which you would particularly want to be able

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.140
to do.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.670
&gt;&gt;Romain: It's locked.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: oh it's locked.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.670
Yeah, of course.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.670
Why isn't it working?

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.670
Which is another tip as well.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.650
So obviously you've got the icon on the bottom
which says "locked" which to most adults should

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.650
be pretty obvious.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.860
But I missed it.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.810
Which is probably more of a reflection on
me than on your app.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.810
But that being said.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.130
&gt;&gt;Trevor: it should probably be, really you
should just cover the entire screen.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.130
So you can't do anything there.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.130
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hm.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.130
Yeah exactly.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.130
I mean you've already got sort of the partial
opacity.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.350
You could make that so you can see through
it a little bit more but cover the entire

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.350
screen.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.140
Or when I press it, display a toast or something
saying "This is locked."

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.300
You know.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.120
Purchase from the home screen.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
Something like that.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.089
'cause again, it's not obvious.

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:20.610
I know that when you first start up the app
you see the instruction to have a purchase.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.640
&gt;&gt;Trevor: yeah, I like that idea.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.920
Like if you tap the lock thing it should fade
out and say "Purchase from home screen" and

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.399
the lock should come back.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.567
You know, add some animation, make it, make
it feel alive.

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:29.567
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:31.580
Some, some way to, yeah, absolutely.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.580
Absolutely.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.480
Which is-- [laughs] and you'll notice that
I find the navigation slightly tricky.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.550
But otherwise, yeah.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.180
Otherwise its' definitely a good idea and
it's nicely implemented.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.080
Just to go along further from what Trevor
was saying.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.300
It might be nice to have a little bit more
animation.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.280
A bit more dynanimacism within the app.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.280
Might, have.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.331
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Maybe have some subtle things.

00:11:52.331 --> 00:11:55.160
Like maybe this guy here could be maybe tapping
his foot, or.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.160
&gt;&gt;Trevor: You know.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.350
Something again, make it feel like you're
just not staring at a static image.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.899
Yeah, I think some really subtle animations
could make a really big difference.

00:12:05.899 --> 00:12:08.360
Because you know, it will attract your attention.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.959
It'll make your eye focus on different parts
of it.

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:12.470
so it would be quite interesting.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.589
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Or you know, since this is an app
designed for kids you could have you know,

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:16.589
little Easter eggs.

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:21.220
You know like I think going over here, like
the background, if this wasn't locked, if

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.480
I tapped on this guy maybe he'd start moving
or a sound should play, right?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.000
Something that would make people, make kids
wanna go and explore a bit.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Absolutely.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Absolutely.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.720
And it' s kind of nice that all the discovery
things, like the free form drawing is all

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.100
totally, you know you play with the app and
you discover these things.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.100
Which is kind of nice.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.842
But it would also be perhaps useful in terms
of getting people to use the app in the first

00:12:46.842 --> 00:12:49.910
place to give some more indication of what
some of those Easter eggs are.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.770
Some of those things that you can do.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.550
Like maybe a tutorial or something at the
beginning which just has you, you know, forces

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.450
you through basically the three different
modes.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.100
Here you press the color to draw.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.209
Here you get free form.

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:07.380
And now we give you these worksheets where
you can do what you want to do.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.380
Any other comments?

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.380
Trevor?

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.380
Romain?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.380
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I think the [inaudible]

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.450
&gt;&gt;Romain: I just wanted to say two quick things.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.570
I know we're running behind on some of this.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.700
But two quick things about the market, or
I'm sorry, the Google play listing.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.700
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Ah.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.600
So I should pull it up here and see what we
can do.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.860
&gt;&gt;Romain: This is very quick feedback.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.860
But.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: OK.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.860
Search for it first.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.630
&gt;&gt;Trevor: You could always scan the barcode
on our screen in here.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: I probably could.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.350
But My Apps is probably faster.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.350
Ah.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.170
Where are we here.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.870
There we are.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.870
OK.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.130
&gt;&gt;Romain: You there?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yep.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.600
&gt;&gt;Romain: So a couple, so two very quick things.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.300
In the feature graphic you have the name of
the app Samo Colors.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.130
The font size is really really small at the
top.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:02.089
And so one thing to note is that on, in the
play store, on devices, actually on phones,

00:14:02.089 --> 00:14:05.950
you're gonna see the feature graphic compressed
to a really small size.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.270
So you're not gonna be able to read that text.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.350
So if you can find some way to bungle the
font size so that it's a little more obvious,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.490
what the name of the app is, that would be
much better.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.990
'cause there are cases where the feature graphic
is used not adjacent to the name of the app.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.680
The second thing was around screen shots.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.339
Your screenshots are actually using the device
frame generator.

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:31.860
I would probably avoid using device frames
in your screen shots themselves.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.860
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.180
Basically too small.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.820
&gt;&gt;Romain: Yeah, because when you open it up
on a phone you've got a frame within your

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.820
phone, you just [inaudible]

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.420
&gt;&gt;Trevor: which might not be the same thing
as the phone you're using.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: We must go deeper.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.440
Yeah, its' a good point.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.800
'cause it looks great when I bring them up
full screen.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.150
Like this actually looks pretty cool although
it is kind of inception-y but when you're

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.960
just looking at them in the carousel, it looks
kind of weird.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.230
Cause you've just got like a bunch of phones
side by side.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.230
Yeah.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.320
I agree with that.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.850
&gt;&gt;Trevor: yeah, those frames are more for
use on web pages.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.850
Things like that.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:04.850
Marketing material.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.120
Not so, I mean, your play listing is marketing
material in a sense.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.120
&gt;&gt;Romain: Absolutely.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.170
&gt;&gt;Trevor: but not good to use them there.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.170
&gt;&gt;Romain: No.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's good to see as well it's been
translated into German, Japanese, Korean,

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.070
and Spanish.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.010
And given that there's not actually a lot
of text, that seems like a really good way

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.649
of being able to create a better experience
for your users.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:26.269
Make it more discoverable in Google play at
a relatively small cost.

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:30.760
And it's very well received looking at its
average reviews in market.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.300
So well done.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.579
Hopefully a few of those tips which we've
given you all will help to make your app even

00:15:37.579 --> 00:15:38.579
better.

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:39.579
OK.

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:40.579
[banging noise]

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:43.079
&gt;&gt;Trevor: oooh, that was not good.

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:45.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: [inaudible] Get it all did it?

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:46.079
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Maybe it's alive.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: hard to say.

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.079
&gt;&gt;Ian: Everything's alive.

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.079
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Right.

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:50.079
&gt;&gt;Reto: We're gonna assume we're alive.

00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.079
Our confidence monitor has disappeared.

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:56.550
And Romain has dropped off the Hangout 'cause
that computer has taken a tumble.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.260
But are we otherwise online Ian?

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.260
From what you can see?

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Uh, you should be.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.260
You should be.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Excellent.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.260
Excellent.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.260
&gt;&gt;Trevor: if you switch on the [h-tran] box
there.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.269
I think we lost that signal.

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.730
Above the Mac.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: Aaaah.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.730
Yes.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.730
OK.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.730
&gt;&gt;Trevor: OK.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.959
We'll let Ian sort all that out.

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:12.959
&gt;&gt;Reto: We will continue.

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:14.290
&gt;&gt;Ian: What do you guys wanna do next?

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:19.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] We're gonna have a look at
GPS Test Plus I think.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.660
[pause] OK.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.019
So this is a GPS testing app.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:29.850
So this is interesting and I'm gonna presume
that it's using some of the more advanced

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.750
geo, well, I guess GPS functions, a little
location based functions.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.870
Which can actually get you a lot of information
about the way in which the location based

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.820
services are using satellite information to
be able to figure out where your location

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.820
is.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.860
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Actually we're probably not going
to be able to see it in here with the ceiling

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.860
over our heads.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah that's true.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.370
But still, I mean, there's a window.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.370
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Aaaaaaah.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.370
It's asking a lot.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Alright.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.370
Well, that's true.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.370
Ok, so we've got zero in view, zero in use
right now.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.370
So your accuracy is not useful.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.370
&gt;&gt;Trevor: That's OK.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.370
You can still see most of the app without
it.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.370
I mean, the app itself we can look at.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.110
So it's kind of an interesting display here.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:08.939
It kind of reminds me of sort of an old school
sort of eight bit game type, you know, type,

00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:09.939
look and feel.

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:13.350
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah, I'll be honest, I'm not a
big fan of it though.

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:14.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah?

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.549
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Mostly, it feels out of place in
Android.

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:19.260
It's not holo.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.980
If you flip through here, like you have this

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: haha.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.069
&gt;&gt;Trevor: You know sort of fake LCD display.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.660
But it doesn't really look like an LCD.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.989
It looks like a computer generated.

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:35.640
I'd expect to see if you're gonna go for something
that's mimicking a real display add some,

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.710
add some gloss onto it.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.710
Make it actually look real.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.710
Go--

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: If you're gonna go, go all the way.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.970
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.419
Use the digital look, go for the real look.

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:47.610
But in between in just looks sort of, MS Paintish,
to be honest.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.369
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, that's absolutely true.

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:55.460
I, in fact, one of the first jobs I ever had
out of college was building software for an

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.369
industrial inspection company and because
all of the equipment that they usually use

00:18:00.369 --> 00:18:03.820
is all sort of old school with the LCD displays
and everything.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.389
And so I made the software to try and look
as much like that as possible.

00:18:07.389 --> 00:18:12.570
And you'd find yourself getting into this
arms race where you want it to look just like

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.570
the real equipment.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.549
And you do it first and it'll look like this,
everything's flat.

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:16.980
And you're like, oh, that's not quite right.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.049
Because their stuff glows.

00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:19.230
So how do I make this glow.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:24.409
And then you start adding gradients to your
images and it just, it goes to a very bad

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:25.409
place.

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:26.570
&gt;&gt;Trevor: [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Reto: And you end up spending a lot of time

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:31.820
trying to do these little things with canvases
and everything else to try and mimic something

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.440
which is done that way because it's cheaper
to do in hardware, not because it looks better.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
&gt;&gt;Trevor: yeah.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.210
And honestly the inverted way of doing things,
you know, we tend to not really try and mimic

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.270
real displays very often.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.909
Real objects.

00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:46.080
And that's just sort of, that's the style
we've chosen.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.080
So.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.270
&gt;&gt;Trevor: An app like this just feels out
of place on the system.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:50.270
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.870
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I mean, ignoring the fact that we
have no action bar, I don't know why there's

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.620
no action bar.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.080
We also have the menu button of shame.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.200
But at least it has a menu.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's not as shameful.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200
But.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.980
&gt;&gt;Trevor: There's no reason that can't be
converted into an action bar.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.389
But I think the app would look a lot nicer
with a splotch of holo on there.

00:19:06.389 --> 00:19:07.659
&gt;&gt;Reto: I tend to agree.

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:10.559
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I think what the app developer is
trying to do, is if you go into settings you

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.049
can change the theme.

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:13.350
So I think they were trying to make it theme-able.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.759
And you can choose like a night time view
or an amber view or a red view.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:18.759
&gt;&gt;Reto: I gotcha.

00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:19.759
I gotcha.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.759
[inaudible]

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.700
&gt;&gt;Trevor: But you know, maybe that's not so
bad actually if you're out doors, stargazing,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.149
you want a GPS 'cause you're going hiking.

00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:27.690
Being able to set, alright, just through,
yeah.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.970
Being able to set a, like a night view like
that--

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:31.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.159
&gt;&gt;Trevor: is actually a pretty good idea.

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:34.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hm.

00:19:34.159 --> 00:19:37.049
&gt;&gt;Trevor: But you could do something like
that and still stay true to holo, I think.

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:38.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think so.

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:41.989
I mean, this is, again, this is you know,
I spent all my time in a previous life working

00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:42.989
on boats.

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:45.470
Where you had a lot of this equipment set
up.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.470
And you do.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.470
You have nighttime views.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.970
As soon as the sun goes down you have this
much more muted thing so people don't destroy

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:53.091
their night vision while looking at the controls.

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:56.850
And I kind of like the idea of making that
sort of thing on something like that.

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.929
But part of me would say, well what is the
purpose of your app?

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:03.539
And so if it is to sort of work as a backup
or as an alternative to some of these GPS

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:09.460
systems while you're navigating, that first
I would say, it's probably of questionable

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.460
utility.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.169
Because unless you're sitting on the roof
of your boat, then you're gonna have this

00:20:14.169 --> 00:20:17.150
problem where you don't have any satellites
in view.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.879
If it's just an aesthetic thing, you're just
really trying to mimic that style, because

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:24.779
that's what you're used to and you think that
your users will sort of appreciate that.

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:26.029
That's definitely a choice.

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:28.299
But I kind of agree with Trevor here, I think.

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:31.070
You can do that without making it look like
an old Atari game.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.359
So you've got the same sort of layout.

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.659
The same sort of graphics.

00:20:33.659 --> 00:20:38.080
Because the big graphics in these sorts of
features are definitely the right approach.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.479
But you just wanna spend a little bit more
time to think about how you can use that same

00:20:42.479 --> 00:20:44.799
layout to put on something which is much more
modern.

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:49.950
So mimicking a modern GPS rather than a GPS
which you would have seen in a computer game

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.990
in the '80s.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.799
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And this actually brings up another
point here just as far as the number of options

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.799
in here.

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:56.799
I mean there's a lot of color schemes.

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:59.190
Which, you know, not necessarily a bad thing.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.149
But just looking around the entire app, you
have a ton of settings.

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:05.149
Some of which are kind of redundant.

00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:09.809
You have an option to choose imperial metric
units for your speedometer.

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:13.659
Imperial metric units for altitude.

00:21:13.659 --> 00:21:15.940
You could condense all of those into just
one setting.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.929
Do I want imperial or metric units?

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:22.919
Cause I can't think of very many cases where
I'd want my speed in one system and my altitude

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:23.919
in another.

00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:24.919
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:30.970
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Uh, there's some other things too,
and you can choose between, I think if you

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.600
go to this menu here, you can actually change
all these to gauges.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.919
Which again has that same problem where it
looks sort of like an Atari game.

00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:37.919
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs]

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:38.919
&gt;&gt;Trevor: It's just like, so many options
here.

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.590
And here it is.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.289
And honestly, as a user, it's too much.

00:21:44.289 --> 00:21:45.559
Because I'd never find them all.

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:47.309
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it makes it non discoverable.

00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:51.019
It's like you almost, if you wanna be able
to choose between different gauges you may

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:52.019
wanna do that.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.019
On the screen.

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:55.239
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And then even going to the options
on the bottom.

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:56.750
You know, there's this mode.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.049
And this mode.

00:21:58.049 --> 00:22:02.039
And then when you're in let's see here, there's
another mode here if you go to navigation,

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.039
[app dings]

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:04.842
And then you have this mode and this mode.

00:22:04.842 --> 00:22:06.369
And then you have a hidden menu there.

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:07.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] interesting.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:13.529
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Which is, the navigation part is
very, it's a bit difficult to find especially

00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:15.539
without textual labels on those buttons.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:17.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, so this is really interesting.

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:20.549
So I mean, it looks like this app is, does
a lot of stuff.

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:23.279
Like it's basically every gauge or dial you
would want.

00:22:23.279 --> 00:22:24.279
Which has anything to do with location.

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.289
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah, it's a very useful app.

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:26.289
Yeah.

00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:27.289
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which I like.

00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:29.309
And having, and I really wanna make a big
point of this.

00:22:29.309 --> 00:22:34.970
Which is when we're discussing you know, changing
the UI to make it look less old school, I

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.509
really wanna emphasize that I don't think
that you should change the overall layout.

00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:40.340
Like I love that it's big buttoned.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.549
It's very graphical.

00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:44.850
You know, everything is based around being
able to see it from a distance.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:45.850
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.289
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think that's a really good approach.

00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:48.450
Yeah.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:52.570
Like I say when it comes to the mimicking
the LCD stuff, like having been there I can

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.669
tell you that it's really not worthwhile and
the feedback that you get from most actual

00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:59.460
users is "Yeah, that's really hard to read."

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.729
[laughs]
So it's' a lot of effort which may not entirely

00:23:02.729 --> 00:23:03.729
be worth it.

00:23:03.729 --> 00:23:05.269
So that may be something to keep in mind.

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:06.269
&gt;&gt;Romain: Hey.

00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:07.269
Quick question.

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:08.269
Do you guys hear me right now?

00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:09.269
&gt;&gt;Reto: We do.

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:10.269
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:11.269
&gt;&gt;Reto: Welcome back.

00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:12.269
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Welcome back, Romain.

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:13.269
&gt;&gt;Romain: OK.

00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:14.269
I thought I'd.

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:15.269
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I don't think you can see us 'cause
our camera isn't glowing.

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:16.269
But.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:17.269
&gt;&gt;Romain: Oh.

00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:18.269
&gt;&gt;Trevor: We can't see you.

00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:19.269
But we can hear you.

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:20.269
&gt;&gt;Romain: I have a few thoughts on this one.

00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:21.269
[inaudible]

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:22.269
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Please.

00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:23.269
Yeah.

00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:24.269
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.269
&gt;&gt;Romain: So one thing that immediately confused
me and I agree with that like the big dials

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:27.509
the big, I guess panels are awesome.

00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:31.590
One thing that confused me a little bit was
about the interactions.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.859
Basically you have these four panels at the
bottom.

00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:34.859
This is on the home screen.

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:36.229
You have these four panels at the bottom.

00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:37.229
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yep.

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:42.111
&gt;&gt;Romain: and touching them basically switches
out the main display at the very top.

00:23:42.111 --> 00:23:46.529
But it wasn't clear that those panels were
kind of like the top level hierarchy.

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:51.780
And then above those four panels, those four
buttons, was kind of the thing you're currently

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.780
viewing.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.259
So I would try to use some sort of better
visual indication that at the bottom is kind

00:23:57.259 --> 00:23:59.600
of like your primary control set.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.279
And then at the very top is something that
is a member of that control set.

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:06.970
It's not currently visible because you know,
touching, they're kind of like tabs but the

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.869
current tab is not visible.

00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:13.720
But somehow indicate that what you're viewing
at the top is one of the things that is you

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.169
know, in this other set of controls at the
bottom.

00:24:16.169 --> 00:24:21.850
And then when you touch on, just, the numbers,
the one that has headings.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.970
Speed and altitude.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.480
You bring up another set of controls, where
basically speed, altitude and heading are

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.659
kind of a secondary set of quote unquote tabs.

00:24:30.659 --> 00:24:32.749
And you could apply the same visual.

00:24:32.749 --> 00:24:40.129
Maybe some sort of like arrow indicating that
you know, the top screen is a child of the

00:24:40.129 --> 00:24:42.720
pre-- of the lower buttons.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720
Something like that.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.620
I don't know if I'm explaining this very well
but I think it's just, the hierarchy isn't

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.539
clear immediately from the current presentation.

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:50.539
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:51.539
No, I totally agree.

00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:52.679
It's sort of the idea of this being a toggle.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:53.729
But it's not really a toggle.

00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:56.950
Its' just swapping out whatever the currently
selected option is.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.279
It was not obvious to me either.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:02.440
And similarly as Trevor pointed out this,
there are basically two modes.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.349
You've got a navigation mode which allows
you to, it works a lot like My Tracks in a

00:25:07.349 --> 00:25:08.349
way.

00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:10.729
It'll let you keep track of way points and
where those locations are.

00:25:10.729 --> 00:25:12.470
Which is really really cool.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.149
But then, and then there's GPS test, which
is another version.

00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:18.859
And it's basically two apps within one app.

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:22.289
And it's not obvious like, when I'm sitting
here, I think, OK well I wanna go back to

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:27.640
the other mode, and so I hit back, and that
just exited the app.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.409
Um, the right way to do it is to go back into
GPS test from here.

00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:34.649
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I almost feel like GPS test might
not be the right name for this app.

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:36.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's so much more than that.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.799
&gt;&gt;Trevor: They're just trying to build, honestly,
a GPS.

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:39.799
&gt;&gt;Reto: yeah.

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:40.799
Absolutely.

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:41.799
I mean that's the thing.

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:45.450
I can almost imagine where this has come from
like you know you fired up the Android SDK.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.289
You see all this cool stuff you can do with
GPS.

00:25:47.289 --> 00:25:51.590
And so you're gonna test all the GPS APIs
and then you create this app from it.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.210
But I almost feel like it's time to move beyond
that in terms of the app name and try and

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.600
be a bit more descriptive of what it does.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.399
And even in terms of your navigation here,
GPS test and navigation seem like two very

00:26:03.399 --> 00:26:04.399
different functions.

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:09.849
They both use the GPS certainly, but in terms
of why you're gonna use them they're very

00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:10.849
different.

00:26:10.849 --> 00:26:11.849
[inaudible]

00:26:11.849 --> 00:26:12.849
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:13.849
Oooooo, but I can see the reason why.

00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:17.519
I mean, having owned one of the really old
Garmin GPS units, this is basically the way

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:18.519
the UI worked.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:19.519
You turned it on.

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:20.519
It gave you the GPS data screen.

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:23.769
Which showed you all the satellites and after
a while you get a lock and you switch over

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:25.460
to your waypoint navigation.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.460
Navigation.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.460
&gt;&gt;Trevor: So you know, I can't say.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.940
It really does feel like they're building
a proper GPS unit.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sure.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.349
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Not one of the fancy ones with mapping
and everything.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:34.349
&gt;&gt;Reto: No.

00:26:34.349 --> 00:26:35.349
&gt;&gt;Trevor: You know, just like an old

00:26:35.349 --> 00:26:36.349
&gt;&gt;Reto: Garmin for your fire.

00:26:36.349 --> 00:26:37.349
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:38.349
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's interesting.

00:26:38.349 --> 00:26:39.429
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I mean, I think that's a valid use.

00:26:39.429 --> 00:26:45.100
But on the other hand I'm not sure if you're
using it like that, actually seeing that screen

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.100
is too useful.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.779
I wasn't sure it was too useful on the old
GPS units either.

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:48.779
&gt;&gt;Reto: [chuckles]

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:51.080
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Really what you want to know is,
you know, you have an LED that says, is my

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.080
GPS locked?

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.080
[inaudible]

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Do you have the lock?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.710
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And then you could click on that
and have you pull up your whole GPS for you.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:56.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.290
&gt;&gt;Trevor: So I mean, it really boils down
to what do you want this app to do?

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.509
Do you want it to be GPS test app?

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:03.179
Or do you want to take it to the next level.

00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:04.179
I think you could.

00:27:04.179 --> 00:27:07.210
You could actually just say "this is my GPS
utility app."

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.210
Absolutely.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.509
And as far as that goes, that may then control
how you decide to structure your navigation.

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:16.669
Cause I think fundamentally even more important
than the graphics element, which I think,

00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:20.679
I'm quite sure a lot of people are gonna disagree
with us and be like "No, I love the old school

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:21.679
stuff."

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:22.679
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Its' always subjective.

00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:23.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:26.480
But I think much more important than that
is sorting out the navigation.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.779
Make it much clearer.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.009
Where you are in the app.

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:30.669
How to move to different parts of it.

00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:31.830
And make everything work together.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:35.169
And I think figuring out what is the key purpose.

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:38.539
I talked a little bit about this during my
IO session this year.

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:40.139
But, what is the focus.

00:27:40.139 --> 00:27:43.539
What is the thing that you want people to
associate your app with?

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:47.619
Is it, oh yea, I wanna check to see what the
GPS quality is?

00:27:47.619 --> 00:27:51.580
So I'm gonna use GPS test and fire it up and
see exactly how many satellites are in view

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.070
and what the accuracy is?

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.320
Or do you want it to be like OK, I'm going
for a hike or I'm going fishing and I wanna

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.859
be able to mark down the best fishing spots
and the best hiking trails?

00:28:00.859 --> 00:28:04.149
And so I'm gonna use GPS test navigation to
do that.

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.499
Chances are it's gonna be one or the other.

00:28:06.499 --> 00:28:10.499
It's what your users are using, or what your
direction to the app is.

00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:14.909
And so I would try and find a way to focus
more on that, and make everything else sort

00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:16.379
of more supportive of that.

00:28:16.379 --> 00:28:19.529
Try and really get that focus as tight as
you can.

00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:24.599
&gt;&gt;Romain: And one minor, one minor add on
to that, just aiding navigation and strategic--

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.309
[audio cuts out]

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:28.359
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Oh, I think we lost Romain.

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:30.769
&gt;&gt;Reto: We may have lost him, yeah.

00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:34.119
&gt;&gt;Ian: Remember guys, when I was crawling
around on the floor?

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:35.739
&gt;&gt;Reto: We do remember it.

00:28:35.739 --> 00:28:36.739
&gt;&gt;Ian: unplugging stuff?

00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:37.739
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:42.009
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's because somebody unplugged the
Chrome book and then used its original plug

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:44.139
to do something else.

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.399
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] Handy.

00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:46.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: so we have no Hangout.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.559
That's just the way it is.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: Sorry Romain, if you can still here
us.

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:51.529
Somewhere.

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:52.529
Anywhere.

00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:53.529
&gt;&gt;Ian: He can't.

00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:54.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: He can't.

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:55.529
No.

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:56.529
[laughter]

00:28:56.529 --> 00:28:57.529
&gt;&gt;Trevor: We could have him dial in by phone.

00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:58.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: Speak louder.

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:59.529
Phone!

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:00.529
Nice.

00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:01.529
Yeah.

00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:02.529
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Actually we could have him join
us on GTalk on that phone there.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:03.529
We could switch back and forth between the
app and Romain.

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:04.529
No, that wouldn't work too well.

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:05.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think we're gonna stick with the
app for now.

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:06.529
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:07.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: We'll have Romain join us again.

00:29:07.529 --> 00:29:08.529
Hopefully next week.

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:13.090
We're gonna try and continue to keep him involved
in our Friday reviews even though he's all

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.909
the way in New York City.

00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:19.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: Also gentlemen, just remember you have
about five minutes left.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Five minutes.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Excellent.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Alright, let's have a look.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.481
So we're going to do a quick community service
announcement type talk on one of the apps.

00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:32.460
Or a kind of app which is, which we get a
lot of nominations for.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.919
And that is virus checkers.

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:34.919
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Oh yes.

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:39.129
&gt;&gt;Reto: so I can't see but I'm gonna assume
that you put the, put something on screen.

00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:43.149
So we get a lot of nominations for virus checking
apps.

00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:46.700
And one of the struggles we have is that if
we decide we wanna put it up and talk about

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.129
it is that it's then already been removed
from market or from Google play before we

00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:52.489
get a chance to look at it.

00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:58.019
So there is kind of a clue as to where I'm
going with this based on that.

00:29:58.019 --> 00:30:03.250
And the struggle here is that a lot of the
times these apps are, their basically trying

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.751
to spread fud so it's a case of "Oh, its'
a computer type thing and I don't wanna get

00:30:06.751 --> 00:30:11.509
a virus, don't wanna get malware so I better
download a virus checker to make sure that

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:12.849
that doesn't happen to me."

00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:17.090
The problem is, well, I'm gonna turn that
around slightly.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.609
The good news is that really isn't something
that you need.

00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:22.729
So you don't need virus checkers for your
Android phones.

00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:27.700
Most of the cases what these apps claim to
do isn't quite legit.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.460
And so that's why a lot of these will disappear
from Google play.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.979
Is because they're basically claiming to be
able to do something which they can't and

00:30:33.979 --> 00:30:37.019
a lot of that is because that's already sandboxed.

00:30:37.019 --> 00:30:41.570
That's really part of our security model is
that apps can't mess with other apps.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:46.179
Which has the very positive side effect of
meaning that viruses are very very difficult

00:30:46.179 --> 00:30:47.179
to create.

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:50.330
I mean, we certainly have had some small issues
with malware.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.809
And there's processes in place to remove those.

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:57.110
But in terms of apps infecting other apps,
interfering with the way they work, isn't

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.570
really an issue.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.000
The side effect of that is of course, by the
same token, having an app which is supposed

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.440
to go through and scan other apps and modify
the way they behave in the way that this virus

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.119
checker works, doesn't work either.

00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:10.119
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Right.

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:11.119
So yeah.

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:12.509
There's really, you can't write a virus checker.

00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:17.330
So if we see one, that's sort of immediately
raises a red flag for everyone on the team.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:22.279
And we ask "What the heck is this app doing?"
and most of the time the answer is, it's lying

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:23.279
to the user.

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:24.279
&gt;&gt;Reto: [laughs] exactly.

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:29.379
And so even if it's not doing anything malicious
in and of itself, which often they aren't.

00:31:29.379 --> 00:31:31.729
It's simply, its' claiming to do something
which you can't do.

00:31:31.729 --> 00:31:33.519
And that definitely raises flags.

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:38.159
And to be honest a lot of the time we've seen
situations where apps like this are just trying

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:43.330
to prey on people's sort of preconceived notions
of what they need.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.350
And they also, tend to have a pretty high
correlation of spam within the app description

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.519
and so on, itself.

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:53.830
So it's basically, for whatever reason, people
trying to get people to download this app

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.859
and you know, do advertising things around
that.

00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:57.169
Now it's not always the case.

00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:59.759
But that's certainly something which we've
found a lot of.

00:31:59.759 --> 00:32:04.249
So we won't be reviewing any virus checker
apps, because as far as we're concerned, the

00:32:04.249 --> 00:32:06.289
answer is, it does nothing.

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:08.220
So in case you're wondering why we skip past
them, in the future.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220
Now you know.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.220
So.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.220
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.080
And I think there was a second part of that
app too, which is, I think it was like notification

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080
spam checking.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080
OK.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080
&gt;&gt;Trevor: which I think technically you could
do.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.619
You can run through the whole package list
and search your package name. and you can't

00:32:19.619 --> 00:32:22.779
look inside it but you could match against
known packages.

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:26.219
But honestly that's not even really needed
on Jellybean anymore.

00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:30.499
Because you can just go and click on a notification
and find out which app it came from.

00:32:30.499 --> 00:32:31.499
&gt;&gt;Reto: [inaudible] [laughs]

00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:32.499
&gt;&gt;Trevor: So.

00:32:32.499 --> 00:32:33.499
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:36.279
So it's something which we're definitely very
keen to try and make sure that the platform

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:40.279
is free of anything which is going to be annoying,
frustrating, malicious against users.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:43.989
And we will try and find ways to do that within
the platform itself.

00:32:43.989 --> 00:32:48.759
Because quite simply it's not something that
can be done effectively, or even at all in

00:32:48.759 --> 00:32:51.679
most cases, by a third party app.

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.799
Alright, let's have a look at what else we've
got.

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:55.529
We have a bunch of notes apps.

00:32:55.529 --> 00:32:59.629
I don't think we really have a lot of time
to look at them, so let's look at RunDouble

00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:00.629
instead.

00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:02.950
We'll have a look at, we'll do a Notes app
review next week.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.950
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.799
&gt;&gt;Reto: There's always a lot of notes apps
that we get for review.

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:07.990
So I think that's what we'll do next week.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:09.889
Is just get like a whole collection of them.

00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:11.440
We'll go through the moderator queue.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.559
So if you have a notes app that you'd like
us to look at.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.629
Probably a good opportunity to put it into
the Moderator queue.

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:21.809
And we'll run through like a bunch of them
and pick out the best and worst of each.

00:33:21.809 --> 00:33:22.809
Alright.

00:33:22.809 --> 00:33:24.720
So this is let's see.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.940
What is the name of this app?

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.460
This is RunDouble.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.659
[pause]

00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:32.769
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah, first comment, the UI sort
of hurts my eyes.

00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:34.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it's a little bright.

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:35.679
Yeah.

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:37.249
It is extreme.

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:40.679
The other question I had about this and I'm
gonna go ahead and check here

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:42.159
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Also, menu buttons of shame.

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:45.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Menu buttons of shame.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.520
Yeah.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520
The ad as well.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.499
So, no problem with having ad supported apps,
by any means.

00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:55.720
But the concern here is more that it kinda
looks out of place.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.799
Kinda like Ian, where he's hovering in front
of us.

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:02.320
You know, it really sort of, doesn't quite
work with the rest of the UI.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.320
And everything feels kind of a little off
balance.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320
Perfect.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320
Thank you Ian.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.010
We now can see ourselves again.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.240
So I'm gonna have a look in the play store
because I have a suspicion.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.330
I'm just gonna slide this back while I bring
up the right app.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.390
OK.

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.460
C25K.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.679
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Also that icon.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.170
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it's a little unfortunate.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:32.429
But what I'm almost more concerned with, so
what I'm not sure of here is whether or not

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:38.070
this app is officially sponsored by RunDouble
or this is an app which someone has built

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.580
to help support something by a third party.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.660
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah, it says it's by RunDouble
C25K.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.710
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.510
That brings up a question mark for me.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.330
And this is potentially, so again I don't
know in this particular case.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:55.320
And I'll try and get in touch with the developer
and find out exactly.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.930
But if it is a RunDouble app, then that's
great.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.930
You know.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.790
It's certainly something we'd like to see.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.310
If it's not, so this is an app by someone
who has built something to support a third

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.990
party, you wanna be really cautious about
the way that you promote that.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:14.380
Because there are rules in the Play store
about not creating apps and app descriptions

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.300
which make it seem as though your app is officially
affiliated with something that it isn't or

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.710
that it is an app that it isn't.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.690
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Also more broadly speaking, there's
trademark laws as well.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:24.690
You know.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:25.690
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.690
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Which we can't comment on.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.260
But it is something you need to be aware of.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.260
Exactly.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.740
So even leaving the legal side aside, if the
eval team looks at and we find out ok, it's

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.550
not by the RunDouble team, even if you, here
it isn't clear to me whether or not that's

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.550
the case.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.850
And so you wanna make sure that you're really
clear to your users as to is this official.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.250
Is this something that's in support of another
app.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.160
And make sure of course that you have permission
from them to use their APIs or their resources

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.550
in that kind of a way.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.640
So you know, we're really conscious about
trying to not confuse users and make sure

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.830
that they know exactly what's going on.

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.740
And here I'm a little confused.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.580
So yes that's what I wanted to check.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.650
So let's go back into the app.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.080
Open it up.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.950
So yeah the big thing here is that the UI
is, it's too bright.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.950
Yellow is too much.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:20.200
And then you've got the small icons with the
white text, again, sort of old school looking

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:26.980
icons which, no, they're reasonable resolution
but they're also look very vectory.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.400
So yeah, I'd definitely work on that.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.170
Like right now it's not particularly appealing
like it, just I'd make, wanna go away 'cause

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.650
it's' hurting too much.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.650
Oh.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.650
Yeah.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.610
&gt;&gt;Trevor: and this thing is something I should
point out too.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:41.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, please do.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.570
&gt;&gt;Trevor: So I think if, actually it's one
screen back.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:49.310
So first off here, the "Change Plan" which
lets you, I think if you click something here,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.520
it lets you, oh, it works now.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.530
It tried to make me buy it earlier.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:53.530
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, OK.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:54.530
&gt;&gt;Trevor: I don't know why

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.530
&gt;&gt;Reto: Did you cave and buy it?

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.530
&gt;&gt;Trevor: No, I didn't.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:57.530
So.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.250
At least a few minutes ago when I tried to
do this.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.410
Wow, I don't even know how to get back there.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:04.410
Upgrade maybe?

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.410
Ah.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.410
There we go.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:07.410
So that's another thing that's confusing.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.990
Like these menus are pretty much the same.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.020
Why is it, and there's three ways to get to
this.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020
There, there, or there.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.190
There really should just be one menu.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.190
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:19.710
&gt;&gt;Trevor: But also when you buy these, your
most likely description is couch to 5 K and

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.020
I click buy.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.570
And the description now does not say anything
similar, er Couch to 5 K weeks three to nine.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.330
I guess it's' sort of similar but it doesn't
match exactly.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.990
And that confused me for a second.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it's not clear exactly what
you're getting.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.020
I'm looking remaining weeks three to nine
which I guess implies that this is weeks one

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.370
to three?

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.820
And then this must be nine through something
else?

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.920
&gt;&gt;Trevor: No, no that's [inaudible]

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: No, that's all the same thing.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.460
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: Uh.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.420
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah so basically my feedback there
is make sure your in-app descriptions if you're

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:55.700
doing in-app purchasing, or your descriptions
in your UI match what you give to market to

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.010
display in the purchase screens.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.010
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.010
Absolutely.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.170
So I think what's going on here is that you
can do the Couch to 5 K as a free trial for

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.170
two weeks.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.450
But if you wanna do the remaining three to
nine times week, then you need to do the purchase.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:11.090
So that's, you know, if you read through it
in detail it can get to where its' trying

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.090
to get you to go.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.350
But you definitely wanna make that as clear
as possible.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.350
And you never--

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.460
&gt;&gt;Trevor: and that is a lot of text on one
screen.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.580
&gt;&gt;Reto: And you never wanna be a pret case.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.510
Like the real big advantage of in-app billing
is that it removes those barriers.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:25.650
It's fewer clicks between "I want this" and
"I have this."

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.770
So you wanna make sure that that's as smooth
a path as possible.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:28.770
As possible.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.770
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.740
I wanna say, like I said, get rid of the upgrade
menu and then the change plan button.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.340
You know, have your purchase button right
there.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.370
And then you can go and grade these out if
they're not available or if you're in trial

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:40.370
mode, you know.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:41.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly, yeah.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.370
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Yeah, but yeah,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: Make it clear what you're getting
when you buy one

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.560
&gt;&gt;Trevor: there's too many ways you could
go and improve the purchase flow there.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.530
And as an app developer that's good for you.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.570
So OK, so I don't wanna spend too much more
time on this mainly because we're pretty much

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.570
out of time.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:58.610
But the big, the big suggestion I would have
for you here is to basically take another

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.040
look at your UI.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.550
Create something which is less busy.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.000
Less bright.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.720
And sort of less text, more pictures.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.580
Really try, again, it's all about focus.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.520
Try and figure out what is it that I would
get this app to do.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.730
What are the actions that I want a user to
do once they start this.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.290
And bring them to the forefront.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.040
Everything else, you know some of it you may
wanna move into menus.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.360
Or move further down the hierarchy.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.100
Or just remove completely.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.850
It's really just a case of figuring out, what
it is that you want me to do once I install

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:27.850
your app.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.460
And try and drive me down that path as quickly
as possible.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.420
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And blinding your users is usually
not what you wanna do.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: No. not safe either, if they're running.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.180
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Well, I mean, if that's what your
app is for.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.800
If your app is called "Blind Me."

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.190
&gt;&gt;Reto: Blind me.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.190
Yeah.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.980
&gt;&gt;Trevor: [laughs] I'm being harsh.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.160
It's yea, just this yellow on black

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160
&gt;&gt;Reto: it's a bit much.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.160
&gt;&gt;Trevor: It seems a bit much.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.650
You know, again, like I was saying earlier,
try and make it blend in with the rest of

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.650
the system.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.770
Take a look at the holo design guidelines.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.640
I suspect you're trying to do some branding
here with the yellow and black thing.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.910
Which is cool.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:59.330
And there are ways to, and keep that motif
going, whilst still staying true to, how holo

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.610
is supposed to look and feel.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.610
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mm. absolutely.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.910
So we're out of time.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:08.060
I wanna give Ian and Dan from the Friday Games
review a chance to setup.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.080
So we're gonna sign off.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.350
We will be back next week.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.520
With a hopefully, Fred will be back again
next week as well.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.830
And maybe Trevor will join us too.

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.070
And we're going to take a look at some note
taking apps.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.100
So in the meantime we will bid you adieu.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.140
Hopefully you will stick around and watch
the Friday games review with Ian and Dan.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.290
And the mystery hat.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.850
I'm not sure what the mystery hat is this
week.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.300
But it's bound to be an exciting hat.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.660
&gt;&gt;Trevor: And there's a mystery beer as well.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.890
&gt;&gt;Reto: There's always a mystery beer.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.890
That's very true.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.890
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Ah.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.890
But there's a special mystery beer.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.890
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:36.890
That's exciting.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right.

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.890
This time the beer is a mystery to Dan.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.130
But I'll give you a preview 'cause I doubt
he's watching.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.810
It's gonna be McKellers 1000 IBU.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.250
&gt;&gt;Trevor: [laughs]

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: We'll see how much of a hop-head he
truly is.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.050
&gt;&gt;Trevor: [laughs]

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.780
&gt;&gt;Reto: Now see, how can you turn that down?

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.000
So we expect that all of you guys will take
a quick bathroom break and we'll all be back

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.700
in ten minutes for the Friday Games review.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.700
&gt;&gt;Trevor: Great.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.700
See you everyone.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: So.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:01.705
Thank you for joining us.
