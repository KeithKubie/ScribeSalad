00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.440
Today we are going to be looking at some of
the Top 5 Video Game WTF's.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.110
There are way more than 5 out there, but,
guess what, 5 is a nice round number, and,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.610
it's the number of girlfriends I have.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.240
And by 5, I mean 0.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.020
Definitions: I'm not including things that
are obvious and intended.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.520
And I'm not including things that are fan-made,
but I really wish I could.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.820
And I'm also not including things that are
part of winning the game.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.870
Number 5 is a CoDMW2WTF, and, yeah, it's a
blow up.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.120
But not that kind...this kind.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.320
In Assassin's Creed, MPC's have been found
glitched out, humping the walls at amazing

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.320
speeds.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.600
I would be a lot more weirded out if I wasn't
so impressed with their speed.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Look at that.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
I want that.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.030
World of Warcraft is filled with WTF's.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.570
We could make an entire countdown just about
them, but let me show you my favorite.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.190
In Dalaran there's a Blood Elf who continuously
strokes a red-hot metal rod.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.930
Let's just take a moment of silence.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.020
If you jump on your Rhino and your barrel
at the same time, you ride the Rhino.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539
Ride.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:12.539
Number 1:

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.189
I love this because of its subtlety.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.520
It's in Bioshock.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.939
After what appears to be a big explosion,
take a look...yeah...that is why this is number

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.939
1.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:26.939
So, there you go.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.700
To me, those are some of the Top 5 WTF's in
video gaming, but there are so many more.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
If you had already seen every clip I talked
about today, give this video a thumbs up to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.329
let everyone know that you are a genius, and
if you've seen others that aren't on this

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.069
list, please put it in the comments.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.439
I want to see more of these things, they're
are awesome.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.880
Once you've done that, be sure to subscribe,
and stay Saucy my friends.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.669
(In whisper) Psst, hey, hey are you still
there?

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.820
Ok, awesome, listen to me.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.179
There's this really cool thing I found- it's
called Facebook.

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.649
I don't know, it's kind of weird, I don't
really get it.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.599
But, we're there, check it out.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.960
There's a link in the description.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.060
Ok, ok, bye.
