00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:04.880
MALE SPEAKER: So after we
graduated from Monta Vista High

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.770
School in Cupertino,
Erez is continued on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.800
to get his Ph.D. in computer
science from UC San Diego.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
So afterwards, while
the peers continued on

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.735
to research and full-time gigs
at Google, Microsoft, and up

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:25.220
and coming startups, he
decided to go the other route.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.950
So stick to his story and
continue building guitars.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.860
10 years ago, while Erez was
an up and coming luthier,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.540
we were driving up north
from Southern California

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.600
with his first two guitars
that he built. And he didn't

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.280
have any power tools back then.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.800
He was intending on gifting
one to his guitar teacher.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.930
And I had to take the other one.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.200
I fell in love with it,
it sounded beautiful.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.130
So we were his first two
customers, basically.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.780
And here we are 10 years
later inspired so many others.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.690
Erez and myself continue
playing instruments

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.720
and appreciate
fine craftsmanship.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.900
So please join me in giving
a warm welcome and a big hand

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.896
to luthier Erez
Perelman, my friend.

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:19.100
EREZ PERELMAN: Hey,
thank you so much,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.610
[? Baris, ?] and
everyone here decided

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.889
to take time from their work.

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.930
This is probably a little
bit different from what

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.870
you guys are used to.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.080
So if I feel privileged
to be here, and I hope you

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.535
guys will find it interesting.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.120
The talk, we titled it Art,
Music, and Engineering.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.700
In a way, it's how
I feel about myself.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.280
Just three different
spaces that got

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.870
grouped together
into what you're

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.590
going to see in front
here, the guitar,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.230
which is what I focus
my life on today.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.685
So let's get started.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
[? Baris ?] already
mentioned it.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.680
I got a Ph.D. in
computer science.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.420
My advisers actually
recently joined Google,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.640
so I'm actually seeing
a few of my colleagues

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.890
from university
years, which is nice.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.700
And that was 10 years ago.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.550
So let me get started with what
we're going to discuss today.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.080
We're going to talk about
my evolution briefly.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.040
How I got into making guitars.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.140
Then we're going
to briefly discuss

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.880
the history of the guitar, it's
a very interesting instrument.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.390
And then we're going to get down
to the nitty gritty of making

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.220
the guitar, what goes into
it, materials, construction

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.720
methods, working
with hands, things

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.340
that are different from being
in the computer, really.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.150
And at the end, I really want
to leave time for questions.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.280
And also I have a client of
mine, he's a fantastic player.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300
This whole talk I'd
organized very last minute,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.040
and asked him if he could do
a little video demonstration.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.410
Because he has a flamenco
guitar and a classical guitar.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.000
So we got a little treat
from a great player.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.130
I'm going to include that
at the end of the talk.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.590
OK, let's start with my journey.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.820
As a young kid, I always
loved working with my hands.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.650
My father did everything
with his hands.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.030
Built furniture and
things like this.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.030
My grandfather was
a sculptor, teacher

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.550
and he had a small, tiny
little workshop in his house,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.020
and I loved spending
hours there.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.420
And as a young kid,
I used to just take

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.640
chunks of wood I found on
the ground and start hacking

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.700
in with knives and chisels.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.710
And here's one of
the creations I made.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.225
I think this is when I was
12 or 13, it's a little owl.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.580
That was my first passion.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.580
A little bit later, I
got into guitar playing.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.910
I was trained with
music from much earlier,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.890
but I wasn't in love with
it until I found the guitar.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.060
And then I really
fell in love with it.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.540
And I dedicated a huge amount
of my time to practice,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.440
and furthering myself.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.840
And I actually ended up
choosing my university

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.210
based on the guitar teachers
that were there on the faculty.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.996
They were [? Marrows, ?]
which was UCSD.

00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:44.870
They're no longer teaching
through there now,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.720
but I had the privilege
of studying with them even

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.020
though it wasn't my degree.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.120
My degree was Computer Science,
which I continued as long as

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.880
possible to get my Ph.D.
And during my studies

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.100
in the university, even though
I was playing guitar a lot

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.620
and I was continuing
sculpting, I still

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.040
felt like I was missing using
my hands to create stuff.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.080
And I had this longing to
build guitars for a long time.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.114
And I contacted a few
guitar builders in the area,

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:27.030
and there are even schools
that you can go to.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.590
But they're very expensive,
and I didn't have much money.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.170
So I found a book
about building guitars.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.470
I read it, and then
I just went for it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.880
I set up a tiny
workshop in my bedroom,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.960
and I started building
my first guitar.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.380
And it took me a year to do.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.100
It was very
challenging, because I

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.740
had to make a lot of
the tools from scratch.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.890
But it was a
interesting journey,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.370
which started me on this
lifelong endeavor, really.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.540
So I forgot to mention
the definition.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.570
What I do, building musical
instruments that are stringed,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.620
it's called a luthier.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.990
Lutes are if you've
ever seen egg shaped

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.030
instruments, lots of strings.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.810
Guitars, violins, cellos.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.780
That's the family of
what luthiers build.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:25.560
I focus specifically on
classical and flamenco guitars.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.570
The picture you're
seeing here in this slide

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.480
is something for
my research, which

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.710
I thought would be
humorous to understand

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.370
what I used to study.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.140
It was basically trying to
characterize the behavior

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.280
of programs as they execute.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.370
Here we're looking
at [? GZip ?] and try

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.180
to classify them into faces.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.870
And one thing you discover
when you start doing this

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.190
is that a lot of that behavior
is repetitive and cyclical.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.550
And I find that applies to
my life, and many in general.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.570
Where I started with
sculpting and playing

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.240
guitar and
engineering, and then I

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.250
went back to my roots of working
with my hands and sculpting.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.510
And I still utilize
a lot of my research,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.430
as you'll see some
of these slides.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.790
So let's get into a
brief history of guitar.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.660
Guitar, the earliest
predecessors

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.060
are actually quite ancient, from
Asia thousands of years ago.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.550
But one distinction
about these instruments

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.960
is that they were carved
out of a block of wood.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.000
The body of it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.750
So you took a log or
a big piece of wood

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.700
and just start hacking
at it, creating a cavity.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.910
And you glue a
soundboard over that.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.650
And you could still
have frets back then.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.270
These were usually made
out of tendon or something,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.390
and they're tied
around the neck.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:57.390
And this is really the
earliest form of guitar.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.980
But we start talking about
used instruments today,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.300
we go into the
[? biwela. ?] That's

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.810
the true old guitar starting
from the Renaissance

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.880
and Baroque periods.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.070
And in this instrument,
what we have

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.420
is a body that's created
from thin plates of wood

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.520
that were actually bent to
create the form of the sides.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.910
The back was glued on, and
it's much, much lighter

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.840
than an instrument that was
carved out of a chunk of wood.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.910
Acoustically, it behaves
much different in how

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.610
it vibrates and responds to
the attack on the strings.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.000
So this is really where
we start seeing things

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.350
that sound more like guitars.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:49.790
Now a couple centuries ago,
we have the romantic guitar.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.820
And it's looking a lot closer
to what guitars look like today.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.690
You see it's a
little bit narrower.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.490
Main guitarists at
the time they used

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.570
it, Fernando Sor and Giuliani.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.610
They're like the
Mozart of the guitar.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.090
These are the instruments
that they used.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.040
But the biggest evolution
of the instrument

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.550
was done when a Spaniard
by the name of Antonio

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:20.670
Torres in the 1850s designed
the guitar that we know today.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.052
OK, this is the modern
classical guitar.

00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:24.510
There was no
distinction back then,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.300
it was just the Spanish guitar.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.450
The body was much wider, and
some very interesting things

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.560
were done internally with the
bracing and the scale length

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.410
to give you the instrument
that we know today.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.090
So Antonio Torres is
the father of the guitar

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.420
very much like
Antonio Stradivarius

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.800
is the father of the violin.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.310
And not too much has been
changed as far as the looks

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.840
of the guitar goes.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.510
Technologically,
though, there have

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.270
been some modern
evolutions of the guitar.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.940
And if there's time
we'll get into that

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.320
at the end of the talk.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.420
So let's get into the
construction of it,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.656
or my approach.

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:10.780
That's the important thing.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.700
The approach to how
do you build a guitar?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.780
Well, there's a difference
when you first do it

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.590
and you just want to build
a guitar for yourself,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.230
and when you do
it professionally

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.500
and you build it to
sell it to a client.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.220
So now, I have orders.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.686
People come to me.

00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:31.560
They don't have to be
professional musicians,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.470
but a lot of times they are.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.460
And I need to understand
very, very specifically what

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.310
their needs are.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.140
And this varies across a
huge spectrum of parameters.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.630
For example, there can be
someone with smaller hands,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.920
and it's very difficult for them
to play a standard size guitar.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.720
So they may need modifications
in the length of the scale,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.560
or the width of the neck,
and these are all things

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.530
that I can change and I
can control as a luthier.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.170
Another needs are, for example,
the sound of the instrument.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.000
There are people who like
to play classical music,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.540
and there are people who
like to play flamenco music.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.470
And there is a bit of a
difference in that sound.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.250
The video later in the
talk will demonstrate that.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.990
But all this has a
huge impact on how

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.530
I approach the
building of the guitar

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.280
before I even do
anything with the wood.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.000
Once I understand the
needs of the clients,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.770
the next thing, of course,
is to select the materials.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:37.760
The materials that I choose will
have a very significant impact

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.310
on the sound of the instrument.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.180
So I brought a guitar here
today that I recently finished.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.580
This guitar is built with
a soundboard made out

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.160
of western red cedar.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.510
This is darker than the spruce.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.890
Spruce is the more
traditional wood.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.700
It's a little bit
lighter in color.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.540
This wood come to Canada, the
spruce comes from the Alps.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.550
The body of this guitar
is made out of rosewood.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.720
This is rosewood from
India, and there's

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.030
rosewood from South America,
there's rosewood from Africa.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.390
If I choose different
materials for the guitar,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.340
it will have an
impact on the sound,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.180
as well as how I
treat that material.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.420
So one of the important
things at the beginning

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.760
is to select the
material specifically

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.690
for the client's needs.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.070
What kind of guitar
do they need?

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.280
I brought a few pieces
I'd like to pass around.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.280
This is actually cedar
like you see on the guitar

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.390
here from the top.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.160
This is very light, it's
considered a soft wood.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.650
And it's light but stiff.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:55.090
So pass this around,
has a nice smell.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.750
This is a piece of cocobolo.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.760
This is actually from Mexico.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.500
The guitar I made
for [? Baris ?]

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.040
is built out of this wood.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.560
It's extremely dense,
extremely oily.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.650
Has a very glassy sound,
you guys can tap it.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.430
And right here we have ebony.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.730
This wood is not colored
or dyed in any way,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.580
this is the natural
color of the wood.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.210
This is from Africa.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.400
It's a very, very
hard, dense wood.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.400
If you put it in water,
it would actually sink.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.380
And we use this in the guitar
where the fingerboard is,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.035
because this is where the
fingers touch raw wood,

00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:37.400
and you want it to withstand
the wear and tear of that.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.095
So I'll pass this
around, and cocobolo.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.480
So I select the
materials I'm going

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.830
to use for the guitar I'm
building for a specific client,

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.410
and then I start building it.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.190
That's the construction process.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.340
The materials-- I'll
ask you guys a question.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.110
One of the most important
materials in the guitar.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.020
It's up here, it's ridiculous
to ask the question.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.740
The wood is the most
important thing.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.620
But just as important is the
glue, and then the polish.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.390
These three things are
what build a guitar.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.300
You glue together two
pieces of wood with glue.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.820
And a lot of people think,
huh, glue, very simple.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.230
But actually, glue is a very,
very complicated medium,

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.710
material, whatever
you want to call it.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.210
Well, adhesive.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.070
But the different types of
glues have a huge impact

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.320
on the quality of sound.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:58.197
Some glues that are, let's say,
soft and plasticy or foamy,

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.280
there are glues like that.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.270
Like polyurethane
glues that foam up.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.410
What happens, for
example, contact cement

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.340
is very soft also.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.550
When you got two
plates vibrating,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.120
it's going to dampen the sound.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.870
Is going to absorb the
sound, and it's not

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.670
going to transfer
between the two pieces.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.340
Versus a glue that's very
hard and crystallized,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.580
which I'll talk
about in a second.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.730
Which would actually transfer
the sound and the vibrations

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.670
without absorbing it.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.695
The same goes for the polish.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.820
I put huge thought and
labor into the polish

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.724
of an instrument, and
these three things really

00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:39.015
make a big difference in the
quality of the instrument.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.896
And finally, the
construction method.

00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:45.270
There's two things
here, which is

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.850
the design of the construction.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.780
Your traditional instrument.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.700
Dimensions, the bracing that
goes into the instrument.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.790
And then how you do it.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.565
How do you tool the work?

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:04.040
So here is one angle
of my workshop today.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.200
You see some guitars in the
background, they're hanging,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.350
I'm polishing them.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.310
You see here some
sound boards that

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:20.640
are already joined, and
just drying and seasoning.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.270
And I work on this workbench.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.950
This is where I spend
my day, I usually

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.880
stand there and do something
interesting with the wood.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.690
Here, I'm slicing a
big chunk of wood,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.632
this is going to be shown
later, how I make the necks out

00:16:34.632 --> 00:16:35.340
of this material.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.130
This is Spanish cedar.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.120
Quite different from
the Western red cedar,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.950
because this material
comes from South America

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.540
and it's much harder and
denser than the cedar

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.690
used for the sound boards.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.800
The tools.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.110
So the tools that
luthiers use today

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.690
are tools that used
to be widespread

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.930
in every woodworker's home.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.050
Let's say 50 years ago, or a
century ago before power tools

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.690
really took off.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:13.170
Unfortunately, today
a lot of wood shops,

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.660
you rarely see tools like this.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.520
People forgot the
art of the hand tool.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.440
And I got two different
types of tools here.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.369
Where is this thing?

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.200
Here we go.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.040
So on the upper left side,
because we're looking here too.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.830
I got Japanese tools.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.920
And recently, I found the
beauty of Japanese steel.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.450
It's absolutely incredible.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.850
Versus here on the lower right
side, these are western tools.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.940
And here we got a
couple of planes.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.090
Planes are used to shave wood.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.050
They have a knife
embedded inside the tool,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.340
and you push it across
the wood, and you can

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.890
get a very, very fine shaving.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.570
This is how you remove
stock, and you can thickness

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.280
plates of wood this way.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.650
Then you got some chisels
here that are Western chisels.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.100
The main difference in quality
between the Western tools

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.260
and the Japanese tools
is in the steel itself.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.300
The Japanese have a
long history of steel,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.180
can imagine with samurais.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.170
And the way they
make the finest tools

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.480
is by laminating a very,
very hard piece of steel

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.750
with a very soft piece of steel.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.080
And the guys that
make these tools

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.460
do very much what I
do with the guitars.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.210
There are people who've spent
their entire lives-- a lot

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.090
of times it's multiple
generations doing it--

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.350
just building tools by hand.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.470
And these tools, now that
I've done this for so long,

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.880
I can really appreciate them
for their quality and incredible

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.540
performance.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.960
So I don't want to say they're
better than the Western tools,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.630
but there is much more of
a craftsmanship involved

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.270
in creating it.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.040
The work.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.630
Well, it's hand work,
for the most part.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.040
So once you've thought through
the specs of the design

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.420
and you start building
it, you put stuff together

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.570
and then you cut it.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.820
So here, I'm using
one of the knives,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.560
and I'm shaving the
crest of the head.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.890
Got to learn how to
sharpen the tools,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.500
and then you got to learn
how to use them with control.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.560
And one of the big
differences in the work,

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.540
let's say from sitting at
the computer and programming,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.090
is there's no undo.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.250
There's no let's revert
back to an old save.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:41.720
So if you do a cut and you
overcut it, well, that's done.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.220
And the amount of focus you need
to have when you do this work

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.120
is incredible.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:52.580
You really got to be in the
zone when you're doing it.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.050
So that's something that
I really enjoy about it.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.630
The materials I
mentioned before then.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.130
So the wood, and then
there's glue in the polish.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.470
So the glue that I'd like
to use, which I think

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.330
is really the superior glue,
it's the most traditional glue.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.110
It's called hide glue.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.650
It's animal glue, basically.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.970
It's cooked down
from hides and bones.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.540
It's very similar to gelatin.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.610
And the way you use
it is you melt it

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.050
in water in a special
glue pot that raises it

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.350
to a very specific temperature.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.510
And when it's hot, you
can actually use it.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.800
It's like honey.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.190
And you can brush it on the
wood and very quickly you

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.480
got to put the joint, rub it,
and that's it, it's stuck.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.060
The beauty of the glue is
that you can reverse it.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.620
You can heat it up
later, open it up.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.120
And the important
beauty of it is that it

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.780
crystallizes super hard.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.380
It snaps like glass, so
it's incredible material.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.630
The other material on the left
side is the polish that I use.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.820
And this polish
is called shellac.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.580
Shellac is a very
interesting material.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.720
Used to be very popular maybe
a century ago, but today

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.260
largely forgotten.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.460
Basically, it's interesting
to know its origins.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.230
Comes from the seedlac
beetle in India

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.820
that grows on a specific tree.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.070
And the beetle
encrusts the branches

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.110
of the tree with some
kind of excretion

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.200
from eating the
resins of the wood,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.500
and lays its eggs in there,
forming its colonies this way.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.350
The people there in India,
they flake this material off,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.790
clean it from all the
bark and bug pieces,

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.860
and then you just
melt it in alcohol.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.950
It's is organic as it gets.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.770
And the process of applying
it-- French polish, which

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.270
I'll discuss later--
provides the finest finish

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.160
for acoustic instruments.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.980
So it takes a lot more work to
do this polish than let's say,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.950
spraying on lacquer, which
is what factories do.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.304
But again, when we're
talking about building

00:22:07.304 --> 00:22:08.720
something really,
really good, you

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.261
want to do the finest
possible thing.

00:22:10.261 --> 00:22:13.200
So we go down to these
basic ingredients.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.260
So one of my jobs is also
to find the best material.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.980
So before starting
the guitar, I need

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.350
to have good
material, good wood.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.400
You've got to start with good
wood to build good guitars.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.520
And here's a picture of me
selecting wood in the Alps.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.950
Me and my wife, I took her
on a very exciting trip

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.240
for two weeks to go
drive around the Alps

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.430
and visit people who
specialize in cutting

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.890
spruce trees specifically
for musical instruments.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:52.750
And you've seen the pictures
here on the right side.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.560
These are tops for violins
and cellos from spruce.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.020
This is spruce, by the way.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.840
You see the difference in
color from the cedar piece.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.460
So we traveled, we looked
for the best material.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.220
And once I found it,
here I'm selecting it,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.770
I bought as much of
it as I could afford.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.250
And the idea is to
stockpile your workshop

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.440
for your lifetime as a builder.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.100
The longer it's in your
shop, and seasons, and ages,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.990
the finer it's considered.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.810
So I know my wife
loves me very much.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.980
She sat on that
table for three days

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.035
while I was selecting
through thousands of pieces.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.780
Let's start with
the construction.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.600
So once I select, I
have the material,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.280
I know what I'm going to
use to build a guitar.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.790
I'm going to give you guys
a very, very quick overview

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.150
of basically every part of the
guitar, and how I build it.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.790
So starting with the soundboard.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.520
The soundboard starts
with a piece of wood

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.920
that's been book matched.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.740
Which means you take it, and
you cut it down the center,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.530
and you open it like a book.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.810
And then you join it, which
means you shave it very,

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.560
very accurately and then
you glue it with hide glue,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.460
of course.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.485
And ideally, you have
no idea there's a seam.

00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:16.120
It looks like a
single piece of wood.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.220
Well, what it gives you is
a symmetric piece of wood--

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.940
or two pieces of
wood-- that are going

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.350
to react to humidity
changes exactly the same.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.960
That gives you more stability
in the top of the instrument.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.700
The back is treated
the same way.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.890
Once we join the back, we're
going to start thicknessing it.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.220
And in guitar
building, this is one

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.080
of the most
important things that

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.903
are going to determine
the overall sound

00:24:41.903 --> 00:24:44.310
of the instrument.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.720
There are machines today,
you can take a piece of wood

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.660
and run it through the
machine, and get it down

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:55.550
to exactly 2.22 millimeters,
or whatever thickness you want.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:59.220
But the art of guitar
making-- or instrument

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.150
making in general-- is
to take a piece of wood

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.840
and appreciate its
unique properties.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.680
Every piece of wood
is different, even

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.250
from the same log.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.794
So I got stacks
of spruce billets,

00:25:11.794 --> 00:25:13.710
and they're all marked
what tree they're from.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.390
And a lot of them are from the
same tree, but a lot of them

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.270
have different properties.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.650
The art of it is
really to understand

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.170
those different properties.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.270
And you're shaving
it with the plane,

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.560
and you really
want to understand,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.290
I got to shave a
little more here,

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.860
or leave it a
little thicker here.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.490
You feel it with your fingers
a lot, bending the wood.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.130
You can tap it.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.270
And this is really important.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.370
Because once you
thickness the soundboard,

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.660
you generally don't
want to touch it.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.890
Once the soundboard
has been thicknessed,

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.610
the next step is to
cut the sound hole

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.200
and inlay the rosette.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.330
So this is the sound hole
in the guitar right here.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.850
Serves a very important purpose.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.840
The sound of the
guitar doesn't come out

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.140
of the sound hole, which
is counter intuitive.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.780
The sound hole serves the
purpose of allowing air

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.350
to come in and out.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.270
Essentially, it's like a pump.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.940
The sound comes
from the soundboard

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.770
here, which is moving when
you're playing the strings.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.710
And this is causing
the air to move,

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.600
and that's what you're
hearing from here.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.280
This is just allowing
this wood to not

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.850
create too much of a vacuum.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.300
That's its purpose.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.120
The purpose of the rosette is
to reinforce the sound hole.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.070
And it can be done very simply
with a single piece of wood.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.300
Or when you're looking at
very artistic, high level

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.680
instrument, this is really
the artistic signature

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.330
of the luthier.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:53.310
And this is where handmade
really gets handmade.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.780
So designing these rosettes,
you can spend a lot

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.242
of time and thought into it.

00:27:00.242 --> 00:27:03.585
And when you know your guitars,
I can just look at a rosette

00:27:03.585 --> 00:27:05.200
and know who built it.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.920
Whose guitar that is.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.790
So just to briefly
show you the process.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:13.560
You start with the center motif.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.550
They're little titles.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.010
And each tile here has maybe
100 little squares of wood,

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.220
like pixels.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:29.330
And you glue them around a
circle to get the design.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.100
That's the center motif.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.790
Once that's glued, you
dig different channels

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.000
for the borders.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.930
And then you glue
in the borders.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.230
The reason I do it in
different steps like that

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:46.550
is because the rosette is a
very complicated piece to inlay.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.300
And I can say from research,
or just doing this,

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.410
I've learned to break
complicated procedures,

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.366
you break it down
to subtasks that

00:27:55.366 --> 00:27:57.190
are a little less complicated.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.520
And what that gives you is
a little bit more control,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.950
and at the end, finer quality.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.250
So you can see I'm
gluing it in here.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.710
Here, I'm shaving the rosette.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.970
And you can see the pixels
of a very close up photo

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.850
of the rosette there, the
little squares of wood.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.290
And also, here's two
different designs.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.390
It's really the artistic
side of the instrument.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.610
You can play with many
different designs.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:27.890
You can spend endless,
endless hours here.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.940
It doesn't have any impact
on the sound of the guitar,

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.450
but this is part of the
artistic part of it.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:38.150
So that's the rosette.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:42.050
Once the rosette is finished,
I flip the sound board over,

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.975
and I start thinking about the
acoustics of the soundboard

00:28:44.975 --> 00:28:46.290
of the guitar.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:51.050
And this is where we start
constructing the guitar.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.690
The soundboard is
supported with braces.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.990
And Torres, it was done
sparsely before him,

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.400
but he's largely considered
the founder of this.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.450
The fan bracing system, where
you take-- these are the fan

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.330
braces.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.510
Sticks, basically,
made out of spruce.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.520
You glue them onto
the soundboard.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.230
And what it gives you is
a very controlled manner

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.890
in which the
soundboard vibrates.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.950
Much more subtle but yet
important thing that it does

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.950
is actually, if
you carefully look

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.410
at the soundboard
of fine guitars,

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.650
they have a bit of
an arch to them.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.480
And these braces actually
create that arch.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.980
It's glued in a dome
dish called a solera.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.790
And the gluing process, you
can see with these sticks.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.050
The thin sticks that
are sticking vertically,

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.630
they're not the braces.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.400
These are called go bars.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.450
Go bars are the clamps.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.870
They are sticks that are
basically bent, and flexed,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.400
then they can be resting
against the ceiling.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.240
And then, they can apply
very fine pressure--

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.770
let's say a couple
pounds-- directly down

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.070
in a single point.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.562
So I can use a few of them to
glue each piece of wood down.

00:30:08.562 --> 00:30:11.490
And I don't have to
deal with clamps.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.660
It's a very
primitive method that

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.450
was actually developed by
harpsichord makers centuries

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.390
ago.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:23.520
And it's a great method to use.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.665
The fan braces,
once I glue them,

00:30:25.665 --> 00:30:30.260
I shave them with a
little plane and chisels.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.020
And again, this is done by hand.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.550
You can try to come down
to precise dimensions,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.510
but the best quality
usually comes

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.500
from some kind of intuition
you build in your fingers.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.980
So where to stop, it's
a matter of gut feeling.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.370
And that's how you see it here.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.530
And here, I'm just flexing
and looking at the soundboard

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:01.340
to gauge how it's going
before I continue on

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.190
in the building process.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.660
So the soundboard is by
far the most important part

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.920
of the guitar.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.120
Selecting good wood,
the design, and then

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.280
finally the intuition of
the builder and to bring out

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.840
the qualities of
the wood are going

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.520
to have a huge factor in how
the instrument turns out.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.930
The neck.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.260
That's this part here on
the guitar, right here.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.610
This is the neck,
and it starts out

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.895
with you saw that giant
piece of wood my workshop,

00:31:31.895 --> 00:31:33.500
I was sawing it.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.590
That is called Spanish
cedar, it could also

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.080
be done out of mahogany.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.450
So I cut it from a
big billet, and then I

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.280
get it into a smaller
piece of wood,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.510
and then I start shaving
it with the planes.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.650
You see all these
shavings on my workbench.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.150
The planes don't only
reduce the dimension,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.885
but they make it
very, very flat.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.260
And you cut special joints
to glue the head on.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.832
And what's being glued on
here is called the heel block.

00:32:04.832 --> 00:32:06.140
I'll show it in the next slide.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:12.480
The heel block is one of
the big distinct features

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.330
between the Spanish
style of building

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.470
and the American style
of building guitars.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.170
So you see that
big block of wood

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.090
here in the picture, which I
carve down later into what's

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.020
called the Spanish foot.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.910
And the American style of
building doesn't have the foot.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.700
What it has is you build
the body of the guitar,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.430
and you build the
neck separately,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.480
and later you join in
with a [? tendon. ?]

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.400
The Spanish style, you have
the Spanish foot, which

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.950
is integrated into the body.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.770
You build the body of the
guitar around the neck.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.610
So the sides are
actually slotted.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:50.020
They're not glued into the neck,
they're just wedged into it.

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.410
And it's much more integrated.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.430
And, I believe, for me
it's worked much better.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:57.775
So this is the method I use.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.000
So the photos aren't
exactly chronological.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.950
Because here you see
the body, the guitar

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.170
that he built a little bit.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.130
But the neck, just to show you
the finishing touches on it,

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.410
you got to carve it.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.390
It started out as a
square piece of wood.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.040
How do you carve it?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.250
So this tool you see here
with the red handles,

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.770
it's called just a pull shave.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.620
It's a knife with
two handles on it.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.820
It's a great tool.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.610
And you basically pull
it, and it gives you

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.560
a nice shaving of wood.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.920
Of course, the skills
involved in using it

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.509
will determine whether you
destroy the guitar or not.

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:40.550
Initially, when you don't
know what you're doing,

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.040
you're going to be using
a lot of files, and rasps,

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.220
and sandpaper.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.370
But as you get better
and better and better,

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.190
you can actually start using
more and more edge tools.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.770
These are things that shave the
wood, and actually are faster,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.300
and give you a much
higher quality finish.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.560
So you can see how I do
some of that process here.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.030
So let's talk about the
body of the guitar now.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:11.300
The body of the guitar is
basically in this case,

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.040
I'm talking about the
sides and the back.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.350
And in this photo, just like
this guitar, it's rosewood.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:23.219
Rosewood is a dense, heavy wood.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.800
Comes from all around the world.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.050
You have it in Asia, India,
which is this material here.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:33.639
south America, and Africa.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.940
And you see the back
here and the sides.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.130
The sides start out
as two strips of wood,

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.250
they're also book matched.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.120
Everything in the
guitar is book matched.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.310
So it starts out
as a single billet,

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.520
and it was sliced open so
that they're symmetric.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.155
And the way they react to the
humidity will be symmetric.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.650
And here I'm bracing the back.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.840
I use the same go bar deck,
I use the hot hide glue.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.930
You can actually see the pot of
glue here in one of the photos.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.560
Let's see if you see that.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.580
That's the hot pot.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.030
And I use a syringe.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.470
It's sitting in a
bath of water that's

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:17.570
heated to exactly 150 degrees
Fahrenheit right here.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.500
Where is the light?

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.420
I can't-- there
it is right there.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.260
And you can see the
glue squeezed out here.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.920
The beauty of this glue is
after just a few seconds,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.440
as soon as it cools
down, it gels.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.790
It is like gelatin.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.275
And you can take
a little scraper,

00:35:35.275 --> 00:35:36.820
and just scrape it off.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.860
And you get this nice
long kind of goomy worm.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.420
And we used to have a dog, I
used to feed my dog this thing,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.830
she loved it.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.300
But now I have it
all over the shop.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.590
So you brace it,
and you shave it.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.264
And here you see me
bending the sides.

00:35:59.264 --> 00:36:00.680
The traditional
method, of course,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.750
is doing it on a hot pipe.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.300
And you take the sides.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.960
And when you apply heat
and pressure to wood,

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.860
if it's thin enough, it'll bend.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.030
It plasticizes.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.280
So sides that are around
two millimeters thick,

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.960
you can actually bend them.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.280
Again, the skills
involved are to avoid

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.900
putting too much pressure, or
trying to do it too fast, which

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.630
will cause it to break.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.060
Or if you do too slow,
the wood will burn.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.110
It'll start smoking, and
you'll get charred wood,

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.150
which is very bad.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.100
So back and sides.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.670
A slight digression
here in this slide,

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.400
just because it is Google here.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.640
So where did I use
some of my skills

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.870
with computers is in designing
a bending machine that

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.540
would bend the sides for me.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.620
This is done in many
shops, it saves time.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.130
The problem is that when
you bend it in a machine,

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.150
you usually use
a heating blanket

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.320
or some kind of heat source.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.200
Whatever you do it in, when you
pull it out, it springs back.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.580
So the idea is to over-bend
the shape of the sides.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.330
So when you pull it out of
the mold of the machine,

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.100
it will spring back to the
final shape that you want.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:30.140
So my idea was, I'll take
the shape of the sides,

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.140
and I'll over bend it by
a specific percentage.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.660
So I wrote a small
program in MATLAB,

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.640
I entered the
coordinates of the sides

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.170
by hand, that
actually took the most

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.000
time to grit it out, and
measure that, and put that in.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.940
And then I created a
program that'll basically

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.630
increase the angle
between each two vectors

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.580
by a certain percentage.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.370
And you can see
here-- I can't see,

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.280
but there's the default
is on the bottom, that's

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.070
the original side shape.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.610
And then increasing
it by 10%, 25%, 50%.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:07.910
And then we jump up to
500%, and it gets very noisy

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:13.600
just because it was
measured by hand.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.570
And the idea for me was to try
a few of these different curves

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:20.360
to see which one would give me
the closest shape when it comes

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.260
out of the bending machine.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.350
Well unfortunately,
it turned out

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:28.170
that this was useless
because every piece of wood

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.860
reacts differently to the heat.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:36.200
It springs back differently,
and basically the machine will

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.180
get you close, but not there.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.990
So you always do it
by hand at the end.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.410
It still saves time,
that's for sure.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.420
But I did have an excuse
to program a little bit,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.210
and I can show it here.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.130
So here's the open guitar
before I grew the back on.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.140
So you can see the
architecture of it.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.910
It's actually quite interesting
if you're structural engineer

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.360
to understand to see
what's going on here.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.590
A lot of it is structural.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:10.760
There's very little
unnecessary pieces in here.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.580
The fan bracing.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.950
In this picture, you see
an additional brace here,

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.630
which is called the
treble bar right here.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.690
It goes at an angle
across the fan braces.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:22.680
What it does is it
breaks the symmetry

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.000
of braces, kind of forming
it more like a piano.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.260
If you think of a piano, it has
different lengths of strings.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.910
And this is the idea here.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.110
To break the symmetry.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.240
You see all these little
blocks of wood glued

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.370
around the perimeter here.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.210
These are called tentalones.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.290
And their purpose is to attach
the sides to the soundboard.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:53.220
Each one, you pick it up with
a little needle, or tweezers.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.210
You put a couple drops
of the hide glue,

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.580
and you stick it in there.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.940
Hold it there for a few
seconds, and then you

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.350
go to the next one.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.470
And it's actually
very meditative

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.900
to do this part of the process.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.880
I really enjoy it.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.157
And a lot of people
have never seen guitars

00:40:11.157 --> 00:40:12.240
from the inside like this.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.560
It's really beautiful.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.390
And the next step of it, of
course, is to glue the back on.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.100
So that's done like this.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.550
This is a very
traditional method.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.110
Roping the back.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:29.090
So you basically
wrap rope around it.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:32.520
I found that surgical tubing
works really good here,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.360
so that's what I'm using.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.730
And you can let it dry.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.820
And once it's dry,
take off the rope,

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.500
and you have something
that looks like a guitar.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.370
Doesn't sound like a
guitar yet, though.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:49.760
Not even to me, as a builder
that can hear the wood.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.000
That's going to come after
this step, the bindings.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.720
The bindings are really, really
important for the guitar.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:02.130
They serve a structural
purpose-- or functional

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.220
purpose, I should say--
that if you can see it,

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.240
it's a strip of wood
that's glued around all

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.760
the perimeter of the guitar.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.030
It seals the end grain that
you see exposed on the back

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.370
and on the soundboard.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.480
And this is very important
with wood to seal the end grain

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.320
so it doesn't react to changes
in the weather, and humidity,

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.630
specifically.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.110
So the way they're done
is you carve a channel

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:31.090
around the corner perimeter
of the entire instrument.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.620
There are two of them, actually.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.161
There's the binding,
and then there's

00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.740
the perfling, which
is slightly smaller.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.107
And you bend them to
the shape of the guitar,

00:41:40.107 --> 00:41:41.440
and then you glue them in there.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.770
This is actually
quite a tedious,

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:48.220
a little more difficult part
in the process of building.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:53.500
And you can see here
how I'm gluing them

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.840
in with a special roping method.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.800
So I ran out of tape
one day, and this

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.750
was the method I was used
to, to just use tape.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:04.710
It's very, very simple.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.730
You just start at one end.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:10.205
You put some glue, and you
tape it on, and you keep going.

00:42:10.205 --> 00:42:12.920
But you need good tape,
you need strong tape.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.690
And I couldn't get any, it would
take me awhile to order it.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:21.730
So I built this jig which
allows me to use rope.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:23.940
And it actually gave
me a lot more control,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.810
and a lot more control on
the pressure to glue it on.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.660
So you can see
how I'm roping it,

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.900
going from one end of the
instrument to the other.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.780
And it just sits there
for a bit until it dries,

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.220
and then I can do the
other side of the guitar.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.230
Once the bindings are
done, I can shave them,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:48.450
and then I can finally hear
the quality of the instrument.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.410
The reason for this
is that the bindings,

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.490
aside from sealing
the end grain,

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.260
they actually
change the stiffness

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.040
of the joints from
the sides to the back,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.450
and the sides to the soundboard.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.980
So they release some
of that tension there.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.490
They open up the instrument.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.350
And if you tap on
the soundboard,

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.750
you can finally hear the
instrument responding

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.870
in the way it's going
to be towards the end

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:13.330
of the build process.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.330
So for me, this is one of
the most enjoyable steps.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.760
Scraping to see the beauty.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.060
You've got to cut
all these joints,

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.720
these are miters
here at the tail.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.380
We're talking about
something that's

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.120
less than two millimeters wide.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.290
And you get one shot at
cutting-- I can't see the red,

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:40.550
there it is- the miter
there with a chisel.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:44.110
And if you mess it up, that's
how it's going to show.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.310
There's not much
you can do about it.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.060
So that's the bindings.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.640
Once I'm past the
bindings, I have

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.265
a little bit of a breath out.

00:43:52.265 --> 00:43:55.020
It's like, ooh,
that was hard work.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:44:00.840
And we move on to nearly
finishing the instrument,

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.340
actually.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.810
This is the fingerboard now.

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.600
There was a piece of ebony,
it's on the floor there.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.539
I passed it around.

00:44:07.539 --> 00:44:09.330
That's what the
fingerboard is made out of.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.630
Yeah, it's the ebony.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:16.340
This is the piece right here
where we glue it on the neck,

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.350
and the frets are going
to be installed in it.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:22.570
And it needs to
be very hard wood

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:28.050
to take a lot of punishment
from the fingers.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:31.285
So here I am starting to
plane the fingerboard,

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:34.870
and that took a me
some time to learn.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:38.990
You need very good tools,
it's such hard, abrasive wood.

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:42.160
You really learn to
appreciate quality steel.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:49.030
So it becomes a joy to work
once you have good tools.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:53.770
So here you can see how
I'm gluing the fingerboard.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.690
And once it's glued, I can
start slotting for the frets,

00:44:57.690 --> 00:44:59.830
so I use a saw for that.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.900
So the frets are spaced.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.280
It's very carefully
determined, their location.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.869
If they're not
accurately spaced,

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:09.785
you're going to have
problems with intonation,

00:45:09.785 --> 00:45:12.240
and you'll never be
able to play in tune.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.420
So it's critical to
get this part right.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.140
And the frets
themselves are basically

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:21.400
pieces of nickel metal
with a tang on them.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.460
You hammer them into the
slots, you cut them flush.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.350
And then the detail
work is really

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.510
getting the leveling
of the frets down.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.420
So they're not perfectly flat.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.180
In really fine
instruments, you really

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.460
want to find a
very special bowing

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.650
in the relief for the frets.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.150
And there is some
technical stuff

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.670
in the back buzzing
of the strings,

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:52.530
and the size of the
wave of the string,

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.520
depending on what
frequency it's on.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.320
10 minutes?

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.267
You can keep going.

00:45:58.267 --> 00:45:59.350
No, it's all good, thanks.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:06.030
But here really, my
years as a player,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.390
gave me a huge advantage.

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.350
Because I could really
appreciate an instrument

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:14.420
that was done right for
the playability of it,

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.310
meaning comfort.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.820
You want to have
the strings as low

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.300
as possible without
exerting yourself too much.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.970
And the way you achieve that
is by getting this part done

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.140
right.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:32.020
So once the frets are done,
you can enjoy looking at them.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.850
And you'll notice how
they're not spaced equally.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.100
But rather, the space is
getting smaller, and smaller,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.160
and smaller, and smaller.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.330
So that's the
mathematical definition

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:51.260
of how to distance
for a 12-note scale.

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:58.960
And the last assembly
process is the bridge.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.240
On the guitar, the bridge
is called the bridge

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.270
because it's bridging the
strings to the sound board.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:07.740
It's going to
transfer the energy

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:12.270
of the vibrating strings,
and it's actually

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.140
a torque mechanism.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:19.131
It's different from the
violin, or arch top guitars.

00:47:19.131 --> 00:47:21.130
The way the bridge works
in the classical guitar

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.320
and acoustic guitars is
there's a big saddle here.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.510
And the vibrating strings,
they pull on the bridge,

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.590
and they cause it
to move like this.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.705
And imagine the
torque it applies

00:47:33.705 --> 00:47:36.360
is this kind of movement
on the soundboard.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.423
So it's not just this,
but this, more like this.

00:47:41.423 --> 00:47:43.820
The heights, the
dimensions of the bridge

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.480
are very critical in the
overall resulting instrument.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.440
So it is said that the
great Spanish makers used

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.070
to start with the
bridge, and build

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:55.950
the guitar around the bridge.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:57.620
And you got to put
a lot of thought

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.750
into how the bridge is designed.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.000
For example, the difference
between a classical guitar

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.410
bridge and a flamenco bridge.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.430
The instrument might
be exactly the same,

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.950
but if I change the bridge,
it'll cause a big difference

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.620
in the sound.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.000
So the bridge is made
out of a hard wood.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.900
In this case,
Brazilian rosewood.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.020
It's similar to Indian,
just a little bit denser.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:24.700
I get to put my
flourish on there.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.230
It's not redundant, though.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.640
You need that up there.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.280
It's called the tie
bar, because that's

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.900
where you tie the strings.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.880
And if you see those two
strips of white there,

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.990
that's made out of bone.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:38.930
That actually give
you that harness

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.690
which the strings would
eat through otherwise.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:45.670
So you need bone there
to strengthen it.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.239
Another little cute
innovation is done today.

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:51.030
I didn't invent this,
but I like to use it.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.010
It's called a 12 hole bridge.

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.790
The 12 hole bridge allows
you to feed the strings

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.740
through the bridge,
and not to have

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.570
to loop back and tie
the string on itself,

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:08.940
which would raise the angle of
the string across the saddle.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.470
It increases the torque
angle, or the break angle

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.690
on the saddle.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.480
So especially with
flamenco guitars,

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.963
it's very important to do this.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.160
All right.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.760
So the bridge, you
got to design it,

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.640
the dimensions are important.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.900
But the most important thing
is to measure its location.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.010
If you don't glue it
in the right place,

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:33.260
you're going to be screwed,
because the guitar's never

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.590
going to be in tune.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.040
So here you can
see measuring it.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.370
The distance of it is going
to determine the scale

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:41.620
length of the instrument.

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.360
650 is the standard scale
for classical guitar.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.610
You can play around with that.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:49.750
640, 660.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.780
Once you measure it and you know
exactly where it's going to be,

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.170
you glue it.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.110
And I glue it with clamps.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.710
I mentioned before,
there's a belly, or an arch

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.240
to the top of the guitar.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.757
So the bridge is actually
built with that arch to it.

00:50:05.757 --> 00:50:07.340
And when you glue
it, you want to make

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.120
sure you maintain that arch.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.200
So underneath, inside
the soundboard,

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.080
there's a piece of wood with
that arch built into it.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.500
And this is how
you the bridge on.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.210
You can see it from a
different angle here.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:25.990
And this is really the last part
of the assembly of the guitar.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:30.810
And we're not done, because
now there's the French polish.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:34.300
And a lot of times,
I will start a guitar

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.730
to build it and
finish making it,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:39.460
and then I'll
start polishing it.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.160
And by the time I
finish polishing it,

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.100
it'll be the same amount of
time as it took me to build it.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.140
The French polish process is
very, very labor intensive,

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.210
takes an incredible
amount of time.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.390
And basically,
it's the technique

00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.500
of taking shellac which
has been melted in alcohol.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.490
I described it comes from India
from the special beetle there.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.240
And you see it in the
bottles here in the picture.

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.150
The materials are very simple.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:05.530
It's shellac, you have a pad.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:09.240
A pad is just a old
piece of cotton t-shirt

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.270
with some cheesecloth
wadded into it.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:16.880
And then the other ingredients
are oil and more alcohol.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.430
And those three
ingredients and the pad

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.410
are all you need to
do French polish.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.530
The skills involved
take decades.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:29.050
And I've been doing
this for over 15 years,

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.650
and it's still
something I see myself

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.960
learning for a long time.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.870
It's one of the difficult
things to master.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.500
It's almost never done
today in any woodwork shop

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.220
except for the finest restorers.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:48.400
It was done in kings'
palaces to do fine furniture.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.390
But acoustically, it
creates the finest finish

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:56.810
for the guitar in
the way it sounds.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.130
The reason for that
is with the pad,

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.010
you're actually applying
thousands and thousands

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.160
of microscopically thin layers.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.520
It creates a very thin
but hard layer of shellac

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.110
that's built on the guitar, and
it doesn't dampen the sound.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.880
It actually makes it louder.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.480
A lot of guitars that
are sprayed with lacquer

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:23.760
from factories, it's like taking
a nice vibrating piece of wood,

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.150
and then spraying
plastic over it.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:28.930
And then that dampens the sound.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.620
It doesn't sound as good.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.870
So this is really the
reason to actually

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:37.750
invest in all that extra
hours of work to do this.

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:42.040
So here you can see a
guitar as I'm polishing it.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.734
This here is called a
pounce bag of pumice.

00:52:45.734 --> 00:52:47.650
Because the wood, if you
looked at it closely,

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.180
is full of little pores, and
you've got to fill them up.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.390
So before the French
polish, the initial step

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:53.870
is to fill the pores.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.100
And you rub pumice, it
abrades microscopic fibers.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.710
And you feed them into the
pores until they're leveled.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:06.700
Again, it's one of these things
that takes decades to master.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.750
But the beauty
you get with it is

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:15.060
unparalleled with modern
finishes, I would say.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.080
So I think I'm getting there.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.110
So here's a finished guitar.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:22.970
This guitar is a
little bit fancier.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.140
For the perflings, I did
what's called herringbone,

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:32.190
or you can call it wheat pattern
going all around the perimeter.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.390
And here's another
one that I did.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:38.220
This guitar is built with
cypress for the body.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.030
It's still a classical guitar,
it's much lighter, though.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:44.810
It's more of a traditional
styled Torres guitar.

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:48.370
And it had a strip of
Brazilian Rosewood on the back.

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:52.100
Again, slightly more
ornamented for the perflings.

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:58.980
And now we have a little treat.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.130
This is my friend, but
he's a great guitarist.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.250
He's a client of mine.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.160
Adam del Monte.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.490
He's actually living
in Los Angeles.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.900
He's a fantastic flamenco
player, and a fantastic

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.200
classical player.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.120
It's very rare to
find someone that has

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:18.240
mastered both of these fields.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.000
And he teaches down
there at USC and performs

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.320
all around the world.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.310
If you get a chance to see him,
that'd be highly recommended.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.100
I'm just going to play it,

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.100
ADAM DEL MONTE: Hi there
to everybody at Google.

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:36.240
My name is Adam Del Monte, and
I'm happily and proudly playing

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.740
two of Erez Perelman's guitars.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.690
This one is a classical
guitar, and so it

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:46.140
is designed with warmth
and sweetness in mind.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.722
And it's got plenty of it.

00:54:59.015 --> 00:55:02.770
The sound just keeps sustaining.

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:06.200
It makes you drunk, because
every sound that you play,

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.040
you want to play another one.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.500
That's the secret
of magical guitar.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.940
As soon as you
play one note, you

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.012
don't get quite enough of it,
so you need to play another one.

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.994
And another one.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.530
This is the sweetest
instrument I've ever played.

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:34.840
Expressive.

00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:58.650
As opposed to this guitar,
which is a flamenco guitar.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:01.930
And it is called a blanca,
because the back and sides are

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.090
made of cypress,
it is a white wood.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:08.280
The top is also spruce, and
it is designed for speed.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.310
So this would be your
Ferrari in the garage.

00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.150
So it's designed to have
a very fast response.

00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:39.090
It has a percussive sound.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.950
And the magic about
this guitar is

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.946
that it just melts
into your fingers

00:56:44.946 --> 00:56:46.570
and allows you to do
whatever you want.

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:47.910
Kind of like a Ferrari.

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:51.290
So Erez, you are the greatest.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.439
Thank you.

00:56:53.439 --> 00:56:54.480
EREZ PERELMAN: All right.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:01.240
Yeah, that's Adam.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.950
And that was the last slide.

00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:08.630
I want to open up to Q&amp;A now.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:13.810
If anyone is interested, I have
a website with lots more info.

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:15.593
So thank you very much.

00:57:15.593 --> 00:57:21.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.784
Please.

00:57:21.784 --> 00:57:22.700
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.595
You use the Japanese
chisels, but you

00:57:24.595 --> 00:57:28.220
use Western planes, which are
pushed rather than pulled.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.590
And I just wondered if
you tried the pulling one,

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:34.190
and if there's a difference
in the woodworking style.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.340
EREZ PERELMAN: Yeah, I
have Japanese planes, too.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.320
They're a little more
finicky to set up,

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.800
there's no adjusting
rings on them, or screws.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.230
But the steel is
definitely superior,

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:53.460
but it comes down to the
tool that does the job best.

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:56.330
And I find the Western
style adjustments allows

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:59.102
me to get there with planing.

00:57:59.102 --> 00:58:00.810
With the chisels, it's
a different story.

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:03.890
I want an edge that's going
to hold as long as possible.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.430
So I like to use the
Japanese chisels there.

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:09.130
I have Western chisels that
are great, too, depending

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.090
on the wood I'm cutting.

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:15.170
A lot of the tools are
specific for a single thing

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.510
that I'm going to use them on.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:19.340
So it's really
finding what it's for,

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.490
and then learning how to
do it the best way there.

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:24.550
AUDIENCE: So as a past
life as a researcher,

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.856
you probably spent a
lot of time thinking

00:58:26.856 --> 00:58:28.860
about how to do new
things in new ways.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.570
Have you thought about new ways
to do bracing, or double tops,

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:36.630
and all sorts of
stuff like that?

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.690
EREZ PERELMAN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:41.460
So it's interesting.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.230
When I first started
building guitar,

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:49.090
I was convinced I'm going to
invent the best guitar that

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:52.780
was ever built. And I thought
about it for a long time,

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.100
and I came up with this crazy
design called the prison

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.160
guitar.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.690
And it was crazy, it was insane.

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:02.680
It turned out beautiful,
but after years, and years,

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.320
and years, I realized respecting
the tradition, the centuries

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.690
that people tried different
things and what survived,

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.580
there's a lot of things
to learn from that.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.930
Today, there are double tops.

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:19.360
Double tops are guitars that are
designed with volume in mind.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.980
Basically, you take
the soundboard,

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.760
which is a two millimeter
thick piece of wood.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.790
And how do you make
it even lighter?

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:29.610
So what they do is they
hollow it out and stick

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:33.600
something synthetic, it's called
Nomex, in a honeycomb fashion.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.210
This is coming from aeronautical
and space engineering.

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:43.240
You can cut that the weight by
half, get a much louder guitar.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:46.330
And I've done it, I've
experimented with that.

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.100
But I believe the
quality of sound

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:53.630
is compromised with
that kind of guitar.

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.170
I'm a very strong
believer in the solid wood

00:59:56.170 --> 00:59:58.327
traditional style of instrument.

00:59:58.327 --> 00:59:59.910
I do I have two
pictures here, though,

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:01.900
to show some innovation
that has been

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.770
done with traditional guitars.

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.670
These are still
traditional guitars.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.600
So on the left, you see a
guitar with a hole in the side.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.080
It's crazy, but it's very
popular today amongst players.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.840
It's called a sound port.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.990
What it does is it gives the
player a bit of that sound.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.170
It's throwing it in their face.

01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:24.700
And this is especially
important for people

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.970
who are playing with a
big orchestra behind them,

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:29.460
or if you're playing
with an accompaniment.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.350
A few people.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:32.900
And then you really
want to hear yourself,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.400
so this really gives
you that ability.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.890
Additionally, it's hard
to make out in that photo.

01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:41.050
It's an elevated fingerboard.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:44.800
The fingerboard is raised
above the sound board

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.670
to give you a lot more
access to the higher notes.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.760
It makes it an
ergonomic feature,

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.450
more comfortable
to play up high.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:58.720
The guitar you see on the right
side is a incredible guitar,

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.390
it's called a Brahms guitar.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:04.610
One of my favorite players
ever is called Paul Galbraith.

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:09.380
And he developed this guitar
with the late luthier David

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.430
Rubio from England.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:12.980
It's essentially
a guitar that has

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:17.280
fanned frets where every string
has a different scale length.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.811
If you notice that the bridge
and the nut are different

01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:21.310
angles.

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.280
So the bass and the trebles
have different lengths.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.250
And I had to write a
program to compute the scale

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:31.080
lengths on this guitar, too.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.570
What's incredible and special
about this instrument,

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:38.360
normally when you have more
than six strings on a guitar,

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.992
it's extra basses.

01:01:39.992 --> 01:01:42.200
So you add basses, basses,
basses, and it's very easy

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.810
to control them with the thumb.

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.790
It doesn't open up a lot of
the range of the instrument.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.710
On this guitar, you
actually add a treble.

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.925
So there's one extra
treble, and one extra bass.

01:01:51.925 --> 01:01:54.190
So it's opening it
up from both sides.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.470
It opens up a whole
new body of music

01:01:56.470 --> 01:02:00.640
that couldn't be played on the
guitar before to be played.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.525
It is a difficult
instrument to play.

01:02:02.525 --> 01:02:04.550
You play it upright
like a cello,

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.520
it has an end pin that
goes in the floor.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.320
So to answer your
question, there

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.250
is experimentation
within tradition.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.360
And today, I continue
experimenting.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.320
But my experiments
are much more focused

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.070
on tenth of a millimeter thing.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:24.460
Very, very fine adjustments.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.040
Where I'm looking for something
very consistent, but to improve

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.700
it and finding
which way to wiggle

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.760
the curve to achieve finer
and finer instruments.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.880
Also to a lesser extent,
but just as important,

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.490
I have clients
with special needs.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.540
For example, clients
that have injuries

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.740
in their backs or shoulders.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:49.020
And one of them asked for
an adjustable support system

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.090
with a guitar that
could lay on the floor,

01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:54.170
and could be angled and
raised to any angles.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.390
You can even stand with it.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:58.590
So here I built him
a special support

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.750
system out of a monopod.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.110
Basically like a camera monopod.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:10.750
And that's one of the
benefits of-- you're

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.755
building every guitar
for the client,

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:15.130
and it might encompass something
like this in the support

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.710
systems, too, specifically
for their needs.

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.920
I don't do a cookie
cutter approach

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.750
where everything is exactly
the same, take it or leave it.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.470
So it's a very feedback
oriented process.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:33.190
And the research is done within
a very controlled manner.

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.160
AUDIENCE: Did you get a
chance to look at the work

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.390
that Adrian Houtsma
did-- like in 1975,

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:43.564
80-- on guitar acoustics?

01:03:43.564 --> 01:03:45.230
EREZ PERELMAN: The
name sounds familiar.

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:48.120
I used to read a lot of
the-- is it GAO publications?

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.610
Did he do the round bracing?

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:56.320
The circle bracing?

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.760
AUDIENCE: The bridge support.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.220
EREZ PERELMAN: Bridge support.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.110
AUDIENCE: It was
basically, you can

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:05.420
make the face a
little thinner if you

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.450
prevent the bridge from rotating
with a separate support.

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.750
EREZ PERELMAN: Yeah.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:12.110
Specifically, no, I don't
remember his research.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:16.620
But every builder
researches to some extent.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.470
A lot more here in
America, for some reason.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:21.180
It's the land of cowboys here.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.490
And it's very interesting to
see what people are doing.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:31.550
Again, I'm a very strong
proponent of the traditional

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:36.470
build, for the special reason
that I had the opportunity

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:38.890
to play those guitars
made by Torres.

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.620
This is a very rare opportunity.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:44.980
If anyone plays guitar
here and they have a chance

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.670
to play a historic instrument,
the sound is really magical.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:52.140
And it's impossible to
portray it on recording.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.060
You really have to try
it out to appreciate it.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.620
So I'm open minded, I'm
always considering new things.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.240
But to me, the
ideal sound is still

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.850
coming from that
traditional design.

01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.590
And I'll always look for better.

01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:11.114
But right now, that's
the ideal for me.

01:05:11.114 --> 01:05:13.030
AUDIENCE: If it's public,
how many instruments

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.316
do you build it every year?

01:05:15.316 --> 01:05:16.940
EREZ PERELMAN: Sure,
it's very limited.

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:20.840
Each guitar takes me
over a month to build.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:25.180
So I'm building around
10 to 12 guitars.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:30.350
And this is generally the
output of luthiers doing guitars

01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:36.210
at the top level without trying
to expand and scale the shop

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:39.100
with helpers, or big machines.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.100
So I'm not trying to
build more guitars,

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.630
I'm trying to improve
the quality of each one.

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:46.350
And the French
polish, as I said,

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:50.560
that takes a huge amount of
time in the build process.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.560
So that limits how many
guitars you can make.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.410
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you guys.
