00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.500
I believe that from developers, we can 
expect them to have a great comprehension capacity

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.200
and of the problems of each of
our societies

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.000
and that they put that Latin spice
to find a solution

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.800
with, probably, the smallest number of 
tools and resources available

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.500
I think that our main aspiration is that
they [developers] dare to think outside the box

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
without capitulating on the focus and vision
to solve incredibly complex problems

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.300
such as mobility or waste treatment

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.500
Tools such as Google Maps or the Cloud Platform
other tools as the hundreds of APIs

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.200
that run on the Google infrastructure. Are absolutely
essential for those entrepreneurs that just start

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.200
they gave us the platform, to not have to 
worry about the things that we have to worry about in the past

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.500
probably 10 to 15 years ago, now they are solved

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.700
We can mount our talents on top of those platforms
And let imagination run

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
I believe that the biggest challenge, for participants
and the teams in general

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:39.800
will be that capacity to assemble in just a few hours
and run behind the same objective
