Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.830
do some legitimate comp. civ., for those of
you into that kind of thing. Stan, I can’t

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.849
help but feel that we have perhaps too many
globes. That’s better.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.340
Today we’re going to learn about the horrible
totalitarian Persians and the saintly, democracy-loving

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.060
Greeks. But of course we already know this
story — there were some wars in which no

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.550
one wore any shirts, and everyone was reasonably
fit. The Persians were bad; the Greeks were

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
good. Socrates and Plato were awesome; the
Persians didn’t even philosophize. The West

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.310
is the Best; Go Team! Yeah, well, no.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:39.640
[theme music]

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.740
Let’s start with the Persian empire, which
became the model for pretty much all land-based

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.530
empires throughout the world. Except for — wait
for it — the Mongols. [Mongoltage]

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.220
Much of what we know about the Persians and
their empire comes from an outsider writing

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.210
about them, which is something we now call
history, and one of the first true historians

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.600
was Herodotus, whose famous book The Persian
Wars talks about the Persians quite a bit.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.650
Now the fact that Herodotus was a Greek is
important because it introduces us to the

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.900
idea of historical bias. But more on that
in a second.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.820
So the Persian Achaemenid dynasty... Achaemenid?
Hold on...

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.880
HowJSay: AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.160
They’re both right? I was right twice!?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.460
Right, so the Persian AkEEmenid or AkEHmenid
dynasty was founded in 539 BCE by King Cyrus

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.540
the Great. Cyrus took his nomadic warriors
and conquered most of Mesopotamia, including

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.370
the Babylonians, which ended a sad period
in Jewish history called The Babylonian Exile,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.250
thus ensuring that Cyrus got great press in
the Bible.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.290
But his son, Darius the First, was even greater,
he extended Persian control east to our old

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.020
friend the Indus Valley, west to our new friend
Egypt, and north to Crash Course newcomer

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.480
Anatolia. By the way, there were Greeks in Anatolia
called Ionian Greeks who will become relevant shortly.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.620
So even if you weren’t Persian, the Persian
Empire was pretty dreamy. For one thing, the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.820
Persians ruled with a light touch, like, conquered
kingdoms were allowed to keep their kings

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.020
and their elites as long as they pledged allegiance
to the Persian King and paid taxes, which

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.950
is why the Persian king was known as The King
of Kings.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.770
Plus, taxes weren’t too high, and the Persians
improved infrastructure with better roads

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.920
and they had this pony express-like mail service
of which Herodotus said: “...they are stayed

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.460
neither by snow nor rain nor heat nor darkness from
accomplishing their appointed course with all speed.”

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.519
And the Persians embraced freedom of religion.
Like they were Zoroastrian, which has a claim

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.040
to being the world’s first monotheistic
religion. It was really Zoroastrianism that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.549
introduced to the good/evil dualism we all
know so well. You know: god and Satan, or

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.840
Harry and Voldemort... But the Persians weren’t
very concerned about converting people of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.299
the empire to their faith. Plus, Zoroastrianism
forbid slavery, and so slavery was almost

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.079
unheard of in the Persian Empire.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.120
All in all, if you had to live in the 5th
century BCE, the Persian Empire was probably

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.719
the best place to do it. Unless, that is,
you believe Herodotus and the Greeks. We all

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.999
know about the Greeks: architecture, philosophy,
literature. The very word music comes from

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.370
Greek, as does so much else in contemporary
culture. Greek poets and mathematicians playwrights

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.010
and architects and philosophers founded a
culture we still identify with. And they introduced

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.040
us to many ideas, from democracy to fart jokes. And the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.700
Greeks gave the west our first dedicated history,
they gave us our vocabulary for talking about politics.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.359
Plus they gifted us our idealization of democracy,
which comes from the government they had in Athens.

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.969
Past John: Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green,
Mr. Green — did you say fart jokes?

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.969
Present John: Uhh. You don’t ask about Doric,
Ionian, or Corinthian columns. You don’t

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.389
ask about Plato’s allegory of the cave.
It’s all scatological humor with you — It’s

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.589
time for the open letter? Really? Already?
Alright.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.480
An open letter [the whoopee cushion sounds]...
Stan! To Aristophanes. Dear Aristophanes...

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.080
Oh right, I have to check the secret compartment.
Stan, what... oh. Thank you, Stan. It’s

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.299
fake dog poo. How thoughtful.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.299
So, good news and bad news, Aristophanes.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.859
2,300 years after your death — this is the
good news — you’re still a reasonably

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.829
famous. Only eleven of your forty plays survived,
but even so, you’re called the Father of

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.529
Comedy; there are scholars devoted to your
work.

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.029
Now, the bad news: Even though your plays
are well-translated and absolutely hilarious,

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.279
students don’t like to read them in schools.
There always like, why do we gotta read this

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.370
boring crap? And this must be particularly
galling to you, because so much of what you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.409
did in your career was make fun of boring
crap, specifically in the form of theatrical

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.330
tragedies. Plus, you frequently used actual
crap to make jokes. Such as when you had the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.470
chorus in The Acharnians imagining a character
in your play throwing crap at a real poet you didn’t like.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.870
You, Aristophanes, who wrote that under every
stone lurks a politician, who called wealth

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.620
the most excellent of all the gods... You,
who are responsible for the following conversation:

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.930
"Praxagora: I want all to have a share of
everything and everything to be in common;

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.319
there will no longer be either rich or poor;
[...] I shall begin by making land, money,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.030
everything that is private property, common
to all. [...]

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.569
Blepyrus: But who will till the soil?

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.449
Praxagora: The slaves.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.460
Blepyrus: Oh."

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.710
And yet you’re seen as homework! Drudgery!
That, my friend, is a true tragedy. On the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.790
upside, we did take care of slavery. It only
took us two thousand years.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.569
Best wishes,
John Green

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.629
When we think about the high point of Greek
culture, exemplified by the Parthenon and

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.930
the plays of Aeschylus, what we’re really
thinking about is Athens in the fourth century

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.449
BCE, right after the Persian Wars. But Greece
was way more than Athens; Greeks lived in

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.610
city-states which consisted of a city and
its surrounding area. Most of these city-states

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.750
featured at least some form of slavery, and in all
of them citizenship was limited to males. Sorry ladies...

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.860
Also, each of the city-states had its own
form of government, ranging from very democratic

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.680
— unless you were a woman or a slave — to
completely dictatorial. And the people who

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680
lived in these cities considered themselves
citizens of that city, not of anything that

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.280
would ever be called Greece. At least until
the Persian wars.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.990
So between 490 and 480 BCE, the Persians made
war on the Greek City states. This was the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.430
war that featured the battle of Thermopylae
where three hundred brave Spartans battled

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.330
— if you believe Herodotus — five million
Persians.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.550
And also the battle of Marathon, which is
a plain about 26.2 miles away from Athens.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.780
The whole war started because Athens supported
those aforementioned Ionian Greeks when they

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.439
were rebelling in Anatolia against the Persians.
That made the Persian king Xerxes mad, so

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:15.080
he led two major campaigns against the Athenians,
and the Athenians enlisted the help of all

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.120
the other Greek city-states. And in the wake
of that shared Greek victory, the Greeks began

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.340
to see themselves as Greeks, rather than as
Spartans, or Athenians or whatever.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.710
And then Athens emerged as the de facto capital
of Greece and then got to experience a Golden

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.990
Age, which is something that historians make
up. But a lot of great things did happen during

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.909
the Golden Age, including the Parthenon, a
temple that became a church and then a mosque

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.610
and then an armory until finally settling
into its current gig as a ruin.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.909
You also had statesmen like Pericles, whose
famous funeral oration brags about the golden

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:47.599
democracy of Athens with rhetoric that wouldn’t
sound out of place today. “If we look to

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.979
the laws, they afford equal justice to all
in their private differences... if a man is

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.430
able to serve the state, he is not hindered
by the obscurity of his condition.”

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.849
When you combine that high-minded rhetoric
with the undeniable power and beauty of the

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:06.219
art and philosophy that was created in ancient
Athens, it’s not hard to see it as the foundation

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.759
of Western civilization. And if you buy into
this, you have to be glad that the Greeks

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.740
won the Persian Wars. But even if you put
aside the slavery and other injustices in

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.139
Greek society, there’s still trouble.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.719
Do I have to say it, seriously? FINE. TROUBLE
RIGHT HERE IN RIVER CITY WITH A CAPITAL T

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:21.629
AND THAT RHYMES WITH P AND THAT STANDS FOR
PELOPONNESE.

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:26.280
Pericles’s funeral oration comes from a
later war, The Peloponnesian War, a thirty

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.129
year conflict between the Athenians and the
Spartans. The Spartans did not embrace democracy

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:38.150
but instead embraced a kingship that functioned
only because of a huge class of brutally mistreated

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.629
slaves. But to be clear, the war was not about
Athens trying to get Sparta to embrace democratic

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:48.029
reform; wars rarely are. It was about resources
and power. And the Athenians were hardly saintly

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:52.240
in all of this, as evidenced by the famous
Melian Dialogue. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.460
So in one of the most famous passages of Thucydides’
history of the Peloponnesian War, the Athenians

00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:01.909
sailed to the island of Melos, a Spartan colony,
and demanded that the Melians submit to Athenian

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.729
rule. The Melians pointed out that they’d
never actually fought with the Spartans and

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:09.090
were like, “Listen, if it’s all the same
to you, we’d like to go Switzerland on this

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.520
one,” except of course they didn’t say
that because there was no Switzerland.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.099
To which the Athenians responded, and here
I am quoting directly, “The strong do what

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:20.270
they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.770
Needless to say, this is not a terribly democratic
or enlightened position to take. This statement,

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:30.849
in fact, is sometimes seen as the first explicit
endorsement of the so-called theory of Realism

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:35.380
in international relations. For realists,
interaction between nations, or peoples, or

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:41.150
cultures is all about who has the power. Whoever
has it can compel whoever doesn’t have it

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.070
to do pretty much anything.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:48.080
So what did the meritocratic and democratic
Athenians do when the Melians politely asked

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:54.600
not to participate in the fight? They killed all the
Melian men and enslaved all the women and children.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.000
So, yes, Socrates gave us his interrogative
Method; Sophocles gave us Oedipus; but the

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.060
legacy of Ancient Greece is profoundly ambiguous,
all the moreso because the final winner of

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.080
the Peloponnesian War were the dictatorial Spartans.
Thanks for the incredible bummer, Thought Bubble.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.840
So here’s a non-rhetorical question: Did
the right side win the Persian wars?

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.440
Most classicists and defenders of the Western
Tradition will tell you that of course we

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.780
should be glad the Greeks won. After all,
winning the Persian war set off the cultural

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.980
flourishing that gave us the Classical Age.
And plus, if the Persians had won with their

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:30.110
monarchy that might have strangled democracy
in its crib and given us more one-man rule.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.710
And that’s possible, but as a counter that
argument, let’s consider three things:

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.960
First, it’s worth remembering that life
under the Persians was pretty good, and if

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.090
you look at the last five thousand years of
human history, you’ll find a lot more successful

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.340
and stable empires than you will democracies.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.070
Second, life under the Athenians wasn’t
so awesome, particularly if you were a woman

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:52.900
or a slave, and their government was notoriously
corrupt. And ultimately the Athenian government

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.480
derived its power not from its citizens, but
from the imperialist belief that Might Makes

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.330
Right. It’s true that Athens gave us Socrates,
but let me remind you, they also killed him.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.100
Well, I mean they forced him to commit suicide.
Whatever, Herodotus, you’re not the only

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.030
one here who can engage in historical bias.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.140
And lastly, under Persian rule the Greeks
might have avoided the Peloponnesian War,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.340
which ended up weakening the Greek city-states
so much that Alexander “Coming Soon” the

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.770
Great’s father was able to conquer all of
them, and then there were a bunch of bloody

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.140
wars with the Persians and all kinds of horrible
things, and Greece wouldn’t glimpse democracy

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.740
again for two millennia. All of which might
have been avoided if they’d just let themselves

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.660
get beaten by the Persians.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.720
All of which forces us to return to the core
question of human history: What’s the point

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.060
of being alive? I’ve got good news for you,
guy. You’re only going to have to worry

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.310
about it for about 8 more seconds. Should
we try to ensure the longest, healthiest,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:46.140
and most productive lives for humans? If so,
it’s easy to argue that Greece should have

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.830
lost the Persian Wars. But perhaps lives are
to be lived in pursuit of some great ideal

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:57.020
worth sacrificing endlessly for. And if so,
maybe the glory of Athens still shines, however dimly.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.880
Those are the real questions of history: What’s
the point of being alive? How should we organize

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.330
ourselves, what should we seek from this life?
Those aren’t easy questions, but we’ll

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.130
take another crack at them next week when
we talk about the Buddha. I’ll see you then.
