00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000
Good morning everybody.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.800
Iím Judy Singer,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.314
I'm the Senior Vice Provost for

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:04.635
Faculty Development
and Diversity,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.698
And I want to welcome
everybody here

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.423
to a university conversation
about mentoring

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:14.417
We see this as a unique opportunity
to bring together,

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:16.857
several different types of
groups of people

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:19.283
who donít normally cross paths.

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.320
So, one particular
feature of this event

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.260
is that itís across the university

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.100
We have people from
the Longwood area

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:27.223
who are both medical school

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.532
and the school public health
who are here,

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:30.887
and we have people from all across

00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:32.392
the Cambridge campus joining us.

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:36.421
This conversation was also designed
to be a cross-cohort,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.197
so we have both distinguished
senior mentors

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.190
and senior faculty who
want to learn

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.241
more about mentoring

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.890
and what they can do,

00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:45.640
as well as some tender
track faculty

00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:47.668
who are hopefully,

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.244
willing to share with us
their perspectives

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:51.557
on what would be helpful.

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.310
One of the things you
learn when you

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:54.564
start to think about mentoring

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:57.370
is the people who want to be helpful

00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:59.103
donít actually know what it is

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.759
that they can be doing to be helpful

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.323
and weíre hoping that
this conversation will stimulate ideas.

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:07.144
I want to say a few words

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:08.520
about why weíre focusing on mentoring.

00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.273
This is actually the first of three

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:11.885
faculty development events

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:13.343
weíre holding over the
next few weeks

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:14.462
The other two are focusing

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:17.151
on book publishing
and media training:

00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:18.660
learning how to talk to reporters

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.786
and people in the media.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:21.237
Weíre starting out with mentoring

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.372
because we are using that to focus

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:26.743
on the renewed commitment
of the university

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:29.071
to a tenure track system

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.822
and thatís something thatís a C-change
from the old Harvard

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.990
I was at a conference last week
down in Washington

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.573
and I saw a faculty member

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.974
who is now at the
University of Michigan,

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.899
who used to be a faculty member

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.012
at one of our professional schools,

00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:44.850
who we tried to keep but who left

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:46.974
And I asked how things were going

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:49.218
and whether we could possibly
lure him back

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:52.541
and he said, ìWell, where
I am is much better.

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.772
It was much better for junior faculty."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.606
And I said, "Well no, Harvard has a
tenure track system now."

00:01:58.195 --> 00:01:59.655
And he said, "What happened
to the eight-year

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.355
Post Docs they used to give people?"

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:06.228
We actually see this as a commitment

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:08.857
to the development of people that we hire,

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:11.604
that we hope to be promoting up
through the ranks.

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:13.397
And we need mentoring programs

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.827
because if we actually commit to
this kind of system,

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:20.619
we need to make sure that our tenure track
faculty can succeed

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:22.198
as they move up the ladder.

00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:24.185
In my own career,

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:26.747
mentoring has been keenly important.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:28.348
In fact as I walk into the faculty club,

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.153
I am always reminded of
my first encouters here

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.186
which were breakfast

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.476
with my graduate school thesis adviser,
Fred Marstellar.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.036
And we would meet for breakfast
in the main dining room

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:43.310
at the ungodly hour of seven oíclock,

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:44.880
which to me was likeó

00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:46.467
I coudn't believe it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.283
But Fred would very kindly
take me aside

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:51.824
and sort of talk to me about

00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:53.576
my own professional development.

00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.907
when i was hired

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.092
I actually knew I didnít want
to be a professor

00:02:57.755 --> 00:03:00.817
because of the way I saw Junior Faculty

00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:02.959
and the Harvard Statistics department
being treated.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.227
In fact the department has
just tenured last year,

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.459
its first person from within
in about 45 years,

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.651
just to recognize the kind of C-change.

00:03:12.697 --> 00:03:13.819
But I saw Junior Faculty

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:19.088
and they were treated like
rotating day laborers

00:03:19.307 --> 00:03:21.694
and it just didnít make a
very attractive career.

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:23.607
The reason I ended up going
into academia

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:26.403
was because of mentors for people
who took me aside

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.852
and said, ìJudy, youíd be really
good at this.

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.407
You donít really understand
as a graduate student

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.425
what life as a faculty member is like

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:35.055
and so why donít you applyî

00:03:35.076 --> 00:03:36.674
in fact for the only job I ever applied

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:37.674
was an Assistant Professor

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:38.963
at the Graduate School of Education,

00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:41.526
where my faculty position is now.

00:03:41.664 --> 00:03:43.296
And there too I was fortunate enough

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.573
to have mentors who really helped me

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:46.856
and helped me understand.

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:48.038
And that was at a time when there were

00:03:48.182 --> 00:03:49.513
very few women at the university.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.166
Pat Graham was my dean

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:54.529
and she was the first woman dean
at the university,

00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:56.716
appointed in 1981 by
President Bach

00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:58.866
She was the thirteenth female

00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:01.083
tenured faculty member at the university.

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:03.095
I mean, people used to know their number,

00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:04.512
just to put it in perspective.

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:06.959
And when she joined the faculty

00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:08.187
and came to the faculty club,

00:04:08.592 --> 00:04:09.659
she had to go in through back door

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:11.139
because that's where women went

00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:14.844
I tell those anecdotes just to say
that this is a new Harvard,

00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:18.861
or as Martin Minot said in a recent
interview in the New York Times

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.921
about Harvard five years

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:24.062
after Larry Summers infamous
comment on women and science:

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.860
ìThis is not your fatherís Harvard.î

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.379
And what I hope today

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.418
is we can actually have a
conversation about

00:04:30.573 --> 00:04:33.346
how Harvard can support all faculty

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:35.187
in their professional development.

00:04:35.452 --> 00:04:38.769
So with that, Iím going to turn it
over to my colleague,

00:04:38.914 --> 00:04:42.077
Ms. Cariaga-Lo, Assistant Provost for
Faculty Development and Diversity,

00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:43.881
whoíll do some housekeeping matters

00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:46.074
and also introduce our distinguished panel.

00:04:46.113 --> 00:04:47.113
Thank you very much.

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:54.018
Good morning everyone

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.146
and thank you all for coming
this morning.

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:58.176
We are so delighted with with the response

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.281
that we got when we sent out
the mentoring invitation

00:05:01.422 --> 00:05:03.863
In fact, the response was so large

00:05:04.023 --> 00:05:07.224
that we were unfortunately unable
to meet everybodyís needs

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.048
and so we actually had to turn
away some people.

00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:12.301
But we hope to have additional
conversations

00:05:12.305 --> 00:05:14.950
around mentoring at the various
schools very soon.

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:17.133
Just a few housekeeping notes:

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.401
So, you all received a packet.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:26.785
The green packets are actually
Sciences packets,

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:29.415
so the articles are slightly different.

00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:37.314
The purple is a Humanities and
Social Sciences packet

00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:40.956
and the only real difference is really
the research articles

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
that weíve included in there

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.932
to help you think about mentoring

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:46.755
from the perspective of
your disciplines

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.797
and fields. In addition, in the packet,

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:51.802
we provided some tools

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:55.057
that we hope will help you think
about mentoring,

00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:58.699
not just for faculty in your
department

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.391
but also thinking about mentoring
in different perspectives

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.248
and through various opportunities

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:07.628
that you might find yourself in,

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.134
whether itís working with
young faculty

00:06:10.317 --> 00:06:12.539
or working with trainees

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:15.169
or working with students

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.370
So, I hope that you find that useful.

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:18.285
In addition,

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:20.872
as you think about mentoring
in your departments,

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:27.729
we do hope that you will allow
us to assist you as needed.

00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:33.534
If you are thinking about developing
mentoring programs

00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:36.126
in particular for your tenure
track faculty,

00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:39.116
we have some wonderful
experts in the room

00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:42.404
and I hope that you will
use them today

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:43.603
but also beyond that,

00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:44.797
to be in touch with them

00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.181
as you begin to think about developing

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.806
mentoring programs for your faculty.

00:06:51.526 --> 00:06:53.798
Today we are very honored actually,

00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:57.908
to have in our midst leadership
from the schools,

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:01.626
four individuals who actually
have been instrumental

00:07:01.962 --> 00:07:05.747
to developing mentoring activities
at the various schools.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.300
And I am honored to have them
come with us today,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:15.228
some of them just flying in early this
morning from Chicago,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.901
John Reid and others

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:22.103
who are also just running in
and out of meetings.

00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:23.356
So, we are grateful to them

00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:25.011
for taking the time to come here.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.944
Our four panelists this morning,

00:07:27.144 --> 00:07:29.535

and Dean Reede and then
Professor Lamont

00:08:31.955 --> 00:08:38.857
Sure. So, Iím glad to see so many people
here interested in mentoring.

00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:42.683
So, I was asked by Judy to talk a little bit

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.987
about my own personal experiences

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:48.445
and what Iíve done at the School of
Engineering and Applied Sciences,

00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:50.317
which we call SEAS.

00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:53.153
So first off,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.340
Iíve been here at Harvard
for exactly six months,

00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:00.978
so I donít know Harvard that much

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:02.565
but Iím learning a lot about it.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:10.087
And I have been having lunches
with the tenure track faculty

00:09:10.334 --> 00:09:11.334
at the School of Engineering

00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:12.495
Weíre a growing school

00:09:13.077 --> 00:09:17.373
and so we actually are hiring quite a fewó

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:22.776
by that I mean,
we have only 70 FTE facultyó

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:27.796
and weíre hiring in
proportion to that,

00:09:28.363 --> 00:09:30.116
quite a few people.

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:39.026
And so Engineering is
moderately new at Harvard,

00:09:39.353 --> 00:09:39.959
that is to say,

00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:42.554
itís been around for hundreds of years

00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:47.389
but it's a brand new school since 2007

00:09:48.974 --> 00:09:56.492
and so itís the last school

00:09:57.896 --> 00:10:01.629
and the first in 70 years
that is a new school in Harvard.

00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:05.606
And so weíre kind of getting
ourselves together as:

00:10:05.943 --> 00:10:08.459
what is this school going to be?

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:09.925
So, let me first talk a little bit about

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:11.850
my personal experience
with mentoring.

00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:17.183
So, I went to MIT,
got a PhD in Physics

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.709
and was recruited by
Bell Laboratories

00:10:20.982 --> 00:10:22.573
and went to Bell Laboratories

00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:26.957
just immediately after
graduate school.

00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:30.484
And my first week at
Bell Laboratories,

00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:32.795
I had an anti-mentoring
experience.

00:10:34.774 --> 00:10:36.806
Someone from the department
came in and said,

00:10:36.982 --> 00:10:38.527
ìSo youíre here. What are
you going to do?î

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:43.059
And so I said, ìHereís the kind of
stuff I was planning on doing.

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:44.706
Iím going to set up these
experiments.î

00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:45.914
This is what I told people.

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.036
And the reaction of this
person was,

00:10:49.206 --> 00:10:50.538
ìWell, youíre never going
to survive here.î

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:55.903
So, that was my anti-mentoring
experience,

00:10:56.136 --> 00:10:59.455
which I did not consider
to be very positive.

00:11:01.068 --> 00:11:02.068
and when I became

00:11:06.255 --> 00:11:08.267
I got on the leadership council,

00:11:08.555 --> 00:11:10.635
which is very much like the
faculty council here.

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:15.318
I actually went around to all
of the new members

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.902
ot technical staff in the
research area

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.731
and asked them,

00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:20.038
"Would you like a mentor?"

00:11:20.923 --> 00:11:22.487
And 100% of them,

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:24.803
whether they are male, female,

00:11:25.099 --> 00:11:27.284
under-represented,
didnít matter, said yes.

00:11:27.823 --> 00:11:30.671
And so I set up a mentoring
program at Bell Labs

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:34.950
which actually worked quite well.

00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:40.565
Then as I got up higher in
management there,

00:11:42.025 --> 00:11:44.167
I was assigned a formal mentor

00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.409
who was the head of a business unit,

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.951
which I found to be extremely useful

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:51.394
when I was a department head,

00:11:51.672 --> 00:11:53.526
which is like the third
level of management

00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.382
Bell Labs did not do very well

00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:05.748
until we actually put in a mentoring
program for the young people

00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:08.000
but by the time you got
in to management,

00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:09.392
they did extremely well.

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:13.057
So when I arrived at Harvard,

00:12:13.674 --> 00:12:17.155
I discovered that we did not have
a mentoring program.

00:12:17.395 --> 00:12:21.241
That is to say we had an informal
mentoring program,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.679
where the former dean had said,

00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:27.636
ìWhy donít you go mentor
this person too?î

00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:29.365
But the person didnít know

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:32.117
they were being mentored
and it was quite...

00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:38.073
So, what I set up is mentoring
networks which isó

00:12:38.822 --> 00:12:40.374
we donít have departments
in the school

00:12:40.558 --> 00:12:43.184
so I had to assign an associate dean

00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:45.396
to each tenure track faculty member

00:12:45.549 --> 00:12:47.670
so nobody fell between the cracks,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:50.848
and then they are in charge of a

00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:54.494
mentoring developmental
committee

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:59.300
So, we all sat together as
associate deans

00:13:00.703 --> 00:13:02.857
and suggested names of people

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.908
for each of the tenure track faculty

00:13:07.363 --> 00:13:13.149
and then the associate dean

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.801
sits with the tenure track faculty
member and asks,

00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:20.570
ìWhich of these people
would you like?

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.519
Are you thinking of someone else
as your formal mentors?î

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:28.976
So, three or four people are
on this mentoring committee,

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:33.622
and I have a meeting every quarter
with the associate deans,

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.648
with the chairs of these mentoring

00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:37.319
committees to see how
people are doing.

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:41.236
So Michele asked me today,

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.362
ìHow is this going?î

00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:44.757
And actually itís going very well

00:13:44.891 --> 00:13:51.268
except some of the tenure track
faculty were on leave,

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:52.487
either maternity leave

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.213
or some other leave

00:13:55.588 --> 00:13:59.650
and they kind of fell between
the cracks.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:01.019
That is to say,

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:02.214
all of the associate deans

00:14:02.703 --> 00:14:03.424
at the very beginning

00:14:04.082 --> 00:14:05.995
went out when I asked them to,

00:14:07.941 --> 00:14:10.780
to talk to their tenure
track faculty

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.635
but the ones who werenít there
at the time,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.738
they kind of forgot about it.

00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:18.745
So, I reminded the associate
deans again.

00:14:19.243 --> 00:14:21.201
And now Iím having lunches

00:14:21.504 --> 00:14:22.728
with the tenure track faculty

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.079
and asking them how itís going,

00:14:25.412 --> 00:14:26.983
and I think it's going
a whole lot better.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.808
So, I guess the story line about this

00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:33.122
is keep following up

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.003
if youíre setting up a
mentoring program,

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:38.034
keep following up with
both the mentors

00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:39.835
and the mentees to make sure
itís working.

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:41.478
Thanks.

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:53.137
Good morning to everyone.

00:14:53.344 --> 00:14:54.344
My name is Julio Frenk.

00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:57.198
I have been Dean of the

00:14:57.366 --> 00:14:58.024
Harvard School of
Public Health

00:14:58.947 --> 00:15:01.811
for twice the amount
as Cherry,

00:15:02.454 --> 00:15:05.039
for about a year.

00:15:06.108 --> 00:15:08.381
So you have the table here
of new deans,

00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:10.211
at least on this side of the table.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:12.954
But thank you very much
for inviting me

00:15:13.452 --> 00:15:14.677
because mentoring is really

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.006
a topic that is very,

00:15:16.613 --> 00:15:17.613
very near and dear to
my heart,

00:15:17.775 --> 00:15:20.589
probably stemming
from the opposite:

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.218
a very, very fundamental

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:24.938
mentoring relationship
I developed,

00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:26.483
first as a graduate student

00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:28.793
and then as a junior
faculty member

00:15:30.213 --> 00:15:31.916
with Avedis Donabedian

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.138
who was actually a graduate

00:15:33.283 --> 00:15:34.456
of the Harvard School of
Public Health

00:15:35.532 --> 00:15:37.144
And I went to the

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:37.772
University of Michigan

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:38.709
to study with him

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:39.819
and under him

00:15:40.455 --> 00:15:43.721
and then I joined the faculty
with him.

00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:46.469
And I think it was probably

00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:49.223
not just one of the most
informative

00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:50.350
but one of the most

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.133
formative experiences
of my life.

00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:54.942
So, I think having benefited

00:15:55.104 --> 00:15:57.469
from what a good mentoring
relationship is,

00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.919
Iím a strong believer in that,

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:06.018
because academia is

00:16:06.138 --> 00:16:07.452
a highly competitive
environment

00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:10.267
and it is not obvious,

00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:11.886
even after having been

00:16:12.006 --> 00:16:13.153
there in the student role,

00:16:13.315 --> 00:16:15.267
how to navigate those waters

00:16:15.627 --> 00:16:18.288
without the sort of very,

00:16:18.474 --> 00:16:19.980
very personal guidance.

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:23.319
Fortunately, the Harvard School
of Public Health

00:16:23.448 --> 00:16:25.516
has had a long tradition of

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:27.013
emphasizing mentoring,

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.305
particularly my predecessor

00:16:30.459 --> 00:16:33.069
Bary Bloom already in the year 2000

00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:35.228
fromed a committee to assess

00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:37.125
junior faculty mentoring.

00:16:37.876 --> 00:16:39.375
And based on the
recommendations

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:41.074
from that faculty committee,

00:16:41.727 --> 00:16:42.748
each department was then

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:43.651
required to develop it's own

00:16:43.817 --> 00:16:44.827
strong mentoring policy,

00:16:46.096 --> 00:16:47.256
which included assigning

00:16:47.568 --> 00:16:48.816
each new faculty member

00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:50.824
a mentor at the time of

00:16:51.414 --> 00:16:52.658
the faculty memberís
appointment.

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:56.557
So, the school in additionó

00:16:57.004 --> 00:17:00.020
although it looks like a
play on wordsó

00:17:01.228 --> 00:17:03.438
you have to monitor mentoring.

00:17:03.948 --> 00:17:06.993
Monitoring mentoring
is a key aspect.

00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:09.138
So, there is what is called

00:17:09.479 --> 00:17:11.407
a bi-annual mentoring survey

00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:14.570
and through that weíve learned

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:15.356
that a lot of progress

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.423
has been made but also,

00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:17.940
thereís a lot of

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.128
much more needs to be done.

00:17:20.856 --> 00:17:22.899
So, since I began my tenureó

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:24.013
because I had the privilege

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:26.128
of spending the full term

00:17:26.281 --> 00:17:28.642
of 2008 already being appointed

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.187
but not yet having taken officeó

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:32.967
I spent those four months

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.606
coming every month for a week,
to Harvard.

00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:37.426
And mentoring was one of the topics

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.363
that emerged right at the top

00:17:39.657 --> 00:17:41.260
of my early conversations

00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:41.906
with department chairs

00:17:42.034 --> 00:17:43.211
and with faculty members.

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:45.933
So, I made this one of
my priorities

00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:47.598
particularly because

00:17:47.914 --> 00:17:48.961
the way Iíve expressed

00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:50.504
not so much the vision

00:17:50.573 --> 00:17:51.260
but the ambition for

00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:51.971
the School of Public Health

00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:53.623
is to make it the first school

00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:56.010
of public health of the 21st century,

00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:58.058
the first both in time and in quality.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.811
and you can only build

00:17:59.964 --> 00:18:02.226
the school of the 21st century

00:18:02.386 --> 00:18:04.146
with the generation of the
21st century

00:18:04.644 --> 00:18:05.235
and that generation

00:18:05.346 --> 00:18:06.446
is the generation of

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.620
the junior faculty members.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.010
So, the only way to be effective

00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:13.814
in realizing that ambition

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.256
is to actually invest in
junior faculty.

00:18:17.053 --> 00:18:18.699
So among other things,

00:18:19.012 --> 00:18:21.178
weíve established for
the first time,

00:18:22.032 --> 00:18:23.265
an office of an associate dean

00:18:23.805 --> 00:18:26.587
for research that funds
SEAT grants,

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.030
provide scientific
editorials report,

00:18:29.732 --> 00:18:31.068
external review of
grant proposals

00:18:31.307 --> 00:18:33.509
and a number of support mechanisms

00:18:33.944 --> 00:18:37.098
for a school that's heavily
dependent on research

00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:38.131
and where promotion is

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.368
heavily dependent

00:18:40.505 --> 00:18:42.144
on research productivity.

00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:46.664
Probably my diagnosis

00:18:46.857 --> 00:18:48.421
is that a lot of progress has
been made

00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:49.946
but the remaining challenge

00:18:50.168 --> 00:18:52.517
is heterogeneity across
departments.

00:18:52.697 --> 00:18:54.769
So, the quality of your
mentoring relationship

00:18:54.908 --> 00:18:57.141
should not have such variation

00:18:57.347 --> 00:19:01.339
because then also in the networks
of the faculty,

00:19:01.937 --> 00:19:04.775
the realization of very
different experiences

00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:08.443
is a factor in demoralizing
some people

00:19:08.617 --> 00:19:11.921
that donít get the quality
that they see peers getting.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.089
So, trying to achieve

00:19:14.089 --> 00:19:15.782
some uniformed standards-

00:19:16.243 --> 00:19:19.218
high standards is one of
my priorities,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.807
so some school-wide mentoring
guidelines have been established.

00:19:24.394 --> 00:19:25.980
And under these new guidelines,

00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:29.241
each new junior faculty member

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:31.946
meets with a chair of the department

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:33.496
soon after arriving at the school.

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:36.548
At that time, a primary mentor
is identified.

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:38.883
Sometimes thereís also a
secondary mentor.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.661
The mentors meet with the mentees

00:19:42.413 --> 00:19:43.763
at the beginning of their
appointment

00:19:44.074 --> 00:19:45.636
and then at a minimum,

00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:46.089
they have to meet

00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.604
at the end of each academic year

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.077
to review academic progress

00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:51.694
and plan for the next year.

00:19:52.244 --> 00:19:54.474
So, thereís a formal structure

00:19:54.883 --> 00:19:57.817
but I think itís also very important

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.516
to stimulate informal

00:20:00.516 --> 00:20:02.122
mentoring relationships.

00:20:03.467 --> 00:20:04.102
So in a sense,

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:09.234
itís a multi-tiered strategy
with primary,

00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:11.150
secondary and informal mentors

00:20:11.602 --> 00:20:12.218
and in addition,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.367
members of the leadership

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.661
of the academic administration

00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:16.168
of the school,

00:20:16.358 --> 00:20:18.120
particularly the senior
associate dean

00:20:18.413 --> 00:20:19.633
for faculty affairs

00:20:19.933 --> 00:20:21.610
and the associate dean

00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:22.925
for research that I just mentioned,

00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.273
meet with the junior faculty

00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:29.945
at critical points in their careers.

00:20:30.234 --> 00:20:32.464
So, itís this three layers of the chair,

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.612
the formal and informal mentors

00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:39.398
and then the school-wide
academic leadership.

00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:40.335
But let me end

00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:41.987
because they did ask us to
talk a little bit

00:20:41.987 --> 00:20:43.059
about personal experience.

00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:44.874
And I thought what I would doó

00:20:45.315 --> 00:20:46.740
and this would take literally a minute.

00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:52.274
When my beloved mentor
Avedis Donabedian passed away

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:53.742
after a very, very productive

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:55.192
and rich life, I wasó

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.212
having been his student
and pupiló

00:20:59.404 --> 00:21:01.243
to speak at his memorial

00:21:01.525 --> 00:21:03.876
and I reflected on the relationship.

00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:06.388
So, let me quote two
paragraphs fromó

00:21:07.144 --> 00:21:10.296
just a very brief mention
to what I said there.

00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:12.884
And this is what I said:

00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:16.093
Ours, referring to Avedis
and me,

00:21:16.372 --> 00:21:19.821
was the pragmatic
mentoring relationship.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.807
In our age of mass
education,

00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:23.657
the mentor has become an

00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:26.557
endangered academic species.

00:21:27.627 --> 00:21:28.983
A mentor teaches you

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:30.734
but is much more than a teacher.

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:33.317
A mentor befriends you

00:21:33.808 --> 00:21:35.321
but is much more than a friend.

00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:37.460
A mentor guides you

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.627
but is much more than a guide.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.387
What a true mentor does

00:21:41.637 --> 00:21:44.099
is one of the greatest gifts
of generosity.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.590
He, I was talking about Avedis

00:21:46.918 --> 00:21:47.126
but we would say

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:49.549
heís or she sows in your mind

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:50.461
and in your soul,

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:52.777
the seeds that will
nourish intellect

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.751
and spirit for the rest of your life.

00:21:55.412 --> 00:21:59.241
So to me, this is the nature
of the mentoring relationship.

00:21:59.793 --> 00:22:01.699
And letís not forget
where this word comes from.

00:22:01.972 --> 00:22:03.528
Itís actually an individual--

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:05.546
a figure in Greek Mythology
(Mentor)

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.636
who is entrusted with the
care of Telemachus

00:22:09.399 --> 00:22:12.182
when his father has to go to
the Trojan wars.

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:15.757
So, although in this marvelous
plasticity of the English language

00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:19.127
weíve turned it into a verb
and an adjective,

00:22:19.461 --> 00:22:24.677
let us not forget that the root
of the word refers to an individual,

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.596
and itís this personal dimension,

00:22:26.932 --> 00:22:28.598
this very, very profound,

00:22:28.873 --> 00:22:30.245
deep relationship that I think

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.449
holds both to the
enormous potential

00:22:33.469 --> 00:22:35.932
and also the great rewards
of mentoring.

00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:37.244
Thank you.

00:22:41.971 --> 00:22:42.897
Good morning.

00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:43.487
So like others,

00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:44.065
Iíve been asked to give

00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:45.624
both a personal perspective

00:22:45.774 --> 00:22:47.158
but also part of a perspective

00:22:47.292 --> 00:22:48.672
from Harvard Medical School.

00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:50.527
And so Iíll say personally

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:51.739
in terms of mentoring,

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:54.491
as you look through the literature

00:22:54.528 --> 00:22:55.630
and you hear people talk about it,

00:22:55.717 --> 00:22:57.699
they talk about issues

00:22:57.826 --> 00:22:59.278
such as matching on gender

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.840
and matching on race ethnicity

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.315
and how important
those things are.

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:03.852
And what I would say is,

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.218
is if I look at my career

00:23:05.222 --> 00:23:05.950
and my progression

00:23:06.509 --> 00:23:08.701
if I were to find the
perfect mentor

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.682
that was matched on all of
my dimensions,

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:13.060
the only person that could mentor me is me.

00:23:14.878 --> 00:23:18.013
And so for me,
I have had multiple mentors.

00:23:18.037 --> 00:23:19.644
The idea of a network of mentors

00:23:19.772 --> 00:23:21.069
is the only way I have survived,

00:23:21.231 --> 00:23:23.541
and they have crossed
race ethnicity,

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.253
and gender, and discipline.

00:23:26.534 --> 00:23:27.901
They have been individualsó

00:23:28.101 --> 00:23:29.894
and as you talked about
the anti-mentoringó

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:31.857
that have protected me

00:23:32.128 --> 00:23:34.428
from what Bill Silan calls,

00:23:34.703 --> 00:23:36.133
the dementors and
the tormentors

00:23:38.862 --> 00:23:43.211
and they continued
as I moved forward in my career,

00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:47.282
critical elements for
my success and my balance.

00:23:47.675 --> 00:23:49.522
And those are the individuals
who early on,

00:23:49.748 --> 00:23:51.229
when I was at
Harvard Medical School

00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:52.557
and Harvard School of
Public Health

00:23:52.695 --> 00:23:55.071
and my interests were
very different from others,

00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:58.051
told me to pursue
my interests

00:23:58.195 --> 00:24:00.795
and backed me in pursuing
my interests

00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:02.657
and creating my own space

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.294
for what I thought was
important,

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:05.615
and actually showed me

00:24:05.783 --> 00:24:08.101
that there was a value to
advancing academically.

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:09.651
Before then I had not thought that

00:24:09.758 --> 00:24:10.575
there was any value to it

00:24:10.898 --> 00:24:11.536
and it was my mentors

00:24:11.651 --> 00:24:12.567
who told me that there was

00:24:12.778 --> 00:24:14.867
and were able to show
me the way.

00:24:15.022 --> 00:24:16.556
I want to give you an example

00:24:16.685 --> 00:24:17.354
of some of the things

00:24:17.396 --> 00:24:18.081
that weíve actually done

00:24:18.884 --> 00:24:19.906
at the medical school.

00:24:20.156 --> 00:24:21.056
And the first begins with

00:24:22.282 --> 00:24:24.130
everyone saying that mentoring

00:24:24.249 --> 00:24:25.130
is critically important

00:24:25.357 --> 00:24:27.763
but not really recognizing it

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.491
and our faculty affiliate

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.491
really wasnít recognized.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.897
So, in 1995 our office

00:24:32.058 --> 00:24:33.873
established a mentoring award

00:24:33.924 --> 00:24:37.948
for the school that has
grown over time.

00:24:38.762 --> 00:24:39.750
It is an award that was

00:24:40.018 --> 00:24:41.760
establish in 1995
but has grown

00:24:41.944 --> 00:24:42.944
and since then,

00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:46.142
over 3700 nominations 
have come in

00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:49.174
for close to 1200 individual
faculty members.

00:24:50.116 --> 00:24:51.597
Itís grown from an
initial award

00:24:52.518 --> 00:24:54.175
that was named the
Cliff Barger award

00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:56.593
to having three categories
of Cliff Barger award

00:24:56.778 --> 00:25:00.013
for those who have
been in service

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.659
for a minimum number
of years,

00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:03.886
a final award for those

00:25:04.007 --> 00:25:04.595
who have been in service

00:25:04.724 --> 00:25:05.661
for more than 20 years,

00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:07.717
and what we call a young
mentor award

00:25:07.878 --> 00:25:08.876
for those who have been

00:25:09.062 --> 00:25:11.291
in service for less than 10 years.

00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:15.951
To date, there have been
122 awardees.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:18.129
What I find important
about this

00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:20.232
is when we did our new promotion criteria

00:25:20.384 --> 00:25:20.942
for the school,

00:25:21.127 --> 00:25:23.479
these awards were recognized
within the promotions.

00:25:24.198 --> 00:25:27.388
And so how do you start to
recognize mentoring,

00:25:27.908 --> 00:25:28.808
and recognizing the way

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.038
that it starts to show up
on individuals CVs,

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.883
itís taken into consideration
for promotion,

00:25:34.196 --> 00:25:36.741
recognized throughout
our environment.

00:25:37.137 --> 00:25:39.746
Other ways in which it
has been recognized

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:43.433
include CHAD which is a consortium

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:45.449
or committee across the
Faculty Development

00:25:45.697 --> 00:25:46.405
and Diversity offices

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.236
at the various Harvard
affiliated institutions

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:49.991
with the medical school.

00:25:50.593 --> 00:25:51.361
And they actually offer

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.133
a mentoring course,

00:25:52.322 --> 00:25:54.721
led by Jean Emmons
who is here,

00:25:54.903 --> 00:25:57.317
who was a silent
mentoring awardee.

00:25:58.245 --> 00:25:59.689
There is also a task force

00:25:59.814 --> 00:26:01.372
on Faculty Development
and Diversity

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:01.966
that will be coming out

00:26:02.053 --> 00:26:03.429
with a report in the
next few months

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.560
and one of the three
main committees

00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:07.597
of this task force deals
with mentoring,

00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:10.461
again chaired by
Jean Emmons.

00:26:11.404 --> 00:26:13.603
When we look at
mentoringó

00:26:14.256 --> 00:26:16.536
because I want to mention
some of the other people that are hereó

00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:19.598
and oftentimes,
we get an image of a sage,

00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:22.764
white man with white hair
and blue eyes

00:26:23.044 --> 00:26:24.190
and all the other kind of things

00:26:24.335 --> 00:26:24.952
that go along with that.

00:26:25.737 --> 00:26:26.947
And important part of this

00:26:27.093 --> 00:26:28.508
is recognizing that mentoring

00:26:28.659 --> 00:26:30.086
occurs all across our faculty.

00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:32.226
And one of the people that
we have here

00:26:32.353 --> 00:26:33.595
that I really want to point out

00:26:33.738 --> 00:26:35.009
is Jessica Henderson Daniel,

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:36.689
who is the first woman

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.118
and the first person of color

00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:39.420
to win the mentoring award

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:40.663
at Harvard Medical School

00:26:41.115 --> 00:26:42.487
and recognizing it across the board.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.817
And Jessica,
you should go like thisÖ

00:26:49.782 --> 00:26:51.831
So, there are many ways
I think in which

00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:53.656
we are trying to
advance mentoring.

00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:56.196
The last part is actually
taking from those individuals

00:26:56.337 --> 00:26:57.196
who have won the
mentoring award,

00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.731
and now there is a
council of mentors

00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:02.255
that is actually meeting
and looking at

00:27:02.392 --> 00:27:04.301
what is going on
with the mentoring in the school,

00:27:04.718 --> 00:27:06.615
ways in which we can
improve mentoring

00:27:07.054 --> 00:27:09.074
but itís taken from the best
across our campus

00:27:09.388 --> 00:27:10.116
and across disciplines.

00:27:10.518 --> 00:27:11.518
Thank you.

00:27:18.252 --> 00:27:21.129
Well, I was appointed

00:27:21.251 --> 00:27:23.487
a year ago to this new role

00:27:23.882 --> 00:27:26.801
as Faculty Advisor

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.101
on Faculty Development
and Diversity,

00:27:29.364 --> 00:27:30.920
and one of the reasons

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.840
I agreed to do this

00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:32.674
is because I thought

00:27:32.699 --> 00:27:34.747
there was a really nice
theme in place

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:36.486
with many people committed

00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:40.141
to creating cultural
change in FAS

00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:41.936
and this is not a minor thing.

00:27:42.385 --> 00:27:44.545
FAS is a very large part
of the University.

00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:46.146
Itís 40% of the faculty

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:47.274
forty-two departments

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:48.626
and these departments

00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:50.327
are very different in their culture.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.973
Some of them have never promoted,

00:27:51.973 --> 00:27:54.329
some of them have been
promoting regularly

00:27:54.335 --> 00:27:55.564
over the last few years,

00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:57.152
so itís really a complex mosaic.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:02.405
First my experience
with my own mentoring:

00:28:02.653 --> 00:28:03.140
Iím Canadian,

00:28:03.449 --> 00:28:05.345
I went to Paris as a
graduate student

00:28:05.995 --> 00:28:07.086
at a very young age

00:28:07.363 --> 00:28:08.804
and there was no mentoring.

00:28:09.281 --> 00:28:14.258
It was a pure swim or sink system

00:28:14.518 --> 00:28:16.512
and that was very difficult,

00:28:16.797 --> 00:28:18.007
it taught me resilience.

00:28:18.635 --> 00:28:20.708
And in 1983 I went to

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.452
Stanford as a Post Doc

00:28:22.765 --> 00:28:24.227
and I discovered a word

00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:26.177
that was totally unknown to me.

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:27.300
I felt those students were

00:28:27.444 --> 00:28:29.139
unbelievably lucky,

00:28:29.428 --> 00:28:30.603
privileged and also

00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:32.274
they were getting extremely
good training.

00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:34.528
Then in í87 I was hired

00:28:34.695 --> 00:28:36.315
at Princeton in Sociology

00:28:36.469 --> 00:28:37.524
where I was for 15 years

00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:40.026
before coming here in 2003.

00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:42.044
And Princeton at the time

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:43.452
still had a system where

00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:45.396
only one person in six
approximately,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.555
got tenure and that was

00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:48.562
also a little bit baptism by fire.

00:28:48.738 --> 00:28:50.654
I really felt that they were

00:28:50.796 --> 00:28:52.400
not taking very good care
of us and many,

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.979
many of my friends left
when we got tenure.

00:28:55.117 --> 00:28:56.676
All my friends were
gone basically.

00:28:56.923 --> 00:28:59.675
And then I came here in 2003.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.229
My scholarship is on
Culture and Inequality.

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:03.827
I am presently working on

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.355
anti-racism in France and the US,

00:29:06.469 --> 00:29:08.610
I really have a long-term commitment

00:29:08.873 --> 00:29:10.077
to trying to understand

00:29:10.284 --> 00:29:12.614
how collective definitions

00:29:12.741 --> 00:29:13.712
of worth influence

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.196
for production of inequality,

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:16.819
so my involvement in this

00:29:16.947 --> 00:29:18.841
is very much driven by
my own scholarship.

00:29:19.169 --> 00:29:22.048
I also happen to have a significant other

00:29:22.184 --> 00:29:23.900
who also studies diversity.

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:25.980
And actually in the Globe
this weekend,

00:29:26.257 --> 00:29:28.650
there was a big article
on his work

00:29:28.785 --> 00:29:33.576
which basically shows that he
studied 800 corporations

00:29:33.697 --> 00:29:34.971
looking at which one have been

00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:37.767
most successful at
favoring diversity.

00:29:38.235 --> 00:29:39.559
And he finds that what is

00:29:39.671 --> 00:29:41.735
most effective is structural change:

00:29:42.069 --> 00:29:45.573
that is appointing people
who actually have as a responsibility

00:29:45.725 --> 00:29:46.800
or appointing task force

00:29:46.934 --> 00:29:50.527
who are in charge of
overseeing diversification

00:29:50.825 --> 00:29:53.897
and also using carrots
and stick to really create change.

00:29:54.102 --> 00:29:59.504
And mentoring is a very
big part of the equation.

00:30:00.126 --> 00:30:02.203
So, with all this backgroundó

00:30:02.394 --> 00:30:07.082
my predecessor Liza Martin had 
resigned in 2005,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.826
after having created a
mentoring program

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:12.651
where women were matchedó

00:30:12.898 --> 00:30:15.245
only junior tenure track facultyó

00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:18.356
were matched with mentors
in other departments,

00:30:18.506 --> 00:30:19.356
which was a very good idea,

00:30:19.782 --> 00:30:22.631
because you can actually
ask advice to people

00:30:22.963 --> 00:30:25.787
who will not be involved
in your promotion

00:30:27.148 --> 00:30:28.900
where you can look
more vulnerable

00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:30.891
than the people who will be one 
day be in charge

00:30:31.024 --> 00:30:31.941
with looking at your work.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.463
Departments were asking FAS

00:30:35.463 --> 00:30:38.359
to report on their
mentoring activities

00:30:38.522 --> 00:30:41.945
but there was just an enormous amount
of informal mentoring occurring.

00:30:42.144 --> 00:30:45.334
And the literature shows us
that informal mentoring

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:46.939
mostly benefits people

00:30:47.073 --> 00:30:48.681
who are entitled and many,

00:30:48.815 --> 00:30:50.491
many people did not
benefit from it.

00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:54.781
So, the idea was really

00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:56.426
to create a new system

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.713
that was launched this fall,

00:30:57.947 --> 00:30:59.714
where weíre asking
both departments

00:30:59.714 --> 00:31:03.152
and individuals to
create mentoring plans.

00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:04.929
And actually, we donít
use the word mentoring,

00:31:05.146 --> 00:31:06.602
we use the word
development network,

00:31:06.947 --> 00:31:09.024
drawing on the work of David Thomas

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.446
who is an expert
on the question,

00:31:10.455 --> 00:31:11.930
who works in the
Business School

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:12.924
and Monica Higgins

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.349
who works in the
School of Education.

00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:16.687
And the idea is that

00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:18.614
tenure track faculty

00:31:19.318 --> 00:31:21.002
create a network of people

00:31:21.111 --> 00:31:23.186
with multiple nodes

00:31:23.302 --> 00:31:24.967
that will answer various needs

00:31:25.196 --> 00:31:26.586
and the needs that are evolving

00:31:26.832 --> 00:31:29.545
as they move through the
tenure track system.

00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:31.768
And the word mentoring itself

00:31:31.906 --> 00:31:33.010
is not that great a word

00:31:33.171 --> 00:31:33.643
because in fact,

00:31:33.777 --> 00:31:34.953
what most people are seeking

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:36.204
is intellectual exchange

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.159
that is the ability to get

00:31:38.287 --> 00:31:39.413
people to read their work.

00:31:39.848 --> 00:31:41.879
When we work in my department 
to launch

00:31:42.023 --> 00:31:43.421
our mentoring plan this fall,

00:31:43.974 --> 00:31:45.598
this is what they want.

00:31:45.598 --> 00:31:46.841
They know that the faculty

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.996
are unbelievably busy

00:31:49.187 --> 00:31:52.171
but they want us to really understand

00:31:52.317 --> 00:31:53.438
that weíre supposed to set aside

00:31:53.714 --> 00:31:55.753
few days a year to read manuscript

00:31:55.864 --> 00:31:56.710
and give them feedbacks

00:31:57.011 --> 00:31:57.835
so that they will be able

00:31:57.948 --> 00:32:00.772
to improve their work

00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:03.336
on which they will be judged

00:32:03.472 --> 00:32:04.617
when they come up for tenure.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.601
So, departments had until March 1st

00:32:08.894 --> 00:32:10.438
to turn in their mentoring plans

00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:13.519
and many of them have.
I'm very pleased.

00:32:13.829 --> 00:32:15.013
The cultural change is veryó

00:32:15.693 --> 00:32:18.614
the purpose in fact is not
to create these mentoring plan.

00:32:18.853 --> 00:32:20.926
Itís really to create a cultural change.

00:32:21.325 --> 00:32:22.988
And creating a structure in itself

00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:26.120
is probably the easiest
part of the challenge.

00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:28.457
What will be much more
of a challenge

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:30.409
will be to monitor in a year,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.476
what has been happening.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.057
And there, Iím certainly going to
email my co-panelists

00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:36.093
to learn more about

00:32:37.426 --> 00:32:39.460
the tools that they have
put in place.

00:32:39.766 --> 00:32:40.859
I think that at Harvard,

00:32:41.572 --> 00:32:42.322
where thereís such a

00:32:42.467 --> 00:32:43.322
strong culture of excellence,

00:32:44.041 --> 00:32:46.255
diversity is often viewed
as a pollutant

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.483
or even claiming aid-help

00:32:48.936 --> 00:32:50.009
is viewed as a pollutant

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.960
because we all are supposed
to be so talented

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:54.503
that the cream will
rise naturally.

00:32:54.835 --> 00:32:56.101
Well in fact everyone who 
gets tenure

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.061
gets a lot of help:

00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:59.189
they get their colleagues
to read their work,

00:32:59.484 --> 00:33:02.256
they present their work
at colloquiam, et cetera.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.402
So, the idea is that

00:33:03.534 --> 00:33:05.751
to acknowledge that
getting help

00:33:06.034 --> 00:33:07.844
is crucial to the raising
of the cream

00:33:08.059 --> 00:33:11.115
but we want more of an
even playing field

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.594
where more people
get the help

00:33:12.743 --> 00:33:13.172
that they need

00:33:13.315 --> 00:33:15.002
to become all they can be.

00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:16.985
And Harvard is I think,

00:33:16.985 --> 00:33:17.720
a little bitó

00:33:18.175 --> 00:33:18.893
if we think of whatís

00:33:19.026 --> 00:33:20.971
happening at
Stanford or at Yale

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.412
our peer institutions are
fully engaged in this.

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.475
Stanford has its motto:

00:33:25.818 --> 00:33:27.091
Diversity and Excellence
Together.

00:33:27.689 --> 00:33:30.480
And we are very much
moving in the same direction

00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:33.732
though FAS made a
very important statement

00:33:33.907 --> 00:33:35.755
last week to this effect.

00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.828
So, I think that

00:33:38.173 --> 00:33:39.542
a lot of people are pushing

00:33:39.931 --> 00:33:40.996
in the same direction

00:33:41.128 --> 00:33:41.887
and Iím personally

00:33:42.048 --> 00:33:42.968
quite optimistic

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:44.092
for the future.

00:33:44.734 --> 00:33:45.834
Thank you.

00:33:51.493 --> 00:33:55.493
Panelists,
we are in factó

00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:58.039
as an FYIó

00:33:58.206 --> 00:33:58.732
we are in fact

00:33:59.012 --> 00:34:03.418
videotaping this section
of this event.

00:34:03.658 --> 00:34:08.672
And so we hope
to be able to have your faces

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:09.818
on our website soon,

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.620
so that others
who are not able to attend

00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:15.784
can be guided by your wisdom.

00:34:15.897 --> 00:34:16.432
So, thank you.

00:34:16.883 --> 00:34:20.858
We are privileged on many
fronts here at Harvard

00:34:21.538 --> 00:34:26.397
but I think that our human capital
at Harvard is unsurpassed

00:34:26.562 --> 00:34:30.722
and we do indeed stand
on the shoulders of many giants here.

00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:39.654
And often, we donít recognize
how they profoundly change our lives

00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:43.624
and how they profoundly
change our academic community.

00:34:43.897 --> 00:34:46.762
So, today we wanted to be
able to acknowledge

00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:48.176
some of these individuals,

00:34:48.359 --> 00:34:49.858
and I hope that we can
do more of this,

00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:51.004
as Joan had mentioned,

00:34:51.346 --> 00:34:53.679
we can do more to recognize
the mentors

00:34:53.842 --> 00:34:55.350
and those who support us-

00:34:55.535 --> 00:34:57.836
those who help us through

00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.430
the difficult challenges ahead

00:35:00.623 --> 00:35:03.549
as we try to develop careers
here at Harvard.

00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:07.202
So, I would like to have
Professor Scott Edwardsó

00:35:07.378 --> 00:35:08.971
as I call your name,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.421
if you could please stand
in the front

00:35:11.867 --> 00:35:15.347
so that we may embarrass
you further.

00:35:15.809 --> 00:35:16.809
Professor Scott Edwards,

00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:18.812
Professor Jean Emmons,

00:35:21.747 --> 00:35:22.747
Professor David Golan,

00:35:24.978 --> 00:35:26.528
Professor Virginie Greene,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.738
Professor Ichiro Kawachi,

00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:33.036
Professor Michele Lamont,

00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:36.220
Professor Everett Mendelsohn,

00:35:37.463 --> 00:35:39.008
Professor Joan Reede

00:35:40.434 --> 00:35:42.624
and Professor
Marianne Wessling-Resnick.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.528
For many years

00:35:51.663 --> 00:35:54.224
these individuals have toiled

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.708
at many levels to support
mentoring,

00:35:57.857 --> 00:35:59.685
not just in their schools

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:00.996
but in the University.

00:36:01.398 --> 00:36:05.689
Some of them have established
awards to honor those colleagues

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.761
who have done mentoring
in their departments

00:36:07.761 --> 00:36:08.422
and in their schools.

00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.108
Others have simply

00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:12.227
developed their own

00:36:12.355 --> 00:36:13.926
informal mentoring programs

00:36:14.553 --> 00:36:16.442
without virtue of resources

00:36:17.438 --> 00:36:21.888
and often at the expense of their
own personal scholarship.

00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:24.140
So, we are very grateful to them

00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:25.883
for the work that they do

00:36:26.148 --> 00:36:29.501
and I hope that you will enjoy
meeting them

00:36:29.638 --> 00:36:30.641
in your discussion groups

00:36:30.912 --> 00:36:32.678
because they will serve as guides,

00:36:32.879 --> 00:36:34.222
as you think about the questions

00:36:34.383 --> 00:36:36.541
that we have posed for
these discussion groups.

00:36:37.026 --> 00:36:38.487
So, on behalf of the university,

00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:42.966
we thank you for your
profound contributions to mentoring

00:36:43.426 --> 00:36:46.530
and hope that we can gain insights

00:36:46.858 --> 00:36:50.740
and guidance from you
in the years ahead,

00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:52.796
as we think about mentoring
in the academy.

00:36:53.179 --> 00:36:56.224
Letís give them
a warm round of applause.

00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:05.866
So, we keep on having to
cut off the conversation,

00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:07.695
but that the conversations 
want to continue

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.960
I take as a very good sign.

00:37:09.266 --> 00:37:09.947
And in particular,

00:37:10.524 --> 00:37:12.466
the cross-schools conversations

00:37:12.618 --> 00:37:14.096
and the cross-cohort conversations

00:37:14.688 --> 00:37:16.488
are very eye-opening in some cases

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.354
with some concrete ideas

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.621
about things that we might
be able to try

00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:21.818
in our own environments

00:37:21.903 --> 00:37:22.476
and in some cases

00:37:22.883 --> 00:37:24.979
some very challenging
problems to address.

00:37:25.557 --> 00:37:27.811
I have the pleasure now

00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:30.937
of introducing our Provost,
Steve Hyman

00:37:31.673 --> 00:37:33.441
who is going to share with you

00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:35.771
some University perspectives
on mentoring.

00:37:36.104 --> 00:37:38.328
So, please join me in
welcoming, Steve.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640
Thank you.

00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:47.373
Let me start by
thanking you,

00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:50.692
Judy and Lisa

00:37:50.808 --> 00:37:52.317
and the staff of your office

00:37:53.824 --> 00:37:54.574
and the Bach Center

00:37:54.701 --> 00:37:56.525
for organizing this very,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.643
very important event.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.264
And let me thank
in absentia those deans

00:38:01.396 --> 00:38:04.364
who either have been here
or will be here later

00:38:04.642 --> 00:38:06.466
because a high-level

00:38:06.621 --> 00:38:08.847
commitment is necessary
to this activity.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:09.863
Those of you,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.615
whether you are tenure
track faculty

00:38:13.948 --> 00:38:18.729
or people who have leapt over

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:20.601
that hurdle at some time
in the past,

00:38:21.388 --> 00:38:23.487
recognize the importance
of mentoring

00:38:23.532 --> 00:38:24.720
and at the same time,

00:38:24.914 --> 00:38:27.474
recognize that it is
often thankless

00:38:27.642 --> 00:38:31.483
and that the rewards have
to be internal

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.328
because you know youíve
done the right thing.

00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:35.787
As a university,

00:38:37.223 --> 00:38:40.586
we often donít find adequate

00:38:40.761 --> 00:38:42.408
ways to thank people

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:44.168
for their extraordinary efforts,

00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:47.026
for their citizenship,

00:38:47.026 --> 00:38:49.108
for their caring.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.877
At least at a time of
famine and dirt,

00:38:55.037 --> 00:38:56.517
at least we have
muffins for you

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.731
and unhealthy things

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.704
like bacon to express our thanks.

00:39:04.182 --> 00:39:05.629
But in all seriousness,

00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:08.287
this is such an important area

00:39:08.327 --> 00:39:09.407
for the University.

00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:13.458
And before I launch
into my remarks,

00:39:14.174 --> 00:39:17.461
I want to particularly recognize
some of you here

00:39:17.627 --> 00:39:19.578
who have won mentoring awards

00:39:19.605 --> 00:39:21.245
and Iíve seen some of
you already:

00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:25.098
Everett Mendelsohn
from Arts and Sciences,

00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:28.080
Jean Emmons from HMS,

00:39:28.574 --> 00:39:30.997
Ichiro Kawachi
from Public Health,

00:39:31.923 --> 00:39:34.338
Marianne Wessling-Resnick
from Public Health,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.745
Scott Edwards
who I saw from Arts and Sciences

00:39:37.405 --> 00:39:39.653
and Professor Virginie Greene
from FAS,

00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:41.492
who I also saw a few
minutes ago.

00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:45.694
You areóand I hope
Iím not missing other names

00:39:45.877 --> 00:39:47.934
but you are really exemplars.

00:39:49.162 --> 00:39:57.258
I also again, want to thank
members of the leadership team

00:39:57.491 --> 00:39:59.954
and tenured faculty
who are here to talk about this

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:06.575
Although the president
of the university

00:40:06.765 --> 00:40:09.061
is the person
who actually confers tenure,

00:40:09.351 --> 00:40:13.050
I chair half of the tenure cases

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:16.394
except for the medical school,

00:40:16.807 --> 00:40:19.441
where actually Iím the last
signature on all of them.

00:40:19.594 --> 00:40:24.190
I mean, the good news is

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:26.270
that at this last step of the ad hoc

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:27.968
the success rate is very, very high.

00:40:28.743 --> 00:40:29.646
But all too often,

00:40:30.175 --> 00:40:34.184
we see people for whom the case is

00:40:34.318 --> 00:40:35.735
closer than it should be,

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:37.435
despite their brilliance

00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:41.790
and their effort and sometimes,

00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:46.740
people who really should have
made it donít make it.

00:40:47.505 --> 00:40:48.221
And in some sense

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.566
there are many reasons for
this but often,

00:40:51.898 --> 00:40:54.561
I thought to myself
after a difficult case,

00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:57.017
that had there only been
the right kind of mentoring,

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.212
this would have had a
different outcome.

00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:08.139
And often, people are left to
fend for themselves

00:41:08.283 --> 00:41:10.875
or they have sort of glancing,

00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:12.161
intermittent mentorship

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:16.471
and also from the point of view
of the mentors.

00:41:16.735 --> 00:41:19.712
Itís important to engage in 
groups like this

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:20.603
and stay up-to-date

00:41:20.689 --> 00:41:21.285
and understand

00:41:21.572 --> 00:41:23.196
what the different schools

00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:24.676
are looking for becauseó

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:27.869
for example in many other schools,

00:41:28.157 --> 00:41:31.112
Arts and Sciences in particular,

00:41:31.649 --> 00:41:33.611
teaching which at one time

00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:36.877
was considered to be something

00:41:37.045 --> 00:41:39.969
that you had to do

00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:42.030
but it wasnít worth all
that much

00:41:42.193 --> 00:41:45.689
is now an important part
of tenure cases,

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:48.942
we just saw a new criteria

00:41:49.164 --> 00:41:50.035
from the School of
Public Health

00:41:50.331 --> 00:41:52.588
that made teaching important.

00:41:52.741 --> 00:41:54.128
So, each school has a different

00:41:54.268 --> 00:41:55.491
culture and different weights.

00:41:56.314 --> 00:42:00.095
And while tenure track faculty

00:42:00.278 --> 00:42:04.524
shouldnít enslave their energies

00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:08.664
and their interests to some plan

00:42:08.824 --> 00:42:11.568
for what it takes to achieve tenure,

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:17.485
obviously people have
to follow their loves

00:42:17.675 --> 00:42:19.534
and their intellectual leads.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.320
Still, it is so important

00:42:21.469 --> 00:42:26.190
that people understand
the system

00:42:26.858 --> 00:42:31.584
and have the kind of helpful

00:42:31.868 --> 00:42:33.738
engagement in every stage

00:42:34.592 --> 00:42:37.699
so that we can achieve
what we want

00:42:37.869 --> 00:42:39.103
which is the success of all

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:40.983
of our tenure track faculty.

00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.573
So in that sense,

00:42:45.372 --> 00:42:48.781
Iím really happy to see
this room full,

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.635
and the only thing

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:53.802
I could wish for is to see many,

00:42:53.947 --> 00:42:56.993
many more rooms full.

00:42:58.355 --> 00:43:00.069
Because in the end,

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:03.729
we have committed ourselves

00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:07.073
as a University increasingly

00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:09.825
to a tenure track system

00:43:09.996 --> 00:43:11.761
or in some of the
professional schools,

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:14.007
something like that
without a name.

00:43:15.123 --> 00:43:16.104
And what that really means

00:43:16.248 --> 00:43:19.792
is that we want to be committed
to our tenure track faculty,

00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:23.080
we want to get them through
these set of processes.

00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:26.165
But this is not a matter of magic,

00:43:26.358 --> 00:43:29.845
this is a matter of effort
and engagement

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:35.695
where mentoring is
particularly important.

00:43:35.827 --> 00:43:37.035
And I think many of us

00:43:37.874 --> 00:43:43.378
think back to the importance
of senior faculty

00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:45.961
and mentors in our own careers

00:43:46.906 --> 00:43:49.141
and itís something though

00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:51.980
that just has not been
adequately institutionalized.

00:43:52.203 --> 00:43:56.966
And so I commend everybody
for being here.

00:43:57.344 --> 00:44:02.642
I wish you all a productive
and useful day

00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:05.829
and I hopeó
especially those of you

00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:09.194
who are already tenuredó

00:44:09.888 --> 00:44:14.257
I was told itís no longer PC
to talk about senior and junior faculty.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.756
But those of you who
are senior faculty,

00:44:18.026 --> 00:44:21.788
I hope youíll be evangelists
for the importance of mentoring

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.785
in your schools

00:44:23.091 --> 00:44:24.223
because frankly

00:44:24.367 --> 00:44:25.255
as I said at the outset,

00:44:25.832 --> 00:44:27.245
this is not enough recognized

00:44:27.357 --> 00:44:28.276
or enough rewarded

00:44:29.045 --> 00:44:30.836
but it is absolutely critical

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.788
if we are going to
succeed as a University

00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:35.624
in one of our most important goals,

00:44:36.113 --> 00:44:40.642
which is to help our tenure track
faculty make it over this bar

00:44:40.802 --> 00:44:42.806
and permanently join
our community.

00:44:42.817 --> 00:44:43.817
So, thank you very, very much.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:50.391
Well, I was in a group

00:44:50.687 --> 00:44:54.491
that included senior faculty

00:44:54.624 --> 00:44:55.527
and tenure track faculty

00:44:55.551 --> 00:44:57.750
in the Social Sciences
and the Humanities

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.306
but across different schools

00:44:59.456 --> 00:45:01.647
in the Kennedy School FAS

00:45:01.954 --> 00:45:04.502
and the Harvard School
of Public Health

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.059
and the medical school,

00:45:06.214 --> 00:45:08.551
and we had a really interesting
conversation,

00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:09.726
a troubling one too.

00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:12.937
Because some of the tenure track
faculty who were thereó

00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:14.395
I would say three of themó

00:45:14.558 --> 00:45:16.120
described context

00:45:16.272 --> 00:45:18.528
where they were really caught
between two chairs,

00:45:19.282 --> 00:45:24.193
in the sense of having
an appointment in a school

00:45:24.342 --> 00:45:27.532
where the discipline is
not marginalized

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.397
but not dominant discipline,

00:45:30.125 --> 00:45:31.140
what path to follow

00:45:31.412 --> 00:45:33.532
when basically your chair
is very busy

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:38.514
and is not immediately
available to give you feedback

00:45:38.668 --> 00:45:41.612
about whether you should
publish in your own field

00:45:41.861 --> 00:45:44.069
or publish for your school.

00:45:44.578 --> 00:45:48.669
Another case where a department
hasnít promoted since 1950

00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:51.601
and the person basically,

00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:54.611
doesnít know if his FTE will be
in one department or another,

00:45:56.095 --> 00:46:02.352
another case where the
output of the scholar

00:46:02.489 --> 00:46:05.866
is a very unconventional one
by Harvardís criteria.

00:46:06.089 --> 00:46:07.803
So for me in my role,

00:46:08.004 --> 00:46:11.222
Iím thinking we really need
a kind ombudsperson

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.532
to whom people could go

00:46:13.676 --> 00:46:15.220
and raise a red flag early on

00:46:15.387 --> 00:46:16.627
to try to understand better,

00:46:16.796 --> 00:46:20.377
the criteria by which they
are going to be evaluated.

00:46:21.325 --> 00:46:24.579
A second issue that was raised

00:46:24.755 --> 00:46:28.281
is that of variation in the faculty

00:46:28.426 --> 00:46:33.353
in how much weight they put on
various criteria of publication:

00:46:33.475 --> 00:46:36.030
what kind of publication
books versus articles,

00:46:36.368 --> 00:46:37.903
service and teaching.

00:46:38.622 --> 00:46:39.695
And Judy Singer who was there,

00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:43.138
mentioned an experiment
they did in the School of Ed,

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:44.980
where they asked all the faculty

00:46:45.086 --> 00:46:49.798
to attribute 100 points to
the various dimensions

00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:51.213
they used while looking
at their file.

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:54.850
And they found it was a
very teachable moment

00:46:55.247 --> 00:46:56.743
when the results
were distributed and

00:46:56.872 --> 00:46:59.295
the faculty came to
the realization

00:46:59.463 --> 00:47:00.504
of how much difference

00:47:00.656 --> 00:47:01.792
there was in how much weight

00:47:01.832 --> 00:47:03.163
they put on the various criteria,

00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:04.963
which really made me think

00:47:05.112 --> 00:47:05.977
about the importance

00:47:06.117 --> 00:47:07.457
of spending much more time

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:09.969
among the senior faculty,

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:13.501
thinking much more
explicitly than we do,

00:47:13.511 --> 00:47:17.249
about what do we do
when we are evaluating.

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:18.540
We have now in Affairs,

00:47:18.663 --> 00:47:19.773
a situation where some departments

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:20.881
have never promoted,

00:47:21.018 --> 00:47:22.540
others have promoted
regularly.

00:47:22.749 --> 00:47:24.807
And I think among the
more senior faculty

00:47:25.001 --> 00:47:26.266
who have been here
for 40 years

00:47:26.394 --> 00:47:28.620
and those who have come
over the last 10 years,

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.477
there are different expectations

00:47:30.612 --> 00:47:32.331
about what a Harvard
faculty should be

00:47:32.686 --> 00:47:34.701
and this really needs to be
talked about

00:47:35.029 --> 00:47:36.053
much more explicitly.

00:47:36.383 --> 00:47:42.165
So, thatís a second central
theme in our conversation.

00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:44.607
A third one was
how to find good mentors.

00:47:48.137 --> 00:47:51.202
Members of our group
mentioned the importance of gossip

00:47:51.727 --> 00:47:53.457
and of hanging out in hallways,

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.702
and really how much good ideas
come at the most unexpected time.

00:48:00.255 --> 00:48:03.992
... who was
trained in New Zealand

00:48:04.322 --> 00:48:08.036
was regretting the good habit
of drinking tea together

00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:09.880
three times a day for
15 minutes,

00:48:10.066 --> 00:48:10.641
so we concluded,

00:48:10.763 --> 00:48:14.219
I think we should just institute
that here in all schools.

00:48:15.007 --> 00:48:16.272
Thatís basically what came up.

00:48:16.747 --> 00:48:18.218
I donít know if any of our
group member

00:48:18.331 --> 00:48:20.475
would like to highlight
any other point

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.668
that I did not mentionÖNo.

00:48:32.067 --> 00:48:35.391
So, we had a very active
discussion,

00:48:35.759 --> 00:48:41.231
raising first the fact that there
are very different rules

00:48:41.279 --> 00:48:44.700
and ways of looking at
"ladder faculty"

00:48:44.845 --> 00:48:47.397
so that we didnít necessarily share
a common language

00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:48.683
from the medical school,

00:48:48.695 --> 00:48:51.208
the hospitals, FAS,

00:48:51.344 --> 00:48:52.263
the School of Public Health

00:48:52.458 --> 00:48:56.200
and therefore as mentoring
goes forward

00:48:56.342 --> 00:48:57.518
at Harvard overall

00:48:57.844 --> 00:48:59.952
and to make sure that
the language is more global

00:49:00.266 --> 00:49:03.435
and more really
accepting of the entire group.

00:49:04.395 --> 00:49:07.121
And so just in terms of
the common language,

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:11.119
the issues of promotion
versus career satisfaction

00:49:11.266 --> 00:49:14.203
and really accepting
some heterogeneity

00:49:14.574 --> 00:49:17.569
in the definition of
what we want for mentoring.

00:49:18.352 --> 00:49:21.870
It was clear that there should
be expectations Harvard wide,

00:49:22.028 --> 00:49:22.949
of a change of culture

00:49:23.092 --> 00:49:24.516
that mentoring was important

00:49:25.434 --> 00:49:27.454
across all career trajectories.

00:49:28.418 --> 00:49:30.957
A lot of interest in mentor

00:49:30.957 --> 00:49:32.501
and mentee training,

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:35.592
so that again there was
more uniformity

00:49:35.762 --> 00:49:38.596
both in our senior faculty of
knowing how to really

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.954
effectively mentor

00:49:40.175 --> 00:49:44.793
but for our junior faculty
to have more information

00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:47.904
on how to be  a great mentor
and what to expect.

00:49:48.405 --> 00:49:51.030
And this could be in the form of

00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:53.325
part of the boot camp 
thatís part ofó

00:49:53.561 --> 00:49:57.056
apparently when the new faculty
come to FAS

00:49:57.259 --> 00:50:00.416
and some other areas,
perhaps orientation at the hospitals

00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:04.456
so that thereís sort of a module
that explains some of the ways

00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:07.563
that one can think about
being a mentee.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.839
The other issue is to certainly
leverage the infrastructure

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.393
of already the hospitals,
the departments, et cetera

00:50:15.643 --> 00:50:17.358
and just to make it part of the

00:50:17.522 --> 00:50:21.347
faculty discussions,
part of sort of every area,

00:50:21.626 --> 00:50:22.666
whether itís a faculty meeting,

00:50:22.837 --> 00:50:24.415
perhaps you can do
mentor training

00:50:24.575 --> 00:50:27.201
because the faculty are already
there at the faculty meeting

00:50:27.885 --> 00:50:30.605
and theyíre not likely to show
up at other places sometimes.

00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:34.562
And then we talked about
some of the various models

00:50:34.984 --> 00:50:39.281
which could be junior faculty
doing peer mentoring.

00:50:39.863 --> 00:50:42.491
There could be a senior person
there or not there,

00:50:42.644 --> 00:50:44.774
so it could serve a
networking focus

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.804
and also to help the junior
faculty develop skills.

00:50:47.998 --> 00:50:50.750
There was a sense that many of the
junior faculty were told,

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.511
ìWell, donít mentor anyone because
that will ruin your own career.î

00:50:54.754 --> 00:50:56.869
And so weíre giving sort of
an early message

00:50:57.238 --> 00:51:00.592
and thatís not really what we want
to develop in the long run.

00:51:01.108 --> 00:51:03.732
And then Jessica brought
up some issues

00:51:03.862 --> 00:51:05.087
around serial mentoring.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.160
You may think of it from the
adolescent point of view,

00:51:08.321 --> 00:51:09.038
which is where I think of it,

00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:11.607
which is serial monogamy.

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:17.263
But certainly, to think
about the fact that

00:51:17.398 --> 00:51:20.567
one needs developmental networks
that Kathy Graham

00:51:20.719 --> 00:51:22.741
and David Thomas and
Monica Higgins

00:51:22.875 --> 00:51:24.010
and others have really
thought about

00:51:24.753 --> 00:51:29.527
in terms of a more broad-based
issue for our faculty.

00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:31.923
Whatís interesting is the
word Career Mentors

00:51:32.337 --> 00:51:33.641
is used very differently.

00:51:33.908 --> 00:51:36.400
In some places itís the scholarly

00:51:36.576 --> 00:51:37.625
or research mentoring

00:51:37.853 --> 00:51:40.311
and in other places itís somebody
worrying about your career,

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.623
whoís not your division chief.

00:51:42.274 --> 00:51:45.421
So, I think if we can develop
some common terminology,

00:51:45.766 --> 00:51:46.766
at least when we have
these meetings

00:51:46.872 --> 00:51:49.009
weíll know what each one
is talking about.

00:51:49.511 --> 00:51:50.926
But it was a very good
discussion.

00:51:51.072 --> 00:51:52.981
Weíd still be there in the living room

00:51:53.108 --> 00:51:54.682
if you hadnít brought us
back upstairs.

00:51:55.037 --> 00:51:56.037
So, thank you.

00:52:03.324 --> 00:52:04.324
I need to be mentored in a
most effective way

00:52:04.565 --> 00:52:05.766
to weave from back
to front

00:52:05.959 --> 00:52:06.959
and take the least
amount of time.

00:52:07.443 --> 00:52:08.837
We had a very good
discussion.

00:52:08.998 --> 00:52:10.958
We had representatives
from FAS,

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.175
from Harvard School of
Public Health

00:52:12.296 --> 00:52:13.173
and the medical school.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:14.433
And from the medical school,

00:52:14.585 --> 00:52:15.961
from both hospital

00:52:16.095 --> 00:52:18.007
and the medical school itself.

00:52:19.183 --> 00:52:21.055
And Iím going to go over
lots of discussion,

00:52:21.214 --> 00:52:22.281
lots of ideas thrown out.

00:52:22.403 --> 00:52:24.381
But going down across
the questions

00:52:24.534 --> 00:52:26.432
in terms of what are some of
the critical needs.

00:52:27.299 --> 00:52:29.081
Some of the areas that were
discussed were:

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.456
increasing knowledge
about multiple career paths

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:34.610
so that thereís not only
one path;

00:52:34.816 --> 00:52:37.418
being able to help people
with their transitions;

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.374
helping and encouraging
individuals to take risk

00:52:41.529 --> 00:52:43.615
and understanding that
advancement requires risk;

00:52:44.886 --> 00:52:47.269
this idea that all that weíre
focusing now on

00:52:47.537 --> 00:52:49.572
are those who are on the ladder

00:52:50.024 --> 00:52:51.770
and understanding
that we need

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:53.446
the mentoring across
the spectrum,

00:52:53.689 --> 00:52:54.382
and that many of the people

00:52:54.524 --> 00:52:55.932
at the early stages of the ladder

00:52:56.243 --> 00:52:59.159
transitioning to more
senior positions

00:52:59.328 --> 00:53:01.139
and they need that same kind
of advice and mentoring.

00:53:02.094 --> 00:53:05.921
So, keeping something in
place across the spectrum.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.841
There needs to be a mechanism
for acknowledging

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.403
and dealing with
anti-mentoring.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.734
And the other one was:

00:53:17.322 --> 00:53:19.994
the mentees and whatís
needed for them

00:53:20.165 --> 00:53:22.965
is this network of those both
inside and outside.

00:53:23.175 --> 00:53:24.769
So, much of our focus today

00:53:24.959 --> 00:53:28.942
has been on the mentoring within
our institution but equally,

00:53:28.988 --> 00:53:30.981
thereís a need to create
the networks

00:53:31.018 --> 00:53:33.588
and the supports outside
of our institutions.

00:53:34.408 --> 00:53:35.377
In terms of some of the roles

00:53:35.528 --> 00:53:37.472
and responsibilities for mentors
and mentees:

00:53:38.364 --> 00:53:39.548
with regard to the mentors,

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.887
they talked about a
cultural competence

00:53:42.174 --> 00:53:43.134
and a holistic approach;

00:53:44.813 --> 00:53:46.468
knowledge for the
mentor themselves,

00:53:46.643 --> 00:53:47.755
that you just donít
need one mentor

00:53:48.067 --> 00:53:49.515
but you need multiple mentors,

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.244
and this issue of it being quality

00:53:52.414 --> 00:53:54.526
and not quantity in terms
of the mentor.

00:53:55.129 --> 00:53:56.129
And for the mentees:

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:58.799
this idea of paying it forward
at all levels,

00:53:59.057 --> 00:54:00.486
that someone can mentor
someone else

00:54:00.622 --> 00:54:01.454
who is coming behind them.

00:54:03.141 --> 00:54:05.182
In terms of some of the
policies and practices,

00:54:05.764 --> 00:54:08.012
we talked about something
called mentor domains.

00:54:08.189 --> 00:54:09.238
Somebody mentioned
mentor domains

00:54:09.357 --> 00:54:11.660
and they talked about four
domains practice

00:54:12.022 --> 00:54:14.005
or what I call part of the
scholarship or discipline;

00:54:14.534 --> 00:54:15.718
second being promotion

00:54:16.054 --> 00:54:17.350
and understanding the system there;

00:54:18.219 --> 00:54:19.732
the third academic productivity

00:54:20.375 --> 00:54:21.957
and the fourth, environmental

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:24.486
and things such as work
life balance.

00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:29.964
The other component dealt with

00:54:30.783 --> 00:54:32.837
more of the institutional aspects

00:54:33.175 --> 00:54:35.095
and what institutions or
departments could do.

00:54:35.708 --> 00:54:37.741
We talked about ways in
which departments

00:54:37.926 --> 00:54:39.525
or institutions could support
the mentoring

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.042
by offering other programs.

00:54:41.832 --> 00:54:43.868
It was mentioned from the
Psychiatry Department

00:54:45.134 --> 00:54:46.570
where these writing seminars

00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:49.937
and what they call
charisma conferences.

00:54:50.762 --> 00:54:53.075
We also talked about faculty
development sessions.

00:54:55.129 --> 00:54:57.636
It was mentioned that there was a
need for mechanisms

00:54:57.812 --> 00:54:59.180
to make matches for
individuals

00:54:59.347 --> 00:55:01.333
to be more aware of whoís in
the environment

00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:03.171
and who may be able to
help them.

00:55:03.877 --> 00:55:04.751
And Harvard School of
Public Health

00:55:04.896 --> 00:55:07.945
talked about their going to
put in a mentor registry.

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:10.429
We talked about the need for

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.461
rewards or rewards for
mentoring;

00:55:12.929 --> 00:55:14.841
having mentoring
resources available,

00:55:15.064 --> 00:55:16.064
something that might
be online;

00:55:16.257 --> 00:55:19.224
the training and teaching
of mentors.

00:55:19.893 --> 00:55:21.021
And then they talked aboutó

00:55:21.174 --> 00:55:22.315
and it was alluded it
to an ombudsó

00:55:22.491 --> 00:55:24.275
somebody early on alluded
to an ombudsó

00:55:24.417 --> 00:55:25.556
but it was stated that in

00:55:25.677 --> 00:55:27.197
and of itself would
not be adequate.

00:55:28.168 --> 00:55:30.221
Anybody from our group
that has other things,

00:55:30.379 --> 00:55:31.243
that I might have left out?

00:55:33.857 --> 00:55:34.857
Thank you.
