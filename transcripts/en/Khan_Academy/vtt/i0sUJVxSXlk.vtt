00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.090
is discuss affirmative action

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.630
and it can be a sensitive topic,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.730
so I encourage folks to
engage on the message boards

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.020
but to do so respectfully.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.000
So, the first question is
what is affirmative action?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
So, generally speaking you could view it

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.670
as efforts to improve opportunities

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.390
for underrepresented groups

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.050
and oftentimes it will be
for underrepresented racial

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.592
or ethnic groups or for women.

00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:31.240
To help us think through
the types of efforts

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.580
that might be classified

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.890
or that might be associated
with affirmative action

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.290
we can set up a little
bit of a spectrum here.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.820
At one end of the spectrum

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060
you could have outright quotas.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.420
These could be situations

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.190
where say a university
admissions department

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.850
says we're going to say 10% of our class

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.750
is gonna be from this
group or from that group.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.310
In between you could have race
or gender-aware admissions

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.600
where it is a factor in admissions.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Race/gender is a factor.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.250
And at this end of the spectrum

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.090
there's outreach to groups

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.740
to make sure that people
who could be qualified

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.410
who are from underrepresented
groups are applying,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.083
so this would be outreach.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.350
Now, in popular language today,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.960
affirmative action
tends to refer to things

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.750
more on this end of the spectrum

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.700
and the phrase affirmative action

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.880
first comes into popular usage

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.530
during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.760
Now, as you can imagine

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.450
this is a very sensitive topic

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.283
because on one hand

00:01:33.283 --> 00:01:34.650
folks could say yes,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.020
it would be nice to give opportunity

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.610
for folks who historically
have not had opportunity

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.350
or folks who are
historically underrepresented

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.670
but other people might say

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.650
well, shouldn't we be
a race blind society?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.700
If you are factoring race for one group,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.410
well, doesn't that hurt another group

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.860
and couldn't it cause
reverse discrimination?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.000
And to appreciate the legal history here,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.550
we can go back to 1978

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.110
where we have the case
Regents of the University

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.720
of California v. Bakke in the
United States Supreme Court

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.950
and this is a situation

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.120
where Bakke is a former
solider and engineer

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.070
who also happens to be white

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.760
who wants to go to medical school.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.320
He gets rejected by the
University of California

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.610
at Davis and he claims

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.790
that there was reverse
discrimination at play

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.070
because they had a quota system.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.650
16 out of the 100 seats
at the medical school

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.000
were reserved for
underrepresented minorities

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.030
and the Supreme Court actually had trouble

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.420
deciding on this case.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.280
It was a very divided opinion

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.350
and eventually Justice Powell's opinion

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.090
became the opinion that
people paid attention to.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.590
And it was a little bit mixed.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.730
It said that outright
quotas are unconstitutional

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.070
and that Bakke should be allowed admission

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.200
and he was able to go

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.960
to University of California,
Davis Medical School

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.710
but Justice Powell tried
to thread the needle

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.150
by saying even though quotas

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.690
might be unconstitutional

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.650
it is okay to consider race
as a factor in admissions

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.130
especially if it's being used
for the educational benefit

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.120
of diversity of the community.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.900
In 1996 the voters of California

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.230
actually voted directly on this issuer

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.840
and they passed the California
Civil Rights Initiative

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.333
more commonly know as Proposition 209

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.953
and this proposition made it illegal

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:21.940
to consider race, sex or
ethnicity when it came

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.300
to government jobs or admissions

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.190
in state schools.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.880
It has been challenged by
proponents of affirmative action

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.250
many time but all of those challenges

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.150
have been unsuccessful to date.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.750
These issues surface
again in the Supreme Court

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.750
in 2003 when we get to the
Grutter versus Bollinger case.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.770
This case has some
parallels to the Bakke case.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.850
In this case Grutter is a white applicant

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.320
to the University of Michigan Law School

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.370
who claims that she was denied admission

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.500
because the Law School was
giving racial preference

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.430
which was causing essentially
reverse discrimination.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.430
The Supreme Court rules against Grutter

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.890
but it's really interesting
to read the majority opinion

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.540
written by Sandra Day O'Connor

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.260
and the dissenting opinion
from Clarence Thomas

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.070
because it gives us some texture

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.130
into the nuances of these decisions.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.010
Here is an excerpt

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.633
from Sandra Day O'Connor's
majority opinion.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.460
We last addressed the use of race

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.800
in public higher education
over 25 years ago.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.870
In the landmark Bakke case,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.240
we reviewed a racial set-aside program

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480
that reserves 16 out of 100 seats

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.060
in a medical school class

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.550
for members of certain minority groups.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.660
Since this Court's
splinter decision in Bakke,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.270
Justice Powell's opinion

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.260
announcing the judgment of the court

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.940
has served as the touchstone
for constitutional analysis

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.220
of race-conscious admissions policies.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.610
And then she goes on to list

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.210
the situations that Justice Powell

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.537
said were not okay to justify race

00:04:52.537 --> 00:04:54.890
as a factor in admissions.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.230
Justice Powell rejected an interest

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.200
in reducing the historic deficit

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.330
of traditionally disfavored minorities

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.410
in medical schools

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.280
and in the medical profession

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.440
as an unlawful interest
in racial balancing.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.600
So, according to Justice
Powell in the Bakke case,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.450
you can't justify
race-conscious admissions

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.120
to try to fix historic deficits.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.650
Sandra Day O'Connor goes on to write

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.800
Justice Powell in the Bakke case

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.330
rejected an interest in
remedying societal discrimination

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.680
because such measures would risk placing

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.480
unnecessary burdens on
innocent third parties

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.130
who bare no responsibility

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.040
for whatever harm the beneficiaries

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.970
of the special admissions program

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.590
are thought to have suffered.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.780
So, you also can't have
race-conscious admissions

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.350
if the goal is to remedy
current societal discrimination

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.410
because if you're benefiting someone,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.810
you're also putting the burden on people

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.150
who might have nothing to do

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.960
with that societal discrimination.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.360
And then she goes on to write

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.680
that in the Bakke case Justice Powell

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.320
approved the university's
use and here we're talking

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.030
about the University of California's use

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.446
of race to further only one interest,

00:06:00.446 --> 00:06:04.330
the attainment of a diverse student body.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.020
And now in this part of the excerpt

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.840
she shifts to talking
about the case at hand

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.280
in Grutter versus Bollinger

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.290
where we're talking about admissions

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.511
to the University of Michigan Law School.

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:16.350
As part of its goal of assembling a class

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.790
that is both exceptionally
academically qualified

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.100
and broadly diverse,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.930
the Law School seeks to enroll

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.820
a critical mass of minority students.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.140
The Law School's concept of critical mass

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.000
is defined by reference to
the educational benefits

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.810
that diversity is designed to produce.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.130
These benefits are substantial.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.240
As the district court emphasized

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.730
the Law School's
admissions policy promotes

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.640
cross-racial understanding,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.050
helps to break down racial stereotypes

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.860
and enables students to better understand

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.300
persons of different races.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.590
We, the majority in the Supreme Court,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.340
agree that in the context of
its individualized inquiry

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.410
into the possible diversity contributions

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.870
of all applicants,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.150
the Law School's race-conscious
admissions program

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.450
does not unduly harm
non-minority applicants.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.280
In summary, the Equal Protection Clause

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.560
of the 14th Amendment

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.520
does not prohibit the Law
School's narrowly tailored use

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.620
of race in admissions decisions

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.610
to further a compelling interest

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.920
in obtaining the educational benefits

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.810
that flow from a diverse student body.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.900
So, in this situation the majority opinion

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.740
that's penned by Justice O'Connor

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.330
is clarifying Powell's statement in Bakke

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.120
saying that diversity is a
legitimate educational benefit

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.850
that universities can optimize around

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.460
as long as race is one of many factors

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.223
in the admissions process.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.323
Now, on the other hand,

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:44.500
you have the dissenting opinion

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.500
from Justice Clarence Thomas.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.480
Here is an excerpt he wrote.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.260
I believe blacks can
achieve in every avenue

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.270
of American life without the meddling

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.290
of university administrators.

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.090
Because I wish to see all students succeed

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.460
whatever their color,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.210
I share in some respect the sympathies

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.850
of those who sponsor the
type of discrimination

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.620
advanced by the University
of Michigan Law School.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.750
The Constitution does
not, however, tolerate

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.050
institutional devotion to the status quo

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.670
in admissions policies

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.930
when such devotion ripens
into racial discrimination.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.920
So, he's calling the University
of Michigan Law School's

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.640
admissions policies
outright discrimination.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.780
He's saying that look,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.500
even though it might be the status quo,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.210
it's essentially what
a lot of universities

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.890
have been doing since Bakke.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.900
It's not okay because it has ripened

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.720
into racial discrimination.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.770
The majority, he's
talking about the majority

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.110
of the Supreme Court upholds

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.193
the Law School's racial discrimination

00:08:42.193 --> 00:08:45.200
not by interpreting the
people's Constitution,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.700
so the US Constitution

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.710
but by responding to a faddish slogan

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.440
of the cognoscenti.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.090
So, here he's making reference
to this idea of diversity

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.330
which he's calling a faddish
slogan of the cognoscenti.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.960
Cognoscenti would be people

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.130
who are in the know,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.110
or people who think they're in the know.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.890
Nevertheless, I concur in part

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.560
in the Court's opinion.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.490
I agree with the Court's holding

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.600
that racial discrimination in
higher education admissions

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.220
will be illegal in 25 years.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.430
And here he's making reference

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.220
that in Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.500
she did say that in 25 years

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.740
it might not be okay to have
race-conscious admissions.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.820
I respectfully dissent

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.520
from the remainder of the Court's opinion

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.980
and the judgment, however,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.530
because I believe that the
Law School's current use

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.810
of race violates the
Equal Protection Clause

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.120
and that the Constitution
means the same thing today

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.120
as it will in 300 months.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.110
So, here he's saying look,

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.880
if the majority thinks
that it's right now okay

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.110
to have race-conscious admissions

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.810
but it's not okay in 25 years,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.850
well, what's gonna change
about the Constitution?

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.150
If it's going to be
unconstitutional in 25 years,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.750
it should be unconstitutional today.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.201
Finally, he goes on to say

00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:59.000
the Constitution abhors
classifications based on race

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.860
not only because those classifications

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.690
can harm favored races

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.970
or are based on illegitimate motives

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.780
but also because every time
the government places citizens

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.210
on racial registers

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.370
and makes race relevant to
the provision of burdens

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.320
or benefits, it demeans us all.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.070
I encourage you to think about it.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.980
Are you more on the side of Justice Powell

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.270
or Sandra Day O'Connor

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.790
where race is a legitimate
factor in admissions

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.340
especially if it's in service

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.100
to diversity which is considered

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.630
a benefit for an educational community

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.250
or you more on the side of Justice Thomas

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.740
and Proposition 209 in California

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.310
saying that look, we need
to be racially blind.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.140
The 14th Amendment, the
Equal Protection Clause

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.930
of the 14th Amendment says

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.080
that we should be a racially blind country

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.290
and that every time we
try to involve race,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.760
it might do more harm than good.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.613
You decide.
