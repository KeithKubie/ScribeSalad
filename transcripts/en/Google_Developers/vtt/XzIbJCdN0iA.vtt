IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.740
I'm Ibrahim Ulukaya from
YouTube API Developer

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.150
Relations Team, and today we
will talk about the Live

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.280
Streaming API, and we will
showcase the great

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.520
integration.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.950
It's called RadioLine.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.620
Actually, they were one of the
first integrators of the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.590
YouTube Live Streaming API.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.100
And today, we will showcase
API with the guys--

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.820
the folks from RadioLine
themselves.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.060
The CEO of RadioLine,
Thomas Serval, will

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.530
be joining me today.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.760
And Samuel Landau is the
CTO of RadioLine.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.886
And we'll talk about
RadioLine.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:50.300
Hey, Thomas, how are you?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.860
THOMAS SERVAL: I'm
fine, thank you.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.590
Hello, Ibrahim.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.920
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Thanks
so much for

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.360
joining me here today.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.900
Maybe let's talk about
what is RadioLine?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.430
What's the product itself?

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.100
THOMAS SERVAL: So RadioLine
has one goal.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.330
It's to make your radio
universally

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.840
available across the world.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.350
And the first thing we wanted
to do is to make sure we are

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.200
the number one video site
and one of the best

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.000
websites in the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.655
So we wanted to be present on
YouTube as a first move and as

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.238
a first product for
the company.

00:01:23.238 --> 00:01:27.070
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: And how did
you come up with the idea?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.720
Right now, we know that
RadioLine line is creating

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.920
this [INAUDIBLE] experience
on YouTube.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.810
How does the idea came from?

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.360
THOMAS SERVAL: Well, actually,
I used to be a YouTuber

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.130
before, and one of the things
that I had to do

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.350
is to travel a lot.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680
And I'm also a big radio fan.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.470
So when I wanted to listen to
my favorite radio, I was

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.835
watching a lot of YouTube
channels, but I had to switch

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.190
to another website.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.560
And also, I was doing other
things while working, and I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.440
wanted to listen to
my favorite radio.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.110
So I said this is stupid.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.350
Why don't we use YouTube,
which has a great search

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.009
engine, to find out what is
going on live on radio and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.520
make them available
by live streaming?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.690
So I started discussing
with you guys, and you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.800
came up with the API.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.180
And we said, OK, now it's
becoming possible.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.730
So that's how we end up having
this idea of making radios

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.651
available on YouTube.

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:23.770
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: That's great.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.105
Can you just show us a bit of
the demo itself, the website

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.452
and the actual YouTube
channel?

00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:32.420
THOMAS SERVAL: Yeah, so
with great pleasure.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.360
It's a big task, so I
just want to make

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.083
sure that we are not--

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.750
we are just available
right now in France.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.620
And let me share my screen
and walk you through the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.910
experience we envision.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.010
So you have to speak a little
bit of French, but I'm going

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.270
to do the real-time
translation.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.110
This is our website right
now for French radio.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.285
It's called
youtube.com/radiolinefr, and

00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:06.260
there's a little video that
explains how it works.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:12.130
I don't know if you can
hear the sound.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.700
But this is what you can do,
is you can listen to any of

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.490
your favorite radio by searching
it inside the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.980
YouTube search engine.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.280
So, for instance, one of my
favorite radio could be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.950
RTL or Europe 1.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.030
And we have categorized
all the radios.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.110
So, for instance, I'm looking
for [INAUDIBLE] containing

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.010
food, or I'm looking
for talk radio, or

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.600
I'm looking for live.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.255
So I will choose Europe 1, which
is a news radio, and

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:58.050
live you can listen to what's
going on on Europe 1.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.060
And you have next to the title
of the radio the metadata, so

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.770
what's actually on air.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.530
And that's actually not so easy,
so in real time, we are

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.630
changing the description of
the video so people know

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.880
what's being aired
at every moment.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.190
And if you like this radio, then
on the right side, you

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.160
have suggestion of other radio
or other programs that are

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.110
live at the same time
that you might be

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.280
interested in listening.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830
So I like news.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.080
Maybe I want to listen to
business news, so I will click

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.110
on the right side, and
I will switch to the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.590
news in real time.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.660
And you see we have the programs
that is on the bottom

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.680
left side with the name
and the schedule.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.270
So It gives a lot of information
to the user so

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.480
they can navigate between their
favorite radio programs.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.790
So right now, this is available
for 50 French

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.120
radios, but we are going to
extend it to all news, talk,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.840
and sports radio across the
world in the coming months.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.380
I think that's about it at the
moment, but we are thinking

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.780
about adding new features.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.350
And as soon as the new features
are implemented also

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.230
in the Live API, we
can enhance the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.350
experience on the radio.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.320
So we have a lot of feedback
from earlier beta testers

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.540
about having more information
being shown on the screen, and

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.170
it will automatically show more
information about the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.300
radio and the programming
live.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.390
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: That's
great, actually.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.910
Maybe actually we can see
a little bit from my own

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.265
computer and hear the audio and
see one of the channels?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.550
So let's go to Europe 1.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.160
THOMAS SERVAL: I'll let you
hear one of the channels.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.150
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.450
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Thomas, explain
it to the users--

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.644
THOMAS SERVAL: That's a French
weather forecast.

00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:04.580
They tell you that there is
a little heat wave around

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.410
France, so I hope
you want visit

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.558
this part of the country.

00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:12.190
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: So yeah,
that like one of the

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.240
streams over there.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.170
Yeah, maybe it's a good time
to actually go in depth a

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.490
little bit about the
API integrations.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.450
Since you're already doing the
live streaming using the Live

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.050
Stream platform for this, also
you are one of the first

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.910
integrators of the API, maybe
at this time somehow the CTO

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.720
of RadioLine can join me and can
help explain about how the

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560
integration went so far
and what are the other

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.885
expectations on the
API itself.

00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:41.590
SAMUEL LANDAU: Hi.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.285
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: So how was
your app implemented?

00:06:43.285 --> 00:06:45.394
Can you talk a little bit?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.850
SAMUEL LANDAU: So I sent
you a diagram.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.060
Maybe you can show it?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:03.630
So basically, we have
implemented connectors from

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:10.390
our RadioLine service that use
the radio audio streams to

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.430
encode the video stream
that we send to

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.660
YouTube Live Stream.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.320
And on the other hand, we have
made an automaton that

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.650
regularly updates the
metadata for the

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.274
YouTube live broadcast.

00:07:28.274 --> 00:07:31.480
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: So actually,
as well as your Live

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.790
Streaming, too, you are also
updating the your metadata all

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.522
the time with your app, right?

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.940
SAMUEL LANDAU: Yes.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:44.580
So the RadioLine service
platform is providing this

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.980
metadata, and so we just had
to make a program which is

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.910
both a client from RadioLine and
a client to YouTube Live

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.130
APIs, and also encode this video
with information and

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.120
creating metadata and the
audio radio stream.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.110
Actually, we had to do
a quick [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:15.445
implementation, so we first
made a PHP implementation.

00:08:15.445 --> 00:08:19.960
So actually, that's
a web service.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.070
And our next implementation
will be a [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:32.200
server with some back office
functionalities I did.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.000
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Was there
anything surprising while you

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.289
were using the API itself?

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.220
Because actually you started
really early testing the API,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.522
even before the other uses.

00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:46.540
SAMUEL LANDAU: Yes.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.766
We had a lot of surprises.

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:57.630
But I was surprised by the
swiftness of API updates on

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:06.805
YouTube behalf when they were
requesting some new parameters

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:08.340
or functionality.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.090
And like the day after or two
days after, it was available,

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.100
so I was impressed.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.630
Also, what surprised us a lot
was the fast indexing of the

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.360
live broadcast.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.390
Actually, the live broadcasts
have this 24-hour limitation,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:35.030
so we have to recreate
them every day since

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.650
our radios are 24/7.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.720
So every day, we recreate the
live broadcasts, and we did

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.070
not expect for these live
broadcasts to be indexed so

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.189
quickly in the YouTube engine.

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:52.460
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: I see.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.430
And for like a counterintuitive
thing, you

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.960
actually mentioned about the
24-hour limitation, right?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.640
You actually had to create
your own, I think,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.420
refresher for that?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.950
SAMUEL LANDAU: Yes.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:10.160
We had to make a kind of back
office that permits this live

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.500
broadcast recreation to overcome
the limitation.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.210
While we understand that most
live events are short-lived,

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:27.320
but for our needs, our specific
needs as a RadioLine

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.450
service, we need it 24/7.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.570
Radios do not stop streaming.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.200
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: I think you
also ask it as a feature, and

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.690
hopefully, we may get to that.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.220
Have you actually tried the
other APIs, like data API?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.200
And have you ever used
the other APIs on

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.110
top of the Live Streaming?

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.350
SAMUEL LANDAU: Yes, actually.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.000
Thomas mentioned the channel
and the playlist.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.082
We automated their management,
so we are using that API

00:10:59.082 --> 00:11:02.805
literally, actually.

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:05.230
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: And can you
give us a little bit more on

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.940
the feedback side or the other
features you want to implement

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.800
and you want to see in the Live
Streaming API, or could

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.630
be the data API or other
APIs as well?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.090
SAMUEL LANDAU: We plan on
adding some back office

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:28.210
functionality so that we can
offer a service to radios in

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.910
the streams.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:37.680
So we will need richer
live queue codes.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.460
Today it's a bit limited.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:52.080
Also, for live radios, the
description includes the

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.020
program of the radio, so we will
very much like to have a

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:08.180
description that updates
in the user's screen.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.120
Today they are static.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.710
Also, we think it would be nice
to have annotations like

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.870
in the YouTube service.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.880
We understand that for live
event, it has many new

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.530
constraints.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.990
But we think it will
be very nice.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.380
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: OK, great.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.385
Maybe this time I can go back to
my own screen and a little

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:37.690
bit summarize actually what they
were doing at RadioLine.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.390
As you know, YouTube has a Live
Streaming platform, and

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.050
we also made available
the API itself.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.540
So by using the Live Streaming
platform, they're actually

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.150
streaming all these videos they
are sending to YouTube,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.460
and actually those videos are
available as live streaming.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.820
And at the same time, what they
did is they actually used

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.160
the API to create
those events.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.560
Other than creating them again
and again, they actually use

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.220
an automation tool which they
actually create all

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.050
this using the API.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.270
They set the streams.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.990
They were able to update all the
metadata on top of them,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.040
and they use it as creating
the new events, or rather,

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.820
refreshing the events,
and they use the

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.170
API from that side.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.500
And I guess it was like the most
of the talk, and maybe I

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.330
can just show a few other radios
that are available from

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.490
the RadioLine.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.070
As you guys see, they actually
have not only one stream, they

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.190
actually have a few streams
going on at the same time.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.740
All the radios are available
through the channel, which

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.980
they created multiple
events in there on

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.070
their own YouTube channel.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:55.570
And saying that, I guess that
was most of the RadioLine and

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.250
how they use the Live
Streaming API.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.990
Thanks so much for joining
me, guys, today.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:06.060

also challenging a lot of you
guys trying to be a tester,

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.400
development, and went so far to
create an amazing platform

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.690
on top of the YouTube
Live Streaming.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.800
