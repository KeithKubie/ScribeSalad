[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:05.527
KENNY NGUYEN: All
right, guys, we're

00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:06.350
going to have a
little bit of fun.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.750
But before we have a
little bit of fun today,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.330
I'd like you all to
get to know about me.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.590
So a little about me is-- can
we pull up the slides, please?

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.610
--is I love creating
amazing presentations.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.590
And when it comes to
amazing presentations,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.490
this is what I love right here.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.352
It's very detailed--
this guy right here

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:28.310
is like there's no way.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.580
I'm joking with you.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.780
Really what I love
doing is simplicity,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.840
but before we get
really into what

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.649
I love doing in
presentations-- I

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.690
feel like this just killed
half of this audience,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.830
thinking oh my God,
what did I sit down?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.310
Let me introduce a
little bit about me.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.270
And so a little bit about me is
that I am a proud Cajun-Asian

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.810
born from Louisiana.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.470
I am from Baton Rouge, and this
is actually me in my thug life

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.670
years about 10 years ago.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.020
So I had a very interesting
creative journey.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740
And during this time, we had
a lot of different things

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.010
that I loved doing, such as
I loved playing music-- which

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.209
is actually a funny story.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.957
This is my co-founder
Gus right here,

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.040
that's him all the way to
the right with the Afro.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.760
We played a lot
of music together,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.840
and I always thought that being
a musician would be my calling.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.400
I wasn't that good.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.440
And Gus would probably
say I was kind of good,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.590
but he's being nice,
don't believe him.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.480
And I figured at that point
that maybe creativity in music

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.380
wasn't for me.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.640
So I decided to go
on a different path.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.680
And the next path I came on
was I wanted to be a chef.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.930
And I trained for four years as
a cook in Asian food-- sushi--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140
but also I trained
in Italian food.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.640
I really thought
that this was going

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.750
to be my calling in creativity.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.070
It wasn't, I lost a
culinary scholarship

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.690
because I missed a competition.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.580
And because of that, I
actually left the country

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.920
and went to Vietnam
to go find myself.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.470
And in Vietnam, I
had this crazy idea.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.140
It was-- I always
loved the subject

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.570
creativity and communication
and conversation.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.460
Music, food were really intimate
ways to communicate that,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.720
but is there another way that I
can communicate and help others

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.670
with my passion of
communication and conversation--

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.170
whether it's through
music or food?

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.140
And decided how about I just
go to college-- at this point,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.170
this is when I was in
high school-- I actually

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.727
go in and create a
student organization.

00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.810
And so I created an
organization-- how many people

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.270
know where LSU is?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.380
I'm a very proud LSU
Tiger fan, and at LSU we

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.090
created an organization
called IME, which is I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.179
Am Entrepreneur.

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.470
And it was funny because I
had the student organization

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.070
and didn't own a business.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.710
And it was even
crazier that I managed

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.230
to get a lot of really
great CEOs in the room,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.740
locally, talking about
entrepreneurship.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.700
And it made me think
what if I could

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.380
help these guys with their
PowerPoint presentations

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.660
because they were so boring?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.380
And it was just in
the back of my head.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.940
But the story gets even funnier.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.920
I remember-- it was in January
2012, it was actually me

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.240
and Gus-- we were sitting
in a room for our student

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.560
organization, and I remember
there was a Fortune executive

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.470
coming to speak to us.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.360
And I remember I was so
excited-- I was young,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.570
I was naive, and I
thought Fortune executive,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.010
he must be an amazing presenter.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.060
There's no way he could be bad.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.010
Well, soon lo and
behold, I remember

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.980
he walked up and
had a USB drive.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.080
And he plugged in
his slide deck,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.880
I remember seeing
in there 200 slides

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.480
at the bottom right
corner of his PowerPoint.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.900
I'm thinking oh shit,
and at this point

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.050
this guy-- scheduled for an
hour-- went on for three hours,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.730
reading off every single slide.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.000
And to make it even
worse, this guy started

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.464
telling his own jokes,
answering his own questions--

00:03:47.464 --> 00:03:48.880
And as I was sitting
there it made

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.210
me think-- if the world
and these companies

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.270
are presenting
like this, chances

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.650
are the next big
idea won't be heard.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.610
And that's when we had
an idea of why don't we

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.210
create a firm that can
help these executives,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.430
help these companies create
amazing presentations?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.360
And that's when we had the
idea of Big Fish Presentations.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.320
And we never thought
the idea would take off,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.404
it was a college start-up.

00:04:11.404 --> 00:04:12.778
It was one of
those ideas that we

00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:15.160
had where why don't we just
help a couple companies here

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.079
and there?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.260
But soon enough, people
started noticing us.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.579
We got in Inc. Magazine as
one of Inc.'s coolest college

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.410
start-ups, that was really neat.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.700
And that's when the
Fortune companies actually

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.170
came calling us
and saying, can we

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.150
get you guys to help
with our presentations?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.740
And we thought maybe we have
a really cool and crazy idea,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.220
and we should just run with it.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.807
And so as we evolved more,
Entrepreneur covered us,

00:04:37.807 --> 00:04:39.390
and we started getting
more clientele.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.560
We worked with clientele
like Ted, Verizon, and GE.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.170
And soon enough, we actually
worked with this guy.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.716
And it was really
cool because we

00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.590
worked with this
organization called the Hult

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.410
Prize down in-- actually here.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.420
It was during the Clinton Global
Initiative, the huge summit

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.290
they had down here.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.520
The Hult Prize is $1 million
for the biggest college

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.980
start-up that's
helping the world--

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.070
and in nonprofit as well.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.470
And what was so cool is
that we helped a Dubai team,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.990
and it was such an
amazing experience.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.940
Because after the whole entire
show we helped the Dubai team,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.900
Bill Clinton walked up
to us, shook our hand,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.022
and said that was an
amazing presentation.

00:05:19.022 --> 00:05:20.730
And that's when we
thought OK, wow, we're

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.021
actually doing something right.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.340
So this is some validation.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.389
So a little bit about me was
that that's our journey so far.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.930
And from that, we
have a book-- which

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.055
is actually located right
over there, "The Big Fish

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:30.570
Experience."

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.880
But even further and even
better than all this is now

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.872
my girlfriend agreed to marry
me, and so I'm now engaged.

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:38.330
And so I joke with
her all the time

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.079
when I show this slide-- was
it all that that led to this?

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.370
She's like no, don't show that.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.205
But a little bit about me,
I'm a very happy engaged man.

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:46.830
This actually happened
at Disney World.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.440
But with all these things
that happened with Big Fish,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.580
we've learned there's
a process in creating

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.020
amazing presentations.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.370
And while I know you're so
interested to hear my story,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.670
I know you're really
interested in hearing how

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.090
to make amazing presentations.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.130
And we have a process, and
that process is actually

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.010
called the Big Fish Experience.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.040
And it's content,
design, and delivery

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.867
equals an amazing
presentation experience.

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:15.200
And we're going to go through
those three things today--

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.660
this content, design, delivery.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.150
I know we have a whole
entire range of people--

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.740
from designers,
to app designers,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.180
to even some business
development people in here--

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.550
so we're going to talk about
a lot of different ways.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.660
From the basics--
how can everyone

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.070
walk away here and create
an amazing presentation--

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.740
but even more, how do you find
a way to become the best version

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.650
of yourself as a presenter?

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.710
And the first thing
that we're going to do

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.910
is actually content.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.400
And so our content-- part of
the design delivery process

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.870
is that engaging
content always wins.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.300
But what does engaging
content really mean?

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.450
So with content, there's
four different things

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.470
that I always
recommend when it comes

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.190
to making a great presentation.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.670
And this goes from whether
it's a deck that you're

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.780
going to send out,
to a pitch deck,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.800
to even if you're
pitching an idea.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.555
And the first is that
every single presentation

00:07:05.555 --> 00:07:10.040
that you have should have
this thing called a big idea.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.340
And a big idea is an
idea that formulates

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.140
around the whole
entire presentation,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.730
it's your central argument.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.480
And by the way, in the
middle of this talk

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.621
we're actually going to create
a presentation from scratch.

00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.120
So we're going to
have a lot of fun.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.360
So the big idea is the
main central argument

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.410
of your presentation.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.300
It's what people are
compelled to believe in.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.850
And furthermore with that is
that every good presentation

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.940
should have a structure.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.240
So when I say structure--
how many people

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.630
here know about the rule
of three in presentations?

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.589
So the rule of three in
communication and presentations

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:43.880
is that if I tell you there
are six things to remember,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.150
there are five
things to remember,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.524
it's a little bit
more difficult.

00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:48.940
But if you're able to condense
your presentation down

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.840
into three easy
points-- they're, I say,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.780
Twitter handles-- you're more
likely to walk away and have

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.830
someone to be able to
retain the information.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.460
The next is a call to action.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.490
Every presentation--
I tell you this.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.130
When I think of the
word presentation,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.830
I don't think of just
the formal presentation

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.000
we're doing here on stage.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.445
I think of going home,
talking to my fiancee,

00:08:09.445 --> 00:08:11.070
and saying what do
you want for dinner?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.820
Then I present my ideas,
she presents her ideas,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.100
and we go back and forth.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.030
It can even be a
conversation, or if you're

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.200
pitching an idea such
as a design concept.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.670
Presentations can be anything.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.260
But here's the thing-- any
time when you go and present

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.100
an idea or just
an argument, it's

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.790
important to have
a call to action.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.870
And when I say call to action,
there are three different ones.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.490
One is an offer, such as
if you buy this, you'll

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.809
get X. Next is demand, do this.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.789
And the next and final one is
actually more of a question,

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:47.150
such as what if you went
home and ate a donut

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.325
and became happy?

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:49.700
And the reason
why I say donut is

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.830
that that's actually
the presentation

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.870
we're going to create.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.440
We're going to create a
live and full argument

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.190
on why everyone in
this room who might not

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.530
think donuts are healthy,
would now believe

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.610
that donuts are healthy.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.600
And so we're going to do it
with the same exact process.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.820
So from going around this
room, how many people

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.334
here actually love donuts?

00:09:10.334 --> 00:09:11.500
Good, there's not that many.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.250
I love this.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.900
All right, challenge accepted.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.600
So how many people here don't
think that donuts are actually

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.500
healthy for you?

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.700
Kind of wrong,
but it's all good.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.590
Donuts are delicious, though,
they're great for your mind.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.423
They make you happy.

00:09:24.423 --> 00:09:26.570
And so with that
being said, that

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.270
will be the central argument.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.830
The big idea is that for all
the donut lovers in here that

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.900
now have my back, we're going
to create and work on a reason

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.660
why everyone else in the
room should love a donut.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.260
So just going around, why
should people in this room

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.230
love donuts?

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.210
And this is where
I'm going to ask you

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.710
questions, because we're going
to come up with our own pitch

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.311
together.

00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:47.560
AUDIENCE: There are so many
different kinds of donuts.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.220
KENNY NGUYEN:
Exactly, there's so

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.010
many different kinds of donuts.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:50.609
What else?

00:09:50.609 --> 00:09:51.900
AUDIENCE: They taste delicious.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.910
KENNY NGUYEN: They
taste delicious.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.330
Come on guys, this is the
time to rise up and talk

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:57.873
about donuts.

00:09:57.873 --> 00:09:58.580
AUDIENCE: They're flling.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.102
KENNY NGUYEN: They're filling.

00:09:59.102 --> 00:10:00.280
AUDIENCE: They make you happy.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.714
KENNY NGUYEN: They
make you happy.

00:10:01.714 --> 00:10:02.900
AUDIENCE: Sugar rush.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.057
KENNY NGUYEN: Sugar rush.

00:10:04.057 --> 00:10:05.140
AUDIENCE: They're America.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.450
KENNY NGUYEN: They're
America, there you go.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.420
So let's create this
central argument.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.450
For the donut lovers
in here, what if we can

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.890
say that donuts make you happy?

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.140
That's a good enough reason
why people should believe,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.320
because I don't think anyone in
this room wants to be unhappy.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.020
Now let's think of
a call to action.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.550
And I always say when you create
a presentation-- no matter

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.020
what it is-- think about the
call to action at the end.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.490
Where do we want to lead people?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.630
Where do we want to take
them on this journey?

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.610
Because if you have a big
idea and you have an argument,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.240
there's always a chance
and there's always

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.770
a reason why you should create
your call to action first.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.140
And that's because
you should know where

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.450
you want to take your audience.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.152
So for us, then, donut
lovers-- call to action,

00:10:46.152 --> 00:10:47.360
let's be a little bit gentle.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.380
Let's say if we ask them
if you want to be happy,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.860
why don't you get a donut?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.880
Do you all feel like
that's an enticing enough

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.380
and non-forceful
enough conversation

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.640
for the non-donut
lovers in here?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.470
You think so?

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.100
Cool.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.080
So our main idea-- and
imagine this as a circle--

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.720
is that donuts make you happy.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.960
At the end of the
presentation, our big ask

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.510
is why don't you get a
donut to make you happy?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.890
Now comes the fun part
when it comes to structure,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.780
creating the three main
points to convince people.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.780
So I heard three main
points-- I probably

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.540
won't say it's
America for this case,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.290
but let's think of
some main points.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.980
If I were to come in right
now and pitch someone

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.188
that doesn't like donuts
why they should like donuts,

00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:30.854
and the main point is to make
them happy, what would you say?

00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:32.270
Start pointing at
different people

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.580
now is-- I heard earlier
that someone said that they

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.230
have a sugar rush, right?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.470
And you like sugar rushes.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.012
What's another one?

00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:44.470
And this is what we're going
to build up for our structure.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.330
They taste good.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.240
And tasting-- you like to eat
food that tastes good, right?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.250
Exactly.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.780
So let's say the main point
one is they taste good.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.290
What's main point two?

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.566
They're what?

00:11:55.566 --> 00:11:56.380
AUDIENCE: Cheap.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.800
KENNY NGUYEN: Cheap?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.450
America.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.530
[LAUGHS] So yeah, they're cheap.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.100
What else?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.225
Let's have our third point.

00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:04.260
Let's hit it home here.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:04.750
Come on, guys.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.500
We've got to help.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.672
AUDIENCE: Sugar helps your
brain function in the afternoon.

00:12:08.672 --> 00:12:10.880
KENNY NGUYEN: Damn, so that
was a really deep answer.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.338
So we're gonna
close off with that.

00:12:12.338 --> 00:12:13.219
So let's say this.

00:12:13.219 --> 00:12:14.760
If I came up and
pitched-- and I will

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.000
give this whole presentation
right now about donuts

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.580
is that, one, like,
they taste delicious.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.780
Two, they're cheap.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.170
But here's the thing,
being cheap and delicious

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.880
can actually make
you more productive,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.320
because a sugar rush will
help you out in the afternoon.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.160
And overall, if you're
more productive,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.620
you'll be more happy.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.422
There is a very
compelling reason

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.880
that everyone can walk out
right here, right now and think,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.450
I should go and get a donut.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.790
Now, to close this whole
entire presentation,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.680
pseudo-presentation
that we have right here,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.500
it's always important to
remember your introduction.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.619
And I say this with
so much importance,

00:12:48.619 --> 00:12:50.410
and I waited till the
end to tell you this,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.390
is that every presentation
should have an introduction

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.390
that's very memorable.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.550
And there are five
different ways

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.880
to have a great introduction.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.540
One is to build the emotional
connection through a story.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.580
Two is to tell a statistic.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.650
Three is to share a quote.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.500
Four is to actually
deliver media,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.299
whether I open up with a video
to kind of bring you all in,

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:12.590
make you all feel very
welcome-- 30 seconds to a minute

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.970
is what we normally, like,
recommend-- or fifth, I open

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.990
and tell a joke.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.160
Jokes are dangerous, as everyone
knows, because if falls flat,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.180
you're fighting an uphill slope
the rest of the presentation.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.410
But for the sake of this
one, how about I actually

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.650
give this presentation by
telling a story and using

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.390
all the points that
you delivered to me.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.370
So again, who are the people
that love donuts in this room?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.500
Get my back.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.000
Cool.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.860
That's a lot of people.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.700
We're going to convince
everyone else right now,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.920
through your support, that
they should love donuts,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.300
just from what you just said.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.660
So, when I was a
kid, my father used

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.770
to bring home donuts
for me all the time.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.890
And the reason why is
that he always told me,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.080
you need to eat breakfast.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.260
And I was a very energetic kid,
and for anyone that's actually

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.540
seen my TEDxTalk, I
actually shared a story

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.740
where I used to run around
all the time outside,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.280
and it drove him crazy.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.370
And he thought, you know
what, how about I just

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.680
stop feeding him donuts.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.230
And he noticed that my energy
levels really went down.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.780
And the thing is, he
wanted a happy kid.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.690
And so, why don't-- why did
he take that out of my diet?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.829
So it actually leads
to another story.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:23.370
About two years
later, I was actually

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.790
at my brother's birthday party.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.280
And in Louisiana, if you'll
ever go down to Baton Rouge,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.875
there's this wonderful place
called Mary Lee Donuts--

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:32.000
and I feel like I should
get a sponsorship for name

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.620
dropping them-- but a delicious
place called Mary Lee Donuts.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.590
I remember that my
dad took me here,

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.140
and he said, son, let
me tell you something.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.940
I love you very much-- and he
never says this, and tells me,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.820
furthermore, do
you want a donut?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.710
And I was like, yes, I do.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.315
And he said, well,
here's the thing.

00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:51.815
You know, we never get
to spend time together.

00:14:51.815 --> 00:14:54.570
Why don't you take a
donut and we can just

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.130
go and hang out and relax?

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.547
My father was always very busy,
so this meant a lot to me.

00:14:58.547 --> 00:15:00.046
And so that moment
there, I realized

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:01.580
that donuts made
me happy and that,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.450
if anyone ever asked
me about a donut

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.330
and we wanted to break
bread together, that this

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.609
was a really cool story.

00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:10.650
And so I want everyone
here to believe in donuts.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.770
So my presentation,
my argument to you

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.720
today is that donuts
can make you happy.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.340
And here are three reasons why.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.430
One is that they are delicious.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.830
Who doesn't like good food?

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.330
Good.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.150
No one raised their hand.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.420
I'm very happy about that.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.772
Two, who here wants to
spend a lot of money

00:15:30.772 --> 00:15:32.230
on something that
tastes delicious?

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.210
Sure, we can go, like, a three
Michelin star restaurant.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.501
Sure, we can go to a two,
one Michelin star restaurant.

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:38.640
But for just the
price of $2 or $5--

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.070
I'm using New York prices--
$2 to $5 right here,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.779
you can have a delicious donut
and really make you happy.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.570
But the third is the
most compelling point.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.629
Everyone here at Google here
I know works very, very hard.

00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:54.170
And I know that everyone here,
when they come in the morning,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.970
you're energetic.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.790
But as you go
throughout the day,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.415
the brain kind of drains down.

00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:00.270
You get tired.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.620
There's so much
bombardment in our lives.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.580
So what if there was a way,
what if there was a device

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.810
or something that we
can ingest, cheap,

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:13.810
that can totally make us
more effective as leaders

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.010
in the creative community?

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.560
And if we remember that
that device does exist,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.950
and it exists in this delicious,
small pastry called a donut,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.200
I believe then
that everyone here

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.717
will have a much more fulfilling
career and be much more happy.

00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:33.550
And that's why yo should
go and eat a donut.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.060
See?

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.150
That right there was
a very compelling way

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.790
to tell a story about the donut.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.955
And if you follow that
format exactly how I

00:16:39.955 --> 00:16:41.440
did in any of your
presentations--

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.080
say you have a big main idea.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.920
If you have a project coming
up, explain why the project

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.980
is the best for everybody.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.450
Next is to have
a call to action.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.820
What's your big ask at the end?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.350
What do you want
to lead them to?

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.182
Next, have your main points.

00:16:54.182 --> 00:16:55.390
What are your main arguments?

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.690
Just from those five
minutes right there,

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.450
we came up with an idea of
how to make other people that

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.210
don't love donuts love donuts.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.680
And finally, have an
introduction that's memorable.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.300
If you're sending
out a presentation,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.710
make it very simple in the
beginning with the design.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.480
You don't want to just
jump and bombard people

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.119
with a lot of clutter.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.760
However, if you're
going on stage,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.680
I always suggest share a story.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.390
That story is
actually a true story

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.569
that my dad always brings
home Mary Lee donuts.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.569
I'm always very
energetic as a person,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.310
so he actually cut
it off for a while.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.380
But then he took me
to the donut store

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.640
for my brother's birthday.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.549
That's a true story.

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:30.590
Now you actually know a
little bit more about me,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.145
and I'm sure that
everyone here today

00:17:33.145 --> 00:17:35.020
has a story about a
donut where they remember

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.520
the company that they were with,
and they want everyone else

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.760
to have that same happiness.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.350
And so that's
content right there,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.250
is that content can
be engaging if it

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.184
has a structure, a call to
action, and a big main idea.

00:17:45.184 --> 00:17:47.600
But the next thing that's so
important in the presentation

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.370
process is that we
actually have design.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.180
So how do you take content to
the next level with design?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.480
And the way that we
do that is that we

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.000
have a very simple equation.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.530
It's just simple, memorable,
and understandable.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.525
And so when it comes
to simple, memorable,

00:18:04.525 --> 00:18:06.270
and understandable
slides, I'll actually

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.750
share some slides that we
created with clients, including

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.586
one we did for the Hope
Prize for the Dubai team

00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:13.210
that I think you all
really would like.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.030
And so the first
thing is simplicity.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:19.520
So everyone-- have you all
heard of the KISS principle?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.800
Keep It Simple, Stupid?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.570
It's one of those things that
goes into slides completely

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.630
well, because if you're
giving a presentation,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.240
the focus should always be on
you, the presenter, and not

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.770
the presentation.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.640
Keep this in mind.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.350
People will always
remember the presenter more

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.490
than the presentation.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.960
And so when I say simplicity,
this is what I mean.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.640
This is actually a slide that
our team did for a client

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.160
where it's very, very simple.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.570
And the thing is, everyone
here is wondering,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.999
why don't I
understand that slide.

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:48.040
What is he trying to say.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.610
And that's what it should be,
is that, at the end of day,

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.080
I need to be here to present
it to you for it to make sense.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.809
However, after I
deliver my message,

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:57.100
this should ring home with you.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.920
And that's my first
message to you,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.470
is that, if you're
designing slides,

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:05.350
keep in mind is that if you
are needed there to deliver it,

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.200
that's a good slide.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.554
However, though, if they
can just read the slide

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:09.970
and you don't need
to be on stage,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.660
you're wasting your time.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:12.980
So think about it like this.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.030
Always keep it simple
when it comes to slides

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.560
because people need to see you.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.165
Next is being understandable.

00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:21.120
And so this slide
right here is a slide

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.540
that we actually send out.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.690
And it's not cluttered.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.410
And you exactly know where
your mind actually or your eyes

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.310
actually draw.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.080
So it's in the top corner
to the bottom to the left.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.580
And it's very, very simple,
but it's also understandable.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.820
You know exactly the way this
means with this infographic.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.520
Now, with simple
and understandable,

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.689
it should all come together.

00:19:40.689 --> 00:19:42.480
And I'll show you one
of my favorite slides

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.396
that we've ever created
at our firm, Big Fish.

00:19:44.396 --> 00:19:48.200
And it's this slide right here,
is that-- you might notice

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.495
it's kind of blurry, right.

00:19:49.495 --> 00:19:51.720
And you might thinking,
man, that's a really shitty

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.560
designed slide.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.750
And we did that on purpose.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.420
And the reason why is
that, for the Hope Prize,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.210
we had four amazing judges.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.310
They included Muhammad Yunus,
one of the Nobel Peace Prize

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.490
winners, and also
Sanjay Gupta from CNN.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.650
And what was so cool was that
we had an opportunity to tell,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.250
with our client, the
story of Harambee.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.040
And Harambee, you see, was a
very small little black box.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.850
This company
developed a black box

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:24.967
that can make glasses for
$5 for kids in urban slums.

00:20:24.967 --> 00:20:27.050
And that's amazing because,
if you think about it,

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.690
we can just go walk
outside this door

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.231
and walk, like, less than two
miles to go get a pair of Warby

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.510
Parker like right here.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.710
However, though, imagine
a kid in an urban slum

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.920
where they couldn't do that.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.810
Imagine not being able to
see, not being able to learn.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.600
What can we do to
make that happen?

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.120
And the thing is, we actually
thought to ourselves,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.530
what if the judges all
had perfect 20/20 vision?

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:50.422
How can they understand what
does it feel like to be blind?

00:20:50.422 --> 00:20:52.255
And so we created this
slide right here when

00:20:52.255 --> 00:20:55.190
we pitched to the company
was imagine if you were

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.630
a child growing up in Guatemala
and you couldn't see anything,

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.000
but you wanted to learn,
you wanted to lead,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.460
and you wanted to
do great things.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.990
But your sight isn't there.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.950
And if you want
to be better, you

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.426
need to see the people
that believe in you.

00:21:10.426 --> 00:21:12.050
And this is actually
what they pitched.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.470
They said, for those here,
who here has 20/20 vision?

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.000
And the judges raised their
hands, and we were right.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.020
And they never-- and
they asked, so you all

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.370
might not know what it's
be like to be blind.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.630
However, though, if
you're looking right here,

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.620
this is what it's like.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.000
But for $5, if you invest in
us today, you can do this,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.930
and a child can see and
make a huge difference.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:33.830
And they loved it.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.670
And that was one of
most memorable moments

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.369
in that whole
entire presentation.

00:21:37.369 --> 00:21:39.410
And it was one of those
feelings where I thought,

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.440
that's how design
can be memorable.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.450
So for anyone here
today can take away

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.980
something when it comes to
presentations, whether it's

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.320
with content but for
design, is that simplicity

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.830
wins because they need
you, as the presenter.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.680
They need to be understand
but, most of all,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.880
it needs to be memorable.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.830
There's no reason why
slides can't be fun.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.067
PowerPoint is fun.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.900
I know everyone, when
they come to our firm,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.140
they think, what can we
do besides PowerPoint?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.650
We have all these cool
tips and tricks in our bag,

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.030
but I always say, what's
wrong with PowerPoint?

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.780
You can do amazing
things with PowerPoint.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.404
This right here was
done in PowerPoint,

00:22:10.404 --> 00:22:13.620
but it delivered a
very effective message.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.430
So with content design comes
one the most important things,

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.340
and that's actually
rules of thirds

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.770
is that, with every
grid slide here--

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.950
how many people here are
photographers on their off time

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.550
here?

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.130
So what do you-- when you
think of the rule of thirds,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.956
you always think of
your central figure

00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:34.330
should not be in the center
when you're creating a slide.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.790
It's actually you want to be
able to position your figure,

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.550
wherever your main
point of focus

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.420
is, to the left or
the right so you have

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.360
a little bit of slide-- or
little bit of room to the left

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.047
or right to actually
put in there some words.

00:22:46.047 --> 00:22:48.630
That's what we recommend for a
lot of our presentation slides.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.470
For anyone going home
today and creating

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.960
their own presentation, think
about the rule of thirds.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.670
If you put it in the middle,
you're forcing something.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.520
But you're putting
to the left or right,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.969
you're actually coexisting.

00:22:57.969 --> 00:22:59.510
And that's what you
want with slides,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.380
is that you want to coexist
when it comes to photography.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.024
You never want to impose on top.

00:23:04.024 --> 00:23:05.440
And here's some
of our other sides

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.460
that we created,
is that, for this,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.820
when it comes to slides like
this, you think of photography.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.389
This is very, very, very
boring energy usage.

00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:15.680
How can you make this more fun?

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.846
And we see this in a lot
of corporate presentations,

00:23:17.846 --> 00:23:21.110
is that you actually think,
OK, this gets the point across,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.750
but how do you
make it memorable?

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.210
And this is what
I recommend doing.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.210
Let's bold the important
points, and let's throw

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.450
an image at the end.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.980
Next, what do you
think about when

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.470
you share a graph like this?

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.610
We all seen graphs
like this where

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.140
it's a chart or some kind
of information presented

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.270
and you think to
yourself, wow, what can we

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.750
do here to make it more fun?

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.480
Very simple.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.420
Why don't we turn
it into a graphic?

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.000
And it's simple tools like
this where you can do it

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.540
and where you can turn very
minute and boring information

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.520
into something fun
and more lively.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.772
Design should be fun.

00:23:51.772 --> 00:23:53.730
And the thing is, like,
how many people in here

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.688
are actually designers?

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.300
I'm not a designer, and
I'm proud not to be is

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.880
because if you learn these
simple design principles,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.400
anyone can become a great
presentation designer.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.660
And I say that is that there
are many tools out there.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.701
So this tool right here,
you can create something

00:24:09.701 --> 00:24:12.430
using Canva, for
example, a very popular--

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.290
Canva or Piktochart
is another one.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.920
And those tools can create
amazing infographics for you

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.040
very quickly.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.297
If you're ever in a rush
for presentations and you

00:24:21.297 --> 00:24:23.755
can't hire an agency or you
don't-- you can't just spawn it

00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:26.171
off to another designer, I
recommend there's a tool called

00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:29.220
Haiku Deck, and it actually puts
in your presentation content

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.470
for you and actually allocates
it into a way where it does not

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.900
feel like there's too much slide
or too much text per slide.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.060
But there are many
good tools out there

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.059
to make you an effective
presentation designer.

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:42.600
It's just very important to look
for them and to keep in mind

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.140
that being simple,
memorable, and understandable

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:49.620
for any type of designer is
the most important thing.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.370
Now this is the fun
part is the delivery.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:58.110
So when it comes to delivering
slides, presentations,

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.840
or even arguments or
even conversations,

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.110
it's very important to have
powerful body language.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.350
May I have a volunteer?

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.054
Preferably a donut lover?

00:25:08.054 --> 00:25:10.220
May have a volunteer in
here to actually demonstrate

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.350
some good body language?

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.570
I'm going to choose you,
Gus, to come up here.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.170
This is my co-founder,
Gus, over here.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.160
And so-- whatever
I say, you do, OK?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.880
Just trust me.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.280
GUS MURILLO: OK.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.680
KENNY NGUYEN: OK.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.050
That's the way I sold it to him.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.400
That's my presentation to him.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.830
So, ways to have
better body language.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.100
The first thing is
to always remember,

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.990
when you give a
presentation, no one

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.740
wants to have a grumpy
person in the room.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.670
It's very important to smile.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.279
So smile.

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:38.070
Let's smile at him.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.400
Let's wake him up a little bit.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.550
Just smile at him.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.300
So it's very important to smile.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.786
Smiling actually alerts the
other human in front of you

00:25:44.786 --> 00:25:46.660
that you're ready and
you're ready to engage.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.370
If you're grumpy and you're
walking up and you're sad,

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.100
it pulls off a very
different opinion of you.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.950
Second is that you always
want an open posture.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.544
Imagine if you're like this
talking in a presentation.

00:25:58.544 --> 00:25:59.960
And it's one of
those things where

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.906
it's very hard to do
because, when you're nervous,

00:26:02.906 --> 00:26:04.280
you're going up,
you're like, OK,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.620
let me think about something.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.870
It looks like you're not sure.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.990
But you're open, it shows a
much more positive and more

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.870
engaging type of body language.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.210
The third is to
use hand gestures.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.750
So you can do this.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.160
It's hand gestures.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.055
And I say it in a controlled
way is that imagine I present it

00:26:21.055 --> 00:26:22.790
like this.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.400
You don't know if I'm excited.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.700
And just by using
one hand, it shows

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.200
a completely different
way of saying

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.890
you don't know if I'm excited.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.254
It seems very, very different.

00:26:31.254 --> 00:26:32.670
That's the power
of hand gestures.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.045
It can actually
show your emotion

00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:35.790
and it shows your point.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:39.250
The fourth is to actually
have eye contact.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.619
So let's stare him down.

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:41.410
GUS MURILLO: Again?

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.890
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah, again.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.100
Sorry, man, you're in
my direct line of sight.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.840
So is eye contact.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.750
So I'll tell you all a secret
trick that one of my friends

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.970
taught me, is that
for those people here

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.690
that are very afraid
of eye contact,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.970
there's a trick called
looking in the forehead.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.410
I'm looking at your
forehead right now, man,

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.760
but it looks like I'm
staring directly at you.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.100
It's very creepy, I know.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.040
Just bear with me.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.380
But the thing is, though,
that's a very effective way

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.220
is that, when you're able
to look someone in the eye

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.511
and tell them a message that
they might not believe in,

00:27:07.511 --> 00:27:09.574
or an argument, a call
to action, a big idea,

00:27:09.574 --> 00:27:11.240
but you're able to
look them in the eyes

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.970
and show that
genuine authenticity,

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.122
it's much more compelling
for you as a presenter.

00:27:16.122 --> 00:27:18.730
But if I look away I'm
telling you something,

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.740
you want that attention on you.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.680
And so that's why eye
contact is so important.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.345
And the fifth and most important
point is do it naturally.

00:27:26.345 --> 00:27:27.720
You should not
look like a creep.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.290
Sorry, man.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.650
We just totally just bombarded
you with some of that.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.820
But if I'm just doing this
and talking, pull me out.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.970
NYPD, come get me.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.310
And you don't want that.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.106
You want something that
looks very natural.

00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:40.980
And that's why it's so
important to rehearse.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.835
Gus, thank you, man.

00:27:41.835 --> 00:27:42.140
GUS MURILLO: All right.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.440
KENNY NGUYEN: So let's give
him a round of applause.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.500
He had no clue, and that's
how I sold it to him.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.652
But next thing is,
how do you rehearse?

00:27:48.652 --> 00:27:50.110
Because when you
think to yourself,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.620
body language,
oh, I can do this.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.680
I know-- I remember
how to do this.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.530
It's very important to
rehearse and create habits.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.450
Presentations,
public speaking, they

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.570
become great through habits.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.350
Sure, you can present
once or twice.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.860
But if you don't-- aren't
able to critique yourself,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.540
there's a very different
way for you to learn.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.410
And I recommend three different
ways to actually rehearse.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.270
One-- does anyone
ever record themselves

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.536
before a presentation?

00:28:17.536 --> 00:28:18.910
It's really hard
to watch, right,

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:21.493
sometimes in the first-- yeah,
it's actually really miserable.

00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:24.790
For my first-- for my TEDxTalk,
and actually the same talk

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.260
I did at HubSpot recently,
I actually gave a talk

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.370
and I watched it and I thought,
man, I don't like this.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.950
And I watched it about nine
times, and I just said,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.349
I'm gonna scrap it.

00:28:35.349 --> 00:28:37.140
And that's really
flustering to understand,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.348
but here's the thing, is
that if I'm able to do that,

00:28:39.348 --> 00:28:41.270
I'm able to watch it
and say, if I'm not

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.110
able to sit through
my own presentation,

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.920
why would someone else want
to sit through it, as well.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.070
And sure enough,
we redid it, and I

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.890
think the video now has
almost 40,000 views on YouTube

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.180
and 10,000 on SlideShare.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.630
And it was actually telling
the story about "Shark Tank."

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:02.610
How did we make-- we
turned down "Shark Tank"

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.544
and in my TED Talk, we
explained how we turned

00:29:04.544 --> 00:29:05.710
the process of "Shark Tank."

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.580
And the challenge is how
do you make that sound fun.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.081
And so watching it over and
over and over again to the point

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.496
where we knew where
it sounded fun

00:29:11.496 --> 00:29:14.040
and I would enjoy hearing the
story was that breaking point.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.509
And so finding a way to rehearse
and watch yourself-- pull out

00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:19.550
that webcam, pull out that
iPhone, watch yourself

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.387
rehearse and critique yourself.

00:29:21.387 --> 00:29:23.095
Did you say something
that sounded weird?

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:25.390
Do you say a lot of
and's, um's, or ah's?

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.900
Or did you have
body language that

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.010
just made you look
boring, creepy,

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.310
or did you not enunciate
your words correctly?

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.990
It's very important
to record yourself

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.660
because then you'll find
your biggest critic.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.370
Next is always find
your own unique ritual.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.730
So my ritual before
I go and present

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.350
is I love listening
to stand-up comedy.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.617
And it just makes me happy.

00:29:48.617 --> 00:29:50.700
And the thing is, before
I go into a presentation,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.880
I should be happy.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.920
So there are different
ways for you to actually

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.320
prepare yourself mentally.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.940
So does anyone
here want to share

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.273
some of things they do before
they go on a presentation?

00:30:02.522 --> 00:30:03.980
AUDIENCE: I wasn't
at the TED Talk,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.370
but there was a woman that
did a Superwoman pose, so I--

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.331
KENNY NGUYEN: Oh yeah.

00:30:08.331 --> 00:30:08.830
Yeah.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.830
That's actually one of the
most common ones I actually

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.780
hear is, like, the
Superwoman pose actually

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.165
just gets you really revved up.

00:30:14.165 --> 00:30:14.870
I think that's great.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.620
I think I would love
to try it for myself.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.890
I should do that.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.292
Any other ones?

00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:21.916
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I like to listen
to Rocky's "Eye of the Tiger."

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:22.747
It gets me--

00:30:22.747 --> 00:30:24.080
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah, that's good.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.690
That's good.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.390
Music is actually
another big one.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.640
Yoga I've heard.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.616
Tony Robbins actually
jumps on a trampoline.

00:30:29.616 --> 00:30:31.741
I've read that, like, before
he went on Dreamforce,

00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:34.140
he just jumps on a trampoline
to get that adrenaline up,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.635
those endorphins, and he gets
them really amped for, like,

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:37.990
his six-hour workshop.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.920
It's incredible.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.530
And so it's good, though, is
that you have these rituals.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.320
And to prepare yourself is one
of the most overlooked things

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.331
is that, sure, I'm just
giving a presentation.

00:30:47.331 --> 00:30:49.080
But you always want
to be in your element.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.871
If you're able to find
what makes you happy

00:30:50.871 --> 00:30:54.790
beforehand, that makes you
really energetic, use that.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:55.890
Keep that in mind.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.120
And the third is
to actually find

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.117
friends that can critique you.

00:31:00.117 --> 00:31:02.450
And that's one of the most
overlooked thing, because you

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.190
always think, oh, you
know, I'm in this alone.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.074
If you have people in
the room-- and I'm not--

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:09.490
I usually ask this
question, who--

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.170
how many people here in
the room have actually

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.220
wanted to fall asleep when
they've seen someone else here

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.950
present.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.040
And usually it's a really
uncomfortable question.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.990
I always tell them, those are
the people that you should

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.031
go to, because those are
the people that tell you

00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:21.710
straight up that
will tell you you

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.169
can do better on
your presentation.

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:24.709
And that's very
important, is to find

00:31:24.709 --> 00:31:26.850
those friends or those
colleagues, those coworkers,

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.730
those siblings that will
tell you straight up,

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.400
I didn't understand
what you had to say.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.720
So to close, for
this formal part,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.587
is that there are three
things that everyone

00:31:34.587 --> 00:31:36.920
should remember when it comes
to an amazing presentation

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.670
experience.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.480
One is that content
should always be engaging

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.230
and should always
have a structure

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.720
and should always, always,
always have a call to action.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.080
Next is that design should
be simple, memorable,

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.970
and most importantly,
memorable and understandable.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.010
Now finally, delivery.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.990
Delivery, always
find your element.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.330
Have that great body language.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.150
But it's most importantly find
what makes you comfortable.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:05.205
Because at the end of
the day, if I'm up here

00:32:05.205 --> 00:32:07.080
and I'm teaching
you and telling you,

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.770
why don't you become like
Steve Jobs when you go present?

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.840
You're gonna think,
I'm not Steve Jobs.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.410
You want to find
your own element.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.090
And that's why we
have this process.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.590
The process here isn't to teach
you to be like someone else.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.300
This process here is
to teach you to be

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.760
the best version of yourselves.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.250
And for people here that
know the poet Maya Angelo,

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.880
people always remember
what you say, what you do,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.840
but people will never forget
how you made them feel.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.490
That is the true essence
of an amazing presenter.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.195
And if you remember that
quote in any presentation

00:32:37.195 --> 00:32:40.530
that you give, it's how
you make others feel,

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:45.240
I promise you you'll be the most
amazing presenter in the room.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.206
Thank you.

00:32:46.206 --> 00:32:49.574
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:51.490
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for that presentation.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.281
You guys definitely
know what you're doing.

00:32:53.281 --> 00:32:56.030
So I have a handful
of questions about how

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.760
you can take all the
experience that you guys have

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.770
and how we can apply it to
our day-to-day work here.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.940
So one of the first questions
I have is all this information

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.710
is pretty fantastic
if you have a week

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.920
to prepare for a presentation,
but the reality is

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.420
there's going to
be situations where

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.878
I get an email in
the morning and I

00:33:13.878 --> 00:33:16.530
have to give a presentation
in three hours.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.610
Do you have any tips
or tricks or advice

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.820
on how to prepare presentations
under a time crunch?

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.820
KENNY NGUYEN: Yes, I do.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.490
And, like, feel
free to chime in.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.250
For our stuff is that I actually
get pretty frequent requests

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.570
to do presentations if, let's
say, a speaker drops out.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:33.040
I'll go and give a
presentation the day of.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.240
And the best thing I've
always learned to do

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.980
is, like, I talked it a
little bit about earlier,

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.965
creating that type of
structure in your presentation.

00:33:40.965 --> 00:33:44.720
The intro, three main points,
and then a call to action.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.246
I make sure, before I go on
anything else-- design, or even

00:33:48.246 --> 00:33:50.370
delivery-- I have that kind
of content right there.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:53.070
Because at the end of the
day, that's your message.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.052
And so before I even
open up PowerPoint

00:33:55.052 --> 00:33:56.510
and you're in a
time crunch, if you

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.600
have less than six hours
or even less than two hours

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.850
to put together a deck,
that's what I recommend doing,

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.431
is, like, come up with your
structure and your message

00:34:03.431 --> 00:34:04.805
before you take
on anything else.

00:34:04.805 --> 00:34:06.721
I don't know, do you
want to chime in on that?

00:34:06.721 --> 00:34:08.500
GUS MURILLO: And keep
in mind that content

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.699
is the most important thing.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.210
You shouldn't be spending too
much-- if you have six hours,

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.293
you shouldn't be spending
five hours on your deck.

00:34:14.293 --> 00:34:15.770
Focus on what
you're going to say.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.830
Spend your last bit of
time putting-- making sure

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.605
that your slides look good,
but honestly just the biggest

00:34:21.605 --> 00:34:22.730
tip is just keep it simple.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.590
There's tools out
there like Haiku Deck.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.877
Or if you just honestly want
to make something really

00:34:26.877 --> 00:34:28.460
quick and simple in
PowerPoint, that's

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.013
good because, if you try to
spend too much time making

00:34:31.013 --> 00:34:32.429
the most detailed
slides, it's not

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.370
going to matter if you're
not prepared for what you're

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.703
going to say and if you don't
have a clear and memorable

00:34:36.703 --> 00:34:38.320
structure.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.500
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.489
A lot of these rules
sound really excellent

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.980
when you're giving
a presentation

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.710
to a large audience.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.440
Do you think it
changes at all when

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.409
you go from a stage
and a platform

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.505
to a small room or
a conference table

00:34:51.505 --> 00:34:54.510
and you're presenting to
a small set of coworkers?

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.210
KENNY NGUYEN: I actually learned
that by doing some workshops--

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.990
we do a lot of workshops--
I actually change a lot more

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.380
based on the audience size.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.990
For example, if we had,
like, a stadium crowd here,

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.910
or, like, a crowd like 1,000,
for example, I normally

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.190
wouldn't do and engage with
them that much compared

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.350
to if it's a smaller room.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.040
And so like, let's
say, like five

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.130
to, like, 50 people,
that's when activities

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:19.590
would be more-- I would be
more open to activities.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.670
It matters because
the reason is is,

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:23.880
like, you can only engage
so much people in the room

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.710
at a time.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.490
But the smaller it is,
let's make it more intimate.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.706
Let's make it a conversation.

00:35:27.706 --> 00:35:29.470
And so I'll tell
anyone that, like, when

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.282
they give a presentation, if
you have, like, a small room,

00:35:32.282 --> 00:35:33.240
make it a conversation.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.920
But if it's a
bigger room, that's

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.672
where a more formal
presentation would be OK.

00:35:37.672 --> 00:35:39.657
I don't know, what do you think?

00:35:39.657 --> 00:35:40.490
GUS MURILLO: Agreed.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.823
Just make sure your activities
are tailored specifically

00:35:42.823 --> 00:35:43.420
to your group.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.250
Like, for groups of five to 10,
which a lot of small meetings

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.420
are, you can actually
get every one of them

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.480
to answer your question
and to chime in,

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.330
rather than here you have
to get a crowd to come up

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.800
with a few suggestions.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.810
For a group to five to 10, you
can really get some-- a lot

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.690
of back and forth, and actually
turn it into a conversation.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.290
Because groups that
small don't want

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.004
to sit for 45 minutes,
or even 30 minutes

00:36:06.004 --> 00:36:07.920
and just be talked to
for that period of time,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.020
they want to talk.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.360
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah,
everyone has a voice.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.401
And that's why I wanted
to do the donut activity.

00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:14.280
It's always fascinating,
because usually it's

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.350
like-- it's usually
a hit or miss

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.560
when it comes to people,
like, actually engaging back.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.268
Because a small room,
everyone would just

00:36:19.268 --> 00:36:21.090
start-- just bombard
me with, like, this

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:22.560
is why I love a donut,
this is why I love a donut.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.249
And it's cool.

00:36:23.249 --> 00:36:25.290
But, like, when it comes
to, like, larger crowds,

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.706
you know, you have the feeling
of, should I say something.

00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:29.410
But once a person say
something, then we

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.140
have one person
that just chimes in,

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.390
then the others will chime in.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.473
It usually takes that one.

00:36:33.473 --> 00:36:36.160
But with a smaller room and
you have like 5 to 10 people,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.070
usually you're getting
it left and right.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.110
MALE SPEAKER: So Google
has the unique problem

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.255
where we might have a
meeting in the morning

00:36:44.255 --> 00:36:47.360
where we're talking with our
coworkers on the same floor,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.610
an hour later we may have a
meeting with our coworkers

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.280
in India or
California or Brazil.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.900
Do you have any advice
on how to communicate

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.440
when you're doing it
digitally across [INAUDIBLE],

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.570
or something like that?

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.361
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah.

00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:02.610
So whenever I think of
presentations-- or webinars

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.980
or just doing something
remotely with colleagues,

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.670
like complete--
like this even comes

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.180
in when we do client
pitches is that we've

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.430
had to learn the hard way
on how to engage them.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.040
When you do something
on the computer,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.160
you're fighting with what's
available on the other person's

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:18.820
computer.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.025
It's like internet, it's
YouTube, it's cat videos.

00:37:21.025 --> 00:37:22.109
It's-- it can be anything.

00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:24.274
And the way that we always
thought about it is this,

00:37:24.274 --> 00:37:26.140
is like how do we
get it to be direct.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.730
So I'll answer in two parts.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.310
One is, if you
have a small group

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.080
for five 10 people,
that's when I

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.020
say I would engage with people,
is I would ask them questions.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.686
I wouldn't just go
sit down and present.

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:37.930
And if I do, I keep that
at a minimum, where there's

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.235
a break in between where I
can ask them questions, what

00:37:40.235 --> 00:37:42.710
do they think, and give a
time where they can actually

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.630
submit in questions in the box.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.430
However, though, if it's
from, like, 25 to 50 people,

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.930
that's a little bit
different, where

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.990
it's a little bit harder because
you have a whole entire team

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.700
call and you don't know who's
really paying attention.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.754
I mean, quite frankly.

00:37:55.754 --> 00:37:57.170
So what I recommend,
in that case,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.210
is that, if you use a slide
deck, keep it very simple.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.045
If it's-- it's even harder
to present off a webinar,

00:38:04.045 --> 00:38:06.420
because you're not there having
that personal connection.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.420
So that simple, memorable,
understandable design

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.430
applies to that.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.919
If there's no slide
deck, though, I

00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:14.210
would recommend actually
asking questions and engaging.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.060
But at the same time,
have an agenda call.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.100
And clearly make sure who's
involved on that call.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.920
I mean, you want
piggyback on this?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.670
GUS MURILLO: Yeah.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.260
Especially for smaller meetings
between-- and you're pitching

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.700
ideas, make sure
that you go into it

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.066
and they go into it knowing,
like, I guess an agenda,

00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.440
but it's mainly
just a structure.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.148
So they know that
they're gonna come away

00:38:35.148 --> 00:38:36.220
with these few things.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.786
And that might not be a deck.

00:38:37.786 --> 00:38:39.160
Just make sure
that you have that

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.130
written down and sent to them.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:42.030
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.080
So in the next
few minutes, we're

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.240
gonna open this up to the
audience for questions.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.210
So if you have something
you want to ask,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:51.800
please stand by one of
the two microphones.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.990
So in your opinion, you know
how to give good presentations,

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:01.350
and so you probably have a sense
of what a bad presentation is.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.614
What is the absolute worst
thing a person can do?

00:39:04.614 --> 00:39:06.030
KENNY NGUYEN: Read
off 200 slides.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.560
MALE SPEAKER: 200 slides.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.810
KENNY NGUYEN: No, I'm kidding.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.512
Well, like, no, the
worst thing I've seen--

00:39:10.512 --> 00:39:12.380
and I hope everyone
takes this to heart--

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.860
is when the presenter
is everywhere,

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.800
there's no structure
in the presentation.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.277
I kid you not, when you
have a structure, a roadmap,

00:39:19.277 --> 00:39:21.610
you know where you're going--
and it can be suspenseful.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.818
You don't have to reveal
everything in the beginning.

00:39:23.818 --> 00:39:26.050
But if you have a
roadmap that can tell,

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:26.855
like, there are
three things we're

00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:28.470
gonna learn today-- content,
design, and delivery,

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:29.841
you know where I'm taking you.

00:39:29.841 --> 00:39:30.340
That's fine.

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:32.350
But if I'm telling you all
these different stories

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.610
and you don't know where we're
going, that's a big problem.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.880
It's always to say, like, I
like to have presentations

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.840
that have a structure.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.080
Still surprise me,
but at least, like,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.370
let me know where we're
going, where we're at.

00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.120
GUS MURILLO: And the
biggest thing for me,

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.500
since I-- I guess-- I mainly
contributed to the design

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.960
portion of the book,
was just everyone

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.409
putting too much on the slide.

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:52.950
And that just happened
so frequently.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:57.186
It just-- keep in mind that what
you're gonna send to the people

00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:59.560
later is not what you should
be showing to them right now

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.750
on stage.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.200
And that's the
worst thing for me.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.122
That guy with the 200 slides,
having 60 bullet points a slide

00:40:05.122 --> 00:40:06.330
where you can't even read it.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.640
That's the worst.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.640
MALE SPEAKER: So the flip
side of that question,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.806
are there any speakers that
you particularly look up

00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:14.599
to or view as role models?

00:40:14.599 --> 00:40:16.932
KENNY NGUYEN: I really like
Scott Harrison from charity:

00:40:16.932 --> 00:40:17.510
water.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.270
He's a very good presenter
because he's really--

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.440
he's able to tell very
emotional stories,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.680
then deliver the meaning
to that story after.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.306
And well, this
presentation I just gave

00:40:26.306 --> 00:40:28.180
didn't have a lot of
stories, but you're able

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.210
incorporate more stories
in your presentation,

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.120
make it more personal,
you're able to connect more

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.440
with the other person.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.470
That's personally my
favorite presenter.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.910
And then, you know, you have
the Steve Jobs of the world,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:43.705
or even-- you know, I
actually really like Malala.

00:40:43.705 --> 00:40:45.580
Malala's a really good
communicator, as well.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.680
So I have several
presentation heroes.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.630
I never try to emulate
them, but I always

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.892
try to learn from them.

00:40:51.892 --> 00:40:53.350
GUS MURILLO: I like
Scott Harrison,

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.641
from a design perspective,
because he's a photographer.

00:40:55.641 --> 00:40:56.910
He documents his entire life.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:01.730
And so from-- as a designer,
you can just visually see

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.690
him walk you through his story.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.941
And just seeing him present,
it just helps it so much.

00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:07.481
His slides aren't
a crutch, it's just

00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:09.720
a way to walk you through
his life and his story.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.890
KENNY NGUYEN: It should
always be an aid and not

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.980
a visual crutch.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.820
And those rule of
thirds that we shared

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.830
earlier, that's actually a lot--
a big proponent of his slides

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.190
is that they always
follow the rule of thirds,

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.840
is that it's coexistence,
it's not overpowerment.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.791
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:25.290
Great.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:29.122
So let's open this up to
questions from the audience.

00:41:29.122 --> 00:41:30.330
AUDIENCE: Great presentation.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:31.560
Thank you guys for coming.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.900
When I think about doing a
lot of presentations here,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.330
oftentimes I may present
it to a small group,

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.250
but the deck will
live on forever.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.250
People are going to look
at it, and I won't have

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.884
the opportunity to present it.

00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:45.550
How does that change
the calculus of how

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.310
you're putting together a deck?

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:50.350
GUS MURILLO: The way we do
it is we make two pieces, one

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.330
for-- especially if you're
either on stage or in a meeting

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:57.460
room in front of people, you
make that deck completely

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.556
separate from what your
actual information is.

00:42:00.556 --> 00:42:03.180
So you can work on your deck, if
you like to display everything

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.730
in PowerPoint or
Keynote or whatever,

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.820
you like to put all
your bullet points in

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.010
and what you want them to
remember and take away,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:12.710
make all of that first.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.840
And then make what you're
gonna present after that.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.420
Make what you're gonna
present as a completely

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.380
different document
that doesn't live on,

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.380
because that needs you.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.757
So that's the way
we-- and that's

00:42:21.757 --> 00:42:23.590
a hard thing to remember,
because it's not--

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:25.184
you're not doubling your work.

00:42:25.184 --> 00:42:27.100
Because in the end, you
just put all your work

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.844
into your structure
and your content,

00:42:28.844 --> 00:42:30.510
and then just spend
the last bit of time

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.290
making a really simplistic deck
so people aren't overloaded

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.370
in trying to read that.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.910
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.670
You mentioned
PowerPoint and Keynote.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.972
Hopefully you also
use Google Slides.

00:42:43.972 --> 00:42:46.430
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah, that was
one joke that Ben threw at me.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.220
He was like, yeah, why
don't you use Google Slides?

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.803
I was like, if I have no time,
I promise you I'll switch over.

00:42:50.803 --> 00:42:52.144
Unfortunately, we didn't today.

00:42:52.144 --> 00:42:54.102
AUDIENCE: That actually
leads into my question,

00:42:54.102 --> 00:42:57.840
is that you talked a lot about
the content and your body

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.280
language and
whatnot, your person

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.900
as you present the presentation.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.840
But in terms of the
underlying technology,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.950
do you still feel like a slide,
your traditional slide that's

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:09.820
been around for decades
now, is still the way to go?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.900
And sitting here at
Google, among some

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.894
of the best and brightest, are
there any changes or feature

00:43:14.894 --> 00:43:17.060
requests that you would
like to put out in the world

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.260
right now to help
make your jobs better?

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.420
GUS MURILLO: I don't
think that the slide would

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.640
be-- I think it's an option.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.970
I think it's a way for people
to display information.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.180
But I honestly am starting
to like the way that we just

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.060
cut out the deck completely.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.430
Write it on a white board
or-- like Simon Sinek

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.350
draws his own paper.

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.720
And I'm starting to
find that as a way

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.154
to-- for people-- for
seasoned presenters or people

00:43:46.154 --> 00:43:48.570
who can get on stage and are
comfortable with complicating

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.987
what they're doing on stage,
but it's just such a cool way

00:43:50.987 --> 00:43:52.528
and a different way,
because it's not

00:43:52.528 --> 00:43:53.850
the deck that's been living on.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:54.720
It's even older than that.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.370
It's before that.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.440
It's just drawing it out
for people to see it live.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.939
And it changes, and will change
from what the audience says.

00:43:59.939 --> 00:44:05.810
So slides work, but I guess
I'm starting to be partial

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.750
and starting to, like, a lot
of the engaging presentations

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.990
are finding different ways
to display the information

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.390
outside of the computer.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.110
Going back.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.610
KENNY NGUYEN: Yeah, actually
so for my TEDx Talk, what I did

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.679
was, like, I actually
cut out all my slides.

00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:20.220
And it's funny,
because people always

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.360
suspect me to have, like,
this amazing sideshow.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.600
But I actually normally don't
use slides in my presentations.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.006
I usually use an easel
and a white board.

00:44:28.006 --> 00:44:29.630
And this is why it's
kind of new for me

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.120
is, like, when I use decks,
I'm, like, thinking, oh man.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.602
Like, I like to
be like-- kind of,

00:44:33.602 --> 00:44:35.447
like, run wild almost,
but at the same time,

00:44:35.447 --> 00:44:37.280
like, have that, like,
canvas of creativity.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.421
So that easel and that
white board really helps me.

00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:40.920
But one thing that
I really, really,

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.130
really like doing in some
of my pitches and, like,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.140
my presentations
is having props.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.140
I like to do show
and tell a lot.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.920
So my TED Talk was talking
about why we turned down

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.810
"Shark Tank," but the
underlying message

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.660
was the power of
saying no, and why

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.205
that's so important
in people's careers

00:44:58.205 --> 00:44:59.820
and in their personal lives.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.280
And I use the anal-- or
pretty much the metaphor

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.830
is that a sword is like yes,
but a shield is like no.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.205
And I gave that
analogy to people

00:45:10.205 --> 00:45:12.832
and actually pulled out a sword
and a shield after my talk,

00:45:12.832 --> 00:45:15.040
and I remember people were,
like, going crazy over it

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.956
at the end of my talk.

00:45:15.956 --> 00:45:17.560
I had this, like,
really cool moment

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.680
of my life where I
remember just, like,

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.130
putting the sword in the air
and the shield in the air.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:22.930
But it made a more
memorable presentation.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.140
So if you're able to use
props, that show and tell

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.500
type of element-- I know
Cisco does that really well,

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.280
and Apple does that,
as well-- I think

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.380
that's another element
to your presentation

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.770
that goes beyond the slides.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:35.270
It's like, show people
why you're so excited.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.770
GUS MURILLO: And
one feature request

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.730
would be, as you connect
to the audience, which

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.810
is why I like the
hand-drawn way to present,

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:46.590
is, like, no platform is
very good at integrating

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.610
social and then getting real
live, like, live feedback

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:51.789
during a presentation.

00:45:51.789 --> 00:45:54.080
Especially, like, tying into--
there's a few out there.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.050
There was one by the agency--
an agency out of-- like one

00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.930
of the big agencies.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.430
And they created
a lackluster app

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:05.910
that kind of does it and
pulls in some feeds and stuff,

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.380
but it's not that good.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:09.820
And there hasn't
been a solid platform

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.210
that allows people to pull
in real time social feedback.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.920
So as a feedback
request, it's something

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.140
that I haven't been able
to found-- find to suggest

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.485
to people, that'd be one.

00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:20.610
KENNY NGUYEN: I would love
for one way, by the way,

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.680
if you all can incorporate,
when virtual reality becomes

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.080
more commercialized, I would
love to find a way where,

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.750
like, the slideshow can actually
extend beyond just the slide

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.042
and take you to a different,
more immersive experience.

00:46:32.042 --> 00:46:34.375
And whether we develop that
in-house ourselves or, like,

00:46:34.375 --> 00:46:35.920
even Google develops
it, like, that's

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.503
one thing I'm really interested
in the future of presentations

00:46:38.503 --> 00:46:39.750
is virtual reality.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.480
Like, even like, you
know, just seeing

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.813
on screen putting on, like,
a pair of glasses and, like,

00:46:43.813 --> 00:46:46.470
and just seeing it, just being
something completely different,

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.050
that's that wow factor
I hope I'll see one day.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.402
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:50.402 --> 00:46:51.360
MALE SPEAKER: OK, guys.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.651
Well, we're almost out of time.

00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:56.480
So to wrap this up, you
covered a lot of topics today.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.320
If there's one thing
that everyone here

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.165
remembers and takes away from
this, what would that be?

00:47:01.165 --> 00:47:03.040
KENNY NGUYEN: Mine is
that people will always

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.490
remember the presenter
more than the presentation.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.490
And you should never,
ever, ever, ever

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.590
deliver a presentation
you wouldn't want

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:14.520
someone else to sit through.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.200
GUS MURILLO: I would say
just in creating your content

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.770
and working through your pitch,
make sure you keep everything,

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.500
from content to design,
as simple as possible.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.410
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:26.910
Great.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.990
Well, this has been Kenny
and Gus with their new book

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.570
"The Big Fish Experience."

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:32.570
Thanks for coming, guys.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:32.940
KENNY NGUYEN: Thanks
for having me, man.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.210
GUS MURILLO: Cool.

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:33.470
Thank you.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.740
KENNY NGUYEN: Appreciate it.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.740
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.553
[APPLAUSE]
