start locally so we have localhost and
 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.530
start locally so we have localhost and
then port 8080 if you're going to be

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540
then port 8080 if you're going to be
 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.090
then port 8080 if you're going to be
changing the port then you need to

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
changing the port then you need to
 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.890
changing the port then you need to
modify this value otherwise you can

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900
modify this value otherwise you can
 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.740
modify this value otherwise you can
leave it as is then we have four

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
leave it as is then we have four
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.190
leave it as is then we have four
different IDs for the loyalty class

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200
different IDs for the loyalty class
 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.950
different IDs for the loyalty class
object ID for the class object and for

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960
object ID for the class object and for
 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.230
object ID for the class object and for
the offers as well in this case you can

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240
the offers as well in this case you can
 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.870
the offers as well in this case you can
leave them assist or we can modify them

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880
leave them assist or we can modify them
 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.610
leave them assist or we can modify them
if you've been running the quick start

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
if you've been running the quick start
 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.650
if you've been running the quick start
and you want to create a new class then

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660
and you want to create a new class then
 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.170
and you want to create a new class then
you'll need to change these so let's say

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180
you'll need to change these so let's say
 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.360
you'll need to change these so let's say
let's say demo one for each of these

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
let's say demo one for each of these
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.970
let's say demo one for each of these
once we have these we should be able to

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980
once we have these we should be able to
 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.340
once we have these we should be able to
run the quick starts but before we do

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350
run the quick starts but before we do
 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.970
run the quick starts but before we do
that let's make sure that we have our

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980
that let's make sure that we have our
 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.770
that let's make sure that we have our
prerequisites done here so first let's

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780
prerequisites done here so first let's
 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.300
prerequisites done here so first let's
check our ruby version so to do that

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310
check our ruby version so to do that
 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.720
check our ruby version so to do that
just run version and I'm running two

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730
just run version and I'm running two
 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.340
just run version and I'm running two
point oh you need to be running at least

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350
point oh you need to be running at least
 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.040
point oh you need to be running at least
1 93 so if that's good and you don't

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
1 93 so if that's good and you don't
 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.080
1 93 so if that's good and you don't
need to upgrade your Ruby then now let's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090
need to upgrade your Ruby then now let's
 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.110
need to upgrade your Ruby then now let's
move into our gems for the gems we need

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120
move into our gems for the gems we need
 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.420
move into our gems for the gems we need
to have four gems installed for this for

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430
to have four gems installed for this for
 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.000
to have four gems installed for this for
the quick start the we need to have Jace

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
the quick start the we need to have Jace
 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.990
the quick start the we need to have Jace
on the Google API client the jaw and

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000
on the Google API client the jaw and
 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.430
on the Google API client the jaw and
Sinatra so let's run maybe you already

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440
Sinatra so let's run maybe you already
 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.200
Sinatra so let's run maybe you already
have some of these installed so first

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210
have some of these installed so first
 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.080
have some of these installed so first
let's run gem query local to see which

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090
let's run gem query local to see which
 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.200
let's run gem query local to see which
ones we have and in my case I have them

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210
ones we have and in my case I have them
 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.130
ones we have and in my case I have them
all I have Sinatra Google API client

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140
all I have Sinatra Google API client
 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.500
all I have Sinatra Google API client
JSON and jot if you don't have one of

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510
JSON and jot if you don't have one of
 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.800
JSON and jot if you don't have one of
these then it's very easy just do gem

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
these then it's very easy just do gem
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.410
these then it's very easy just do gem
install and the name of the gym so I can

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420
install and the name of the gym so I can
 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.620
install and the name of the gym so I can
do here json so since I already

do here json so since I already
 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.870
do here json so since I already
installed them we don't need to do that

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880
installed them we don't need to do that
 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.870
installed them we don't need to do that
now once we have that we have the

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880
now once we have that we have the
 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.060
now once we have that we have the
correct version of Ruby we downloaded

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070
correct version of Ruby we downloaded
 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.250
correct version of Ruby we downloaded
the code we also have all our gems

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260
the code we also have all our gems
 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.410
the code we also have all our gems
installed and we modified our parameters

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420
installed and we modified our parameters
 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.140
installed and we modified our parameters
now all we need to do is just run it to

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150
now all we need to do is just run it to
 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.750
now all we need to do is just run it to
do that very easy we're using Sinatra to

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760
do that very easy we're using Sinatra to
 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.300
do that very easy we're using Sinatra to
run the server and we'll call it by

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310
run the server and we'll call it by
 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.560
run the server and we'll call it by
doing Ruby wolf server which is the name

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570
doing Ruby wolf server which is the name
 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.390
doing Ruby wolf server which is the name
of the movie script that we're running

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400
of the movie script that we're running
 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.960
of the movie script that we're running
and then minus P to say that we want to

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970
and then minus P to say that we want to
 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.900
and then minus P to say that we want to
run it on a specific port in this case

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910
run it on a specific port in this case
 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.860
run it on a specific port in this case
I'm running it on port 8080 so once we

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870
I'm running it on port 8080 so once we
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.720
I'm running it on port 8080 so once we
run it now it's telling us that it's

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730
run it now it's telling us that it's
 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.730
run it now it's telling us that it's
running on port 8080 everything's good

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740
running on port 8080 everything's good
 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.550
running on port 8080 everything's good
Sinatra is running so now let's go into

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560
Sinatra is running so now let's go into
 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.220
Sinatra is running so now let's go into
our browser and see how this looks so i

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230
our browser and see how this looks so i
 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.540
our browser and see how this looks so i
have here we're going to go into local

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550
have here we're going to go into local
 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.040

host port 8080

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050
host port 8080
 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.870
host port 8080
once we run this you'll see that we have

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880
once we run this you'll see that we have
 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.380
once we run this you'll see that we have
the it successfully running now what do

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390
the it successfully running now what do
 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.290
the it successfully running now what do
we have in this page we have two steps

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300
we have in this page we have two steps
 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.930
we have in this page we have two steps
the first step it says insert a class so

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940
the first step it says insert a class so
 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.060
the first step it says insert a class so
either a loyalty class or an offer class

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070
either a loyalty class or an offer class
 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.520
either a loyalty class or an offer class
and then we have to save to wallet

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530
and then we have to save to wallet
 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.370
and then we have to save to wallet
buttons how does this work the first

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380
buttons how does this work the first
 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.530
buttons how does this work the first
thing that you do is that you'll need to

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:13.540
thing that you do is that you'll need to
 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.930
thing that you do is that you'll need to
have a class for either or whatever

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940
have a class for either or whatever
 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.610
have a class for either or whatever
vertical you're working with so let's

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620
vertical you're working with so let's
 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.040
vertical you're working with so let's
say that we're doing the loyalty you'll

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
say that we're doing the loyalty you'll
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.840
say that we're doing the loyalty you'll
need to insert the class first and this

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:21.850
need to insert the class first and this
 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.720
need to insert the class first and this
is only done once in the system you can

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:24.730
is only done once in the system you can
 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.820
is only done once in the system you can
also of course update classes after

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830
also of course update classes after
 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.100
also of course update classes after
you've inserted them but you only need

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110
you've inserted them but you only need
 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.660
you've inserted them but you only need
to insert it once so this button will

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670
to insert it once so this button will
 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.490
to insert it once so this button will
will not be on your site this is only

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.500
will not be on your site this is only
 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.320
will not be on your site this is only
here for us to test and show you how to

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.330
here for us to test and show you how to
 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.240
here for us to test and show you how to
create classes every time you modify

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250
create classes every time you modify
 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.630
create classes every time you modify
something on the code but then after we

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:42.640
something on the code but then after we
 

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.640
something on the code but then after we
even started the class then you will

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.650
even started the class then you will
 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.590
even started the class then you will
have button or you most probably will

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:46.600
have button or you most probably will
 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.810
have button or you most probably will
have a button to save the card or a

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:48.820
have a button to save the card or a
 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.500
have a button to save the card or a
coupon to the users wallet so this

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.510
coupon to the users wallet so this
 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.570
coupon to the users wallet so this
button once we click it it will create

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580
button once we click it it will create
 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.550
button once we click it it will create
an object on my Google Wallet account

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560
an object on my Google Wallet account
 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.490
an object on my Google Wallet account
where I'm signed in here and then we'll

00:07:59.490 --> 00:07:59.500
where I'm signed in here and then we'll
 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.900
where I'm signed in here and then we'll
be able to see that on the phone on the

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:00.910
be able to see that on the phone on the
 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.900
be able to see that on the phone on the
Google Wallet app so first let me create

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:03.910
Google Wallet app so first let me create
 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.530
Google Wallet app so first let me create
the class by just clicking on that then

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:07.540
the class by just clicking on that then
 

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.480
the class by just clicking on that then
it says that it's inserted the class

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:09.490
it says that it's inserted the class
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.340
it says that it's inserted the class
loyalty class demo one which is how we

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:11.350
loyalty class demo one which is how we
 

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.490
loyalty class demo one which is how we
named it and now I go in to save card to

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.500
named it and now I go in to save card to
 

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.940
named it and now I go in to save card to
wallet and it saved the card already so

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:17.950
wallet and it saved the card already so
 

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.520

now when we go into our Google Wallet

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:20.530
now when we go into our Google Wallet
 

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.350
now when we go into our Google Wallet
app will see it saved and we'll do that

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360
app will see it saved and we'll do that
 

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.690
app will see it saved and we'll do that
during our demo and they get a better

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:24.700

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.129
I'll take some promotional emails from
this merchant I'll create the account so

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:14.139
this merchant I'll create the account so
 

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:15.509
this merchant I'll create the account so
this will take a few seconds call back

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519
this will take a few seconds call back
 

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.090
this will take a few seconds call back
to the web service that Morrow just

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.100
to the web service that Morrow just
 

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.829
to the web service that Morrow just
showed and then it will return it to

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839
showed and then it will return it to
 

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.259
showed and then it will return it to
return in objects to the Google service

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:22.269
return in objects to the Google service
 

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:24.689
return in objects to the Google service
which will then push the object display

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:24.699
which will then push the object display
 

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:27.569
which will then push the object display
back down to my device in this case I

00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:27.579
back down to my device in this case I
 

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:30.960
back down to my device in this case I
have a second card with a balance so in

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:30.970
have a second card with a balance so in
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.850
have a second card with a balance so in
this case maybe I could show this

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:32.860
this case maybe I could show this
 

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.249
this case maybe I could show this
balance and use it as my stored value or

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:35.259
balance and use it as my stored value or
 

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:37.439
balance and use it as my stored value or
something in the future so that's a

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:37.449
something in the future so that's a
 

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:39.449
something in the future so that's a
quick demo now here's Mauro to talk

00:12:39.449 --> 00:12:39.459
quick demo now here's Mauro to talk
 

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.489
quick demo now here's Mauro to talk
about how everything works from the

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:41.499
about how everything works from the
 

00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:43.710
about how everything works from the
discoverable there's one thing that we

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720
discoverable there's one thing that we
 

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.780
discoverable there's one thing that we
need to make sure we have set up once

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:45.790
need to make sure we have set up once
 

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.210
need to make sure we have set up once
we're doing testing on our end is that

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.220
we're doing testing on our end is that
 

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.129
we're doing testing on our end is that
the status of the discoverable needs to

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:50.139
the status of the discoverable needs to
 

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:53.069
the status of the discoverable needs to
be draft if its draft that means that no

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079
be draft if its draft that means that no
 

00:12:53.079 --> 00:12:55.379
be draft if its draft that means that no
one can see it publicly but we can see

00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:55.389
one can see it publicly but we can see
 

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:58.340
one can see it publicly but we can see
it on our testing on testing mode also

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.350
it on our testing on testing mode also
 

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.809

it won't be life to anyone except you
 

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.460
it won't be life to anyone except you
when you're testing now let's look at

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.470
when you're testing now let's look at
 

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.379
when you're testing now let's look at
some of the code and see how this all

00:13:31.379 --> 00:13:31.389
some of the code and see how this all
 

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:32.120
some of the code and see how this all
works out

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.130
works out
 

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.670
works out

we open the sample the first thing you
see is the index HTML page right in

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.330
see is the index HTML page right in
 

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.480

class we can see that these buttons are

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600
class we can see that these buttons are
 

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.520
class we can see that these buttons are
rendered in there here let me open it

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:29.530
rendered in there here let me open it

these when we click on the loyalty then
 

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.280
these when we click on the loyalty then
we're going to be calling insert /

calling JWT / loyalty and then worlds

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:04.750
calling JWT / loyalty and then worlds
 

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.350
calling JWT / loyalty and then worlds
are calling the job / offer for the

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360
are calling the job / offer for the
 

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.270
are calling the job / offer for the
other button and what this is doing is

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:09.280
other button and what this is doing is
 

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.720
other button and what this is doing is
that it's rendering the g save to wallet

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:12.730
that it's rendering the g save to wallet
 

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.810
that it's rendering the g save to wallet
tag on the button which will based on

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:15.820
tag on the button which will based on
 

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.120
tag on the button which will based on
the the JS file that we're including on

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.130
the the JS file that we're including on
 

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.380
the the JS file that we're including on
the index HTML will render the nice safe

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.390
the index HTML will render the nice safe
 

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.820
the index HTML will render the nice safe
to wallet button that you see on the

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:23.830
to wallet button that you see on the
 

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.660
to wallet button that you see on the
page so how does this work when you call

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:27.670
page so how does this work when you call
 

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.970
page so how does this work when you call
the first let's look at the job for the

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:29.980
the first let's look at the job for the
 

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.550
the first let's look at the job for the
save to wallet button how this works is

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560
save to wallet button how this works is
 

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.880
save to wallet button how this works is
that you'll go into the web server and

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:34.890
that you'll go into the web server and
 

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.400
that you'll go into the web server and
we'll find here the path we're saying if

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:38.410
we'll find here the path we're saying if
 

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.750
we'll find here the path we're saying if
you're calling God / anything then call

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:42.760
you're calling God / anything then call
 

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.490
you're calling God / anything then call
this and what this is doing is that it's

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.500
this and what this is doing is that it's
 

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.480
this and what this is doing is that it's
creating a job

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.490
creating a job
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.410
creating a job
and it's including the information of

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:49.420
and it's including the information of
 

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.079
and it's including the information of
the object that we're creating either a

00:15:52.079 --> 00:15:52.089
the object that we're creating either a
 

00:15:52.089 --> 00:15:54.720
the object that we're creating either a
loyalty object or an offer object so

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:54.730
loyalty object or an offer object so
 

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.550
loyalty object or an offer object so
this is what we're doing we're saying if

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560
this is what we're doing we're saying if
 

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.829
this is what we're doing we're saying if
it's the type is loyalty then we

00:15:58.829 --> 00:15:58.839
it's the type is loyalty then we
 

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:01.079
it's the type is loyalty then we
generate an object and then we add the

00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:01.089
generate an object and then we add the
 

00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:03.480
generate an object and then we add the
object to the payload and then we encode

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.490
object to the payload and then we encode
 

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.750
object to the payload and then we encode
the job and we just here we're just

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:06.760
the job and we just here we're just
 

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.210
the job and we just here we're just
outputting that so what it's doing is

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:09.220
outputting that so what it's doing is
 

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.019
outputting that so what it's doing is
that if you see the page when we load it

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:13.029
that if you see the page when we load it
 

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:15.600
that if you see the page when we load it
and you just you just inspect the

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:15.610
and you just you just inspect the
 

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.490
and you just you just inspect the
element you'll see that it has the jot

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:17.500
element you'll see that it has the jot
 

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.410
element you'll see that it has the jot
on the on the URL for that button then

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:22.420
on the on the URL for that button then
 

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.930
on the on the URL for that button then
also we have the insert if you're going

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:24.940
also we have the insert if you're going
 

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.360
also we have the insert if you're going
to insert a class then we also have if

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:27.370
to insert a class then we also have if
 

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.120
to insert a class then we also have if
you post to insert with the type what

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.130
you post to insert with the type what
 

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.620
you post to insert with the type what
we're doing in here is that we're

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:31.630
we're doing in here is that we're
 

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.930
we're doing in here is that we're
generating a class also based on the

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:33.940
generating a class also based on the
 

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.060
generating a class also based on the
idea that we created on the webz

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.070
idea that we created on the webz
 

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.750
idea that we created on the webz
Constance and then we're calling the API

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:39.760
Constance and then we're calling the API
 

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.990
Constance and then we're calling the API
here we're calling a REST API to insert

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000
here we're calling a REST API to insert
 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.040
here we're calling a REST API to insert
the app the class in this case and that

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.050
the app the class in this case and that
 

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.199
the app the class in this case and that
is returning back an answer and that is

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:49.209
is returning back an answer and that is
 

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:52.220
is returning back an answer and that is
displayed on the page on the index HTML

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:52.230
displayed on the page on the index HTML
 

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.350
displayed on the page on the index HTML
then the last path that we need to look

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360
then the last path that we need to look
 

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.960
then the last path that we need to look
at here is the web service and this is

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:57.970
at here is the web service and this is
 

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.329
at here is the web service and this is
the one that was configured from the

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:00.339
the one that was configured from the
 

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.430
the one that was configured from the
discoverable and when you call

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440
discoverable and when you call
 

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.470
discoverable and when you call
webservice what it's doing is that it's

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480
webservice what it's doing is that it's
 

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.230
webservice what it's doing is that it's
checking it's getting in our case we are

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240
checking it's getting in our case we are
 

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.030
checking it's getting in our case we are
assuming that we have success a

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.040
assuming that we have success a
 

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.100
assuming that we have success a
successful response all the time but you

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.110
successful response all the time but you
 

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.290
successful response all the time but you
can change this value to return a

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:13.300
can change this value to return a
 

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.600
can change this value to return a
different message so we're saying if

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.610
different message so we're saying if
 

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.449
different message so we're saying if
it's successful here we're going to

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:18.459
it's successful here we're going to
 

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:21.120
it's successful here we're going to
create a job and we're going to send

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.130
create a job and we're going to send
 

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.540
create a job and we're going to send
back on the payload that the result is

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:24.550
back on the payload that the result is
 

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.579
back on the payload that the result is
approved and we're going to send the

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:26.589
approved and we're going to send the
 

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.540
approved and we're going to send the
loyalty object back to to Google so how

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:30.550
loyalty object back to to Google so how
 

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.490
loyalty object back to to Google so how
this works here is that we're generating

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:32.500
this works here is that we're generating
 

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.470
this works here is that we're generating
an object here and we always generate

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480
an object here and we always generate
 

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.750
an object here and we always generate
the same one for the sample but on your

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760
the same one for the sample but on your
 

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.360
the same one for the sample but on your
case you would say oh it's a new it's a

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:39.370
case you would say oh it's a new it's a
 

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.520
case you would say oh it's a new it's a
new member so we generate a new object

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:41.530
new member so we generate a new object
 

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.500
new member so we generate a new object
and you generate this object on your end

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:43.510
and you generate this object on your end
 

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.240
and you generate this object on your end
and then you send back the information

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.250
and then you send back the information
 

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.910
and then you send back the information
to us and then of course you put it on

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:47.920
to us and then of course you put it on
 

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.980
to us and then of course you put it on
the on the payload and you encode it and

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:49.990
the on the payload and you encode it and
 

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.780
the on the payload and you encode it and
send it back the same way that we do

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:51.790
send it back the same way that we do
 

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.630
send it back the same way that we do
with the with the other path with a job

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640
with the with the other path with a job
 

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.480
with the with the other path with a job
path if the response is not successful

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.490
path if the response is not successful
 

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.280
path if the response is not successful
then you don't have to send an out

00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.290
then you don't have to send an out
 

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.990
then you don't have to send an out
object the only thing you sent back is

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000
object the only thing you sent back is
 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.560
object the only thing you sent back is
an error message and the result is

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:04.570
an error message and the result is
 

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.530
an error message and the result is
rejected in that case then Google will

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:07.540
rejected in that case then Google will
 

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.110
rejected in that case then Google will
display in an error on the Google Wallet

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120
display in an error on the Google Wallet
 

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.970
display in an error on the Google Wallet

parts to be able to list classes and
list objects and get specific objects

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:20.140
list objects and get specific objects
 

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.800
list objects and get specific objects
