00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.439
Is it possible to get something from nothing?

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.240
This is the story of a very important number,
but a number that wasn't always a number.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.530
In fact it was much less than a number until
relatively recently.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.809
This is the story of Zero

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.350
and it's a story that takes a tortuous and
meandering route

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.160
through 1,500 years of human history.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.760
Today we enjoy zero in all its glory where
it takes on two roles:

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.730
The first is as a placeholder within our positional
number system.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.780
Zero notes an absence of a value

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.860
and it allows us to create huge numbers

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.480
without the need to create new digits

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.710
So we know 30 is larger than 3

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.239
and 300 is larger than 30 and 3.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.170
The second use of zero is as a number in its
own right,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.530
the middleman between positive and negative
one

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.030
and enjoying nearly all the same benefits
as other numbers.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.039
We can subtract, add and multiply by zero...

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.390
but dividing by zero just doesn't work.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.080
For example, you can't divide 1 chicken by
no chickens.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.970
You might suggest that the answer is infinity,
but it's not,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.840
because infinity isn't really a number, it's a concept.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.590
Mathematics developed from a very practical
desire to count things,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.189
such as the passage of days

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.710
or the quantities of chickens you owned.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.360
To manage this, ancient civilisations developed
rudimentary number systems,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.049
for example the Babylonians used two symbols
in different arrangements

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.549
to create unique numbers 1-60.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.530
The Ancient Greeks and the Mayans also developed
their own number systems

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.229
and all of these civilisations are thought
to have created

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.829
their own rough concepts of zero as a placeholder.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.119
But it wasn't until the Indians begun developing
their own number system

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.159
that zero would be defined explicitly.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.049
Their early number system would also evolve
into the one we use today,

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.119
initially with 9 number symbols and then a
small dot used to mark the absence of a number.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.759
In the 7th Century mathematician Brahmagupta
developed terms for zero in

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.970
addition, subtraction and division, although
he struggled a bit with the latter,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.319
as would academics for hundreds of years to
come.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.560
As the mathematics of India matured it found
its way Eastwards to China and Westwards,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.120
influencing the Islamic and Arabic cultures
where it was instrumental in trade.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.420
But Zero found resistance in Europe

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.790
as the Hindu-Arabic system was opposed by
the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.560
Roman Empire's established numeral system.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.970
However, by the 13th Century academics such
as Italian mathematician Fibonacci

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.550
were championing the new number system in
their work,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.819
helping zero gain a solid foothold across
Europe.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.959
Over the next 400 years as mathematics evolved
from practical applications

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:02.090
to ever more abstracted functions, zero would
form the cornerstone of calculus.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.950
Calculus allowed anyone to break dynamic systems
down

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.810
into smaller and smaller units approaching
zero,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.409
but cunningly avoided the trap of having to
divide by zero.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.409
Zero had now became a celebrated tool in the
mathematical arsenal

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.310
and as the binary numerical system formed
the foundation for modern computer programming,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.640
zero once again stepped into the limelight
to prove its worth.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.180
And so it seems after all this time, it was
finally possible to get something from nothing.
