00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.259
You've probably heard of Pavlov's dogs,

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.999
the phrase that often summarizes

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.877
Dr. Ivan Pavlov's early 20th century research,

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.788
in which he demonstrated that we can alter

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:26.243
what stimuli elicit a reflective response in canines.

00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:28.150
He showed this by sounding a bell

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.531
just before he presented

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.856
his group of dogs with meat powder.

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.222
After many presentations of the bell,

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:36.017
followed by tasty meat powder,

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:38.105
the dogs eventually began to salivate

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.305
at just the sound of the bell.

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.725
They salivated even when

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.609
there was no meat powder present.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.230
This phenomenon isn't limited to dogs.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.814
Consider the placebo effect,

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.442
in which a pill with no active substances

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:51.656
brings about a response

00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:54.612
similar to a pill with a substance present.

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:57.219
What changes here is our reaction to our ailment,

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.823
such as perceiving less pain

00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:00.665
and not the ailment itself.

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.814
Or, consider the love humans have for a parent.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:06.418
Some would argue that this love is instinctual,

00:01:06.418 --> 00:01:08.292
and they may be partially right.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.887
But, the argument fails to account

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:11.167
for the equal amount of love

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.170
that children adopted later in life

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.340
hold for their adoptive parents.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.304
But the behaviorist argument can account

00:01:17.304 --> 00:01:18.934
for both accounts of love.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.181
A parent, biological or not,

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.188
is constantly paired with things like

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:23.724
food,

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:24.355
smiles,

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:25.075
toys,

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:25.974
affection,

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:26.580
games,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.277
protection,

00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:28.828
and entertainment.

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:30.613
And a parent's constant association

00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.322
with these wonderful or crucial aspects of a child's life

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:35.693
has a similar, albeit more complicated,

00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:39.324
effect that meat powder had on Pavlov's salivating dogs.

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:41.631
In other words, if one's parent is predictive

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:44.034
of really good or really important things,

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:45.205
then one's parent becomes

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.373
a really good and important thing, too.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.873
And there is also romantic advice to be gained

00:01:49.873 --> 00:01:51.754
from Pavlov's observations.

00:01:51.754 --> 00:01:54.048
We all need food to survive, right?

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:55.967
And someone who can provide such things

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:58.414
in a delicious, saliva-producing manner

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:01.929
stands to become our human equivalent of a ringing bell.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:02.560
In other words,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.890
if you can cook one or more scrumptious meals

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.309
for a potential love interest,

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.409
there's a good chance that you'll be viewed

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.866
more favorably in the future,

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.274
even if you didn't prepare the delicious food.

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:14.777
And who wouldn't want the love of their life

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.361
drooling over them?

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.826
But life is not just bell rings and salivation.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.492
There's also a dark side to this type of learning,

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:23.034
called "taste aversion".

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:25.410
Taste aversion occurs when we ingest some food

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.245
that eventually makes us sick,

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:30.333
and, as a result, we avoid that food,

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.666
sometimes for the rest of our lives.

00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.545
Taste aversion is so powerful

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.045
that the effect can be seen

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:39.424
even if the illness is experienced hours later

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:42.487
and even if the food itself did not actually make us sick.

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:45.515
Such is the case when we have the flu, and, by accident,

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.058
we ingest some food moments prior to vomiting.

00:02:49.058 --> 00:02:50.986
In this case, we know that the food

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.438
did not cause the vomiting,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.112
but our bodies don't know that.

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:56.078
And the next time we encounter that food,

00:02:56.078 --> 00:02:58.194
we are likely to refuse eating it.

00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:00.618
Now, imagine the potential consequences

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:03.112
of undercooking a meal on a first date.

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:05.282
If the food makes your date sick,

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:06.413
it is possible for them

00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:09.630
to associate that bad feeling with not just the food,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.421
but with &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; food in particular.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.718
If the episode was traumatizing enough,

00:03:14.718 --> 00:03:17.430
or if it also happens on a subsequent date,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.182
they may come to relate you with the consequences,

00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:22.066
just like Pavlov's dogs

00:03:22.066 --> 00:03:24.290
related the bell with the meat powder.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.146
In other words,

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:27.729
the sight of you showing up at the next dinner date

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.671
might actually make your date nauseous!

00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.651
As the old saying goes,

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:33.361
the fastest way to someone's heart

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:34.781
is through their stomach,

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:37.621
assuming you don't make them sick in the process.
