[music]

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:27.019 position:75%
Susan Marshall:
My goal is to just to find out what does happen.
We’ve never done it with more than 20 people.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.820
Naomi Leonard:
We're going to get some things that
are quite unpredictable tonight.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.820 position:75%
Naomi Leonard:
She sent me an e-mail asking me you know maybe
this was a crazy idea, but would I be interested

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.059 position:73%
Naomi Leonard:
in trying out some of these ideas with dancers…
people who have been trained to be physically

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.890 position:70%
Naomi Leonard:
aware? I love ideas like that, so I said yes.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.600 position:67%
Naomi Leonard:
I think that we were inspired by the beauty
and the complexity of animals in motion and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.189 position:70%
Naomi Leonard:
bird flocks and fish schools. The basic rules
of flocking are ones that have to

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.509 position:66%
Naomi Leonard:
do with cohesion and repulsion. So this is
the way biologists understand that animals

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.250 position:70%
Naomi Leonard:
stay together in a group and avoid colliding.
And then when there’s more information in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.210 position:73%
Naomi Leonard:
the group, say some of the animals see a threat
approaching or are attracted to a food source,

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.740 position:72%
Naomi Leonard:
then you can see this beautiful ripple through
the group. So, the first to respond maybe make

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.350 position:72%
Naomi Leonard:
a sharp move and that affects their neighbors,
and that affects their neighbors, and so on.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.630 position:69%
Naomi Leonard:
Some of the things that we'll learn tonight
have to do with the fact that you take these

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.590 position:70%
Naomi Leonard:
ideas, and you put them in a different space
with a larger number of people -- with people

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.200 position:70%
Naomi Leonard:
who’ve been trained and people who haven’t
been trained for more than five or 10 minutes

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.040 position:64%
Naomi Leonard:
on the basic rules of flocking -- and you
get something very different.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.310 position:70%
Susan Marshall:
So, the Atelier is this wonderful program
at Princeton that allows professional artists

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.310 position:75%
Susan Marshall:
to collaborate on a work, on a creative process,
in the company of students. And the Atelier

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.220 position:73%
Susan Marshall:
enters into this with the idea that the process
of creating an artwork is going to be rewarding

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.200 position:64%
Susan Marshall:
for these students at whatever level they
engage with it. The students have heavily

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.849 position:70%
Susan Marshall:
shaped and designed what we’re doing here
tonight and they’re performing in it as well.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.380 position:80%
Naomi Leonard::
So, we actually used a sort of a computer simulator
that a student, Willa Chen, developed this summer.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.470 position:59%
Willa Chen:
When I started creating the simulator,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.470 position:69%
Willa Chen:
the whole class was just a spark of an idea.
So, I helped to shape the class in many ways

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.020 position:66%
Willa Chen:
as we experimented with dancers to see how
they followed rules, how they responded to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.360 position:67%
Willa Chen:
rules. I am a dancer. I’ve been dancing
since the age of six. And, that’s partially

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.360 position:78%
Willa Chen:
why I got interested in this project. I thought,
"Wow, I love dancing, I love computer programming,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.430 position:66%
Willa Chen:
and this just combines the two perfectly."

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.050 position:67%
Susan Marshall:
The whole process with the students was a
big artistic exploration. Obviously, we are

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.050 position:78%
Susan Marshall:
not fish; we are not birds, so we have limitations
and strengths that are different from those

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.810 position:70%
Susan Marshall:
populations. The wonderful thing that happens
with fish and birds, of course, is they

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.319 position:70%
Susan Marshall:
get to occupy three-dimensional space so that
even simple patterns take on this beautiful,

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.190 position:81%
Susan Marshall:
complex patterning that feels like space is folding.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.330 position:61%
Susan Marshall:
Were on one plane and we’re not silvery

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.110 position:67%
Susan Marshall:
on one side. And when you look at us from
above, we only have a point. We’re not long

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.450 position:81%
Susan Marshall:
and wide. So, we have different physical attributes,
and so that is one of the things we needed

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.390 position:69%
Susan Marshall:
to investigate: How can we create something
that’s visually exciting with the attributes

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.290
Susan Marshall:
that we have on a single plane?

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.819 position:69%
Susan Marshall:
This is a pretty rare opportunity to be able
to have a creation supported of this nature

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.819 position:66%
Susan Marshall:
in a university setting where you can take
a risk on an unknown creative outcome with

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.660 position:72%
Susan Marshall:
the support of students, and that be a course.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:45.660
