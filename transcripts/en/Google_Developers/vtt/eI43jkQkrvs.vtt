Have you ever had an image
or some other box of content in your app

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:13.480
and thought: "Man, I wish
I could just round those corners off

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.770
for a bit of polish."

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.410
Well, Flutter's
got a widget just for that.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.178
It's called <i>ClipRRect.</i>

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:21.403
An extra "r" stand for "rounded."

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:23.412
You just wrap your widget
with a clipper,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.188
specify a <i>borderRadius--</i>

00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:27.851
that's the radius of the circle
we want the corners clipped with--

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.999
and you've got yourself
a rounded rectangle.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.441
Widgets like <i>ClipRRect</i> work
by inserting a special <i>Render</i> object

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:35.782
into the <i>Render Tree,</i>
just above their child.

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:39.250
That <i>Render</i> object adds a clip
each time Flutter repaints.

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:42.923
In addition to setting a radius,
<i>ClipRRect</i> has a <i>clipBehavior</i> properties--

00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:44.430
so you can customize the <i>Edge.</i>

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.304
And if you'd like to try
a different shape,

00:00:46.304 --> 00:00:50.910
there're similar widgets called
<i>ClipOval,ClipPath,</i> and more.

00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:54.191
For more info on those
and all the other Flutter widgets,

00:00:54.318 --> 00:00:56.162
