00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
TONY: I've got another constant for you Brady.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.780
It's Apéry's constant.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.320
One point two oh two oh five six nine ...

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.920
We could go on.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.500
What is this really? This is actually -
what I'm writing down here -

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.480
is really 1 + 1 over 2 cubed + 1 over 3 cubed ...

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.420
This sum actually appears in quantum electrodynamics.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.420
It's related to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, which is one of the great tests of QED.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.200
This number appears in that so it has physical relevance,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
but that's not really why we're going to talk about it today.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.760
The reason I want to talk about it is because it's -

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.660
It's a crazy number in many ways

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.900
and not a lot was known about it for a very long time, and it's still not known about.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.360
This goes back to 1644 when Pietro Mengoli posed the Basel problem.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.800
Of course, the Basel problem was - the question was not quite this sum

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800
but essentially this sum

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.520
1 plus 1 over 2 squared, 1 over 3 squared and so on...

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.560
To get this in closed form - this was the problem, to get it in closed form

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.060
and this was famously solved by Euler in 1735

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.340
and he showed that this was equal to π squared over 6.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.980
Now of course, Euler being Euler,

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.419
you know, wasn't going to settle for just this guy, right?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.729
He wanted to do this far more generally

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.160
so he looked at the general form of these things: 1 over 2 to the s, 1 over 3 to the s

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.920
1 over 4 to the s and so on which we recognize as the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.890
Riemann Zeta function, you know, one can ask what values this takes in the positive integers?

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.489
And this is what Euler was interested in and he was able to show of course that when you take even integers -

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.680
so you look at this guy at even values -
 that this took the form of something rational.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.940
times π to the 2n

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.680
So of course, π being transcendental, this guarantees that this number is also going to be transcendental.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.479
That was for the even positions.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.618
What about the odds? The things like zeta to the 2n + 1 and which of course

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.840
This guy which is of course

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.880
our Apéry's constant is at the value three. What about this? Is this rational? Is this transcendental?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.640
What, what is it?  Euler couldn't work it out, Euler couldn't do it and nobody knew for hundreds of years

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760
What was going on with this number.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.180
Until this mathematician came along, a kind of maverick mathematician -

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.680
a good mathematician, but not a great mathematician, a guy called Roger Apéry.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200
actually solved this problem.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.860
And Apéry's quite an interesting character actually:

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.640
He's French, he was very political, very politically active

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.720
He was a prisoner of war in the 2nd World War

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.320
and he sort of had quite a dry sense of humor actually.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.380
Later on he was a member of the French resistance.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.300
At one point he was actually stopped by the Gestapo because he was carrying an object -

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.640
A long thin object wrapped in newspaper.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.040
And the Gestapo said to him: what are you carrying there? Is it a gun?

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.440
And he said no, it's a leg.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.080
And it was a leg, it was his friend's prosthetic leg, that he was going to get fixed

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.889
So he was there, but you know, this was the Gestapo he was messing with, right?

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.220
So he was pushing his luck somewhat.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.960
Anyway this sort of sense of humor - this sort of maverick style - actually carried through.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.640
Let's fast-forward to 1978 - he's coming towards the end of his career

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.940
there's this - he's a good mathematician, but not a great one,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.820
and he gives a seminar about the value of this zeta function at three, okay?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.880
And whether it's rational or not which hadn't been and which the great Euler himself had not been able to solve.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.339
Anyway, Apéry says he solved it. Okay. It is irrational, and he can prove it

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.549
So he starts his - and everyone's a bit skeptical, okay?

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.340
So he starts his seminar and the first thing he writes down is the following.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.179
Doesn't really matter, details of that don't matter

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.290
The point is nobody in the audience has ever seen this formula before, okay?

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.820
It's not being proven, nothing.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.099
So they immediately ask, you know, where did - no one's seen this before - where did they find it?

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.389
Where did he find this formula? And he says - he replies - "Oh, they grow in my garden."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.570
So everybody's getting annoyed at this point. People start to leave and like, you know, everyone's furious,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.600
and then while this is all going on -
 people are leaving -

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.180
some guy at the back's got a programmable calculator,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.660
and manages to verify this sum, at least to the accuracy of the calculator,

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.380
and then, you know, as the talk's going on, he interrupts and says and announces this,

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.119
at which point everyone sits up and starts paying attention.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.080
And it turns out that Apéry has solved this hundreds of years old problem,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.480
and he proves that it is indeed irrational.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.520
And of course it is fabulous - it sort of shook maths at the time.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.800
People started to try to use it to then start to ask questions about the other odd values - you know -

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.880
zeta 5, zeta 7, and so on.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.260
And they try to use the same method, and all methods like that have so far failed,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.880
interestingly enough, and so it's still not known whether those guys are irrational or not.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.680
BRADY: But three we cracked.
TONY: Three is definitely irrational,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.660
but it's not known whether it's transcendental.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.420
What is known about the other odd ones is that there are an infinite number of irrational ones,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.300
but we don't know which ones they are.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:31.720
It's even known that one of zeta 5, zeta 7, zeta 9, and zeta 11,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.640
that one of these is irrational, but we don't know which one.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.440
BRADY: (laughs)
TONY: So it's so little known about it and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.780
It's sort of - I think it's a fabulous number.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.880
So coming back to Apéry - I did a shout-out on Twitter.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.800
I asked people to send in three randomly chosen positive integers,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.220
and the reason I did that was 'cause I wanted to estimate Apéry's constant.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.780
Now I'm a bit lazy, so I didn't go through all of them 'cause I've got loads!

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.100
And some people put ones that were a little bit hard to manipulate as well.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.109
There's quite some quite entertaining comments about how you can't choose that random numbers from just 140 characters

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.509
And so on and so forth, but anyway

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.740
I did go through someone I went through quite a few.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.260
I have a list here, and what I did was I went through those numbers,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.690
and I checked whether the combinations were co-prime. So in other words I asked

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.460
What was their greatest common divisor - of the three numbers -

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.420
and if that greatest common divisor was 1, then they're co-prime.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.400
If it was some number higher than 1 then they're not co-prime.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.060
So I just went through and I checked them all, all the different combinations.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.080
So let me do this - I've gotta count this now, Brady!

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.200
I haven't actually checked this - I didn't check the number - [if] the estimate came out right,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.920
so this is real-time, real-action stuff.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.090
So anyway the number that are co-prime -

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.119
Let's just - let's just count them, okay

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.100
So here's my list, so that's one - all the ticks are co-prime, okay.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.380
BRADY: These are all the tweeters?!

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.980
TONY: These are all the tweeters - not all of them 'cause there were just too many, so I had to stop at some point,

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.990
but it's a lot of them, okay?

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.619
So these are all the tweeters - so anyway, okay,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.750
So if they're ticked, then they're co-prime - they sent in co-prime combinations. So one, two,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.800
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.100
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, ...

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.880
38, 39, 40, 41, 42,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.620
43, 44, 45, ... 68, 69, 70, 71, 72.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.260
So there's 72 of those came in as co-primes, co-prime combinations.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.620
Some people didn't send in co-prime combinations

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.280
What I've written down here

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.300
are the greatest common divisors that they had so we'll just count how many of those there were.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.260
One, two, three, four, five, ... fourteen, fifteen.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
All right, did I miss any?

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.780
Okay, so that's a total of - it was 87 in total, right?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.000
Okay, now I claim, that -

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.100
This is the moment of truth now, I dunno if this is going to work -

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.540
That 87 divided by the number of - so the total number divided by the co-prime number - let's see what number this gives.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.900
(excited laughing)

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.340
It's not bad, not bad!

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.020
Is that good?

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.300
BRADY: It's pretty close.
TONY: I think it's pretty close. I'm happy with that.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.500
I'm very happy with that estimate. Okay, good.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.740
Yay, and I think, I'm sure if I'd gone through all of them, this would've got more and more accurate, right?

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.820
Okay, how? Why?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.160
Let's suppose we had s numbers.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.180
What's the probability that any given number - so we got some prime number p -

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.120
What's the probability that any given -
 you pick a random number - that it's divisible by p?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:46.140
It's 1 over p. If I've got s numbers, what's the probability that they're all divisible by p?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.320
Well that's going to be 1 over p to the s.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:58.280
What's the probability that at least one of those s numbers is not divisible by p?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.800
That's 1 minus 1 over p to the s.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.300
So if they - if I now ask,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.420
whether if I've got s numbers,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.520
whether the probability that their lowest [*greatest] common divisor is 1,

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.080
the basis - there's no number of the prime numbers that divides them all,

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.440
then I just have to take the product of this number over all the primes.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.240
So that's the product over the primes

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.700
of 1 minus 1 over p to the s and now our friend Euler comes back, right?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:35.799
Because it's all Euler - he's always [like?] that, Euler - Euler showed that the zeta function

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800
Was the product over the primes

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.780
1 minus 1 over p to the s to the minus 1.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.380
So this is 1 over zeta of s.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:55.560
Okay so this means you've got a 1 in zeta s chance of finding a co-prime combination.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Okay, so for three -

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:05.600
I've got three numbers. The chances of finding a co-prime combination are 1 in zeta 3.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.260
That's why it worked. Makes sense?

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.020
