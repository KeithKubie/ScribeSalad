00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.193
&gt;&gt; Mathematics is an intricate and fascinating language that we've developed to

00:00:03.193 --> 00:00:07.194
understand and explain the world around us. Sometimes it can seem very

00:00:07.194 --> 00:00:11.454
abstract, which can make it feel confusing or irrelevant. In this course we

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.352
will show you the relevance of this important branch of mathematics to your

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:15.845
everyday life.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:18.350
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Julie Sliva Spitzer.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.815
&gt;&gt; And I'm Miriam Swords Kalk.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.770
&gt;&gt; And together with Sarah Norell, we'll be teaching college algebra.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.075
&gt;&gt; In this course we'll approach algebra using real world scenarios.

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.087
&gt;&gt; We'll help a start up company handle its finances with its new product,

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:33.735
windshield wiper glasses.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.063
&gt;&gt; We'll talk about hearing and sound, the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls, how panda

00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:39.542
populations grow, and much more.

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:42.535
&gt;&gt; These stories will help you put the math in context.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:46.012
&gt;&gt; To help you develop a deep understanding of mathematics, and learn how to

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.646
problem-solve more effectively.

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:52.727
&gt;&gt; So join us to learn how intuitive, relevant, and compelling algebra can be.
