00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
Your car has stalled somewhere deserted, your airplane makes a crash landing,

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.259
or you're trying to survive after our civilization has finally crumbled.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.639
You may need the skills to continue life after your luxuries have been taken away,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.400
but how? The main necessities for survival are water, food, shelter, warmth and clothing.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.689
So, let's start with water. It will be integral to search for a fresh water source

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.769
but once found, it won't be immune to disease. You'll need to boil the water for five minutes to kill potentially harmful bacteria and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.130
additional toxins are likely proteins that will denature at high heat.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.969
You can consume water from cacti by cutting off sections of the cactus and mashing them into a container. In colder climates you can eat

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.959
fresh snow with dense ice being the best source. If you can't get to fresh water,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.149
dew can be collected in limp fabric and rainwater can be collected from leaves and divots and rocks.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.209
Don't waste water on quenching your lips. You can suck on a button or pebble to help with dry mouth and thirst

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.499
temptation. Once water is found drink it slowly over a long period of time.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.538
This allows the body to utilize it efficiently and will inhibit nausea. Now for food.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.449
You'll have to suck it up and eat insects, crickets, mealworms, and other critters are high in protein vitamins and minerals

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.509
which are essential to survival. You're also an intimidating animal and in most cases owls wolves and foxes

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.909
will leave their caught prey if you appear

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.159
which you can then take. There will likely be lactic acid present in the meat if the prey had to run so it will be

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.339
tough and spoil faster than freshly caught, but if cooked immediately it should be fine. After a month without vitamin C

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
you can start to feel weak as your body struggles to heal itself. This is because vitamin C

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.180
Is integral to biological pathways that build collagen, the structural protein that causes wound healing.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.589
Boiling spruce needles in water to create a tea will provide you with the equivalent vitamin C

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590
level as a fresh glass of orange juice.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.739
One of the easiest animals to capture is rabbit as they rely so heavily on

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.589
camouflage and are easy to get close to you once spotted.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.250
But you can't survive off rabbit alone as they are such a lean meat

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.899
so you'll need to find more fat. So much of our lipid intake comes from staples such as

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.430
butter, milk, salad oil or ice cream, things that are sort of hard to find in the wild,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.539
so you'll need to actively seek out fat eating some plants and berries can be deadly so think like a squirrel and eat acorns

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.470
They're high in fat and always safe. The bitter taste comes from the organic

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.298
substance tannin which is found in tea and beer. If you boil the acorns for two hours

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.249
you'll decrease the bitter taste and then leave them to dry or grind them into a paste and make pancakes.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.379
All aspects of the dandelion are edible, too.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.409
You can also boil them to decrease bitterness as well. Maple tree seeds are also a fun snack that is high in essential

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.589
nutrients and fat. It will be nutritionally valuable to catch fish

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.869
but there are alternatives that don't need to be caught.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.359
Seaweed is extremely nutritious and abundant. It can be boiled, steamed, fried, or eaten raw and

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.919
rock cleaning mollusks are also rampant along the Pacific coast of North America.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.039
An obvious way to cook meat is over a campfire with a stick

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
but you can steam food by digging a hole adding hot rocks to it and covering it with wet

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.750
vegetation or seaweed. Add the food on top and slowly pour water

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.449
and the hot rocks will create steam. To create heat

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.530
you'll need fire so always have matches or a lighter handy, but in desperate times

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.569
you can hit two rocks together for sparks.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.779
Keep your eyes peeled for iron pyrite, a type of flammable

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.138
mineral that is mined for its combustible properties. Another safe option is the classic magnifying glass binocular lenses

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.299
which can work as well. Once you get sparks

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.479
you'll need a tinder, the name for materials that can ignite easily.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.659
Examples are shredded birch bark, dry moss, lichen, grass,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.659
evergreen needles, and the bark of all cedar trees. Once lit you'll want to lay the ends of sticks in the fire and then push

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.638
them into the flame slowly as they're consumed. This is an efficient way to keep your fire going for longer.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.179
You don't want to light a fire within your shelter for obvious reasons and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.690
proper ventilation is needed to stop any chance of carbon monoxide poisoning

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.709
A shallow cave is an ideal shelter putting your fire a safe distance in front for warmth. In the woods breaking off branches and making

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.959
a leaning structure is simple and effective, too.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.590
Angle the gradual incline

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.310
towards the wind and start building the walls from the bottom up. Use a stick to make a drain around the structure for a rainwater

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.919
to drain. As for a comfy bed pine needles, dry moss, leaves, and ferns are the Casper mattress of your

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.709
post-apocalyptic life. In the winter don't dress too

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.408
warmly as your body is capable of regulating temperature and perspiring can lead to dehydration. On the way out

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.539
you'll want to grab boots and thick wool socks.

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.449
Leave your skinny jeans at home as you'll need extra room around the knees for dexterity. Look for clothes with as many pockets as possible,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.439
preferably ones that can close, and loose cotton shirts will provide better protection from insects. Oil driven from animal fats can be used to grease

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.830
footwear and help keep them resistant to water, and the down feathers caught from any birds can be shoved beneath your clothes for warmth when

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.279
needed. Now rewatch this video and take notes as when it comes time to fend for yourself access to information on the Internet

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.709
will likely not be an option. Good luck.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.950
And if you want to see how some of the richest people in the world are already

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.980
prepping for the apocalypse, watch our second video here by clicking on the screen or using the link in the description. Seriously,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.259
they're called Preppers, and they're already getting ready. And subscribe for more weekly science videos every Thursday.
