00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Announcer] This program is presented

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.240
by University of California Television.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.640
Like what you learn?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.583
to keep up with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.250
(lively music)

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
- So these are the
Berkeley Graduate Lectures,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.030
the Hitchcock Lectures
and as you heard yesterday

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.030
when Carol gave her first
talk on how telomeres cause

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.020
age-related disease, there's
a great story in discovery

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.330
that can be serendipitous
and so today, Carol,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.480
I'll introduce her shortly,
will give us a story

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.800
that's been retitled The Anatomy
of a Scientific Discovery.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.490
She's gonna tell you really
much more about the process

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.490
of how scientists discover
things that are later deemed

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.360
to have high impact as we all would agree

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.140
from the 2009 Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.050
So Carol is a professor and director

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.190
of molecular biology and
genetics at Johns Hopkins

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.970
but she started as a California native.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.480
She was born and raised
here for the most part

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.770
and she went to UC Santa Barbara

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.040
for her undergraduate
degree and then came here

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.163
to UC Berkeley for her PhD.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160
And from there, went to Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.110
as faculty and in '97
then to Johns Hopkins.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.020
But it's from Cold Spring
Harbor from the early 90s

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.721
that I know Carol where I had the pleasure

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.120
of joining her research group.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120
And there are many things that you'll hear

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.240
that are really important
features in a scientist

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.240
who's committed to doing
discovery basic research.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.980
And Carol exemplifies
really those features

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.380
and I think in part, the
MCB graduate program here

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.380
and Carol, to me, have the
important starting point

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.240
as she'll talk about of
curiosity-driven research

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.180
and hard work.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.470
But I say that it takes much more

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.990
than just curiosity and hard
work because it also takes

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.053
the patience to let the question unfold,

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.840
to let the real question that
you should be answering unfold

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.530
as opposed to the question
you started asking.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.830
And also it takes the insight to recognize

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.390
when the question you should
be asking comes along.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.130
And I'll just quote in
fact from the 1945 winner

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.110
of the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.040
Sir Alexander Fleming whose comment was,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.373
one sometimes finds what
one is not looking for.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.290
In describing his discovery of penicillin

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.493
which he discovered accidentally.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.316
He's a bacteriologist, he loved to watch

00:03:43.316 --> 00:03:45.800
and understand how bacteria grew

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.630
and he had stacks and stacks of plates

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.170
from his curiosity his hard
work and he put them aside

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.730
and one day, he happened
to notice in the corner

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.583
of one of these plates
a giant colony of mold.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.640
And this is not what he
set out to do to grow mold

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.300
but he noticed something about this mold

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.800
and it was this insight
that led him to penicillin.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.860
He noticed that this particular mold

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.320
wasn't just competing with the bacteria

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.830
for space on the plate, it was
actually killing the bacteria

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.380
that surrounded it on the plate.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.210
And from there, he recognized,
that insight that hmm,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.190
this could be a new question to study

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.460
as opposed to the question

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.000
that I started this experiment
with in the first place.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.280
And I really, I've
learned a lot from Carol

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.270
and I've learned a lot from
this process of learning

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.280
not just to be curious
but to have more patience

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.310
and to let the questions change and evolve

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.420
and take you to what you
weren't sure you were asking

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.253
in the first place.

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:51.823
So thanks Carol and
welcome back to Berkeley.

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:55.350
(attendees applauding)

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.340
- Well, thank you very much
for that perfect introduction

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.450
for what I'm hoping to tell you today.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.250
So yesterday, we talked a
little bit about the science

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.090
of telomeres and telomerase.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.380
And today, I thought that I
would take off a little bit

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.790
and use telomerase and
the discovery of telomeres

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.170
as a way of telling a story
about exactly that about

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.129
how serendipity and chance play a role

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.830
in the progress of science.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.300
So once again, as we were
discussing yesterday,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.054
we'll be discussing telomeres.

00:05:32.054 --> 00:05:34.900
So for those of you that
weren't here yesterday,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.280
I'll just go back over this.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.080
Within the nucleus of a
cell, you have chromosomes

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.579
and the genes are all along
the length of the chromosomes

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:46.790
and the telomeres are these end parts

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.510
that protect the ends
and maintain the length.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.800
And so we'll be talking a little bit

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.000
about some of the
discoveries along the path

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.990
to understanding the role of telomeres

00:06:00.355 --> 00:06:02.793
in a number of different organisms.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.970
So if you think about
scientific discovery,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.440
in hindsight it may
seem that the discovery

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.720
is a fairly linear process.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.720
So telomeres were first
recognized as important components

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.940
in the 1940s and then the
telomere sequence is identified

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.290
and then it was clear
that there was a role

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.823
of telomere elongation in
telomere length maintenance.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.833
Telomerase was predicted.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.050
Telomerase was then discovered.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.950
We then understood the connection
of telomeres and cancer

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.960
and then telomeres and
disease and then in 2009,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.680
a Nobel Prize for the
discovery of telomerase.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.650
So it may seem like this is a
linear process when in fact,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.953
the process is really much
more complicated than that.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.010
So what I'll be doing is
explaining how in reality

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.030
the process is very messy
involving serendipity,

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.210
personal interactions, insight, hindsight

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.000
and various other approaches.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.890
So I don't expect you to
understand all of this yet.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.870
We'll kind of go through
it and work our way through

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.190
but there are two points
that I want to make

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.390
at the beginning.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.500
The first of all is that this timeline

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500
is not an accurate linear timeline.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.830
You'll see that the 1980s are greatly

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.840
overly represented here.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.560
There was a lot of a particular
progress that went on

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.110
in the 80s and the early 90s.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.130
So this isn't meant to be an
accurate linear representation

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.750
of time but also,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.490
I'm taking a fair amount
of artistic license here.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.210
So this is not meant to be any
kind of a definitive history

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.920
and I apologize in advance for anyone

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.420
who's important discovery
I might not mention.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.690
This is really meant
to be more metaphorical

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.690
about how the process
of discovery unfolds.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.320
So this isn't meant to be
taken as a definitive history

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.303
by any means.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.450
But there are gonna be some themes

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.680
that I'm going to bring
out during this talk.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.570
And the first is the curiosity
is a driver of science.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.600
Discoveries tend to happen in batches.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.000
That's in part because
people talk to each other

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.710
but it's important that
discoveries happen in batches

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.210
because replication is really essential

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:33.690
to establish a new discovery
as something fundamentally new.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.700
Fields collide and inform each other.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.450
So you may be working on one area

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.330
and then start working in another area

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.760
and it's the juxtaposition of those fields

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.793
where a lot of new things
can usually be found.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.830
And scientific discovery
is not like engineering.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.020
Changing direction or
objectives can be a good thing.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.030
Very much like what you
just heard from Cathy.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.340
Being able to be distracted
by something that may be

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.980
the question that you really should ask.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.660
And then finally, another quote,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.590
this one from Louis Pasteur,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.540
that chance favors the prepared mind.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.870
So we'll be working through
some of these themes

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.040
as we go through as an example
of a scientific discovery,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.503
some of the discoveries about telomerase.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.930
So the telomeres were
first functionally defined

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.900
as units that protect chromosome ends

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.500
in the late 1930s, early
1940s by H.J. Muller

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.820
working in drosophila
and Barbara McClintock

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.680
working in maize showing that
there were functional units

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.380
that had to protect chromosome ends.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.700
But then that initial recognition
of these functional units

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.760
had to wait a number of years

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.630
before we could really understand anything

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.330
about the mechanism of
what these functional units

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.273
actually do.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.170
So it was in 1972 that there was a paper

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.010
that was published by Jim Watson,

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.570
one of the co-discoverers
of the structure of DNA,

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.270
and what he defined is what's called

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.010
as the end replication problem.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.360
The problem with replicating the end

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.590
of any kind of a linear DNA molecule.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.430
And so if you have such
a linear DNA molecule,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.630
it turns out that what
was known in the 1970s

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.370
was the mechanism by which
this replication occurs

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.030
is that you start copying this chromosome

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.190
from an internal location,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.490
and when you then copy to the very end

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.920
of the linear molecule,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.180
it turns out that there's a small region

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.090
because of the biochemical mechanism

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.360
by which these are made,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.000
there's a small region at the
very end of the chromosome

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.430
which isn't copied.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.560
And as you go through this
process and continually copy

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.621
many chromosomes, you then
expect that chromosomes

00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:53.210
would shorten progressively
from their ends.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.150
So this was a theoretical paper

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.590
that was published by Jim Watson.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.100
And around the same time, it turns out

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.540
that there was a paper,
also a theoretical paper

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.750
published by Alexey Olovnikov

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.120
in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.790
Although he did not use the
term telomere in this paper,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.530
he noticed that there may be a problem

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.530
with copying the ends of molecules

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.700
and he used this term marginotomy

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.890
being the margins of the chromosomes

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.630
instead of using the word telomere.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.705
And because of that
different usage of words,

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:28.940
his publications weren't well known

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.610
to the telomere community
until a number of years later.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.030
However, Olovnikov did show

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.150
that there was this
theoretical problem of copying

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.982
the ends of chromosomes and
he had the important insight

00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:45.060
to link that to a paper
that had been published

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.160
in the 1960s by Len
Hayflick which suggested

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.770
that if you take primary human
cells and put them in culture

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.250
that they have a limited
life span in culture.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.840
So this limited life span of human cells

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.630
was termed cellular senescence.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.650
So back in the 70s, these
two ideas were linked

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.720
but as you'll see, we
weren't able to follow up

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.403
on what that meant until
a number of years later.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.320
So the first molecular
characterization of telomeres

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.780
and this is one of the
themes that will bring out

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.350
is that as soon as you
identify actual components

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.540
and the molecular mechanisms,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.020
it's easier to understand function.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.430
So the first molecular characterization

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.420
came from the identification
of the telomere DNA sequence

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.480
in Tetrahymena, this
single-celled organism

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.990
that has 40,000 chromosomes.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.440
And what's shown here is
a nice electron micrograph

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.800
of this particular molecule

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.680
which is important from Tetrahymena

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.590
which was a 21 kilobase molecule

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.100
that has telomeres at both ends.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.320
And so Elizabeth Blackburn and Joe Gall

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.510
were very curious about what
was the actual DNA sequence

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.790
that was at the ends of those chromosomes.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.713
And they published this paper in 1978,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.570
and what they showed is
that there were many copies

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.600
of this very simple
sequence on both of the ends

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.950
of these molecules.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.420
And so that then defined
the telomere repeat sequence

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.850
for the first time in any organism

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.560
as these tandem repeats
of simple sequences.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.610
So this paper was in 1978,

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.170
shortly thereafter, just
three years thereafter,

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.220
there was another paper
again from ciliated protozoa,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.710
in this case, Oxytricha
which looks a little bit

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.790
like its cousin Tetrahymena
although they are actually

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.440
quite distantly related.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.440
And what this group showed was
that there was a very similar

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.650
tandemly repeated DNA sequence on the ends

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.510
of the chromosomes in four other ciliates.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.270
So in this case, this
Oxytricha telomere sequence

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.320
was tandem repeats of the sequence T4, G4.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.380
So there's T4, G4, T4, G4.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.540
And then they showed at the very end,

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.650
there's an extension on
one of these DNA strands

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.360
relative to the other and it turns out

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.781
that this was a very important
functional characterization

00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:20.163
of the ends of the chromosomes.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.620
So the end replication
problem should predict

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.940
that telomeres shorten
every time cells divide

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.530
because you can't completely copy

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.200
to the end of the chromosome.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.283
And so in understanding this
as a theoretical problem,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.890
there is sort of a mindset as to okay,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.803
how are you going to overcome
this telomere shortening?

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.150
However, telomere shortening was not seen

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.480
when you were growing these
Tetrahymena cells in culture.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.950
So why was it that telomeres
aren't apparently shortening

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.030
as cells are growing in culture?

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.130
In fact, it was found
very shortly thereafter,

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.440
the telomeres would actually get longer

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.370
in some single-celled organisms
as you grew them in culture

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.000
and this was very counterintuitive.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.210
So unexpectedly, there was
this telomere elongation

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.300
and this was a paper

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.753
from another single-celled
organism, trypanosomes.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.600
And if you look on this
the Southern blot here,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.870
there's a band that does not
change size as these cells

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.980
are growing for increasing
numbers of divisions in culture,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.280
but then, this telomeric band
here, as you grow these cells,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.130
it actually got longer
which is the opposite

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.370
of what one had been thinking about

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.090
with this end replication problem.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.713
So this didn't make a lot of sense.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.010
However, when you do this
same experiment in Tetrahymena

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.950
where the telomeres were first identified,

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.510
again, it was seen that the
telomeres actually got longer.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.560
So here, our cells grown
for increasing numbers

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.110
of cell divisions and this telomeric band,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.320
you can see in increasing
in length as these cells

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.300
are grown continuously in culture.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.280
So this is another example
of discoveries happening

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.600
in batches so we really
believe that this is the case

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.020
that there is this telomere elongation

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.533
but yet we don't know why that is.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.500
So in the early years of
the telomere research,

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.820
we were really gathering
pieces of the puzzle together.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.700
They really didn't fit,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.160
but by gathering up all these
various different pieces

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.700
then trying to interpret
what may be occurring.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.700
So the telomeres were shown
to be functional units

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.830
and then the end replication
problem was proposed

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.790
and that was linked to
cellular senescence.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.370
The telomere sequence was also identified

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.650
which allowed an understanding
of what's going on

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.630
at the molecular level and
then one was able to see

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.383
this telomere addition.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.230
So that was sort of the early
stages of trying to understand

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.403
what was going on with telomeres in cells.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.660
The next important
functional characterization

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.840
came from this experiment that was done

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.880
by Liz Blackburn and Jack Szostak

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.410
where they were able to show
that Tetrahymena telomeres

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.900
would function as telomeres in yeast.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.300
So here is a circular plasmid
which was very familiar

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.310
to people that were studying yeast

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:29.360
and when you take that circular plasmid

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.220
and open it up and add
Tetrahymena telomeres

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.230
onto the ends of these chromosomes,

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.250
these actually, the Tetrahymena telomeres

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.690
functioned as telomeres in yeast

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.850
and as I'll be saying in a few minutes,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.500
they were actually elongated in the yeast.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.940
But this paper was published here in 1982.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.750
And in '83 and in '84, again,
similar kinds of findings

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.210
were also made independently
by other groups.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.340
So here's one paper which
has a kind of unusual title

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.780
that doesn't really tell you
what's happening in the paper

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.990
but what they did in this
paper also published in Nature

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.990
was they showed that there
must be GT-rich sequences

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.970
which are present on the
ends of chromosomes in yeast

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.960
and they showed that there was addition

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.933
of GT-rich sequences onto
the Tetrahymena telomeres.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.470
Also in 1984, there
was a paper that showed

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.780
that when you take telomeres in yeast,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.710
if you take now, in this
case, Oxytricha telomeres

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.220
and put them into yeast, that
those Oxytricha telomeres

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.330
would function as telomeres in yeast

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.240
and that they were elongated,

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.850
so again, here's an example
of discoveries happening

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.590
in batches and reinforcing one another.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.330
So this general concept
that telomeres would work

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.540
in a variety of different organisms

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.653
was clearly very well established.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.700
And then later, in '84, the
Szostak and Blackburn lab

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.417
went on and identified the actual sequence

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:17.417
which was added on to these
Tetrahymena telomeres in yeast.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.270
And from this paper, they
proposed that there maybe

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.670
some kind of an activity,
telomere transferase-like activity

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.880
that would extend this GT-rich strand

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.990
of the yeast telomeres.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.110
In the exact same journal

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.450
where this was published
in Nature in 1984,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.100
the next paper in the journal
was a paper by a group

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.850
that was also proposing a way

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.420
that you could elongate telomeres.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.900
How is it that telomeres
are shown to be elongated

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.770
and why would you have
these sequences added on

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.510
to the Tetrahymena telomeres?

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.690
And I'm not gonna take you
through this complicated model

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.050
but basically, what this group proposed

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.770
was that there was a
recombination mechanism

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.320
by which telomeres could be added

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.430
as opposed to de novo addition mechanism.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.580
So I'll just show you the cartoon here,

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.510
a recombination mechanism.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.120
You can imagine that if
you have a particularly

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.100
long telomere and then a short telomere

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.970
is that you can actually
copy this one strand

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.680
from the short telomere can
invade the longer strand

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.680
and you get net elongation
of the short telomere

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.070
and then repair synthesis.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.640
But the main point here
is that you start off

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.730
with a long telomere and a short telomere

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.740
and you end up with two long telomeres

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.150
by a mechanism that was
a well-known mechanism

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.760
in the DNA repair field.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.760
In contrast, what had been
proposed for the de novo addition

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.420
is simply adding on to
this three prime end

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.180
sequences in this direction
and then filling out

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.490
and getting met elongation
by this mechanism.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.920
So the same set of data
led two different groups

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.390
to propose two very different models.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:14.390
So understanding that telomere
addition may be occurring,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.210
one group proposed a
recombination based model

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.570
and another group proposed

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.860
that there would be de novo elongation.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.720
So it wasn't necessarily
clear how this would come out

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.410
in terms of the importance
to telomere replication.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.120
And as you will see,
we'll be talking a lot

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.630
about de novo elongation
although later on,

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.030
recombination also will
turn out to be important

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.044
in addition.

00:21:41.044 --> 00:21:46.044
So both of these pathways
will turn out to be important.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.570
So when I came to Berkeley to
work with Elizabeth Blackburn,

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.330
I was then charged with
trying to understand

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.050
is there any evidence for something

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.870
which would add new telomeres
onto the ends of chromosomes?

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.450
So to test one of those two models

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.710
which was the de novo elongation model.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:12.370
And so what we did was
to take again Tetrahymena

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.630
which has a source of many telomeres

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.440
and we were hoping would have a source

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.400
of many of the components
which were necessary

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.820
for making telomeres and to grind them up

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.960
and put them into a test tube

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.480
with the right sort of reagents

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.380
and the reagents would be
something which would mimic

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.980
natural telomere end and the precursors

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.930
for the telomeric sequence
which is necessary to be made

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.360
and what we found was that
this enzyme telomerase

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.160
would extend the primer
by adding sequences

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.750
of the telomeric repeats.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.270
And that is what is shown here,

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.310
the elongation of the telomeres.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:58.310
So this was just one year later
after the initial discovery

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.630
that the telomeres were
added on to the Tetrahymena

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.803
telomeres in yeast.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:10.610
Then by asking the question
how is it that you can actually

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:14.280
have an enzyme add something
that is not templated

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.220
onto the ends of chromosomes?

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.460
We propose that perhaps,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.930
there's a essential nucleic acid involved

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.903
that is an RNA component.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.870
And we identified this small RNA

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.150
which contains the complement
of the telomeric repeats

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.440
as part of the RNA and showed that the way

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.430
that the telomeres are
elongated is by copying

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.290
this template within the telomerase.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.060
So those discoveries
happen in a relatively

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.570
short period of time.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.080
So after we understood
about the telomere addition

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.363
and the de novo elongation,
this predicted the telomerase.

00:23:54.363 --> 00:23:57.530
Telomerase was discovered
and the RNA component

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.713
was identified just a
few years thereafter.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.030
So we're basically collecting up

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.900
the different kinds of
components of the machinery

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.963
that's necessary for
maintaining telomeres.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.170
So another question that
we didn't really know

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.450
very much about that was
going on about the same time

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:21.530
was trying to understand from
the standpoint of the telomere

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.320
what's actually bound
to the telomere itself?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.910
The telomerase would be the enzyme

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.830
which would make this longer
but what is normally here

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.900
along the telomere.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.810
And so a number of groups were interested

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.900
in identifying what
the components might be

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.780
that would make up the telomere itself.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.057
And in a series of papers
that were happening

00:24:43.057 --> 00:24:48.057
in the middle 80s, again,
the team era binding proteins

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.680
were first characterized by
Dan Gottschling and Tom Cech,

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.440
again, in ciliated protozoa.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.520
These organisms that have
many tens of thousands

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.470
of telomeres.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.720
Again, going to the
source of where telomeres

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.090
are most plentiful.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.440
So they found that there was evidence

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.310
for a specific telomere complex.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.500
And then Dan Gottschling and Ginger Zakian

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.760
were able to identify
the specific proteins

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.850
that were bound in that
complex and then finally

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.280
actually cloning to know
the individual subunits

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.280
of this telomeric complex
occurred in the early 90s.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.790
So the discovery of telomerase
then was around the same time

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.640
as the discover of these
telomere binding proteins

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.860
identifying the individual components.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.210
So at this point, what we knew about

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.460
was that there were these
telomere binding proteins

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.380
and most of the work had been done

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.350
in either yeast or ciliates.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.800
Either Tetrahymena or Oxytricha.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.960
And it still wasn't necessarily clear

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.280
to the wider community of biologists

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.160
that what we knew about telomeres

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.720
in these single-celled organisms
really would be informative

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.720
of anything that might happen
in humans or in other mammals,

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.560
that is what relevance
did this actually have

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.570
to human disease?

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:20.470
Now, certainly, from the
standpoint of a biologist,

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.930
we knew that something
that was very fundamental

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:28.090
for all cells very
likely would be conserved

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.590
throughout many different organisms.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.570
Although it wasn't necessarily clear

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.070
to the scientific community at that time.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.770
So the first hint of what
was actually going on

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:43.260
in human cells came in the middle 80s.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.170
From this paper that was
published by Howard Cooke's lab

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.424
and what they found was
that there was a region

00:26:49.424 --> 00:26:52.480
on the X and the Y chromosomes

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.340
which was very close
to the human telomere.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:59.950
So this is a cartoon of the
human X and Y chromosomes

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.090
and of course, most of these chromosomes,

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.850
most of the DNA on these chromosomes

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.900
is different from each other but turns out

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.733
that there's a region

00:27:06.733 --> 00:27:09.242
which is called a pseudoautosomal region

00:27:09.242 --> 00:27:11.820
which has sequences that are present

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.170
on both the X and the Y chromosomes

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.120
and Howard Cooke was trying to understand

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.080
this pseudoautosomal region
and what he came across

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.200
was that when he probed for these probes

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.930
that the bands that he saw
were very heterogeneous

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.770
and this looks very much like
this heterogeneous sized band

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.360
that was seen for telomeres
in both Tetrahymena

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.470
and in yeast cells.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.660
So here was a hint that the evidence

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.980
that we had for what
telomeres would look like

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.290
in these single-celled eukaryotes
may actually play a role

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.920
in human telomeres.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.730
And they went on then to do

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.110
really the definitive
experiment at the time

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.620
to show something that
something really is telomeric.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.990
What you do is you you take
and you treat with a nucleus

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.210
and this is an enzyme which
will chew away from the end

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.570
and this heterogeneous band here then,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.630
if you chew away with it with a nuclease

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.070
for increasing amounts of
time, it decreases in size.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.840
So this suggests that it
really is the natural end

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.750
of the chromosome.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.280
So this was in 1985 and we didn't yet know

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.430
the sequence of the actual telomere.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.370
Okay, so these bands, they are identifying

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.390
because they're looking with sequences

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.850
that are very near the telomere.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.140
So they still didn't know

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.271
what the actual telomeric sequence was

00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.400
of the human sequence.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.400
It wasn't until 1988 when the Moyzis group

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.300
was interested in looking
at repetitive DNA sequences

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.280
from humans and they came
across this repetitive sequence,

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.930
T2, A, G3 and they were able to show

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.550
that that repetitive sequence,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.700
when you hybridize that
to human chromosomes

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.240
and you may be able to
see here on the ends

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.210
these faint yellow dots on
these red human chromosomes.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.330
They were able to show
that this repeated sequence

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.820
is actually present, not
only on the human chromosomes

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.470
but also on many other
vertebrate chromosomes

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.670
in mouse and a variety of other organisms.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.610
So this now definitively identified

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.700
the human telomeric sequence

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.530
and this was really an enabling discovery

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.000
because it allowed testing of models

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.993
for what's happening with human telomeres.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.770
Again, the discovery in one
lab leads to rapid discoveries

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.933
in other labs.

00:29:40.933 --> 00:29:44.660
So the human telomeres
and the entire sequence

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.060
of the human telomere was then cloned

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.170
by two different groups.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.210
Again, in back-to-back papers in Nature

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.480
and these groups use
the exact same approach

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.600
as had been identified for
cloning the yeast telomere

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.640
by Blackburn and Szostak,

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.260
that is to take and put
human DNA into yeast cells

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.130
and showed that human DNA
actually functions as a telomere.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.720
And they used nuclease sensitivity to show

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.490
that that cloned human
DNA actually was telomeric

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.030
and this is once again another example

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.660
of discoveries happening in batches.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.480
And this is important not just because

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.960
a lot of things are happening
around the same time

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.290
but because by these very similar findings

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.410
coming from different groups
from different angles,

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.780
it really established in a
very short period of time

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.330
the importance of these sequences.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.440
So we had been focusing on telomerase

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.840
and the telomerase components,
the telomere binding proteins

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.050
and then with the identification

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.160
of the human telomere
sequence that then allowed us

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.650
and others to go on and test models

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:57.670
that have been around
for a number of years.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.710
And specifically, the model
that we were able to test

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.450
was this question about
telomere shortening

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.540
in primary human cells as
they divide in culture.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.940
As I said, it had been
proposed in the 1970s

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.760
that the progressive telomere shortening

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.350
in human cells may play a
role in cellular senescence.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:22.150
And so I was fortunate to collaborate

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.590
to be able to ask this question

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.660
very shortly after the identification

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.960
of the human telomeric sequence,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.040
we were able to show that if
you actually take human cells

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.350
and put them in culture
as Hayflick had done

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.940
and showed that these cells divide

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.440
for a certain number of times in culture

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.580
and then stop dividing
and we were able to use

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.740
the human telomeric DNA
probe and show that indeed

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.320
the telomeres shortened progressively

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.210
as these cells are dividing in culture.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.750
Not only does this happen with cells

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.720
that are dividing and culture in humans

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.520
but it also actually happens
in human cells with age.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.120
So this is an example of
the average telomere length

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.950
taken from a gel like I just showed you

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:10.460
compared to the age of the individual

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.120
and that there's a progressive
telomere shortening

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.970
with age in these human white blood cells.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.860
And now, having recently
discovered telomerase

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.420
and understanding that
telomerase is necessary

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.010
to add sequences on to
the ends of chromosomes,

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.940
what we initially thought
was well these cells

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.970
perhaps don't have telomerase

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.980
and so they're shortening progressively

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.030
in the absence of telomerase.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.590
So that's what we thought then

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.930
that there was no telomerase
in these somatic cells.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.610
But now, what we think is happening

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.040
is that although there
may be telomerase activity

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.910
in those cells, the telomerase
activity is limiting

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.320
and the cell division can
outpace the elongation

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.800
that's occurring by telomerase.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.970
So within the lifetime
of these individuals,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.790
there's so much cell division going on

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.040
in the blood cell compartment

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.350
that the division gets ahead
of the ability of telomerase

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.690
to elongate those telomeres

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.560
and that's why you see
this telomere shortening.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.260
So as I mentioned, it was
proposed a while before

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.833
that cellular senescence may have some,

00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:18.990
that telomere length may have some role

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.520
with cellular senescence and
so this is really the point

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.460
that ideas aren't always
connected in a linear fashion,

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.280
that past work that we
didn't really understand

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.750
maybe how it fit in to the story

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.650
can then become relevant
later on and in this case,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.810
it became relevant because we knew

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.140
the human telomere sequence,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.810
and we needed to know
what that sequence was

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.550
in order to do the experiment

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.940
to ask about the telomere shortening.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.760
So indeed, knowing this
human telomere sequence

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.420
then led us to understand
about the cellular senescence

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.600
even though this had
previously been published

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.710
a number of years before.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.007
So along with understanding the telomeres

00:34:01.007 --> 00:34:02.170
and cellular senescence,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:07.170
the other thing that was quite
enabling for understanding

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.150
the human telomere
sequence was understanding

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.200
about telomeres and cancer.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.110
And the same year that we were looking

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.727
at cellular senescence, Titia de Lange

00:34:18.727 --> 00:34:23.727
with Harold Varmus we're
looking in both cancer cells

00:34:24.055 --> 00:34:26.520
at different tissues.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.870
And what's shown here is the fact

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:31.130
that there is tissue specific differences

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.570
in telomere length within people.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.490
So they're looking at telomeres

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.570
that are are quite long in one person,

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.950
comparing the sperm telomere length

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.760
to the blood telomere length.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.920
So these are two different tissues

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.640
and two very different telomere lengths.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.150
Another example here, sperm versus blood,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.810
much longer telomeres in this setting.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.260
And then over here what they found

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:59.210
was that if you compare
normal tissue to tumor tissue,

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.160
that there was significantly
shorter telomeres

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.400
in the tumors.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.590
Again, normal and tumor, so
there were shorter telomeres

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.560
in tumor cells than in normal cells.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.370
And we now can understand
this because that tumor cell

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.960
has gone through more
rounds of cell division

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.253
than otherwise would
have due to some change,

00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:25.060
genetic change that allows it to divide

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.400
and that more rounds of cell division then

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.760
allows this telomere shortening.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.740
So as I had mentioned before,
discoveries happen in batches

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:39.020
so at that very same year,
there was another paper

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.210
which was also published
showing in this case,

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.550
the normal is shown, normal telomeres here

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.460
and tumor telomeres from the same sample.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.800
Normal and tumor, normal and tumor

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.283
so there's a telomere
shortening in cancer cells.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:56.680
So discoveries happen in batches

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.590
and independent replication
is very important

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.940
for verification of fundamental ideas.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.280
So in addition to understanding
the telomere length

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.200
in tumor cells, it was interesting to know

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.940
what is the role of telomerase
activity in tumor cells.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.810
And so we were interested
in the role of telomerase

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.490
and when telomerase may
be present in tumor cells

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.600
and so this particular
paper, telomere shortening

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.530
associated with chromosome instability

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.380
is arrested in immortal cells

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.312
which express telomerase activity

00:36:30.312 --> 00:36:32.830
was the first example of telomerase

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.180
being activated in cancer cells

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.530
but I do wanna have a
little disclaimer here

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.980
that even though I'm an
author on this paper,

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.480
I wanted to just apologize
because one of the things

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.940
when I was doing my PhD
thesis here at Berkeley

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.940
was that my colleague Jasper
Rine told me many times

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.720
that you should not
write cells which express

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.630
but cells that express.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.220
So I just wanna take that as a disclaimer

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.643
and I will never make that mistake again.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.160
So this was a paper that
showed that telomerase

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.363
becomes activated in cancer
cells and then two years later,

00:37:13.213 --> 00:37:14.830
a definitive paper also showing

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:18.070
that in most human cancer cells,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.070
you have telomerase activity
in order for those cells

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.840
to go on and continue dividing.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.900
So this is a getting back
to some of the issues

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.180
that are raised yesterday in the talk

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.860
and that telomerase is required for cells

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.600
that divide many times.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.640
So the fact that you see activation

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.660
of telomerase in cancer cells,

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.660
this one particular cell
undergoes to genetic change

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.160
that has to divide many times

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.610
and this cancer cell has to
solve the telomere problem

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.550
and one of the ways it does that

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.260
is by activating telomerase.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.000
After fundamental discoveries are made

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.370
in a particular field,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.220
it turns out that there's a can be

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.550
a lot of activity in the field.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.013
And so what I've shown you
so far is many of the papers

00:38:03.013 --> 00:38:06.420
throughout the 80s which we're
leading up to establishing

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.540
all of the different components,

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.680
the telomere binding proteins,
the telomere sequence,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.380
the telomerase activity to
understand what might be going on

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.213
with telomeres.

00:38:16.213 --> 00:38:19.370
And so if you look at the
total number of publications

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:22.430
with a word telomerase in it,

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.560
across here there were
a number of publications

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.850
but it looks like it's zero
and then at this point,

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.450
once we have enough enabling discoveries,

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.960
the number of publications
really just skyrocketed

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.165
and people started investigating

00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:38.800
more about different kinds of cancer cells

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.000
and how much telomerase is there

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.080
and what's going on with
the telomere length.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.880
So this is really a common
phenomenon in many fields

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.000
once you reach a critical
mass of understanding

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.450
of the individual components.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.240
So we had understood the telomere sequence

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.430
led to understanding senescence

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.410
and it also led to understanding the role

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.683
of telomeres in cancer.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.760
It was very important though to understand

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.140
the different components
if we were gonna understand

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.710
the role of telomeres in human disease

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.810
to understand those components that are on

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:14.980
the ends of chromosomes.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.250
And the first identification
of the proteins

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.160
that bind to the ends of
chromosomes in human cells

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.810
came from these two papers
from the de Lange lab.

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:27.190
Identifying this protein TRF1

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.620
or telomere repeat binding factor and TRF2

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.620
and you can show in this nice
set of chromosomes over here,

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.550
now, we're looking at the actual proteins

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.930
that are bound to the chromosome ends

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:42.830
that these proteins are
binding to the very ends

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.280
of these human telomeres.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:49.780
And so the identification of TRF1 and TRF2

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.780
then led to the identification
of what we now call

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.160
the shelterin complex.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.010
So TRF1 binds along the
length of the telomeric DNA

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.280
as does TRF2.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.180
So these were the first two
components that were identified

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.030
and we now know of this
complex of proteins

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.040
that's needed to protect
the human chromosome ends

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.450
and also plays a role in elongation

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.100
of the telomeres with telomerase.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.980
So we still, at that
point, although we knew

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.110
many of the different components,

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:23.430
we didn't know what the
makeup of telomerase was.

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.720
We knew it had an RNA component
that provided the template

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.690
but the catalytic component of
telomerase remained elusive.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.520
And it was again the ciliated protozoa

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.930
that came to the rescue.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.830
So Joachim Lingner and Tom
Cech's lab first identified

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.950
the catalytic component of telomerase

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.500
from another ciliate called Euplotes

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.800
and then working together
with Vicky Lundblad

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.610
showed that there was a very similar

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.230
kind of an enzyme in yeast.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.830
And this is just one
figure from their paper

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.370
where they were able to show
that the important catalytic

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.390
regions of this enzyme
that they had identified

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.110
actually was similar to
a reverse transcriptase,

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:11.110
to this example, the HIV RT
suggesting that this telomerase

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.900
reverse transcriptase was
the catalytic component

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.710
of telomerase and this was
quite an important discovery

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.520
because now that the field had their hands

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.890
on an actual molecule, you can then go

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.980
and do experiments to test hypotheses.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.780
And one of the first
experiments that was done

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.040
after the identification
of the TERT enzyme

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.030
and knowing what the human
TERT was was to express

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:42.710
that component inside human cells.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.620
And as I had shown you that if you look

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.500
at these cells that have been grown

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.490
for a long time in culture,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.430
you have relatively short telomeres

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.810
as shown in these four lanes here

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.140
but as soon as you put back the telomerase

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.310
and so you add more telomerase to cells,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.790
what you find is that the
telomeres are elongated

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:03.170
and in this case, this would increase

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.090
the number of cell
divisions that those cells

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.890
would go through and culture

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.760
showing that the telomeres
actually do limit

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.850
the number of times cells
can grow and culture.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.850
And this was quite an enabling
discovery because now,

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.160
in a number of different laboratories

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.010
working in a variety of
different cell types,

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.900
people could grow cells
and be able to study them

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.500
for a longer period of time in culture.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.930
And so today, many different
human primary cells

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:35.360
can be grown for a long term in culture

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.910
if you simply put this
telomerase back into the cells,

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.510
you can now grow those cells with it

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.030
because they're not know longer limited

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.640
by the short telomeres.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.250
So in terms of practical
applications for scientists,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:50.590
this makes it easier to understand

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.890
many different cell types.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.180
So the identification of
the human telomeric sequence

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.060
directly enabled the
understanding of shelterin

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.070
and telomerase allowed the
discovery of the TERT component

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:10.070
which then allowed many
additional discoveries to be made.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.164
So the final question that all,

00:43:12.164 --> 00:43:14.320
I'll just leave you with here.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.550
I won't go through many
of the other discoveries

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.917
but the question of about
what actually happens

00:43:19.917 --> 00:43:21.690
without telomerase?

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.770
And this was the subject
of my talk yesterday

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.520
but this is just an
example of if you have mice

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.630
that lacked telomerase
in the first generation,

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.580
you cross those mice, you
get second-generation mice

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:34.790
that have shorter telomeres,

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.710
you breed those second generation mice,

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.530
you get third-generation
mice with shorter telomeres,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.530
et cetera, for increasing
number of generations

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:45.810
that this progressive
telomere shortening in mice

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:49.623
actually leads to a number
of different complications.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.600
And what happens at the cellular level

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.370
is that with each generation,
the telomeres get shorter

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.930
and those short telomeres then trigger

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.990
either cell death or cell senescence.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:05.253
And this was shown by a
number of different groups.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.350
However, it turns out that
some cells can actually

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.290
escape this cellular senescence

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.560
although most of the time what happens

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.480
is the cells undergo cellular senescence.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.930
The short telomeres also play another role

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.770
and this was also something that was shown

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.390
a number of years before and that is

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:28.340
that they can sometimes
escape and they can undergo

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.580
a recombination pathway

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.130
that allows them to escape senescence.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.560
And so this is just a
figure from this paper

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.230
of Vicky Lundblad and Liz Blackburn

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.940
indicating that there is a bypass pathway

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.530
that if you don't have
elongation by telomerase,

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:48.380
the telomeres can be
elongated by recombination

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.380
and this is harking back
to what was proposed

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.163
about 10 years earlier.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.840
And that is the recombination telomeres.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.980
So the discovery of telomerase led

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.330
to being able to ask the question

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.280
about what are the
consequences of short telomeres

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.320
and remarkably, recombination
is one of those consequences

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.740
and this is something that again,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.940
the process doesn't
necessarily work linearly.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.193
Recombination was proposed
a number of years before.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.430
The cellular senescence

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.530
is one of the consequence of telomeres.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.646
Initiation, the DNA damage response

00:45:24.646 --> 00:45:28.613
and cell death was another consequence.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:34.810
So the overall synthesis of this

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.210
is that defining the molecular components

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.070
together with understanding
the consequences

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.640
of short telomeres allowed the discovery

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.840
of human disease mechanism.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.910
So many of these components
that we've been building up

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:52.770
over the years then led
to the understanding

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.600
of the human genetic disease
dyskeratosis congenita.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.520
So understanding the telomeres RNA

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.180
and understanding the
consequences of short telomeres

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.110
led to knowing that this disease

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:08.490
is actually a disease of short telomeres

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.440
which then several years later made clear

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.230
that there are really a
collection of different effects

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:20.180
of short telomeres often
called the telomere syndrome.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.850
Understanding these consequences puts new

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.670
understanding about
telomere length regulation

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:30.530
and these experiments are
really still the focus

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.720
of many different laboratories today.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.580
So as I was concluding yesterday,

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.557
discovery is not a linear process

00:46:39.557 --> 00:46:43.060
and new discoveries sometimes
come from unlikely places.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.763
Tetrahymena and Oxytricha.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:52.170
So some of the themes that we've
been discussing here today.

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.913
Curiosity is a driver of discovery.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.840
Discoveries happen in batches.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.400
People talk to each other.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.950
And replication is essential
to establish new discoveries.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:06.213
Fields collide and inform each other.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.580
Scientific discovery is
not like engineering.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.320
You have to be ready to change direction

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.303
and follow what's most interesting.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:18.620
And chance favors the prepared mind.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.350
And so with that, I'll just
leave you with one final slide

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.350
and that is where was
telomerase actually discovered?

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.930
Wendell M. Stanley Hall at UC Berkeley.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.537
Many of you may or may not recognize this.

00:47:33.537 --> 00:47:38.470
There's a nice vintage car
sitting outside on the circle.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:43.470
And my final point today is
that you can't go home again.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.060
This is what happened to Stanley Hall.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.130
So here's the remnants
of how it used to look

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:53.750
and now there is a new
beautiful building in its place.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.461
So all, thank you for your attention.

00:47:56.461 --> 00:47:58.540
(attendees applauding)

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.430
- [Attendee] Hi, thank you
very much for your great talks.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:05.080
I read a biography last
year about Henrietta Lacks

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.240
who was the donor for HeLa cells.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.130
Sorry, I'm a chemist, not a biologist

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.420
but it's my understanding that those cells

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.950
were somehow unique in being
able to avoid senescence

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.510
and we're used widely in
molecular biology research

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.410
and until recently

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.400
and I'm wondering if there's
any understanding now

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.610
of were those cells somehow

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:34.630
able to use one of these
mechanisms to avoid senescence.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.030
- Yes, so the HeLa cells are a cell type

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:42.050
that is derived from cancer.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.040
So in the case of Henrietta Lacks,

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.820
her tumors that were put into culture

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.870
and this happened for many
other different cell types

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.350
and as I had shown what happens

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:53.640
is that telomeres do get short

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.880
but then telomerase becomes
activated in cancer cells.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.730
So that's a widely common phenomenon.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.888
In the case of the HeLa cells,

00:49:01.888 --> 00:49:05.770
it happened that they were found
to be very useful by people

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.310
and so they'd been used in a number

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.960
of different laboratories
as our other cell line.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.220
So there weren't anything
unique about those cells

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.040
having activated telomerase
but they were a cell type

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.220
that was a very easy to grow in culture

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.440
because they had been derived from a tumor

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.300
and so they were a very useful resource

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.007
for understanding human cells

00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:32.530
and so they were widely
distributed to many researchers

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:36.250
to understand human biology.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.990
- [Attendee] Thank you
so much for your lecture.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:42.140
My question is you said
the study was done on rats.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:47.140
So the synergist effect of
the cells getting short,

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.160
you talked about that but
how do you make them grow?

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.800
I mean as far as diet and activity,

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.583
how did you make the
cells grow in the rats?

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.440
- Do you mean the tumors or?

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.652
- [Attendee] No, healthy,
we healthy cells, right?

00:50:07.652 --> 00:50:09.430
That are long.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.880
- So the experiment that I
showed where you can take

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.080
normal human cells and normally,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.400
the telomeres are shortening progressively

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.400
and then if you put back
this enzyme telomerase,

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.637
you can make the telomeres be elongated

00:50:22.637 --> 00:50:26.940
and those cells will now grow
for many, many more divisions

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.630
because you no longer
have the short telomeres

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:31.080
that limit the growth of those cells.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.010
So those are normal cells that
now have what we would call

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:39.620
an extended lifespan or
have become immortal.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.650
- [Attendee] Immortal.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:41.483
- Mm-hm.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.080
- [Attendee] I have two
interrelated questions.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.930
Number one, in the cancer cell,

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:48.460
you mentioned telomere
length is shortened.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:51.930
So why does cancer cell
not enter into senescence?

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.320
Why does it keep on dividing?

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.430
And second thing you
mentioned in the cancer cell,

00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.090
telomerase activity is very high.

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:01.620
So why does telomerase does
not make the telomere length

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.520
go back to the normal length?

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.900
- So you you hit on something exactly

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.580
this kind of counterintuitive.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.710
I did tell you that cancer cells

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.100
tend to have shorter telomeres

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.040
and I showed you some evidence
from some historical papers.

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.700
Cancer cells have shorter telomeres

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.424
but cancer cells also
have telomerase activity.

00:51:18.424 --> 00:51:20.370
And so it's that telomerase activity

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:23.000
that maintains the telomere
length in the cancer cells.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.540
So that's why they don't
undergo senescence.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.380
So they started off with long telomeres,

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.510
they went through a number
of rounds of cell divisions

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.100
where the telomeres were shortening

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.100
and then they got telomerase activity by,

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.750
we're not sure exactly what mechanism,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.830
perhaps a mutation.

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:39.310
Now they have to embrace activity

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.630
and now they're maintaining
the telomere length.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.370
Why they don't go back
up to the original level?

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.600
We don't know the answer to that.

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.478
That's a very good question.

00:51:47.478 --> 00:51:49.820
However, we do know that
these are cancer cells

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.450
and so they don't have many of the normal

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:57.170
regulatory mechanisms that
normal cells would have.

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.200
So we have actually done the experiment

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.360
of shortening the telomeres

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.480
in a completely normal organism in mice

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.280
and then when you put telomerase back,

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.730
you do end up going back
to that normal set point

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:12.679
because it's the normal
regulation of those enzymes

00:52:12.679 --> 00:52:15.667
but it doesn't often
happen in the cancer cells

00:52:15.667 --> 00:52:18.380
and that's because there's
probably disrupted cells.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.100
But you're right, it's counterintuitive.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.040
- [Attendee] I have one more question.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.110
What do you think if a cell
has entered in the senescence,

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.680
can that cell can be reverted
back to the active state

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.170
or this cell will remain again
forever for the senescence?

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.160
- That is a good question.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.700
Once this an individual
cell has entered senescence,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.410
it is thought that you cannot
drive it out of senescence

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:43.230
and these are experiments that
we're done before telomerase.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:46.730
If you can put in agents which will cause

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:48.754
the cell to undergo DNA replication.

00:52:48.754 --> 00:52:51.230
In the experiments that I'm showing you

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.320
where you take a culture of cells

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.420
and all of those cells are
heading towards senescence,

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.350
now you put telomerase into the cells,

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:00.800
some of the cells are
still actively dividing.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.650
They haven't yet gotten to
that final senescence point.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.930
And so when you put the telomerase in,

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:07.553
now you rescue those
cells that are dividing

00:53:07.553 --> 00:53:09.200
and the telomeres get long and those cells

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.580
don't enter senescence.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.790
But I did not show you
that if it's actually

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.660
already that one cell is in senescence

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.320
that you can get out of that.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.070
Probably not.

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.630
- [Attendee] Thank you.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.580
- [Attendee] Does the same biology apply

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.130
in the plant kingdom?

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:27.530
And I'm wondering about
some trees that can last,

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:28.840
live for hundreds of years

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.931
and whether it has a similar
relation to telomerase

00:53:32.931 --> 00:53:34.180
or telomeres.

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:37.530
- Yes, one of the things that's
really very nice to study

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.630
something so fundamental
as chromosome ends

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:44.520
is that the mechanisms are
conserved across all organisms.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.129
That is all organisms that
have linear chromosomes.

00:53:47.129 --> 00:53:49.990
And so yes, this this
mechanism does occur in plants.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.670
There are a number of plant studies

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.600
that have been done out there.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.310
The telomerase is known,
the telomere length is known

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.890
but just as in mammalian cells,

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.660
the telomeres don't determine
the maximum lifespan

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.310
of organisms.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.150
That is the maximum
life span of human being

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.200
about 100, 120 years old,

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.910
that is not determined by telomeres

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.350
and we can show that in mice

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.610
and a number of other organisms.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.240
There are probably many different things

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.900
that determine the maximum lifespan.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:21.740
So similarly in plants, the telomeres

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.670
aren't gonna determine
how long that organism

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.730
is gonna live but the
telomeres are carrying out

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.510
the exact same function,
the telomerase is the same

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.403
and these mechanisms are conserved.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.113
- [Attendee] And another thing,

00:54:33.113 --> 00:54:37.490
in the complex which includes TERT,

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:41.120
is there any supposition that
was introduced evolutionarily

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.983
by a retrovirus?

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.183
- I'm not sure what complex
you're talking about.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.833
- [Attendee] The C-E-R-T part of the.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.410
- Oh, the TERT.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:54.243
- [Attendee] TERT.

00:54:54.243 --> 00:54:55.330
- Oh, yes, yes, the telomerase, yes.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.505
- [Attendee] I have dyslexia.

00:54:56.505 --> 00:55:01.130
- So telomerase, the telomerase enzyme

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:05.440
copies RNA that's part
of the enzyme into DNA

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.700
on the ends of the chromosomes.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.170
And so it has hallmarks
of what is now found

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:11.930
also in reverse transcriptases.

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.390
But if you actually look
back evolutionarily,

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.550
they're both related to
enzymes that copied RNA

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:22.310
and so they diverged later on so you may,

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:23.880
there are some supposition that actually,

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.530
the telomerase diverged before,

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:29.450
the reverse transcriptases diverged

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:32.230
but they are related
with the common ancestor.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:33.720
- [Attendee] Thank you for the talk.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.200
In your multiple generations
of your knockout mice,

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.430
I didn't see comparative survival curves

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:45.300
and it appears that you can
have multiple generations

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.300
without telomerase and
still have viable progeny.

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:53.650
- Yes, you can in both in mice,

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.210
for the first three generations

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:58.020
when the telomeres are shortening,

00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.600
in the absence of telomerase,

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.480
there was no consequence
of the telomere shortening

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.610
as long as your telomeres are long.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.660
Once the telomeres get to
be shorter, in our case,

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:10.720
in the third, fourth, fifth
generations as their shortening,

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.520
the short telomeres themselves

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.861
then trigger apoptosis or
senescence which causes diseases.

00:56:15.861 --> 00:56:18.070
So you can live without telomerase

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.710
as long as your telomeres
are long but then,

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:21.940
once the telomeres get short
and the same thing is found

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.150
in human families that don't
have enough telomerase.

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:26.300
In the early generations,
there's no consequence

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.306
and it's not until the later generations.

00:56:28.306 --> 00:56:29.600
- [Attendee] Thanks.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.830
- [Attendee] Thank you for your talk.

00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:32.340
Yesterday, you had mentioned

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.100
that there is no clinical
research or evidence

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.800
that shows products that
are currently out there

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.592
being marketed to help lengthen telomeres.

00:56:40.592 --> 00:56:42.240
So can you address whether,

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.920
I'm assuming that there is
research currently going on

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.320
to try to find either plant
or botanicals or something

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.610
that will help to lengthen telomeres.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:55.620
And I understand that there
may not be clinical research

00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:59.720
study data but that there's
many hundreds of thousands

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.720
of anecdotal data about things like

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:06.203
traditional Chinese medicinal
herbs that can help to,

00:57:07.619 --> 00:57:12.619
you know, help bone marrow
or make gray hair black again

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.070
like He Shou Wu.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:16.563
So can you address that?

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:21.995
- I'm not an expert in any
of those sorts of medicines.

00:57:21.995 --> 00:57:26.349
I certainly know that
there is a lot of interest

00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:29.610
in both sides of looking at telomeres

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:33.200
in finding ways to lengthen telomeres

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.530
in the setting of bone marrow failure

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:38.160
and pulmonary fibrosis, that
if we had some mechanism

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.920
whereby you could lengthen the
telomeres and maintain them,

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.010
that would be really an
outstanding treatment

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:46.171
from people that are
dying from these diseases.

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.970
So there's a lot of
interest in looking at that

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:50.800
and there has also been on the other side

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.750
some interest in looking
at telomerase inhibitors

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:55.780
as approaches to cancer.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.600
But now that we know a little bit more

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.900
about the normal consequences
of having less telomerase,

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.700
we need to just step back
and think a little bit

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.530
about how long you would
want to inhibit telomerase

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:08.430
before you may have other effects.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:11.490
So one needs to have a little
bit more of a nuanced approach

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.770
but these are definitely areas

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.999
that people are actively
trying to understand

00:58:16.999 --> 00:58:20.060
as we understand the disease,

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.900
understanding treatments for the disease.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.820
My colleagues at Hopkins
see patients every day

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.210
that are dying from these diseases

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:29.580
and there's no treatment
so we were very interested

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.230
in pursuing that.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.193
Thank you.

00:58:32.193 --> 00:58:34.656
(attendees applauding)

00:58:34.656 --> 00:58:37.239
(lively music)
