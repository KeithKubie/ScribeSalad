00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.420
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.590
In our last few lectures we were
trying to establish the

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.810
identity of integral calculus
and differential calculus in

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.730
their own right, independently
of one another, and then by

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.230
the fundamental theorems of
integral calculus to show the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.300
amazing relationship between
these two subjects.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.680
Now what we would like to do
today is to emphasize this

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.330
topic in terms of an application
unlike what we've

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.600
been doing before.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.220
In particular, what we will do
today is discuss the question

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.140
of finding volumes.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.550
And in doing this, several
interesting things should

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.310
happen, not the least of which
is that we will rederive

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.140
certain results that we've been
taking for granted about

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.180
solid regions--

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.060
volumes of regions--
for quite awhile.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.380
And also, it will give us an
excellent chance to understand

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640
what we really mean by a
mathematical structure.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.330
Well, at any rate, to emphasize
the structure part,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.690
I've called today's lesson,
'3-dimensional Area'.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.400
See, instead of calling
it volume, I call it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.580
3-dimensional area, and the
reason for this is I'd like to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.860
show you how one can study
volumes in a completely

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.800
analogous way to how
we studied areas.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.480
Remember, we had three basic
assumptions for area.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.960
I'm now going to assume three
similar assumptions for volume

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.930
except where I have to amend
them by necessity.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.630
And the only place this
amendment has to take place is

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.450
whereas the rectangle was the
basic building block of areas,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.530
the so-called cylinder
will be the basic

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.130
building block of volumes.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.605
Let me take a moment to digress
here and explain to

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.740
you mathematically what the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.390
mathematician calls a cylinder.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.160
We start with any closed curve,
say, in a plane, and we

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.670
then take a line perpendicular
to that plane.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.320
And with that line we trace
along the curve.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.660
And we then take another plane
parallel to the plane that the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.030
curve is in and slice this
thing off someplace.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.260
In other words, by definition, a
cylinder has congruent cross

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.250
sections all the way through.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.930
And what we're saying is that--
in fact, the familiar

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.130
form of a cylinder is the
one where the cross

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.260
section is a circle.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.390
That's called the right
circular cylinder.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.120
Remember, the volume of a right
circular cylinder is 'pi

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.230
r squared h', the area
of the cross

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.860
section times the height.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.760
Well, that's the generalization
that we make.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.270
In other words, our first
assumption is that for any

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.080
cylinder the volume of
the cylinder is the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.730
cross-sectional area
times the height.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.500
Or you could call it the area of
the base times the height,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.870
since the cross-sectional area
is the same for all slices.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.180
OK?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.480
The next assumption says, if we
think of volume as meaning

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.960
the amount of space only in
three dimensions, whereas area

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.650
means the amount of space in
two dimensions, our next

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.700
assumption is that if the three
dimensional region 'R'

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.860
is contained in the three
dimensional region 'S', then

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.270
the volume of 'R' is less than
or equal to the volume of 'S'.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.460
And finally, we assume an
analogous result about the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.470
area of the whole equals the sum
of the areas of the parts.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.310
We assume that if a region is
made up of the union of 'n'

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.640
regions which do not overlap--

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.460
notice the union
notation here.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.010
The union of 'R sub 1' up to 'R
sub n' and if the 'R's do

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.730
not overlap, then the volume of
the region 'R' is the sum

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.860
of the volumes of the
constituent parts.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.360
In other words, notice that
except for the fact that

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.910
cylinder replaces rectangle, the
basic axioms for studying

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.030
volume are precisely the
same as the axioms

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.270
for studying area.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.370
In particular, then, what this
means is that structurally the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.510
same results that we were able
to show for area should follow

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.810
word for word, essentially,
for volumes.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.360
And I thought what we would
do is start with a rather

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.870
familiar example.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.780
You may recall--

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.030
of course, we've used this
result many times--

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.110
that the volume of a cylinder
is given by 1/3--

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.810
that the volume of a cone is
'1/3 pi r squared h' where 'r'

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.080
is the radius of the base
and 'h' is the height.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.800
And you may remember that
in solid geometry as a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.780
traditional high school
curriculum went, these results

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.890
were given but seldom
if ever proved.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.040
So what I thought we would do
now is see how we can use

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.950
these axioms to arrive at these
results, and to get the

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.750
spirit of what we've been trying
to do, I will do this

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.800
by integral calculus at least
first and then by differential

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.150
calculus later.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.960
But the idea is something
like this.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.610
To visualize the cone, the
radius of whose base is 'r'

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.600
and whose height is 'h', we can
think of the straight line

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.420
that joins the origin to the
point (r, h), this region

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.370
here, this right triangle.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.410
And we can think of that as
being revolved about the

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.280
x-axis to give the cone.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.910
Now when we were dealing with
areas, you may recall that we

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.060
broke things down into
rectangles that were too big,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.460
rectangles that were too small,
and we computed, say,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.000
'U sub n' and 'L sub
n', et cetera.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.460
We can do the same thing now.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.710
What we do is we again
circumscribe rectangles.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.230
Now the idea is whatever volume
is traced out by this

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.960
piece here, whatever volume is
traced out when we rotate this

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.280
triangle about the x-axis, that
volume will be less than

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.670
the volume generated by this
particular rectangle, because,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.430
you see, the volume that we're
looking for is contained

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.270
inside the rectangle when we
revolve this particular thing.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.070
Now notice that this particular
rectangle when

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.290
revolved gives me a right
circular cylinder, and we're

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.750
assuming that we know how to
find the volume of a cylinder.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.760
It's the cross sectional
area times the height.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.160
Let's focus our attention on
what I call the k-th region

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.670
here and see what this
thing looks like.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.480
First of all, notice that if
we've divided this length,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.880
which is 'h' units long into 'n'
equal parts, each of these

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.430
pieces is 'h' over 'n'.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.460
Secondly, notice that the radius
of the base of the

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.930
cylinder that we're going to
get-- well, let's see.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.290
It's going to be this
y-coordinate.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.300
Given the x-coordinate, 'y' is
determined by multiplying the

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.160
x-coordinate by 'r/h'.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.300
The x-coordinate is
'kh' over 'n'.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.770
I multiply that by 'r/h'.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.530
That gives me 'kr' over 'n'.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.640
That's the height of this--

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.900
the radius of the base
of the cylinder that

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.310
we're going to revolve.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.390
Now what is the volume
of this cylinder?

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.600
The area of the base is 'pi y
squared', and I'm now going to

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.040
multiply that by the height,
which is 'h/n'.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.830
And if I do that,
I obtain what?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:50.310
The volume of this particular
cylinder is 'pi r squared h'

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.450
times 'k squared'
over 'n cubed'.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.200
And now, if I add up all of
these volumes as 'k' goes from

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.040
1 to 'n', that will give me a
bunch of stacked cylinders

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.240
which enclose my cone.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.520
In other words, an answer
that will be too

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.210
large will be what?

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.610
This sum as 'k' goes from 1 to
'n', notice that this is the

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.510
only portion that depends
on 'k', so the upper

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.310
approximation--

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.390
in other words, the volume
that's too large to be the

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.410
right answer--

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.180
is 'pi r squared h' over 'n
cubed' times the sum as 'k'

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.270
goes from 1 to 'n',
'k squared''.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.000
Now you notice I always stick
to problems where we have

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.530
something fairly simple like
this, because this limit

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.340
process, as we've mentioned in
the previous lectures, becomes

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.970
very, very difficult to do in
general, the beauty or one of

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.990
the beauties of our fundamental
theorem.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.870
But the idea is I do know that
this sum is 'n' times 'n + 1'

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.370
times '2n + 1' over 6.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.730
Now distributing the 'n cubed'
one factor at a time, the way

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.970
we have before, I can now write
that this is '1/6 pi r

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.260
squared h'.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.000
'n + 1' over 'n'
is '1 + '1/n''.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.840
'2n + 1' over 'n'
is '2 + '1/n''.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.000
And I find that my upper
approximation is given by this

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.250
expression.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.860
And if I now take the limit of
'U sub n' as 'n' goes to

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.500
infinity, this factor
approaches 1.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.370
This factor approaches 2.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.940
Therefore, our entire product
approaches in the limit '1/3

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.740
pi r squared h', which
is the familiar

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.640
result of solid geometry.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.000
Of course, we've taken a lot
for granted over here.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.040
What we've really proven here
is not that the volume of a

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.860
cone is '1/3 pi r squared h'.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.340
What we have proven is at the
limit of 'U sub n' as 'n'

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.820
approaches infinity, it's
'1/3 pi r squared h'.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.840
The question that comes up is
how do you know that as these

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.960
divisions get small
that the volume--

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.980
the upper approximation gets
arbitrarily close to the

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.100
correct answer.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.640
And again, notice how we can
reason analogously to what we

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.040
did in the case of area.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.820
Namely, what we could do next,
you see, is take the smallest

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.310
cylinder that can be
inscribed here.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.090
In other words, this would give
us an approximation which

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.960
is too small.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.650
The total error is no more than
the solid generated by

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.440
this hatch region revolving
about the x-axis.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:39.220
Notice, however, that each of
these pieces fits very nicely

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.740
in here, so that the total error
between an approximation

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.110
which is too big and an
approximation which is too

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.430
small is this height,
which is 'r'.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.590
OK?

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.540
Let's see, the cross-sectional
area-- this is 'r'.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.210
So 'pi r squared' is the
area of the base.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.370
The height is 'h/n'.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.430
Notice that 'r' and 'h' are
given constants, therefore, as

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:09.200
'n' goes to infinity, the
numerator stays constant.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.650
The denominator goes
to infinity.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.670
The difference goes to 0.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.490
In other words, again, we can
show that 'U sub n' and 'L sub

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.160
n' have a common limit.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.770
In fact, we can generalize this
result rather nicely.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.660
Take this drawing to be whatever
you'd like it to be.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.780
I've simply tried to visualize
here a solid region.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.390
This is a 3-dimensional
region.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.870
It has various cross sections.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.980
And I know that as I look at it
in the 'x' direction, the

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.510
region begins at 'x' equals
'a' and terminates at 'x'

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.520
equals 'b'.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.420
And the question is how can
I find the volume of this

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.060
particular region, assuming I
know the cross-sectional area

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.420
for any slice?

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.770
And the idea, again, is what?

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.600
We can slice this solid up into
'n' parts, which I call

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.410
'delta V1' up to 'delta Vn'.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.480
The sum of these would be
the true volume that

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.020
we're looking for.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:17.550
Now, I focus my attention on
the k-th piece here, and

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.210
again, what I do is I inscribe
and circumscribe cylinders,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.800
one of which is contained
entirely within 'delta V sub

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.680
k', and the other of which
surrounds 'delta V sub k'.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.150
In other words, what I do is is
I find the biggest possible

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.840
cross-sectional area I have in
this interval, and I denote

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.840
the 'x' value at which that
occurs by 'M sub k'.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.190
I find the value of 'x', which
I call 'm sub k', at which I

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.970
get the smallest cross-sectional
area.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.160
And therefore, the inscribed
cylinder has

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.090
volume given by this.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.300
The circumscribed cylinder has
volume given by this, and the

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.690
piece that I'm looking for,
the true volume, is caught

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.220
between these two.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.300
Therefore, if I add these up
as 'k' goes from 1 to 'n',

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.770
I've caught 'V' between 'U
sub n' and 'L sub n'.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.170
Assuming only that the area is
a continuous function, the

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.120
difference between the largest
cross section and the smallest

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.670
cross section approaches 0 as
'delta x sub k' approaches 0.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.690
In essence then, the same as
we did before, what we can

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.900
show is that as 'n' goes to
infinity, both 'U sub n' and

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:40.840
'L sub n' approach a common
limit, and therefore, the 'V'

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.870
being caught between these two
is equal to the common limit.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.390
Now here's the interesting
point.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.530
When we talked about the
definite integral, no one

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.250
asked physically what the
function 'f' was or what the

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.010
'c sub k's that we're using here
were, only that they be

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.170
in the proper interval and 'f'
be a continuous function.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.430
Notice that we're assuming
that 'A' is continuous.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.320
In essence then, by the
definition of the definite

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.900
integral, that volume
is just what?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.970
The definite integral from 'a'
to 'b', 'f of x' 'dx'.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:17.700
In other words, it's this sum
taken in the limit as 'n'

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.590
approaches infinity, or another
way of saying that, as

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.400
the maximum 'delta X sub
k' approaches 0.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.800
That, by the way, is the
integral calculus approach.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.580
If we want the differential
calculus approach, remember

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.610
what we do, we say look it.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.610
The change in volume is less
than or equal to the maximum

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.150
cross-sectional area times
'delta X' and greater than or

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.890
equal to the minimum
cross-sectional area

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.420
times 'delta X'.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.820
Same as we did for area,
you see, we divide

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.700
through by 'delta X'.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.830
We have that 'delta V' divided
by 'delta X' is caught between

00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:02.970
'A of M', 'A of m', where 'm'
and 'M' are in this interval.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.370
And now you see as 'delta X'
approaches 0, 'm' and 'M' both

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.370
approach 'x'.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.860
You see the same procedure
as we had before.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.780
You see what we're saying going
back to this diagram is,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:22.040
for example, here is a 'delta
X', and 'm' and 'M' are points

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.280
in here, and as 'delta X' goes
to 0, 'm' and 'M' both

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.630
approach the end point 'x'.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.170
And since 'A' is assumed to be
continuous, if 'M' and 'm'

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.710
approach 'x', 'A of M', 'A of
m' approach 'A of x', and we

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.980
arrive at, by differential
calculus, that 'dV dx' is 'A

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.600
of x', and therefore, 'V' is
again equal to integral ''A of

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.500
x' 'dx'' as 'x' goes
from 'a' to 'b'.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.610
Where now by differential
calculus, this means what?

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:05.890
It simply means 'G of b' minus
'G of a', where 'G' is any

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.000
function whose derivative
is 'f'.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.580
Now again, I have to go through
this thing rather

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.550
hurriedly because I want to
get some examples done.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.530
But what I hope is that we went
slowly enough so that you

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.460
can again sense how we're
using integral calculus,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.910
differential calculus, and the
relationship between them.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.220
Let's, at any rate, illustrate
some of these results more

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.610
concretely in terms of--

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:36.160
well, first of all, let's talk
about one particular type of

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.920
solid, what's called a
solid of revolution.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.970
That's the particular type of
solid where you have a region

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.130
in the 'xy' plane, and you take
that region and rotate it

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:51.580
either around the x-axis or the
y-axis, thus generating a

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.240
3-dimensional region.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.710
See, in other words, a plane
area is rotated through 360

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.500
degrees either with respect to
the x-axis or the y-axis.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.950
I'll consider the x-axis here.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.880
Notice that this is a special
case of what we've just

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.339
studied, namely, in this
particular case, if 'y' equals

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.710
'f of x' is a continuous
function, notice that every

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.910
cross section here, every cross

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.240
section will be a circle.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.670
The area of the circle
is 'pi y squared'.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.920
That's 'pi 'f of x' squared'.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.180
And therefore, according to our
fundamental theorem, since

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.770
the area is continuous--

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.380
and why is the area
continuous?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.280
Well, if 'f' is continuous,
remember the product of

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.190
continuous functions
is continuous.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.170
If 'f' is continuous, 'f
squared' is continuous.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.330
So according to our result, the
volume of the region 'R'

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.010
is just the integral from
'a' to 'b', 'pi 'f

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.660
of x' squared' 'dx'.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.960
And you see, using differential
calculus, all we

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.520
need now is a function whose
derivative is 'pi 'f of x'

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.890
squared', and we call
that function 'G'.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.770
We compute 'G of b' minus 'G
of a' and that gives us the

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.120
volume that we're looking for.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.830
Remember, when we talked about
areas, we mentioned this was

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.020
highly specialized.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.550
What if you had a region
like this?

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.540
And again, sparing the details,
observe that if we

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.290
have a region like this, we can
draw in the lines where

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.130
the curve doubles back.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:21.010
We can now visualize this
as the volume--

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.630
the difference of two volumes.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.970
Namely, we can find this volume
and subtract from that

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.440
volume this volume.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.590
See, in other words, both of
these have the right form.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.430
And by this difference,
what's left?

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.170
The difference of the big volume
minus the small volume

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.070
is the volume generated
by 'R'.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.750
And as I say, these are rather
simple details that we can

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.640
check out computationally in
terms of exercises, but the

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.990
reason I wanted to mention the
solid of revolution is that

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.110
not only is this a rather common
and important category,

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.250
but it also happens to be the
type of solid that we opened

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.450
our program with.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.700
Remember, the cone may
be viewed as what?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.330
The solid generated by a
particular right triangle

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.110
being revolved about
the x-axis.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.860
In fact, I thought we could
try that same problem now

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.350
doing it by the antiderivative
method.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.030
Namely, we take this particular
region 'R' and

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.980
notice now, if we revolve
this about the x-axis--

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.080
let's see, the cross-sectional
area will be what?

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.470
Well, it's a circle
of radius 'y'.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.430
For a given value of 'x',
'y' is equal to 'r'

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.040
times 'x' over 'h'.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.080
See the slope of this
line is 'r/h'.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.920
It passes through
the origin here.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.860
So the cross-sectional area
is 'y squared' times pi.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.950
That's 'pi 'r squared h'
squared' over 'h squared'

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.720
times 'x squared'.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.080
And to find that volume,
I simply integrate this

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.190
between 0 and 'h'.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.600
Recalling that pi, 'r', and 'h'
are constants, I can take

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.900
the constants outside of
the integral sign.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.140
The integral of 'x squared',
meaning what?

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.070
The inverse derivative
is '1/3 x cubed'.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:14.590
If I evaluate that between 0 and
'h', I get '1/3 h cubed'.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.820
The 'h cubed' in the numerator
cancels the 'h squared' in the

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.000
denominator, leaving a factor of
'h' in the numerator, and I

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
wind up, as I saw before, that
the volume of this cone is

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.380
'1/3 pi r squared h'.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.840
And this is nice that I get
the same answer as by the

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.300
limit method, because according
to the fundamental

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.280
theorem, the first fundamental
theorem, this is precisely

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.560
what was supposed to happen.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.890
In other words, I can do these
either by limits or by

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.680
derivatives.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.430
I want you to see these things
side by side, because in

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.120
certain cases, as I've
emphasized in the previous

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.140
lectures, there will be times
when we cannot, by

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.000
differential calculus, find a
function 'G' whose derivative

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.350
is equal to a given
function 'f of x'.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.940
But enough about that
for the time being.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.620
The next question that comes up
gives us a review of what

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.140
happens with inverse
functions.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.690
It's a rather interesting
type of situation.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.060
It's called the method of
cylindrical shells and it's

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.930
motivated by the following.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.210
Let's suppose again we're given
a very nice region 'R'.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.550
What do I mean by very nice?

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.080
Well, to simplify the
computation, even though it

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.670
doesn't change the theory at
all, I'm assuming that 'y'

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.730
equals 'f of x' is an
increasing curve.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.190
In other words, I'm even
assuming that we have a

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.200
one-to-one function here.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.220
Now the idea is here's this
nice region and instead of

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.950
revolving this about the
x-axis, I would like to

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.880
revolve it about the y-axis.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.000
Now you see, to use the method
of revolution here, to revolve

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.470
this about the y-axis,
essentially what I do is I

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:55.060
pick a washer-shaped
region, you see?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.265
I have to compute the volume
generated by the 'y' part.

00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:01.810
See, in other words, I do this
as two separate parts.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:06.740
I find the volume of the big
piece minus the volume of the

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.330
small piece, and what's
left is the volume

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.680
generated by 'R'.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.970
But notice a rather difficult
computational

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.510
thing occurs here.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.160
Namely, notice that this
length here has to be

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.010
expressed as 'x' goes from one
value to another value.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.510
Now, you see, if this is 'b',
and this is 'a', you see,

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.170
notice what's happening
here, how our

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:32.770
strips are being chosen.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.360
You see, for a given strip, the
final 'x' value is 'b',

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.590
but what is the initial
'x' value?

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.840
See, down here the 'x'
value is 'a', but

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.260
what happens up here?

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.670
In other words, how do you find
what the 'x' value is for

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.160
a given value of 'y' here?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:52.660
Well, you see what you must do
is invert the relationship.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.040
Now even though I've
picked a case

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.610
where the inverse exists--

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.570
see, this is a one-to-one
function--

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.910
we've already had ample examples
in which we've shown

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.040
that computationally it's
extremely difficult if it's

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:10.010
even possible to explicitly
perform the inversion.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.860
And this is where the method
of cylindrical

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.290
shells comes from.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.230
Essentially what the method of
cylindrical shells says is

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.080
wouldn't it have been nice if
we chose our generating

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.920
element to be this way?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.750
In other words, what we say
is look at this piece

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.240
of area over here.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.980
One way of visualizing this
solid being rotated is to

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.390
think of this particular region
being rotated about the

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.990
x-axis, and it generates
a certain volume.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.610
By the way, what volume
will it generate?

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.090
The volume that it will generate
will be less than the

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.310
volume that this rectangle
generates but greater than the

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.660
volume that this rectangle
here generates.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.800
Now what is the volume
generated

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.410
by the large rectangle?

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.160
And, by the way, notice that I
mean by the volume generated

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.570
by the rectangle think of this
as being a slab of a certain

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.530
amount of material and I
rotate that slab around

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.080
through 360 degrees.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.420
The volume I'm thinking of is
the volume of the material in

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.930
that slab, not the material
that's enclosed.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.490
It would be like, if
you're thinking in

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.910
terms of a tin can.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.150
I'm not thinking of the volume
enclosed by the tin can.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.850
I'm thinking of the volume
of the tin itself that

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:24.930
makes up the can.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.410
Well, you see again, to go
through this thing as rapidly

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.010
as possible but still hitting
the main points, you see,

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.920
notice that the volume that I'm
looking for, what is the

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.050
volume that's cut out by
this big rectangle?

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:44.240
Well, notice that the area of
the base from-- if I look at

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:51.170
this as being this cylinder
minus this cylinder, the

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.560
volume of the big cylinder is
pi times ''x + delta X'

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.560
squared' times the height
here, which is 'f

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.090
of 'x + delta X'.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.300
And the volume of the
hollow part from

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.090
here to here is what?

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.780
It's 'pi x squared'--

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.420
that's the radius
of the base--

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.850
times the height, which is still
'f of 'x + delta X''.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:19.550
In other words, 'delta V' is
bounded above by this volume.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.150
In other words, as messy as this
looks, that's only what?

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.610
That's the volume of the region

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.370
generated by this big rectangle.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.970
If we take the smallest
rectangle, namely the one

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.660
that's inscribed inside this
region, we get the same

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.230
results, except that the height
is now replaced by 'f

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:42.300
of x' rather than by 'f
of 'x + delta X''.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.670
In other words, we catch
'delta V' between two

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.820
expressions involving 'x'.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.210
By the way, notice how the
bracketed expression

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.370
simplifies the 'pi x squared'
here cancels with the 'pi x

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.700
squared' here leaving inside the
parentheses just '2x delta

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.130
X' plus 'delta X squared'.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.900
In other words, simplifying
this thing, I can now show

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.910
that 'delta V' is caught between
these two expressions

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.520
now, this expression here, which
is too big, and this

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.490
expression here, which
is too small.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.470
Now I divide by 'delta X'.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.470
The usual procedure to find
'dV dx', it's 'delta V'

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.960
divided by 'delta X'.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.140
Then I will take the limit as
'delta X' approaches 0.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.240
You see, so I divide through
by 'delta X'.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.040
We're assuming, of course,
that 'delta X' is not 0.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.660
That's what the limit means
as 'delta X' approaches 0.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.330
You see, it's not zero, but it
gets arbitrarily close to 0.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.680
Notice then that my 'delta V'
divided by 'delta X' is caught

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:51.190
between pi times '2x + delta X'
times 'f of 'x + delta X'',

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:56.480
and pi times '2x + delta
X' times 'f of x'.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.350
And I now let 'delta
X' approach 0.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.580
And here's the key point.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.470
As 'delta X' approaches 0,
notice that the left hand side

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:09.540
becomes '2 pi x'
times 'f of x'.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.140
Notice also what happens
to the right hand side.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.200
This factor, as 'delta X'
approaches 0, becomes '2x'.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:22.220
And because 'f' is continuous,
as 'delta X' approaches 0, 'f

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.370
of 'x + delta X'' approaches
'f of x'.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.510
In other words, then, in the
limit, as 'delta X' approaches

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:36.560
0, I have that 'dV dx' on the
one hand can't be any greater

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.780
than '2 pi x' times 'f of x'.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.640
On the other hand, it can't
be any less than '2 pi

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.410
x' times 'f of x'.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.770
Consequently, it must equal
'2 pi x' times 'f of x'.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.600
Therefore, if this is 'dV dx',
then 'V' itself is the

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.830
integral of this thing evaluated
between 'a' and 'b',

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.620
because that's where we're
adding these things up from.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.550
In other words, if we're using
differential calculus, this is

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:10.230
'G of b' minus 'G of a' where
'G prime' equals 'f'.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.090
If we're using integral
calculus, we've found the 'U

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:17.510
sub n' and 'L sub n' and we've
caught 'V' between 'U sub n'

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.220
and 'L sub n'.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.180
But, in any event, what we've
shown rigorously now is that

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.500
by the cylindrical shell
method-- and we'll illustrate

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.900
these with examples to finish
off today's lesson--

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.500
that the volume is given
by integral from 'a'

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.830
to 'b' '2 pi x'--

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.120
and let me just replace
'f of x' by 'y' to

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.900
make my diagram simpler--

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.470
times 'dx'.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.940
And if you want to think of
this in what I call the

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.690
traditional engineering point
of view where you think of a

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.600
thin rectangle generating a
volume, what we're saying is

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.760
if you think of a little thin
piece like this being revolved

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.760
to generate, say, some material
in a tin can, notice

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.310
that the amount of material
in here will be what?

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:06.030
Well, when you unroll
this thing--

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.350
see, this thing sort
of like this.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.600
When you unroll this thing,
the radius is 'x', so the

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.300
circumference when you unroll
it will be '2 pi x'.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.870
The height is 'y'.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.940
So the cross-sectional area
is '2 pi x y' and the

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.860
thickness is 'dx'.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.550
So if I multiply that by dx,
that gives me the volume

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.990
generated by this piece.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.270
And then in the proud tradition
of the sigma

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.780
notation, which I'll come back
to in the next lecture to show

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.700
how dangerous this really
is, but the

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.120
shortcut method is what?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.480
Add up all of these
contributions as 'x' goes from

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.370
'a' to 'b'.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.950
At any rate, that's called the
method of cylindrical shells.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.230
Essentially, one uses
cylindrical shells when we

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.000
think of a generating element
being parallel

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.700
to the axis of rotation.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.790
We use revolution, when
it's perpendicular

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.220
to the axis of rotation.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.530
Which of the two is easier
depends on the particular

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.830
computational technique
necessitated by the

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.930
relationship between the
variables in the problem.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.050
Well, at any rate, let's do
a couple of examples.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.340
The first example I'd like to do
is to take that same region

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.680
'R', namely, the right
triangle whose

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.000
legs are 'r' and 'h'.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.150
We've already solved this
problem of finding the volume

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:30.620
when we rotate this
about the x-axis.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.830
What I'd now like to do is see
what volume is generated by

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.990
this as I rotate it
about the y-axis.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.320
And again, I find that I can
do this problem in several

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.580
ways, but I thought it was an
easy enough problem to do by

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.660
cylindrical shells, because, as
we so often do, I thought

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.240
the first problem that we do by
cylindrical shells should

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.650
be one that we can check
by another method.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.260
But at any rate, using
cylindrical shells, let's see

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.330
what happens over here.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.530
The volume is what?

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:05.020
It's the integral from 0 to
'h', '2 pi x' times this

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.160
height, which is 'rx'
over 'h' integrated

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.790
with respect to 'x'.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.900
That's just '2 pi r' over
'h'-- we can take that

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.880
outside, because that's
a constant factor--

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.980
integral 'x squared dx'.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.930
The integral of 'x squared'
is '1/3 x cubed'.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.540
We evaluate that between
0 and 'h'.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.690
That gives us '1/3 h cubed'.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.760
We cancel the 'h' in the
denominator with one of the

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.740
'h's in the numerator, and we
find that the volume that's

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:37.220
generated is '2/3 pi r h
squared', not 'r squared h',

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.735
'r h squared', not 1/3, 2/3.

00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:43.910
Remember, by the way, what
this thing looks like.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.290
I think you can visualize
this.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.700
This is a cylinder with
a cone cut out of it.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.190
See, in other words, if this
thing had been solid, we'd

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.340
have called it a right circular
cylinder, and then

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.320
what's missing is the cone
shaped region over here.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.530
In fact, that's how
we can check this.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.090
See, what would the
volume be that's

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.300
generated by this rectangle?

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.990
This would be a cylinder the
radius of whose base is 'h',

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.540
whose height is 'r', and the
volume of that cylinder is 'pi

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.230
h squared r'.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.260
The cone that's missing, the
cone that was cut out of this

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.920
thing, has the radius of a space
equal to 'h' and its

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.510
height equal to 'r', so
its volume is '1/3

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.090
pi h squared r'.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:31.420
And, therefore, the volume
that's left when we subtract

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.210
this off is '2/3 pi h
squared r', which

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.640
does check with this.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.630
By the way, just as an aside,
notice that the region 'R'

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.020
generates a different volume
if we rotate it about the

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.620
y-axis than it did if we rotate
it about the x-axis.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.980
Numerically, what we're saying
is that we just found that the

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.230
volume when rotated around
the y-axis is '2/3

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:58.940
pi h squared r'.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.790
We know that when we revolve
that about the x-axis, it's

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.470
'1/3 pi r squared h',
and these two

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.580
expressions are not identical.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.320
In fact, if we divide both sides
by 'pi r h' over 3, we

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.830
find that equality holds only
if we have that highly

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.540
specialized case that '2h'
equals 'r', which is not

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.710
really important.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.550
I just threw that
in as an aside.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.830
But I do want you to notice that
the same area, of course,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:29.050
generates different volumes
depending on what you rotate

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:30.650
it with respect to.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:33.270
Well, at any rate, at least
this was a problem that we

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.600
could check by another method.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.350
Let me just use cylindrical
shells for a problem which is

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.130
slightly tougher but one that
can still be checked by

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.420
another method.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.330
Let's take the following
region.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.620
Let's take the curve 'y'
equals '2x - x squared'

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.340
between 'x' equals 0
and 'x' equals 2.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.250
Leaving the details as a rather
trivial exercise, it is

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:59.710
not difficult to see that this
is the parabola that peaks at

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:06.270
1, 1 and crosses the x-axis at
'x' equals 0 and 'x' equals 2.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.310
If I now want to compute this
volume as I rotate the region

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.120
'R' about the y-axis--

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.469
see, I'm going to rotate
this about the y-axis.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.320
I want to find out what volume
is generated by this region

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.699
'R' in this case.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:25.530
Remember I can use either
cylindrical shells or I can

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.780
use revolution here.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.270
Notice the problem I'm
going to be in.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.159
Notice that this particular
function is single valued but

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.239
not one-to-one.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.830
When I try to find these two
'x' values I'm going to run

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.060
into multi-values.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.489
I'm going to have to invert.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:44.770
All sorts of computational
skills are going to

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.000
come into play here.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.060
On the other hand, if I take my
generating element parallel

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.510
to the y-axis, I have a very
simple expression for this,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.960
and now that indicates what?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.320
By the method of cylindrical
shells, this will be the

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.210
integral from 0 to 2.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.930
The generating arm is 'x', so
that cuts out '2 pi x'.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.470
The height is 'y', which
is '2x - x squared'.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.850
The thickness is 'dx'.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.240
In other words, mechanically
I must evaluate

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.230
this particular integral.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.000
OK?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.580
At any rate, it's factoring
out the 2 pi and just

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.090
observing that the
integral of '2 x

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.040
squared' is '2/3 x cubed'.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.340
The integral of 'x'
to the fourth is

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.070
'1/4 'x to the 4th''.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:32.190
Evaluating that between
0 and 2, I get 2 pi

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.490
times 16/3 minus 4.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.300
The lower limit is 0 here.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.330
This just comes out to be 16
minus 12, 4/3 times 2 pi.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.530
That's 8 pi over 3.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:48.150
By the way, before I go any
further with this, let's make

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.350
the interesting observation.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:53.480
See, 8 pi over 3 is the volume
generated by this whole thing

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.140
being revolved about
the y-axis.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.340
If I'd drawn in this line, which
is a line of symmetry,

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.980
notice that these two
areas are congruent.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.780
These two regions
are congruent.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.710
However, it's also interesting
to observe that the volume

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.700
generated by this piece as you
revolve it about the y-axis is

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.390
not twice the volume generated
by this piece.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.190
See, notice that the integral
from 0 to 1-- in other words,

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.940
if we just took this region
here, integrated this from 0

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:32.880
to 1, we would get 5/6, 2/3
minus 1/4 times 2 pi, 5/6.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.920
And if we double that,
we would get 5/3.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.450
In other words, this
area is 5/6.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:44.470
Double it would be
5 pi over 6.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:48.880
Double it would be 5 pi over 3,
and 5 pi over 3 is not the

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.330
same as 8 pi over 3.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.060
The thing to keep in mind here
is notice how the distance

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.070
comes in again.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:37:01.530
You see, for example, these two
lines here are symmetric

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.110
with respect to the
line 'x' equals 1.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.110
But notice that this generates a
much larger volume than this

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.720
because its generating
arm is longer.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.200
It's further away.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.330
But at any rate, that's
just an aside.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.790
Notice how by the method of
cylindrical shells, we

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.620
determine the volume
is 8 pi over 3.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.620
Suppose we'd wanted to do this
by the solid method-- the

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.470
solid revolution method.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.850
Notice that we would first
have to invert this

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:29.880
relationship.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.260
We would first have to solve
for 'x' in terms of 'y'.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.320
Notice that 'y' equals '2x - x
squared' is the same as saying

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.140
that ''x squared'
- 2x + y' is 0.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.680
Using the quadratic formula, we
can solve for 'x', and we

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:49.430
now find that 'x' is 1 plus the
square root of '1 - y' or

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.800
1 minus the square
root of '1 - y'.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.050
What that means, by the way,
geometrically, is simply this.

00:37:57.050 --> 00:38:01.720
For a given value of 'y', there
are two values of 'x'

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.340
located symmetrically with
respect to 'x' equals 1.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.200
See, they're on symmetrical
portions.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.920
Well, this doesn't make
that much difference.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.300
The thing now is what?

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.680
What is my cross-sectional
area?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.130
My cross-sectional area is pi
times this length squared

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.680
minus pi times this
length squared.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.280
That's pi times 1 plus the
square root of ''1 - y'

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.280
squared' minus pi times the
square root of 1 minus the

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.670
square root of ''1
- y' squared'.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.790
When I square this and subtract,
all but the middle

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.180
term drops out.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.640
In other words, I have twice
the square root of '1 - y'

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.210
here minus twice the square
root of '1 - y' here.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:48.610
When I subtract, I get 4 times
the square root of '1 - y'.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.560
I multiply that by pi.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.180
That's my cross-sectional
area.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.260
And now to find the volume, I
just integrate that as 'y'

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.800
goes from 0 to 1.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.100
You see, and if I carry out
this integration, noticing

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.620
that the integral of ''1 - y'
to the 1/2' is minus 2/3.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.800
Remember, the derivative of
'1 - y' with respect to

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.610
'y' is minus 1.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.390
''1 - y' to the 3/2'.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:15.510
Evaluate that between 0 and 1.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.220
The upper limit gives me 0.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.370
The lower limit is minus 2/3.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.550
I subtract the lower limit.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.800
It gives me 2/3.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.860
4 pi times 2/3 is 8 pi
over 3, the same

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.940
answer as I got before.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.760
Notice, by the way, that
this was messy, but we

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.770
could handle it.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.580
If this had been
much tougher--

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.680
say a 6 over here or something
like that instead of a 2--

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.010
how would we have solved for
'x' in terms of 'y'?

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.370
You see, in other words, this
would have been a case where

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.250
the shell method would have been
necessitated because of

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.780
the impossibility
of the algebra.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.660
But at any rate, we have plenty
of opportunity to

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.550
illustrate that in terms of
exercises and supplementary

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.100
notes and reading material
and what have you.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.330
That is actually the
easiest part.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.840
The hard part is to understand
the significance of what's

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.170
going on, so I thought that to
summarize today's lecture,

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:10.620
let's keep in mind that whether
you call it area or

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.530
whether you call it volume or
whether you call it distance

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:18.870
traveled in velocity, the fact
remains that if 'f' is a

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.800
function continuous on the
closed interval from 'a' to

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.930
'b', and we partition that
interval into 'n' parts, and

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:32.270
we form the sum as 'k' goes from
1 to 'n', 'f of 'c sub

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:37.150
k'' times 'delta x sub k', where
'c sub k' is in the k-th

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.750
interval, and 'delta x sub
k' is just 'x sub k'

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.130
minus 'x sub 'k - 1''.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:48.200
If we take that limit as the
largest 'delta x' approaches 0

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.960
and call that 'Q', that
limit 'Q' exists.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.940
Symbolically, it's written by
the definite integral from 'a'

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.660
to 'b', ''f of x' dx', and,
more to the point, if you

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.200
happen to know differential
calculus, you can compute 'Q'

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.430
just by computing 'G of b'
minus 'G of a', where 'G

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.530
prime' is any function whose
derivative is 'f'.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.290
OK?

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.800
Now again, this is why I'm
calling it a summary.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.570
If you separate this out from
all of the computational stuff

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.010
that we did in today's lecture,
this is the part

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.680
that's left.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.500
OK?

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.080
And what I want to do next
time is to show you that

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.170
things are not quite this
straightforward all the time,

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.860
that certain nice things have
been happening here that allow

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.820
us, essentially, to get
away with murder.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:40.570
And what I mean by that will
become clearer next time, but

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.220
until next time then goodbye.
