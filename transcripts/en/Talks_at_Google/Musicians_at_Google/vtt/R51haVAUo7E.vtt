PEGAH HAGHIGHAT:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.170
Welcome.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.740
I'm excited for today.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.650
We're going to have a special
performance by PJ Morton.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.110
Please give around of
applause for PJ Morton.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.412

PJ MORTON: Happy to be
here to hang with you guys.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.910
I don't get to play
to offices that much.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.370
So I'm going to sing a
couple of songs for you--

[PLAYING PIANO]

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.680

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.110
Keep snapping, yeah.

[PJ MORTON SINGING "FIRST

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.567
Thank you all so much.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.355
You all are some
amazing snappers.

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:16.190
I just got to give you
props for your snap.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.529
This next song right here is--

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.940
when I was making
this album, it was

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.680
after having a bunch of meetings
and trying to figure out what

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.150
I wanted to do as an artist.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.460
I feel like I got lost and
things got cluttered for me.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.190
Some of you may not know, but
I'm also in the band Maroon 5.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.780
So seeing all their success
and being a part of something

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.640
so huge somewhat confused me
of who I was as a solo artist

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.390
and what I wanted to say.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.810
And I decided to leave LA,
move back home to New Orleans,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.100
and really get back
down to the basis of who

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.850
I felt I was and got back
to the reason I made music

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.850
in the first place, which
is, at the foundation,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.020
just to do something special and
make some art that is special.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.040
I want to sell records.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.910
I want to do all
those good things.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.540
But at the basis of it, I
want to be making something

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340
that I want to make.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.130
This one's called
Claustrophobic.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.050
You don't have to snap on this.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.540

[PJ MORTON SINGING

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.600
All right, thank y'all.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.110
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Thank you.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.450
Hi, PJ.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.190
Thanks for being here at
Google in San Francisco.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.380
PJ MORTON: Glad to be here.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.840
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Very
excited to have you here.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.990
So I know today you're here.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.565
Also, you're touring
with Maroon 5 currently.

00:09:07.565 --> 00:09:13.380
You're going to perform tonight
in Oakland at the Oracle Arena.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.260
First, I want to
start off and ask you,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.820
how did you start with music?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:23.880
And how did it feel to get
into this whole business

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.390
at the very beginning?

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.590
PJ MORTON: Right, well,
I started in music--

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.080
being from New Orleans,
obviously, it's

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.310
a big part of the
makeup of the city.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.020
And I had a musical family.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.160
My father was a singer
and a preacher-- a pastor.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.570
So I grew up in church
playing as a preacher's kid,

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:51.540
and got into the business very
early because the musicians

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.000
that my father had around
were also songwriters and had

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.810
played songs.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.420
So I got my first placement--

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.150
I was introduced to
the business at 15

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.660
and got a song on an album,
and it kind of went from there.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.060
I moved to Atlanta, went to
Morehouse, and met Andy Irie.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.330
And that was my first major
placement on an album.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.150
And that won a Grammy award
while I was a junior in college

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.930
still.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.180
At that point, it
was just all exciting

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.340
because that was my dream.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.550
Even leaving New
Orleans was in an effort

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.440
to get in the business
because New Orleans,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.740
and why I'm back
in New Orleans, is

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.800
to help build that
music infrastructure

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.130
because while there is music and
entertainment infrastructure,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.320
the best musicians in
the world are there.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.320
There has never been a real
business there for music.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.300
It's why I had to leave
and find the business.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.195
And now I'm back
to combine the two.

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:52.320
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: OK, great.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.950
Great.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.094
I also know you toured
with Erykah Badu.

00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:56.760
PJ MORTON: Yeah.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.051
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: She's amazing.

00:10:58.051 --> 00:10:58.718
So how was that?

00:10:58.718 --> 00:10:59.509
PJ MORTON: Amazing.

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.110
Yeah, that was my
very first tour.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.610
First time on a tour bus.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.500
My first time in
church on a Sunday.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.629
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:07.170
I didn't know what
to do on a Sunday.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:09.780
I was like, wait,
do we go to church?

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.510
I was a true preacher's kid.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.030
Erykah is such an amazing--

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.270
I was just lucky to have my
start be with someone who is

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.200
such an artist, such a leader.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.470
Like a culture shifter.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.210
So that is amazing.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.384
And we still stay in
contact now these days.

00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:28.800
She's always been
a huge supporter

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.720
of whatever I was doing.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.830
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: OK.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.120
And then after you
were touring with her,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.780
you started to get into
the band with Maroon 5.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.040
So how is that?

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.550
How is that getting
into a group like that,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.450
and also starting your solo
career here on the side?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.390
PJ MORTON: Yeah, well, I had
the longest writer's block

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.320
I ever had while I
was out with Erykah.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.610
I tell songwriters to
live first and then write.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.030
So I was trying to
write while I was taking

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.550
on all these new
experiences, and couldn't

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.690
write a song at all.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.980
And when I got off the road with
Erykah, I wrote my first album.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.920
It was like two songs a day.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.000
Everything came out
that I experienced.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.640
And then there was some
songwriting, and some albums,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.290
and some touring
in between there.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.900
And I had a friend,
Adam Blackstone,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.990
who's like the music
director to the stars.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.870
And he would always
ask me to be on gigs

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.300
to play keys because I was
a keyboard player first

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.110
before an artist.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.276
And I would always turn it
down because I was trying

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:38.270
to focus on being an artist.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.561
But when he called about
the Maroon 5 thing,

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.060
I was like, well,
this is different.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.850
And I was also at a point
where I was had a plateau

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.510
with what I was doing.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.410
And it was my first
audition ever.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.590
I had never auditioned
for anything.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.940
And it was their first.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.450
Maroon's been a band
since eighth grade.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.332
So it was awkward
for both of us.

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:06.040
They're like, what
are we supposed to do?

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.998
I'm like, I don't know.

00:13:06.998 --> 00:13:09.730
I've never--

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.440
So they asked me to
learn Sunday Morning.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.870
And I flew to LA, and
played it, and then we

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.710
ended up just jamming
for like half an hour.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.150
And there were other
people waiting to audition.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.260
So they said they knew.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.600
And I kind of felt it too.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.247
I guess it speaks
to a lot of things,

00:13:27.247 --> 00:13:29.080
because there are a lot
of amazing musicians

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.720
that could have probably done
that, but we vibed as people

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.320
and connected as people.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.340
And they canceled the
second day of auditions.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.182
And it's been eight
years now next month

00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:43.390
that I've been with the band.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.220
It's been a crazy ride.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.100
This was before "The Voice".

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.030
This was before
Moves Like Jagger.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.280
We call it pre and
post Moves Like Jagger.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.170
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: How do you
feel about doing your solo thing

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.822
and also the Maroon 5 both
at the same time basically?

00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:07.030
PJ MORTON: I just feel tired.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.070
It is a great problem to have.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:18.000
I just got off of a solo tour
and had a week in between

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.020
and started this Maroon 5
tour a couple of days ago.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.730
It's amazing, man.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.760
Like I said, it's just
good problems to have.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.610
The guys are very
supportive of me.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.130
I've done double duty on
tour where I open the tour

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.890
and then close as Maroon 5.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.299
I've done that
here and in Europe.

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:39.590
And they don't have to do that.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.140
I don't even expect that.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.690
But that just speaks to the
type of people they are.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:51.520
It's challenging schedule wise
and not having any downtime,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.310
but YOLO.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.960
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: So you
also recorded a song

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.290
with Stevie Wonder,
which is pretty great.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.980
PJ MORTON: It's all right.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.210
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: How
was it to meet him

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.620
and to make music with him?

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.450
And who would you like to
work with in the future?

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.580
Are there any artists
you really want

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.170
to work with as a solo artist?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.320
PJ MORTON: Yeah, so to put it
in perspective, as a keyboard

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.230
player who wrote
songs and sang, Stevie

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.630
was just my ultimate--
is my ultimate right now.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.249
And when people would ask me
that question on interviews,

00:15:33.249 --> 00:15:34.540
who do you want to collab with?

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.100
And it was always Stevie.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.990
So after I worked with Stevie,
I was kind of like, ruined it--

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.650
that question.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.810
I had to think differently.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.650
He's my hero.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.840
Some people ask me if I'm--

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.590
because things are
reminiscent of Stevie.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.340
And of course, I'm
sitting down playing.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:01.960
It offends me that people
say I'm so much like--

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.320
look like Stevie or
trying to sound like him.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.890
But I'm honored by that.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.940
It's like, he knows that
I'm not trying to imitate.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.980
I just been heavily influenced.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.610
And to have him there makes
me not care about any of that

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.110
because he supports.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.090
And still, Stevie wants to
work on new music with me

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:22.990
and stuff like that.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.290
It really is surreal, and
I feel like I'm in a dream.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.690
I've listened to the song
that I collaborated with him

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:34.710
on probably 100,000
times, and I'm

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.350
still shocked every
time I hear that Stevie

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.190
is on a song with me.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.030
Yeah, it really is a dream
come true, like literally.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.112
As far as people I'd
like to work with,

00:16:48.112 --> 00:16:50.070
I think of more current
people now because that

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:54.560
was like the big hero from--

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.370
but like a Kendrick Lamar.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.050
Pulitzer Prize winner, Kendrick.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.001
Yeah, like Chance the Rapper.

00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:03.750
I want to produce
something with Pharrell.

00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:09.930
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: So
speaking of that,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.220
you were nominated for two
Grammys for your current album,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.180
"Gumbo".

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.650
So how do you feel about that?

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.294
And also, what made
you create this album?

00:17:21.294 --> 00:17:22.710
And where does the
name come from?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.310
Can you tell a
little about that?

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.351
PJ MORTON: Yeah, well, it
was me moving back home

00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:28.620
in New Orleans.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.090
I was an artist after I
moved away from New Orleans,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.530
so I never made
a record at home.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.670
So that was part of it,
just a nod to gumbo.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:46.640
But really, on a deeper level,
I wanted to challenge myself.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.990
I've written a
lot of love songs.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.790
I wanted to challenge myself to
talk about more than just love

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.560
this time around.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.740
I felt like the world was
just a little too crazy

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.990
to only focus on that.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.200
I wanted to address things
that I was feeling as a person,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.230
like Claustrophobic.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.800
There's some on there
called religion.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.880
Just deal with different
things other than love.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.680
Of course, there's First Began
and other love songs on there.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.710
But for me, it started
to feel like all

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.390
this different subject matter.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.870
And gumbo is a dish where you
put all these different things

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.654
in there to make this
one beautiful thing.

00:18:26.654 --> 00:18:28.070
And I feel like
that's what I did.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:32.410
And I made it in New Orleans, so
that's why I named it "Gumbo".

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.800
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Great, great.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.730
And you started your own
label, Morton Records.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.160
So how did you find
the time to do that

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.000
in between all this craziness?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.885
And how do you how do
you feel about that?

00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:49.760
PJ MORTON: I just
think I'm insane.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.660
It's not a great idea to
start a music label right now

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.320
in the world.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.050
This speaks to my passion.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.270
We're calling it the
Motown of New Orleans

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.780
because I'm really trying
to focus on local talent

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.730
the way Motown did, and really
develop some of the things

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.230
that I care about.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.990
I am a firm believer
in not complaining

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.850
about what's out there
or what you don't like,

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.190
but actually doing
something about it.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:23.240
So this is my way of
balancing music and trying

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.260
to put some things out there
that I feel need to be heard.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.840
And it's been awesome so far.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.130
We're going very slow because I
don't want to take on too much

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.370
and not really be able
to put attention to it.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.510
But it's been awesome.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.970
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Great, great.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.170
And what would you recommend
for people who are out there,

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.090
like young artists,
musicians, who

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.730
want to get into the
business but really don't

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.879
know how to put their
first foot into the door?

00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:54.920
What would you tell them?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.770
PJ MORTON: It's much
easier than when I started.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.740
There's way more access.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:06.620
The playing field is way more
equal than it used to be.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.760
I feel like writers
write, artists make art,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.590
so I would just say
start where you are

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.370
and use the tools that
you have right there.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.290
I couldn't use a
laptop initially

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.750
to make music when I was first
starting out at 14 or 15.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.550
So you have things right there.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.280
You have your phone even
where you can start.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.650
I would say start to
create immediately and find

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.310
your people.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.890
I think what I love about the
internet is that you can find

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.000
your people, whoever they are.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.291
It's ways that they
can get to you.

00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:44.540
But you've got to start with
the lowest hanging fruit.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.550
Just start with
who's around you.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.050
Start with your friends,
start with your city,

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.560
and then just continue
to grow it that way.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.240
There's that old
grass roots thing.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.615
You can just put steroids
on it with the internet.

00:20:58.615 --> 00:20:59.740
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: OK, great.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.510
Thanks, PJ.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:08.400
So we're ready for some Q&amp;A. So
if you guys have any questions,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.080
there is a mic.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.730
Please line up and
free to ask away.

00:21:24.435 --> 00:21:25.310
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.320
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Hey, man.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.275
AUDIENCE: How's it going?

00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:28.983
PJ MORTON: Anticipation
from the walking.

00:21:28.983 --> 00:21:33.440
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was like, I'm
really the only one up here.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.140
No, thank you for those opening
songs, for sharing some words.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.260
I'm just curious since
it's pretty much all you--

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:47.410
you are producing the lyrics,
producing the sounds, which

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.160
tends to come first for you?

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.820
Are you a person who
sits with your notebook,

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.920
and writes these lyrics,
and then jams after?

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.360
Or do you feel it in your hands?

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.690
PJ MORTON: It's usually
musical for me first.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.315
I think maybe only
two times in my life

00:22:02.315 --> 00:22:05.230
have I written
down lyrics first.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:10.810
I'll always have song
title ideas, or a line,

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.350
and I'll put that in my phone
and maybe come back to it.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.150
But it's always
melodic first for me,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.290
and then I put words to it.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.510
Paul McCartney talks
about writing Yesterday.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.350
And he had a dream and it was
scrambled eggs, da da da--

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.700
this is like my process.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.200
It's really close my process.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:35.622
It's like nothing first, and
then I put words to it after.

00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:36.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.465
PJ MORTON: Yeah, man.

00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:40.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.330
PJ MORTON: Hey.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.510
I have a quick question
for those of us

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.850
who are not in bands
but do understand what

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.840
it's like working with a team.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.470
What was the conversation when
you had to talk to the band

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.540
about wanting to do solo work?

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.624
Was that difficult?

00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:55.790
Is that a challenging thing?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.350
You've been with Maroon
5 for a long time.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.600
I'm sure you're like a family.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:22:59.880
PJ MORTON: Yeah.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.500
AUDIENCE: Was that hard,
or were they OK with it?

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.166
PJ MORTON: Well, the
easy thing about it

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:06.210
was when I joined the band, they
knew I was an artist already.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.400
So I kind of came
in as an artist.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.530
What was maybe more challenging
was when I decided to leave LA.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.560
Because I moved to LA
because of the band,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.820
to be closer to
everybody, and I wasn't

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.375
going to leave LA if they
weren't totally cool with it

00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.300
as a group.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.390
It was important to me.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.460
And they realized that
it's different now.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.340
When I first joined the band, we
could call surprise rehearsals,

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.350
there was no "Voice" schedule,
no TV, all that stuff.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.570
So things could just pop up.

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.190
Thankfully, our schedule was
locked in for a long time

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.000
ahead, so they
understood my reasoning

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.970
and knew that I would not be
any less dedicated from where

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.460
I was.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.680
Yeah, we're doing all right.

00:23:58.712 --> 00:24:00.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.320
PJ MORTON: Thank you.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.980
AUDIENCE: So as
a woman of color,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.080
I think as you continue
to advance yourself,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.420
you get degrees, you
get the great jobs,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.400
you start to think
about how do you

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.550
use your platform
to raise awareness

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.900
for different
issues of injustice.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.290
And so I'm curious to know how
you think about now that you

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.800
started your own label,
you're establishing

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.026
your own career
separate from Maroon 5,

00:24:25.026 --> 00:24:26.400
how do you think
about leveraging

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.110
your platform as a musician to
speak to all the issues that

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.320
are affecting people today?

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.390
PJ MORTON: I think as
an artist, we've always

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:44.410
been the way to soften the
blows of a conversation,

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.730
making it musical and
making people sing along.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:53.430
And I, in the spirit of Marvin,
and Stevie, and those guys,

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.660
always feel necessary.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.760
I think that's
what I was alluding

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.710
to when I was saying
that I couldn't just

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.949
talk about love this time.

00:25:00.949 --> 00:25:02.490
There's songs like
Everything's Going

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.260
To Be All Right and All Right on
my album that deal with what's

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.940
going on and how
divisive it is right now.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.860
And that's the best
way I know how.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.700
That's my tool.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.450
That's the strongest
tool I have is music.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.980
So I use that the most.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.250
I feel like that's thing that
comes to be the most natural.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.920
But then I also lend
my voice to people

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.690
who can't be as loud as I can.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.580
It's important to me.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.079
Very.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.800
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.450
I was wondering if
you could comment

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.560
about the role of formal music
training in your own past,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.800
and how that has or hasn't
been part of your development.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.590
And also if you could
talk about the musicians

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.410
that you played with, if
you've noticed differences

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.890
between those who have and
haven't really formally studied

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.920
music versus learning from
being in bands, and friends,

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.450
and so on.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.116
PJ MORTON: Sure.

00:26:01.116 --> 00:26:09.010
Well, my experience
is kind of unpopular.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.070
My mom really wanted me
to take piano lessons

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.230
and become a classical musician.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.290
I quit piano lessons
probably after two weeks

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.650
because I was playing
stuff on the radio

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.450
and playing stuff on TV.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.320
And I had a gift.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:33.950
So to go from playing What's
Happening Now to da da da da--

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.460
I was like, nah,
I can't do this.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.610
So I didn't really
have the discipline.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.970
But I also feel
like with anything--

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.620
I went to Morehouse.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.030
Marketing was what
I got my degree in.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.320
And I felt like I was a
natural marketer already.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.800
I think with anything you do
in life, we have purposes in us

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.020
already that we use formal
training and other things

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.990
to perfect.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.250
So I think, especially
being from New Orleans,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.590
these musicians--

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.160
there was no notation,
there was no reading music.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.180
The music came first.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.130
And somebody said,
well, let's figure out

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:21.030
a way to put this on paper to
allow other people to do it.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:25.790
But I think some of the
elitists in music got it twisted

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.470
and looked down on people
who can't read music.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.570
But those are the people
who have the gift already,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.620
and they can use reading
and school to perfect that.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.100
But it was already in
me, so I personally

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.110
didn't want to learn music.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:46.550
My training came from
experience being on the road,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:51.830
being on 16 passenger
vans, going from city

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.975
to city and touching
people, and being on stage.

00:27:54.975 --> 00:27:56.600
I think that's one
thing we're missing.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.290
One thing my focus is at
Morton Records is development,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.760
because it's missing
because we have YouTube

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.180
and somebody can get a million
views, and then they go

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:13.010
and they're a star, and they
missed a whole bunch of steps.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.970
And that's why we see some
people who can't perform live.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.210
And I think that's
where the longevity is.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.410
So that was my training.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.500
My training was having the vets
around me and watching them.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.620
I didn't necessarily
have the formal training

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.680
of being a musician.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.144
I said if Stevie can't read
music, I'll be all right.

00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:34.928
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.330
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: OK,
one more last question.

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.080
AUDIENCE: Hey, PJ.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.600
PJ MORTON: Hey, man.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.683
AUDIENCE: This is awesome.

00:28:41.683 --> 00:28:43.250
Thank you.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.570
I have a songwriting question.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.930
So you touched on,
as a solo artist,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.400
you do want to sell records.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.730
But at the same time,
you want to really make

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.130
music that's true to
the root of who you are.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.460
And so my question is when
you're creating music,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.020
how do you think about the
compromise between expressing

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.200
what you want to express,
but also making that music

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.020
accessible to a lot of people?

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.015
And do you even see
that as a compromise?

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.590
PJ MORTON: So the thing
about me as a songwriter

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.560
is I've always loved pop
music in the sense of when

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.950
I say pop music, I mean songs
that people can sing along to.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.980
It's never been my
taste to be so left

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.780
that it's like you've got to
be super deep to understand it.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.330
That's never been my
thing, so I didn't ever

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.970
have a challenge with
writing a chorus that people

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.620
could sing along to.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.140
So I don't see that
as a compromise.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.440
Aside from that, I don't really
get deep into-- or I try not

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.100
to--

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:49.770
get deep into being
strategic about how

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.170
this song should be to
make it on the radio

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.380
or something like that.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.680
That's what I had to
get away from, because I

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.600
did have that for a long time.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.790
All I wanted to do was be
jamming for my friends.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.330
That's as far as it goes now.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.430
Because when I was a
kid being a musician,

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.090
when I learn something, I
want to impress my friends.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:15.020
So I think of the world
as if my friends like it,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.730
I don't care who else likes it.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.040
So that's my
compromise these days.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.990
It's like, make the
coolest thing you think,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.000
and then just trust that.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.400
As opposed to what's popping
on the radio right now?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.370
Let me see if I can do
something like that.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.930
Because, especially
now, trends move

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.080
so fast that you're
late once you

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.540
make a Cardi B sounding record.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.250
It's over, you know
what I'm saying?

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.740
That sound has been
done a million times.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.610
So I find that it's so hard
to get through the clutter

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.480
these days.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.650
That's the gift and
the curse of things

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:52.820
being more accessible now.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.950
Anybody can be out there.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.812
So there's a lot of clutter.

00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:57.770
And I think the way you
get through the clutter

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.170
these days is honest music.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.680
People want to be connected,
feel connected to something.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.970
Even Cardi.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.170
I'm not talking about sonically,
but the reason she cut through

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.060
is because she was a real
person and she didn't try

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:15.500
to be something else to sell.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.450
So I think being honest is as
much as the compromise goes,

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.145
and just trying to
impress my people.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.450
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Thank you.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.250
OK, so I think we have
one more song coming up

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.460
before we're done.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.394
PJ MORTON: All right,
I'll play another song.

00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:36.602
PEGAH HAGHIGHAT: Yes, please.

00:31:36.602 --> 00:31:38.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:39.494 --> 00:31:42.390
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.110
PJ MORTON: All right,
so if you know this one,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.790
I want you all to help me.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.350
I did a cover on this album.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.540
I looked up the top
10 songs of all time

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.650
and one of my favorites
just happened to be there.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.760
It's How Deep Is Your
Love by the Bee Gees.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.530
Are they from Austrailia?

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.010
Yeah, I think.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.250
Aussies, they had
some soul in there.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.670
I felt the soul in there.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:16.050
But I'm like, I think I can
fully put the soul in it.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:19.710
So I redid it, and I'm going
to do that one right now.

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.792

00:32:26.632 --> 00:35:08.932

 YOUR LOVE"]

00:35:08.932 --> 00:35:10.310
Thank you all so much, man.

Thank you so much, PJ.
