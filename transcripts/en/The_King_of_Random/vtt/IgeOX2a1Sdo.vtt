00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
Hey what's up guys we are back in the king of

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.720
random labs today I got some special guests this is

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.480
Jake and Richie the sonic dad crew tell

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.160
us what this is Richie This is sonic dad

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.349
project number 78 the marshmallow cannon

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.849
it runs on alcohol and shoots mini marshmallows so

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.139
basically this thing is like a mini

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.449
potato cannon that shoots marshmallows powered

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.300
by alcohol right this is a plastic PVC pipe

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.380
but you made it look like a metal

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.600
heatsink that's why I love Richie he to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.519
me is an engineering genius

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.170
alright so you just set this thing out

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.390
on your desk and you got little ignitor here with

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.570
any luck hopefully I didn't put any dents in my drywall

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.210
thats more powerful than i was expecting  geez these guys

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.350
are joining me today because we're gonna

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.360
take this awesome concept and we're

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.160
going to blow it up two times bigger

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.230
which may not sound like a lot but wait

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.700
till you see the size difference you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.320
make this thing two times bigger and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.360
it's seven times more powerful and that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
is what we're doing today

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.180
so this distance something that wants to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.949
give you their PDF for free I tried to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.690
talk them out of it but they insist

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.039
so somewhere on the screen here you'll

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.390
be able to click and also down the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.829
description there will be a link to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.300
where you can go and get their original

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.070
marshmallow cannon so how many different

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.090
segments are there it's actually

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.830
building this contraption we've got the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.990
base the combustion chamber the barrel

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.780
and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.150
have the igniter and fuel sponge I think

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.290
we're going to do is we're gonna break

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.850
this thing down into segments we're

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.260
going to go to different pieces together

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.060
the glasses on for safety and let's get

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.409
down to business

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.119
we got our parts laid out so we just

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.350
need to glue them together using some

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.270
PVC glue i love this stuff because you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.740
don't have to prime at first you just

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.780
slap it on sticking together in 15

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.440
seconds

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.180
you're locked in tight

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.630
 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.820
now this point the combustion chamber is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.590
pretty much finished there's one part

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.149
that we need to add this pressure will

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.610
be a piece of PVC tubing that sealed off

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.860
with epoxy on one end but still open on

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.610
the other

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.720
now we're going to glue this into the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.729
base of our combustion chamber and this

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.950
will allow us to swivel on the base and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.110
even separated as one individual unit

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.179
but it will be completely are tied now

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.090
it's time to add here

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.649
alright so this unit is as complete as

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.880
we're going to get right now the next

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.380
step is to paint it but before we do

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.929
that we're going to complete the base so

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.310
to build the base these are essentially

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.510
the pieces that you're going to need and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.220
we want to build them in two separate

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.049
chunks to begin with we're going to glue

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.510
all these together as seen here and I'm

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.950
going to glue all these together and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.690
seeing here as well we're going to wait

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.860
on these pieces because these are going

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.239
to friction locks were basically gonna

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.069
just jam the pieces together and this

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.870
will actually give it so we don't want

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.000
to do that yet these things come

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.410
together really well we got the base we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.239
got the combustion chamber the next part

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.040
is the heatsink this marks all the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.630
struggles we need to cut out Richie says

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.799
the best thing that works is to take a

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.569
little screwdriver or something and poke

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.340
a little dent or did it right in the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.260
center of that hole and drill it out

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.970
with a quarter inch bit and then move up

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.100
to a half inch bit so let's drill some

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.410
holes

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.290
alright guys so update we got our

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.910
heatsink finished and it is looking

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.540
awesome

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.860
the cool thing about this barrel is it's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.780
got a beveled 45 and so when you have

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.550
your ammunition whether it's a potato or

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.950
papaya you can just jab it down in there

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.170
is a nice little chunk of something and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.610
it's gonna fit right in your combustion

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.250
chamber ready to shoot that is so cool

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.840
what a clever design rich you are the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.680
man

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.390
alright guys we got our parts painted

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.800
the paint's drying right now and while

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.090
it's drying we can move on to making

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.370
this very important component which is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.430
now this fuel cell looks complicated

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.560
once you break down it's not that bad

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.760
basically are going to do is you're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.650
going to take the metal rod you're going

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.360
to put into the center of the half-inch

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.830
and plug and you're going to fill it up

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.200
with hot glue and let that cool so the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.430
rods running up straight to the center

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.990
then take your sponge and cut into

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.090
1-inch strips take an exacto knife or

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.830
something sharp and slice it right down

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.740
the center halfway deep a dab of hot

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.870
glue and hold in place and they get a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.520
little one-inch sections sponge that you

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.110
can slide down to the bottom including a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.880
place where it's going to repeat that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.040
process until the entire rod is filled

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.710
with sponges it's very important that in

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.600
between each section of sponge you had a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.940
full layer of hot glue this is going to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.800
create a layer in between each section

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600
of sponge the purpose of having all

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.550
these bulkheads in between each sponges

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.410
to prevent the fuel from sliding back to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.040
one end

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.260
rendering this less effective got

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.000
teenager and alcohol which basically

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.609
means alcohol you can't drink poison it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.650
the more surface area we can add through

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.630
these sponges the quicker the alcohol is

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.539
going to evaporate so we got the

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:29.130
combustion chamber and the baseball

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.960
finish we've got barrel and the heatsink

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.530
finished

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.150
we've got our fuel cell the only thing

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.350
left to do now is to put it all together

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.120
and add a source of ignition the igniter

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.410
actually isn't that difficult we're just

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.849
using our threaded cap from the top

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.169
we're going to drill a hole through the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.880
center take one of these barbecue later

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.680
smash it open and extract the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.080
piezoelectric igniter glue that down to

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.060
the center secured to the side twist the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.710
wires and leave a little bit of a gap

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.470
when you press the button and sparks and

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.930
screwed together a little fuel is right

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.600
it's just for fun we put a muzzle brake

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.070
on the end here this uses a one and a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.930
quarter inch coupling with a one and a

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.270
quarter to one inch bushing lookout

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.590
awesome thanks guys

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.720
so our cannon is assembled we're ready

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.009
to fire all we have to do is take this

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.440
barrel add a little bit of alcohol spray

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.419
to the sponge practice thing and give it

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:31.350
a slip and pasta you get the power so

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.580
after you fire you can just give it

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.259
about nine or ten pumps this will

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:35.820
circulate pressure in the combustion

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.979
chamber and push up all the old air and

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.389
because those sponges are releasing

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.520
fresh alcohol constantly you fire this

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.870
thing over and over and over again

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.699
without having detention camps

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:51.260
fire in the hole ok

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.080
well I guess that's to be expected who

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.460
missed over to shredded the damage

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.820
yeah that was amazing i love it

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.800
we're in business huge thanks to my

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.480
friends and sonic at for putting this

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.130
project together Ritchie has got some

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.630
amazing brains they've got a lot of

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.580
little projects on their YouTube channel

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.070
and their websites on ted.com so check

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.750
them out if you've got itchy hands

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.830
you're looking for something to build

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.720
you've got a lot of projects to satisfy

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.280
this kind of makes us feel like being

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.230
kids again in another video we're going

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.370
to take this thing out and battle-tested

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.380
whole range of ammunition so what would

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.760
you like to see this fire with it

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.990
put your comments below what kind of

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.400
ammunition we should shut down the

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.570
barrel and I might be a whole other

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.180
video so subscribe and stay tuned to see

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.890
what we do with this thing in the future

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.840
project videos Richie, that some cool

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.190
ideas for happiness we're going to plug

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.630
in this thing so stick around to see

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.220
those thanks for joining us for this

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.660
project will be looking for in the next

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.720
one not even move a little bit of

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.760
material do not remove a finger you

00:06:46.760 --> 00:07:06.290
can't hesitate you got fully commit
