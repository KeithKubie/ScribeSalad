[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:25.220
 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.530
I thought male pattern
baldness was on the X

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.040
chromosome from your
mum's dad.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.612
Was your grandfather bald?

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.070
No.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.525
What about your dad?

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.320
No.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.470
Well, mine wasn't either.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.380
But it doesn't seem to come just
from the X chromosome.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.815
There was a paper published a
few years ago, which suggests

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:51.606
that it actually involves
chromosome number 20.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:52.856
Huh.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:56.088
 

00:00:56.088 --> 00:01:11.526
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:37.440
 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.970
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.730
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.260
I like it.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.530
Absolutely.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.290
And then you get the observer
who's going to resolve it into

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.070
one state or the other.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.390
The core particle is the
Sella's particle.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.580
Yeah, well, that's--

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.100
The Andrea Sella particle.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.240
Which lends gravitas to--

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.490
Yeah [CHUCKLING].

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.749
