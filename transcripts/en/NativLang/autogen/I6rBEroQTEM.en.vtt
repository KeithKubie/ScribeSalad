00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.630
Did you miss me?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.259
After a three month stepaway, I'm here to
report back with what I've been up to and

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.049
share the tough but important decision I had
to make about the future of NativLang.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.429
At the beginning of the year I announced in
a community post on YouTube and in text and

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.490
audio over on Patreon that I'd be stepping
away from NativLang for a few months.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.179
I stepped away because I needed some perspective.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.949
For years, I've jumped from project to project.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.220
As much as I immersed myself in each new one,
it didn't feel like my job.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.200
I was taking courses and programming to advance
my career, after all.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.680
Getting animated about language history?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.400
That's a personal passion, not a job job,
right?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
Well, that question became acutely relevant
when I was well over 300 hours into animating

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080
Middle Mongol.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.830
What was I doing?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.300
How seriously was I taking this?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.010
Didn't this time belong to my career?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.870
I couldn't shake that, even as I started pouring
hours into the next project.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.000
So I cut myself some slack.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.900
I released the story and art for Altaic that
I had so far.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.500
Then I got some distance, time to learn, time
to create and time to reflect.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.730
I was humbled to see you sticking by NativLang
throughout these months.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.820
You gave me thumbs and hearts, and your patronage
actually grew!

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.680
It's amazing, you cheered me on and you took
the stress out of the whole thing.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.620
I reciprocated, keeping you updated throughout
the months, including my classwork, opportunities

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.590
I was applying to and, most interesting, two
of my own projects I was building.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.000
Wanna see?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.820
While you waited, I worked on a custom language
builder.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.140
Forgive its hackery-looking surface, but check
out its insides.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.100
If I give it some IPA with features, then
some simple syllable types, it generates believable

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.050
words all on its own.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.260
Then I can define some rules and have it apply
sound changes.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.420
It even builds units by attaching grammatical
affixes or adpositions.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.080
While you waited, I also worked Grim Harvest.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.260
This is a prototype for a game idea I just couldn't
let go of.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.139
This grim here farms heros or lite-rogues
that run through a randomly generated castle

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.700
when they're planted.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.129
After I got the various game systems messy
but working together, creating the art and

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.240
music and seeing it come to life was an unexpectedly
nostalgic reminder of what I love

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.820
about creating NativLang videos.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.010
And a reminder that I still had a decision
to make about the future of NativLang.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.700
I compiled a list of over 100 questions considering possibilities

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.779
from going all in to walking away.

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:51.079
I spent weeks weighing my answers and 
9 hours writing them down.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.230
It comes down to this: I'm in.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.900
I have a plan.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.000
The plan is demanding but flexible with me when I need to set aside projects

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.040
or even step away for a moment.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.599
I'll reevaluate in 6 months and again in a
year.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.819
The plan overhauls my creative pipeline.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.000
It'll take time to get the gears turning again,
but I'm on it.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.680
Also, I'm going to be bolder about asking
for your support.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.620
Since you're watching this I realize you're already more likely to be patron or supporter

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.100
so thank you for your patience when I do request
help sharing and sustaining my work.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.400
Well, that's some hope and honesty about my
needs, plans and goals.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.029
I appreciate you for sticking around and subscribing
this far.

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.260
Enough background, though - it's time to tell
a story!
