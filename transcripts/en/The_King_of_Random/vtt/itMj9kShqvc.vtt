00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.940
If you've got any old lighters laying around,
get them ready, because we're gonna use

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.220
them for some mini pyrotechnic entertainment.

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.300
For this project, i'm using these cheap butane
lighters I found at a dollar store. 3 for

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.050
a buck! I'll get those out of the package,
and then volunteer this green one for disassembly.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.800
A pair of needle nose pliers is great for
removing the valve guard, and that will give

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.510
me access to the tensioner that tightens and
loosens the valve. By manipulating the valve

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.699
counterclockwise, and much further than it
was ever intended, I can turn this little

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.090
lighter into a mini flame-thrower. This is
because a significant amount of gas is being

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.539
released now, which is obvious because of
the 12" flame shooting out. That's a foot

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.869
long flame, but be careful because your lighter
might catch on fire, and then what are you

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.490
going to do? Alright, to make a flint bomb,
I'll use my pliers to carefully remove the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.689
striker wheel from the two plastic tabs. There's
a spring loaded piece of flint behind the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.740
wheel, so I'll make sure not to lose it when
it comes flying out. I just need the spring

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.060
and the piece of flint, and when I'm ready,
I can stretch one end of the spring to make

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
a gap large enough to insert the flint. Wrapping
the spring around a couple of times ensures

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.420
the flint is held in place, and it should
look something like this. Time to light it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.799
up. For convenience, I'm using a candle flame
so that I have both hands free to energize

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.079
the flint. It takes about 25 seconds to see
any result, but I do see it starting to glow

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.540
orange. And when it starts glowing this brightly,
it's ready for action. Just throw it on a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.390
hard surface, and wham-o, you've got a little
mini firework. I'm not happy about how that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.159
scorched my patio though, so I'm using a concrete
tile as my new target. This time I'll try

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.860
using another lighter to heat this piece of
flint, and I'm trying to keep it in the orange

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.659
part of the flame because that's where it's
the hottest. When it's glowing bright orange,

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.909
i've got about 5 seconds to throw it and get
the shower of sparks i'm looking for. Waiting

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.579
any longer than that could make it self destruct
before getting it out of your hands. And this

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.540
premature sparkulation results in another
scorch mark on my patio. I tried this at night,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.799
and got some very impressive results. 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.280
I did some tests on the street, and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.519
that made for a cool looking firework effect.
The sparks burn hot and look awesome, and

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.340
it's amazing to see how much light these flash
off. All my flint is used up now, but I still

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.410
have these lighter bodies packed full of liquid
butane .. and I'm sure there's something I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.930
can use them for? Hmm, somehow this feels
like it could be a really dangerous idea.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.400
Luckily, it's just sprung a leak and turned
into a dual flamethrower, but if I smash another

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.670
one down beside it, I get more of the fire
show I was hoping for. I'm gonna stand

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.720
far away for this one, because when the flame
burns through the red casing, it demonstrates

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.340
an amazing flaming fireball. Well that was
impressive. As long as you have enough lighters,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.810
you can make a mini firework show that will
look like this. .. Or this, and this. How

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.810
about this, this and that. It only cost me
33Â¢ to do this flame, flash and boom. Well

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.060
that was a fun project but very dangerous
as well, so use extreme caution if you decide

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.129
to try this for yourself, or someone could
get hurt. 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.009
That's it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
