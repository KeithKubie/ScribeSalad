00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:08.209
(drum music)

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.470
- We want to have a
conversation here today.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.370
We want to talk about substantive issues.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.450
I think it's really important
to hear both sides of issues

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.810
because it often makes you
reexamine your own positions

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.930
and get deeper insights
into your own positions.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.910
We'll try to focus on the
facts as much as possible.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.608
And everyone gets extra
points for citing true facts

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:40.608
and not false facts, no
trivia, no personalities,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.200
just hard hitting issue analysis.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.720
With that, let me start
with the first question,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.618
which is a yes/no
question, president Trump,

00:00:49.618 --> 00:00:51.920
who just appointed Larry Kudlow as his new

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.727
economic advisor--
- No.

00:00:53.727 --> 00:00:57.347
(audience laughs)

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:58.680
- In seeing, no, no, no,
that's not the question.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.660
In seeing Larry Kudlow on TV, he said,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.940
you're looking handsome, Larry.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.946
Is Larry Kudlow handsome?

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:09.480
(audience laughs)

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.280
- Well, he used to do
Cadillac commercials,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.490
so yeah, the guy is handsome.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.995
- So he's handsome, Bob?

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:15.020
- No.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.524
- No.

00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:17.525
(audience laughs)

00:01:17.525 --> 00:01:18.571
Okay.

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.850
Well, I think we've run
that one to the ground.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.347
That was a good debate.

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:24.223
- Yes, thank you, thank you for that.

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:25.697
- Good opinion.

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:28.220
- Can I just add a word of...

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:33.060
Of welcome to Stephen Moore
because for the last 15 years.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.573
- More than that.
- More than that.

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:37.090
- Maybe 20 years, 30, 40?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.290
Stephen and I have debated on television

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.290
with Larry Kudlow very
often and I have enjoyed

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.360
debating you, Steve, I think
you're wrong most of the time,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.800
but no seriously, I've
enjoyed debating Steve

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.930
and I consider you a real friend.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.020
When you are debating on
television, one thing that you,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.400
you don't have a chance to see
the person you're debating,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.574
so it's a kind of surreal
experience, Steve,

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:07.574
to have you, a hologram of
you sitting right next to me.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.510
- Yeah, I used to say,
with, because we did this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.560
almost 20 years on CNN
every week, they called us

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.230
the dynamic duo, and
every once in a while,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.080
like, every once in a blue
moon, Bob Reich got it right,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.230
you know, and so I used to say, you know,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.240
even a blind squirrel finds
an acorn every once in a while

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.863
and that's true.
- Thank you for that.

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:30.377
- Okay, gentlemen.

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.827
(men laugh)

00:02:31.827 --> 00:02:34.520
So now that we've settled that
and the Larry Kudlow issue

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.210
to some extent, knowing there's two sides

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.850
to that one as well, I want to talk about

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.460
the following topics in order.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.240
I'm gonna start with money in politics.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.990
I want to go to crony capitalism.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.120
I want to talk about
free trade and tarries,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.830
the 2017 tax bill and income inequality,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.979
so we're gonna discuss those issues.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.560
We'll be here three or four hours,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.650
but let's see if we can get
through this fairly quickly.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.909
So let's start with money in politics,

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.810
is money in politics a
problem in America, Bob?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.643
- Yes.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.343
- Steve?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.663
- Yeah, because our government
is way, way, way too big.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.043
- Well, let me elaborate.

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:15.940
(audience laughs)

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.940
What we have here is, the
term crony capitalism, Steve,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.670
is one that I keep on hearing,
many people call themselves

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.960
conservative Republicans use, and I agree.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.680
I have seen really over the last 50 years,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.610
my first job was in Robert
F. Kennedy's Senate office.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.120
I was an intern in 1967.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.270
And I've seen just this
tide of money coming into

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.590
Washington, now the interesting
question and I think here

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.470
is where we may disagree
is cause and effect.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.830
And I have seen the
tide of money coming in

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.910
mostly from big corporations
and from Wall Street

00:03:56.326 --> 00:03:58.460
and from wealthy individuals
in order to influence

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.420
government, and Steve, I
don't know whether you see it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.500
that way, or whether you
see government being large

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.330
and as it gets large,
there's more money coming in

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.020
to influence it, but there's
no question that money

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.780
has taken over much of our policy making

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.630
and I hope you agree with me
and that's a real problem.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.641
- So look, I mean, by
the way, let me just say,

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:25.030
right from the start that
I want to thank my friends

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.500
at Young America's
Foundation for sponsoring me

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.763
to come here, so thank you, yeah for that.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.910
I think the causality
goes both directions.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.790
I mean, I think there's a
lot of naivete on the left.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.593
People say, oh my God, there's
so much money in politics,

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:39.500
they're spending so
much money on lobbying,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.640
they're spending so
much money on campaigns,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.630
but folks, we have a four
trillion dollar budget.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.050
Four trillion dollars.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.070
Is it a surprise that
companies and special interests

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.990
and whether it's the gun lobby
or this lobby or that lobby

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.380
is going to spend a lot of money, in fact,

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.520
I'm surprised that the
lobbyists aren't spending

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.730
even more money trying to elect candidates

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.410
and trying to influence
Congress because when I first

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.200
came to Washington, you
mentioned that you worked for

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.520
Robert F Kennedy, when
I came to Washington,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.130
I'm a little younger than you are in 1983,

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.230
the federal budget was

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:19.060
at that time, I'll never forget
this 'cause I was working

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.720
in the Reagan administration at that time

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.330
and I was working for Jim Miller, who was

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.550
the budget director, '84, '85

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.550
and we introduced the first
one trillion dollar budget

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.243
in American history, we
were very proud of that

00:05:30.243 --> 00:05:34.310
as Reaganites and I'll just
tell you one really interesting

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.470
quick story about that.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.180
So Jim Miller was supposed
to go on the Today Show

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.840
which was the show with Katie
Couric and he couldn't do it

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.200
that morning because he
got sick and he called me

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.420
and he said, Steve, can you
go on Katie Couric's show

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.010
and defend the president's budget?

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.860
And I spent literally the next two nights

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.900
just completely cramming
every statistic I knew

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.448
in the budget, I knew what the budget was

00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:02.130
for the army, you know, the
Department of Agriculture,

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.190
World Series, whatever
it was, so I was ready

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.850
for any question Katie
Couric might ask me.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.740
And Katie, the lights
come on, cameras rolling,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.070
Katie Couric kind of
growls at me, she says,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.540
Mr. Moore, I see that
Ronald Reagan is introducing

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.160
the first one trillion dollar
budget in American history.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.030
Says, my first question
for you this morning is

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:23.553
how many zeroes are there in a trillion?

00:06:23.553 --> 00:06:24.580
(men laugh)

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.691
You know, I just melted down.

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.740
It was the worst interview of my life,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.430
but my point is, it was a
trillion dollar budget back then.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.240
By the way, there are
12 zeroes in a trillion,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.970
I know that now by heart.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.180
But now we're at four
trillion and even adjusting

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.870
for inflation, we've doubled it.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.810
We're spending way too much money.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.270
We have so much crap in the tax code.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.170
One of the things we tried
to do in this tax bill.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.210
We didn't, we succeeded a
little bit but not much,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.220
is get rid of all the
junk in the tax system.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.040
One of the things that I
think Bob and I might agree on

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.570
is the idea of let's get rid
of all the special interest

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.610
loopholes in the tax system
for all of the special lobbies

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.290
and get the rates down and that would be

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.970
an efficient tax system, so less spending

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.580
and a simpler tax system
I think would reduce

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.600
the influence of the lobbyists.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.270
Now why would you be against that?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.003
- I'm not, I'm not, again,
it's cause and effect.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:20.801
What I've witnessed, and
this is certainly the case

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:25.390
at least since the mid '80s,
is that the lobbyists come in

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.340
and they want exemptions,
they want loopholes,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.380
they want everything
because they want to justify

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.050
to their industry and to
their trade association

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.870
and to others that they've,
basically they're worth

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.496
all of the money that they're charging

00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:43.496
and that set of loopholes
and that set of exemptions

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.110
makes everything more complicated.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.720
It makes the tax code more complicated,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.068
it makes the enforcement more complicated

00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:53.790
and also it results in less
revenue for the government

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.630
so it drives up deficits.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.630
There is almost no way to
stop all of this, short of--

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.540
- A flat tax, oh, sorry. (laughs)

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.870
- No.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.790
(audience laughs)

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.530
Short of major campaign finance reform

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.530
and full disclosure of who's
actually contributing what

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.480
to every campaign or
against every campaign.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.405
And public financing and a
lot of things that can be done

00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:25.300
even with Citizens United
and Steve, I think you and I

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.620
would agree on much of that.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.858
- So let me just give one
example of something I worked

00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:34.150
this past, you know, six
to nine months trying

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.690
to get rid of, a special interest
provision in the tax code,

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.960
something probably a
lot of you in this room,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.830
I'm just guessing probably
favor, which is, you know,

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.659
we have these massive
giveaways in the tax code.

00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:46.650
To the wind and solar industry.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.660
We pay them money to
produce energy because

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.800
they're so inefficient relative
to coal and natural gas

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.550
and the industry even admitted,
the wind industry said

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:01.068
there would be no wind
industry in America today

00:09:01.068 --> 00:09:02.640
were it not for these tax
subsidies and guess what,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.340
we couldn't get rid of
'em because a lot of your

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.700
Democratic friends, you know,
said they couldn't possibly

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.690
support that and some Republicans as well.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.500
My point is, too oftentimes
liberals say, well,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.980
we're against the special interests,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.947
we're against this or that,
but when it's their special

00:09:17.947 --> 00:09:19.360
interest, they're in favor of it.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.441
- Well what about, but oil
and gas, Steve, get so much

00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:23.441
subsidies.
- Get rid of those

00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:24.710
subsidies too.
- Let's get rid of

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.540
all of those subsidies,
but I don't understand

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.430
how the carried interest
subsidy interest loophole.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.022
- I wanted to get rid of that too.

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:35.380
- Well, wait a minute, how did
it survive, because everybody

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.657
- Because there were a lot--

00:09:36.657 --> 00:09:37.821
- Everybody, including the President--

00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:40.480
- There were about eight
private equity billionaires,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.870
I mean, it sort of makes your point.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.600
Who give a lot of money
to the Republican party

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.620
who said we can't support this
bill if you get rid of it.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.030
I fought it, you know,
and in the end of the day,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.110
that private interest loophole
is still in the tax system.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.493
I'm embarrassed by that, but
I'm gonna make a second run

00:09:56.493 --> 00:09:57.326
at that, I promise you guys.
- I'm embarrassed by it too

00:09:57.326 --> 00:09:58.730
and I'm embarrassed by a lot of things,

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.830
but we can't get rid of it
and all of these loopholes

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.059
and all of this corporate
welfare until we get some control

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.080
on campaign finance and
you would, it sounds like

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
you're agreeing with me on this.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.590
- You know, I...

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.430
What I'm for is people
disclosing what they're giving.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.030
I think we should have open,
if you're gonna give money

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.160
it should all be disclosed
and let people out there see.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.693
- Full disclosure.

00:10:21.693 --> 00:10:23.080
(men laugh)

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.780
- By the way, I just
have to make this point,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.900
that you were saying that
Robert Reich won this

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.500
very prestigious Time
magazine award for being

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.140
one of the 10 most successful
cabinet secretaries.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.831
Aren't there only 12?

00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:37.527
(men laugh)

00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:38.660
- [Robert] No, there are eight, actually.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.550
- Just teasing, couldn't resist.

00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:45.976
- But, look, I think quite
seriously, this is something

00:10:45.976 --> 00:10:49.620
that we have a lot of agreement
on, and I've talked to

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.070
some extremely conservative
members of Congress

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.616
who agree on this too,
it's very difficult to do

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:57.210
and the only way we're
gonna do it is if we get

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.330
big corporations and
the left and the right,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.640
Democrats and Republicans
to form a coalition

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.414
and force full disclosure--
- I am for it, I am for it.

00:11:08.414 --> 00:11:11.760
- Stop the revolving door, at
least slow the revolving door.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.936
- I'm for that.
- Do all of these things.

00:11:13.936 --> 00:11:14.790
- But you know what, I
mean, look, I worked on

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.830
the campaign, I was a
senior economic advisor

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.680
for Donald Trump, what, you know what,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.290
and I went with him to all
these areas of the country.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.340
I mean, I heard his speeches
over and over again.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.270
His most powerful applause
line other than build the wall

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.160
was drain the swamp and Americans, look,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.440
Americans are much more even
upset about this than you are,

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.390
Bob, I mean, I'll give you
a statistic that I think

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.100
summarizes everything that's
wrong with our government today

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.800
in Washington, I live in
the belly of the beast.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.030
I live in the swamp.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:50.310
Three of the five wealthiest
counties in America

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.150
are in and around Washington DC.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.930
Now how did that happen?

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.310
Because you know what folks?

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.950
We don't produce anything.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.030
All we produce is lawyers,
lobbyists, special interests,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.550
politicians, rules and
regulations, and we're getting rich

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.130
off it, and you know
what, the American people

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.130
are getting pretty upset about it, so.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.708
- Well, let me just, I
don't want to go too long

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:14.250
on this, because we have agreement here.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.250
In 1976, 3% of retiring
members of Congress

00:12:19.736 --> 00:12:22.380
became lobbyists, 3%.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.760
Today, 49%.
- Pathetic.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.110
- Of retiring members of
Congress, from both parties,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.100
become lobbyists, and I think that's--

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.210
- I'm surprised it's that low.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.939
- And I think it's a testament
to the amount of money

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:36.660
that is circulating in Washington

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.884
and that's got to stop, so
we have an agreement, good.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:42.398
- Let's move on to tariffs,
so Bob, you were an early

00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:45.660
opponent of the Transpacific Partnership,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.290
and I think Steve has
got some criticisms of it

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.260
but was basically a
proponent of free trade

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.800
and of the Transpacific
Partnership, although

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.920
you can speak for
yourself, but tell me why

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.970
you were opposed to the
Transpacific Partnership

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.954
and does that mean you're
in league with Donald Trump?

00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:03.240
(audience laughs)

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.680
- Well, last question
first, no, but I didn't like

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.150
the dispute mechanisms, in
fact, there was a similar

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.960
dispute mechanism in a
much smaller form in NAFTA,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.670
the North American Free
Trade Act, but actually

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.525
under TPP, you have a much larger version

00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:23.200
and that dispute mechanism
is between any corporation,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.950
for example, that feels
that for some reason

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.110
a member state, a member
country, to the TPP

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.560
has discriminated against
them or there's a non tariff

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.480
barrier, health, safety,
environmental regulation,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.480
labor regulation, whatever,
and that dispute can be

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.413
under the TPP, could be
dealt with by arbitrators and

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.040
the arbitrators are not
necessarily selected

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.040
by any member country but
the net result is that

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.860
anybody who has a grievance
and could be rewarded damages

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.170
from those health, safety or
environmental regulations.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.843
If you follow my argument,
that means that the TPP

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.680
could discourage any member
country from generating

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:20.510
any protections for the
health, safety or environment

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.274
or labor and that to
me is not only an issue

00:14:25.274 --> 00:14:29.300
of sovereignty but it also
is an issue of just politics.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.150
It means it would be harder,
that much harder actually

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.203
to protect members of that society.

00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.270
- In general, though,
are you for free trade?

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.209
Do you think that's a good idea?

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:42.012
As a principle?
- In general, I,

00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:44.221
in general as a principle,
of course, I think free trade

00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:47.560
is a good idea, but see, this
is the interesting issue,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.560
Henry, we have debated free
trade for years and I've been

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.270
on the side of well, stronger
environmental and labor

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.990
protections, Steve, you've
been on the side of free trade.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.610
We've debated deficits,
I've been on the side of

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.810
well, deficits may not
always be a problem.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.920
You and other conservatives
have been on the side of

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.830
we really do need to control deficits.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.010
We've debated states' rights
and I've been on the side of

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.420
federal government does
really need to preempt states

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.260
and you and other conservatives
have been on the side

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.740
of states' rights, we debated Russia

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.700
and I've been saying, you
know, we really shouldn't be

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.080
so hard on Russia, and you
have been on the side of

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.450
we have to be more aggressive on Russia.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.645
Every one of these issues, we
have completely flipped around

00:15:32.645 --> 00:15:36.963
under Donald Trump, every one
of them is now the opposite.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.773
- So I mean, look.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.950
I always say about Donald
Trump, you know, 'cause I've

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.170
gotten to know him very
well and I admire a lot

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.852
about Donald Trump, but look,
there is a good and a bad

00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.050
and an ugly, when it comes to Donald Trump

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.369
and every morning...

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:52.300
- [Robert] Do you want
to assign percentages

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.925
to each of those?

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:55.146
(audience laughs)

00:15:55.146 --> 00:15:55.979
- Every morning, this is
not being taped, right?

00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:57.660
But no, every morning
when I say my prayers,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.820
I say please God, let the
angel on his shoulder,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.660
not the devil on his
other shoulder, prevail.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.890
So when it comes to issues
like Russia, you know,

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.740
I don't understand this
dalliance with even what he said

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.410
today, congratulating
Putin on the election.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.100
Why would you congratulate
a guy who rakes elections

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.242
on winning an election?

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:20.280
So you're right about
that, now on this issue.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.584
- I do have a theory to explain that.

00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:24.980
(audience laughs)

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.530
- I'm not so sure I want to hear it.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.930
On this trade thing, I
mean, this is getting to be

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.280
a very complicated issue,
we're gonna see in the next

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.280
week or so a major call for
a major tariff against China.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.530
I have to confess, I'm
not an expert on the TPP

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.870
so I'm not gonna really get into that.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.540
I will say this, that
I learned my economics

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.890
from Milt and Friedman,
who I think are two

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.280
great economists, and
they always talk about

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.844
the four pillars of
prosperity, and those pillars,

00:16:53.844 --> 00:16:56.690
and I think they're just
important to write down.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.893
Sound money, I think we all agree on that,

00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:02.057
a sound currency that retains its value.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.370
Second of all you need free trade.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.100
Third of all, you need a
light hand of regulation

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.750
and fourth a good tax
system, and I still believe

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.830
that to this day, that if you
get those four things right,

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:15.870
you're gonna have a prosperous economy.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.120
Trump challenges the conventional
wisdom of conservatives

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.490
on a lot of these things,
there's no question about it.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.774
On trade, we can get into
this into a bigger way.

00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:28.895
I think trade, I mean, I think Trump,

00:17:28.895 --> 00:17:32.650
there's new, what I call
a Trump trade doctrine

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.880
and what that doctrine is...

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.630
Using, look, the United States is the hub

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:41.940
of the global economy, right,
and every other country

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.358
is a spoke and what
Trump is basically saying

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:47.382
and I've talked to him about this is

00:17:47.382 --> 00:17:50.360
whether it's China, whether it's Japan

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.520
or whether it's Korea
or whether it's Mexico,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.552
they need us more than we need them

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:59.151
so let's say we had, God
forbid, a trade war with China.

00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:01.350
What would it mean for the United States?

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.240
Well, it'd mean when you go
to Wal-mart, you might have

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.360
to pay 10 cents more for
toothpaste or you might have

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.780
to pay $29 more for a
cellphone 'cause a lot of these

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.240
phones are made in China,
if China can't sell to us

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.560
they go into a recession,
right, and I think

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.330
what Trump is basically
trying to do here is

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.190
use that leverage and that's
why, remember the other day

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.860
when he said, we can win a trade
war or something like that,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.750
I mean, with Trump you have
to kind of read through

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.710
what he's saying, what he meant to say is,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.680
we have a strategic advantage
over them because if it gets

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.245
to that point, they have
more to lose than we do

00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:38.940
and they're gonna blink
first, I think that's what,

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.610
and by the way, you
can disagree with Trump

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.500
on the policy, right, I mean,
you can say this is stupid,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.393
like, I thought the steel
tariffs were stupid.

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:47.406
- The steel?

00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:50.690
- The steel tariffs I
thought were a bad idea

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.420
because all you're doing is
raising the price of steel.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.560
I told the president,
I said, you're not even

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.280
gonna create factory jobs
here because for every one

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.630
steel worker, we have 50
workers in manufacturing

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.500
that use steel, now our steel's
gonna be 20% more expensive

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.830
than the steel, so it doesn't
even work in that respect,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.041
but I will say this, you
know, and you know this

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:11.280
because you've done
this too, I mean, I went

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.050
with Donald Trump to
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.080
West Virginia, Iowa, those
blue states that went red

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.080
and I would say that if Trump
had taken a conventional

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.040
Republican position on trade,
Hillary Clinton would be

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.701
president today, so this is
a challenge for those of us

00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:33.250
who believe in free trade, right?

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.680
We haven't convinced the
American people that free trade

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.513
is good.

00:19:37.513 --> 00:19:39.360
- But don't you think
a lot of that has to do

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.600
with the failure of both
parties to deal with

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.530
the consequences of technology?

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.500
- That's true too.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.640
- Which is actually having
a much bigger effect.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.750
- I totally agree with you.
- On jobs.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.320
- By the way, let me just, on steel,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.170
the reason we're losing steel jobs is not

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.356
because of trade, it's
because if you go, when I was

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:59.390
12 years old, I grew up in
Chicago, my parents took me

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.683
to a steel mill in Michigan,
I mean, that was like

00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:05.020
a 19th century sweatshop
with thousands of workers

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.250
carrying around heavy
beams, I mean, truly,

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.840
drudgery work, you go into--
- And a lot of injuries.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.830
A lot of injuries.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.440
- Yeah, today steel mills
are people walking around,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.040
it's all being done robotics,
Trump is wrong on this.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.230
We're not losing steel
jobs because of trade.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.660
It's because of, and by the
way, that's gonna continue.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.630
10 years from now there
won't be any steel jobs,

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.410
probably, right, because of technology.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:30.220
- Right, but back, if it's
true that both parties

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.600
have failed to deal with
the quote unquote losers,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.800
the people who are losing
their, what had been

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.040
middle class jobs because
of first technology,

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.040
secondly globalization, then
isn't the debate over tariffs

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.200
sort of beside the point,
I mean, shouldn't we say,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.790
let's not, let's not try to
protect industries with tariffs.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.010
Let's try to make it easier
for people to move from

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.447
job to job and get better
and better and better jobs

00:20:58.447 --> 00:21:00.950
with better education,
better job training,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.692
more of a re-employment assistance?

00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:04.900
- Yeah, yes.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.004
- Put that down, that's another issue.

00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:09.490
- (laughs) No, I mean,
you're absolutely right.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.720
I mean, now look, the problem
is, like Hillary would go

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.155
to these towns in West
Virginia, we went to these

00:21:15.155 --> 00:21:19.560
coal towns, and you know,
these places have been just

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.910
decimated, in no small
part, in my opinion,

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.970
because of Obama
regulations that just killed

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.840
the coal industry, now,
there's an example though, Bob,

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.770
where Trump has gotten rid of
a lot of those regulations,

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.840
and guess what, the coal industry is back.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.390
We're, and my point is,
though, Hillary went and said

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.473
exactly what you said, oh,
you can do something else.

00:21:38.473 --> 00:21:40.547
We'll retrain you for this or that.

00:21:40.547 --> 00:21:42.510
- No, no, politically, that's--

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.330
- It's her thing to
tell a guy who's worked

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.319
in a coal mine for 25 years, oh, you know,

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:48.592
you're not gonna be
able to do that anymore.

00:21:48.592 --> 00:21:49.593
You're gonna do something else,

00:21:49.593 --> 00:21:50.900
but I'll give you another statistic.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.900
One out of 11 males in
America today is hired,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.360
what they do for a living
is drive a vehicle.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.690
Now how many of those jobs
do you think will still exist

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.590
12 years from now?

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.800
- Four and a half million
are gonna be eliminated.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.053
- Yeah, exactly, so this
adjustment is happening,

00:22:09.249 --> 00:22:11.972
it's the issue of our time,
frankly, I mean, folks,

00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:13.040
this technological boom that's coming,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.170
whether it's artificial intelligence,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.740
whether it's robotics, whether
it's the driverless cars,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.610
they are gonna change life in
this country and on the planet

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.430
in ways that nobody is looking
at and make these other

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.370
issues small.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.880
- But so what does government
do in these situations?

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.470
You want the government
smaller, but it seems to me

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.700
that if we're going to help
people who lose their jobs

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.310
in these instances and
there are no other jobs,

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.020
what do we say to these people?

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.640
- Don't we have to have
stronger safety nets?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.580
Don't we have to have a
universal basic income?

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.590
Don't we have to have a larger
earned income tax credit?

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.540
Don't we have to have
a re-employment system

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.140
that provides education and job retraining

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.850
that is really useful to these people?

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.123
In other words, politically,
both of us agree

00:22:56.123 --> 00:22:59.100
it's not possible to say to these people,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.560
we're gonna get you another job

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.240
or you're going to get another job,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.240
but don't we have to be serious
about making it possible

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.860
for these people?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.824
- Well, look, I'm not one who believes

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.760
that this is the end of
work and end of jobs.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.497
I mean, there will be jobs
in the year 2025 and 2030

00:23:19.707 --> 00:23:21.527
and 2035, there'll probably be more jobs

00:23:21.527 --> 00:23:23.530
than there are today, but
they'll be different kinds

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.510
of jobs, and we're not, I
mean, my point is, look,

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.400
the kinds of things you're
talking about small potatoes

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.433
in the grand scheme of things.

00:23:30.433 --> 00:23:34.586
What we have to do is get the
next generation of workers

00:23:34.586 --> 00:23:37.460
ready for the, you know, look,

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.290
you've got to have a skill.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.310
Right now today if you have
any useful skill out there

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.290
whatsoever, you can find a job in 24 hours

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.930
and there's five million
more jobs out there than

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.350
there are people to fill them,
so what are we talking about?

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.810
There's not a shortage of...

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.427
Jobs right now, there's
a shortage of people

00:23:54.427 --> 00:23:56.290
who are trained to do the jobs.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.680
If you're a mechanic,
if you're a carpenter,

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.900
if you're an engineer,
if you know anything

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.110
about computers, you can
find those jobs out there.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.860
The problem is and I'll say
this about this university

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.800
but every university, I mean,
we're graduating with kids

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.790
with psychology degrees and
political science degrees

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.440
and frankly, there's not
a big demand for those.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.704
- Well, just for the record,
there's a great demand

00:24:17.704 --> 00:24:21.480
for UC Berkeley graduates,
they do very well.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.690
(audience applauds)

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.640
They really, really do.
- That's why you're here.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.050
- And this university
is extremely successful

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.540
at educating people to go on
to make very, very good money.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.779
I'd be happy to show you the data.

00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:33.345
Sorry.

00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:35.783
(audience laughs)

00:24:35.783 --> 00:24:36.616
(audience applauds)

00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:40.029
- But I think, Henry, that
Steve is absolutely right

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:41.972
that the issue--
- You write that down.

00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:46.090
- The issue in the future
is not the number of jobs.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.831
The number of jobs really does
reflect macroeconomic factors

00:24:49.831 --> 00:24:54.540
stimulating demand adequately,
it's the quality of the jobs.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.202
It's what the jobs pay and
that's what I worry about.

00:24:58.202 --> 00:24:59.770
- Well, the higher paying
jobs, not lower paying jobs.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.850
- Well, we're not seeing that trend.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:03.533
In fact, for the last 40
years, Steve, you and I

00:25:03.533 --> 00:25:07.950
have been talking about this,
median wages have been stuck.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.000
There's been wage stagnation.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.986
- Not the last, no, no,
that's where you and I

00:25:10.986 --> 00:25:15.986
part company, for the last 15
years they have been stuck,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.696
but we saw, now, it depends
on what kind of compensation,

00:25:19.696 --> 00:25:22.470
but if you look at just
compensation to workers

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.450
when you include benefits
and things like that,

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.890
in the 80s, we had a big boom
in middle class, you know,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.020
compensation and Laura
Tyson is here, what you guys

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.610
did in the 90s, that was a great
period for the middle class

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.350
I would argue the 80s and
90s were great periods of

00:25:41.914 --> 00:25:42.747
economic mobility for people.

00:25:42.747 --> 00:25:45.090
Now it stalled in the last
15 years 'cause I think

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.117
we've done a lot of stupid
things that haven't been

00:25:47.117 --> 00:25:50.120
good policy, but this
idea that, I mean, look,

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.690
I reject this idea which
you say all the time.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.880
Workers are not as well
off today as they were 40

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.855
years ago, I mean, does
anybody really believe that?

00:25:57.855 --> 00:25:59.696
I mean, come on.
(audience says "yes")

00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:03.022
No, 40 years, we didn't
have all these things,

00:26:03.022 --> 00:26:04.153
we didn't have the
computers, we didn't have

00:26:04.153 --> 00:26:07.040
the technology, we didn't
have the big screen TVs,

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.660
we didn't have the medicines
that we have today,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.433
the world is so much,
would anybody really rather

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:15.060
have been alive 40 or
50 years ago than today?

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.505
Come on.

00:26:16.505 --> 00:26:19.810
- Here's the thing, you
know, 50 years ago, even 40

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.200
years ago, we had something
called labor unions,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.985
which gave workers a lot
of bargaining leverage

00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:30.438
and right now today, we have fewer than 7%

00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:32.440
in the private sector are unionized

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.380
and that shows, there's
an absolute correlation

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.030
between the median wage, the
decline of the bottom 60%,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.825
particularly men, and the
decline of unionization

00:26:42.825 --> 00:26:45.245
and Steve, you and I can
really bore everybody

00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:48.470
with a data fight over
whether or not adjusted

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.960
for inflation today's wages
for the bottom 60%, 70 or 80%

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.950
of males are better than they
were, 40 or 50 years ago.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.450
I don't think they are,
but we can debate that.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.670
I think the point is that
quality jobs are really

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.731
critically important
and a lot of the anger

00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:10.731
that I saw in 2015 and 2016,
going into the election,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.193
one of the reasons I
think that Bernie Sanders

00:27:14.193 --> 00:27:17.040
and Donald Trump did as
well as they both did,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.640
surprising everybody, was
both of them responded

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.350
in very different ways to
the anger that so many people

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:26.320
had about a system, a
political economic system,

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.490
that was not responding.
- I agree with that.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.651
I think that's true.

00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:32.750
People are, but I would
only make the point

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.180
that I think it was political,
economic and cultural.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.140
I mean, people, you know,
look, what Hillary said

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.000
the other day, you know,
was the way I think

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.310
a lot of us conservatives
think that liberals

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.100
think about them, you know,
there was a view of these,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.560
'cause I talked to a lot
of these Trump voters,

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.270
these middle class voters, and
they were basically feeling

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.880
like number one, they
were afraid to speak out

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.270
because of political correctness.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.540
One thing that Trump did
I thought masterfully

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.630
was just, you know, put aside the rules

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.240
of political correctness and violate them

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.121
and people would say,
finally, somebody's saying

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:08.580
the kinds of things that we
wanted to say for 15 years

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.450
but we get shouted down every
time we want to see them.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.440
These kinds of speech
codes on college campus.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.300
I hope you don't have speech
codes here in Berkeley.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.420
I mean, universities should
be places where you have

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.460
open expression, that's
why I so much appreciate

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.032
the opportunity to come here and talk,

00:28:23.032 --> 00:28:26.030
but too often, conservatives feel like

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:28.700
we're just being
smothered by liberal rules

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.210
and that kind of thing, and so

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.090
I think it was cultural as well.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.890
- Well, let me just say for the record,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.090
I know you don't mean this, but I think

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.320
that Donald Trump has legitimized hate.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.070
(audience applauds)

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.610
- I think he's legitimized
a sense of hopelessness

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.260
of people and a sense that
their voices aren't being heard.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.350
- Well, the other thing that
you said about Donald Trump

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.890
saying that he was going to
take on the swamp in Washington,

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.120
he did say that, but the
swamp is deeper and bigger

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.570
and broader and fatter and
there are more swamp creatures

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:03.202
than I ever saw in Washington ever before.

00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:04.210
(audience applauds)

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.403
I want to, I don't want,
this is not fair to Steve.

00:29:08.403 --> 00:29:11.900
This is Berkeley and if you
applaud what I'm saying.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.180
This, I mean, I really
appreciate you being here.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.270
I asked you to get a visa
to come into Berkeley.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.364
- No, but look, on this
trade issue, I really want

00:29:21.364 --> 00:29:23.230
your kind of reaction, I want to throw out

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.460
a kind of hypothesis on this
and I want your reaction.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.950
I asked Laura about this earlier.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.210
Trump is basically gonna
say, we're gonna put a 30%

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.790
tariff on Chinese goods
and that's coming I think

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.520
in the next week or two, and
that's gonna be a big boom.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.280
I mean, the world is
gonna react in a big way.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.060
That's gonna get Beijing's
attention in a big way and,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.570
you know, I am a free trader
and I want you to react

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.810
to this, but look, China,
the report just came out

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.080
a few weeks ago, the Chinese
are stealing $500 billion

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.700
of our technologies every year.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.720
A lot of that technology
and that knowhow and patents

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.890
and the copyrights and
the computer software,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.350
that's made right here, right, in Berkeley

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.238
and the Bay Area and Silicon
Valley, they're stealing it.

00:30:04.238 --> 00:30:07.860
We also know that they're
building up their military

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.450
in China, we also know that
the reason this lunatic

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.896
in North Korea has a nuclear
bomb is because China

00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:16.080
enabled that to happen and you know what?

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.170
I'm with Trump on this,
I think it is time we get

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.293
really tough with China and
basically say, you're not

00:30:22.293 --> 00:30:26.210
gonna have access to American
markets until you behave

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.770
like civilized people,
and you're not doing that.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.843
You're cheating and you
can't have free trade

00:30:30.843 --> 00:30:32.900
with a country that's
cheating and stealing.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.890
- Well, I want to say first
of all that China is a rogue

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.790
in terms of trade, I
agree with that entirely,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.710
and if you're incorporating
in terms of your definition

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.650
of trade, intellectual property
theft, I agree with that

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.674
as well.
- What do we do about it?

00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:51.130
- That's the question,
what do we do about it,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.730
because I'm afraid that a 30%
tariff or any major tariff

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.250
on Chinese goods coming
to this country is going

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.776
to shoot us in the foot
more than it hurts China.

00:31:00.776 --> 00:31:01.810
- Wow, how could that be?

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.660
- Well, it could be
because China is a large

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.860
and growing economy and
it is very self sufficient

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.700
in many ways.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.137
- But they need access to our markets.

00:31:11.137 --> 00:31:13.800
- And also its sphere
of influence is growing.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.980
The United States right
now doesn't play the role

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.160
of world leadership that
we played in the past

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.740
and I think that when
we are in that position,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.170
China is going to continue
to trade with the rest

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.719
of the world, with Europe,
with Canada, with every major

00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:33.294
nation, we are going to be left out.

00:31:33.294 --> 00:31:35.937
- I don't believe that, I
just don't believe that.

00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:39.150
The rebuilding of our
economy that's happening,

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.180
in no small part because of
Trump policies on regulation--

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.900
- What do you expect
China will be able to do,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.170
because for example, one
of the things you want them

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.990
to do is to open up to us,
but that might be even more

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.170
frightening than a recession
to them because that might

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:57.700
lead to Americans being
much more in the economy,

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.010
maybe a Facebook run by Facebook
in China that really isn't

00:32:02.106 --> 00:32:03.689
censored and so on and so forth,

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:04.522
that's really scary to the Chinese.

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.280
Do you think that's really
feasible, that something

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.860
like that's gonna happen?

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.662
- I'm not sure I'm following,
I'm not sure I understand.

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:11.495
- Well, I'm saying that
if we started to have

00:32:11.495 --> 00:32:14.720
more opening to China, that
means we have, for example,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.830
perhaps a Facebook we're running in China

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.210
that's uncensored because I
think that's the kind of thing

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.500
you're asking for, real
free trade, but if you have

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.670
an uncensored Facebook in
China, the regime is not

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.450
gonna be happy with what's
gonna be on that Facebook.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.790
- Of course, I mean, look,
this is an oppressive regime.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:35.427
They're tyrants, they are not, they...

00:32:35.427 --> 00:32:38.070
Look, the leader there just made himself

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.330
the president for life, they're
not gonna have elections.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.800
- So what do you expect him to do,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.650
are there things they can do
that will satisfy Mr. Trump

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:49.253
and us and that allow us
to not impose a 30% tariff?

00:32:49.253 --> 00:32:51.000
- So he can basically say a couple things.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.030
Help with disarming North
Korea, right, how many of you

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.500
are for that, don't you want
to have North Korea not have

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.900
a nuclear bomb, I mean,
we have the leverage

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.030
to force them to do it,
maybe we do, maybe we don't,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.540
but we should try, number
two, they have to start,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.220
I mean, this is a point
that Laura Tyson was making

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.130
earlier and I think it
makes a lot of sense.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.000
We should...

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.249
Get them to buy more of our
stuff, whether it's our weed

00:33:16.249 --> 00:33:19.074
or our cotton or whether it's
our copper or our computers

00:33:19.074 --> 00:33:22.470
and actually pay us for
it and that's the kind of

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:24.760
trade deal that needs
to be made with China.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.200
- That is precisely the
question, how do we get them?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.121
- Because if they don't, then
they're gonna be severely

00:33:30.121 --> 00:33:32.630
penalized, and this is
where I disagree with you.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.650
They can't function as an economy in 2018

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.583
if they can't sell to
America's four trillion dollar

00:33:39.583 --> 00:33:41.514
consumer economy.

00:33:41.514 --> 00:33:42.920
- Well, but there are
two parts to your thesis.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.860
One is that they're gonna
be hurt more than we are

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.450
gonna be hurt and secondly
that by doing that,

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.100
the outcome is going to
be we get more leverage

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.760
and that down the road
they're going to change

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.903
their policies.
- They're gonna blink.

00:33:53.903 --> 00:33:55.378
- And they're gonna blink.
- You don't think they will.

00:33:55.378 --> 00:33:58.230
- I think it's a dangerous,
dangerous game to play

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.369
and we could end up easily worse off.

00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:03.399
Now a lot of--
- So what's the alternative?

00:34:03.399 --> 00:34:06.208
- A lot of our exports,
you know, there may be

00:34:06.208 --> 00:34:10.840
an alternative in terms of
using the rest of the world.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.452
The rest of the world has
an interest in an open

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.350
trading system.
- Sure, absolutely.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:19.310
- The rest of the world also
has an interest in rules

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.268
that everybody plays by
that are neutral rules

00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:25.900
and why can't we, I mean,
we were already making

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.680
some progress, I mean, the
WTO, I think was a very good

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.510
idea, the World Trade
Organization, and Chinese ascension

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.980
to the WTO, I thought
opened the way, if it were

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.360
correctly used.
- They don't,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.400
they violate every WTO rule.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.280
- I'm gonna end this because
I think what we need to do

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.840
is get a panel of Chinese
experts in here to say

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.800
what's the likelihood they
will blink or won't blink.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.770
Because, you folks know
a lot about economics

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:54.030
but I don't think China is
your greatest expertise.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.045
So let's go to another area
where I think you will have

00:34:57.045 --> 00:35:00.320
expertise, and that's the 2017 tax bill.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.660
You've already said, Steve,
that you think that it did

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.996
good things and simplifying
the tax code in some ways

00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:10.025
and also providing tax breaks
that will help the economy.

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.953
Bob, do you think that 2017
tax bill was a good tax bill

00:35:12.953 --> 00:35:17.470
and that it will really
actually be equitable for people

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.980
and second of all that it
will stimulate the economy?

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.813
- No.

00:35:21.716 --> 00:35:24.120
- Explain. (laughs)

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.140
- You know, number one,
I think it's exacerbating

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.710
already inequality, number
two, most of the profits,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.780
that extra profits that
corporations have got,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.410
corporations are using to buy
back their shares of stock.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:40.120
They are not using them to
invest or to increase wages

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.210
of average workers, number
three, I think that it's going

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.930
to exacerbate our deficit and
our national debt problems.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.810
Now I'm not a huge worrier
about the deficit or the debt

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.430
but generally speaking they aren't

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.654
going in the right direction

00:35:55.654 --> 00:35:58.810
and number four, politically, it sets up

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.249
the Republicans and the
Trump administration

00:36:01.249 --> 00:36:05.086
for beginning to say, well,
we can't afford you name it.

00:36:05.086 --> 00:36:09.136
Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security, it's kind of

00:36:09.136 --> 00:36:11.960
the starve the beast that we saw beginning

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.163
under the Reagan administration,
so for those four reasons

00:36:14.163 --> 00:36:19.163
I think this was a terrible
idea and to add insult to injury

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:23.095
I hear Larry Kudlow and his new boss

00:36:23.095 --> 00:36:27.139
are talking about a second
tax cut, is that right?

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:30.401
- There's some talk about
that, so let me kind of explain

00:36:30.401 --> 00:36:33.023
very briefly what we did and why we did it

00:36:33.023 --> 00:36:34.940
because I think it's kind
of important for people

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.205
to understand the thinking behind the plan

00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:41.750
and so Larry and I sat down
with Trump two years ago,

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.930
walked him through this, he
got it pretty straightforwardly

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.140
and I think, you know, you all will too.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.960
First of all, the heart
of the plan, the gemstone

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.779
of the plan was to get our
business tax rates down.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:57.180
What we've been talking
about for the last 20 minutes

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.980
is we're living in a
global economy, the genie

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.000
is out of the bottle, it's
not being stuffed back in.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.400
You all aren't gonna just be
competing here in California

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.570
against people in Tennessee
and Texas and Florida.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.540
You're gonna be competing
against people in Beijing

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.560
and Germany and France
and Spain and Australia.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.670
We've got to get competitive
and we had a tax system,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.890
frankly, Bob, when it came
to the way we were taxing

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.180
our businesses, you couldn't
have come up with anything

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.790
stupider, you know, we had
the highest statutory rate

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.730
in the world, so we were
at 40% when you count state

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.890
and local taxes and the rest
of the world, which by the way,

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.036
25 years ago was at 40%,
kept cutting and cutting

00:37:35.036 --> 00:37:36.900
and cutting and cutting and cutting.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.710
So much so that the rest of the
world was down to about 20%.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.400
We're at 40, ladies and
gentlemen, if you care about

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.834
America, you care about
American workers and American

00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:46.950
companies, and you want
us to be number one,

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.220
that doesn't work, it doesn't
work for us to be at 40,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.573
and them to be at 20, I called
this a headstart program

00:37:52.573 --> 00:37:55.420
for every country that
we're competing with.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.980
Why would we want to do that?

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.050
So we basically said to Trump,
let's get that corporate rate

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.436
down, you know, he wanted
15%, this is an area

00:38:02.436 --> 00:38:04.600
where he's a master negotiator.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.080
He stuck with 15% throughout
and that's how we got 21.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.420
If he had said 20, we would
have ended up with 25.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.250
We're right back in the game right now.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.030
All of a sudden, the reason
I think you're so wrong

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.350
about the impact of this in
just the first three months

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.910
and we're just sucking
capital now back into

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.920
the United States in a huge way, I mean,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.650
the biggest economic news
story, ladies and gentlemen

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.210
of the last three years,
was the Apple story.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:32.660
I mean, this is gigantic,
Apple is bringing 300 billion,

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.180
not 300 million, $300 billion
back to the United States

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.110
and they're gonna invest
it here, they're building

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.940
a new plant with 25,000 workers, I mean,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.060
this is a big deal, and those
are gonna be good paying jobs.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.620
Now look, some of that money
will probably be paid off

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.560
in dividends or buying up
shares of their own shares,

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.800
by the way, why does a
company buy its own shares?

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.480
Because it wants to increase
the value of the share, right?

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.610
And we have 100 million
shareholders in this country,

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.310
they're all gonna benefit from this too.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:03.010
So that's been a huge
benefit, we've already had

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.260
five million American workers,
the vast majority of them

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.580
in the middle class, who've
gotten bonuses, pay raises

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.230
and increases in benefits,
I mean, the other day

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.830
I'm walking down the
street, I was in Dallas,

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.334
this Guatemalan woman
comes up to me, she says,

00:39:16.334 --> 00:39:17.607
are you the guy on CNN
who talks about economics?

00:39:17.607 --> 00:39:19.990
She said thank you for the tax cut.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.820
I just got a $1500 bonus from my employer.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:28.230
Now to Nancy Pelosi, $1500 may be crumbs,

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.520
but you know what if you're
making $40,000 a year,

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.100
a $1500 bonus is pretty significant.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.386
So this is going to help in
my opinion, Robert Reich,

00:39:36.386 --> 00:39:39.127
middle class workers as
we get more jobs here,

00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:41.870
we get more productive,
businesses invest here,

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.580
that was the whole philosophy behind it.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.220
It was not and I'll repeat this 100 times.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.990
It was not because we wanted
rich people to make more money

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.273
but here's a statistic for
you all to think about.

00:39:51.273 --> 00:39:54.350
When you talk about the top
1%, you know, the people

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.880
who you say have all the
money, but what do those people

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.090
do for a living?

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.482
2/3 of them own, operate and
invest in small businesses

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:04.630
and you can't have jobs without employers

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.590
and that's what the whole thing was about,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.970
is getting money to the businesses

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.980
so they can invest it in America.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.970
- Bob, I'm gonna give you a
second, I just want to say

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.360
there's cards on your chairs
and if you want to write out

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.800
a question please do so, and
then there will be people

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.500
coming by to pick them up, and Bob Reich.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.086
- Well, for example.

00:40:24.086 --> 00:40:28.326
You can't have and businesses
are not going to invest

00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:33.100
without customers and one of
the biggest problems we have

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.610
and businesses face as well
is a shrinking middle class.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.020
I mean, with so much of
the income and wealth

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.178
in this country going
to the top, you know,

00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:44.700
wealthy people spend a
very small percentage of

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.188
their income and certainly their wealth--

00:40:47.188 --> 00:40:48.287
- [Steve] They're investing
it in the business.

00:40:48.287 --> 00:40:50.260
- But they're not
investing, that's the point.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.230
- They're saving, what
are they doing with it?

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.486
- Steve, you're saying
that they're buying back

00:40:54.486 --> 00:40:55.570
their shares of stock and
when you say that's great

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.290
for everybody, that's not the case.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:59.928
I mean, the top 1% of
Americans owns 40% of the total

00:40:59.928 --> 00:41:04.309
stock market, the top 10% own
80% of the total stock market.

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:06.000
- Well, where do you think
the California teachers

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.717
pension fund is invested, all
of this money is invested--

00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:13.717
- But that is the reality,
that the top 10% own 80%--

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.850
- Well, that's a terrible
thing, we should let people

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.610
put their Social Security
money in the stock market

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:19.547
so everybody owns stock.

00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:23.433
- But Steve, Steve, the
reality is, the reality is

00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:28.433
that taking all of this tax
money, these major tax cuts

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.680
and giving it to corporations
in terms of increasing

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.430
profits and then turning
around and buying back

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.720
their shares and making
the wealthy even wealthier,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.330
that does not do anything
about the underlying problem

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.699
of stagnant wages and widening inequality.

00:41:43.699 --> 00:41:48.577
Besides that, besides that,
there is kind of an underlying

00:41:48.577 --> 00:41:51.100
philosophical difference, and
you and I have been around

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.877
this, you know, we've debated
this for 15 or 20 years

00:41:53.877 --> 00:41:58.540
about whether trickle down
economics actually works.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.810
And whether there is any
empirical data to support.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.140
- Which there is.
- Trickle down economics.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.580
Which there isn't.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.660
- (laughs) I mean, we
look at the same body.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.700
I mean, the three most
prosperous periods, you know,

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.720
for the last 100 years, were
the 20s, when Calvin Coolidge

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.970
cut taxes and the 60s, when
John F. Kennedy cut taxes.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.070
Now we actually had a very
prosperous 80s and 90s period

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.813
as well when Reagan cut
taxes, you could say,

00:42:22.813 --> 00:42:25.310
I know that you all,
'cause you work, you say,

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.870
well, Clinton raised taxes but
we did all these other things

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:29.920
We did welfare reform,
we did free trade deals,

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.953
we did the capital gains tax cut, I mean,

00:42:31.953 --> 00:42:35.587
look, when you lower your
tax rates, you make America

00:42:35.587 --> 00:42:37.823
more competitive, you've
got to admit that point.

00:42:37.823 --> 00:42:40.310
I mean, countries do
compete, why do you think

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.900
all these countries all
over the world have been

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.580
cutting their corporate
tax rate for the last...

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:45.890
- Well, that's actually,
you're proving my point

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.640
because when we've cut
the corporate tax rate,

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.170
what, do you think other countries are not

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.560
gonna cut their tax rates?
- They probably will.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.520
- They're gonna do exactly what we do.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.969
That's exactly what this,
there's a race to the bottom.

00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:57.333
- But we didn't do it for 25 years,

00:42:57.333 --> 00:42:58.332
and the rest of the world

00:42:58.332 --> 00:42:59.380
so we had this massive gap,
the other thing we did,

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.040
by the way, which I think
was wildly successful was

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.280
we recognized that there was
something like three trillion

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.777
dollars that was sitting
offshore in Bermuda, in China

00:43:08.777 --> 00:43:11.810
and Ireland and all
these countries that have

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:15.010
lower tax rates than us, and
these companies like Boeing

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.760
and General Electric and
Apple and Microsoft wanted

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.370
to bring the money back but they couldn't

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.750
'cause they faced a stiff penalty.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.230
So Trump, I don't know
why Obama didn't do this.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.810
The money was just lying
there, waiting to be picked up.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:30.090
We basically said, we'll charge
you 10%, you bring it back

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.100
to the United States,
we think we're gonna get

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.597
about two trillion dollars
back, that's $200 billion

00:43:34.597 --> 00:43:36.767
for the United States
government and it's two trillion

00:43:36.767 --> 00:43:38.000
dollars that's invested here, I mean,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.833
what's wrong with that?

00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:40.786
- In 2004, we did exactly the same thing,

00:43:40.786 --> 00:43:43.460
wait a minute, under the same promise,

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.520
that it was all going to
lead to big, big investment

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.620
and it was going to generate more jobs

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.900
and higher wages and it didn't.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.975
We did the same experiment.
- We just had Apple bring

00:43:52.975 --> 00:43:55.930
$300 billion dollars back.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:58.010
I think this tax cut would
have been worth doing just

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.940
to get Apple to bring all this money back.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.200
- Let me ask you a question
that comes from something

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.050
one of the audience persons asked

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:07.230
and that's this, suppose
you're right that in fact

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.040
this is stimulating the
economy and that's great

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.670
and jobs are coming back and so forth.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.911
If it is also, however,
going to make the rich richer

00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:18.260
and the fact is the tax
bill took the top tax rate,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:23.260
39.6 and made it 37% and
therefore that's one indication--

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.671
- It's much more than
that for the wealthy.

00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:28.104
It did much more than
that for the wealthy.

00:44:28.104 --> 00:44:29.240
- Well, I'm just taking
one thing that it did

00:44:32.322 --> 00:44:33.550
that actually palpably
decreased tax rates on the rich.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:38.150
Is this the time, given what
Mr. Trump's political coalition

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:41.170
is about, for us to be
going out and making

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:45.180
the rich even richer, is
there a danger to democracy?

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.060
Maybe we'll have a great
economy but a lousy democracy

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.340
'cause we'll have a lot of
people out there who are really

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.420
ready for revolution because
they feel like they've been

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.770
so badly harmed and that
this is the new Gilded Age

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.320
with lots of rich people
who are treating them badly?

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.152
- And by the way, a lot of
those people are right here

00:45:00.152 --> 00:45:03.330
in Silicon Valley, I mean,
yeah, we do have Bill Gates

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:07.060
who has $50 billion and we
have the people running Apple

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.570
who have billions and we've
got Zuckerberg, who has $50

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:10.830
billion, so what do you want to do?

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.860
Would we be a better
country if we just deported

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.210
all those people, I mean, I
just don't get this, look.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:19.100
I think you all obsess--
- No, no, I guess I'm saying,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.550
why did we decrease the tax rate from 39--

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.093
- Because we wanted--
- To 37%.

00:45:23.093 --> 00:45:26.260
I know there's a technical
reason, but tell me,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.540
was that good politics?

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.170
- Yes, I wanted the rate
down to, look, in 1986,

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.000
to give you a sense of
how things have changed

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.680
in this country, in 1986,
Ronald Reagan had a bill

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.316
with Bill Bradley and
Dick Gebphard, Sam Nunn,

00:45:38.316 --> 00:45:41.960
many Democrats and we
basically lowered the tax rates

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.040
and broadened, you know,
lowered the rates, broadened

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.890
the base and that bill that
lowered the highest income tax

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.500
rate, none of you are gonna
believe this, but you'll have

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.580
to look it up, we got the
lowest tax rate down to 28%

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.680
and that bill passed 97
to three in the Senate.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.230
Now we couldn't even get a single--

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.442
- Wait a minute.

00:45:58.442 --> 00:45:59.880
- We couldn't get one
Democrat in the entire Senate

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.563
to vote for a 37% tax rate.

00:46:02.563 --> 00:46:04.200
- Bob.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.788
- I thought that that '86
bill was a very good bill.

00:46:06.788 --> 00:46:07.621
- Me too.

00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:09.770
- And it also leveled
the playing field between

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.137
capital gains and ordinary
income and that was one of

00:46:12.137 --> 00:46:14.402
the most important aspects of that bill.

00:46:14.402 --> 00:46:19.402
But you know, I'm reminded
here, Steve, of something else

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.492
that we have debated almost
steadily for the past 30 years

00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:29.492
and that is the issue of
economic growth and what really

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.921
stimulates economic growth,
I mean, in the 1950s,

00:46:36.921 --> 00:46:40.940
the highest marginal income tax was 91%

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.410
and the effective rate
was 52% on individuals

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:47.350
and we were growing faster
at an annual rate than we've

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.218
ever grown before or since.

00:46:49.218 --> 00:46:52.550
You refer to the golden age of the 1920s.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.053
I don't want to live in
the 1920s even if I could.

00:46:55.053 --> 00:46:59.300
The 1920s was a period of extraordinary--

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.510
- Wealth creation.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.522
- Wealth creation, inequality.

00:47:02.522 --> 00:47:03.786
- Yeah, the country got
rich, why do they think

00:47:03.786 --> 00:47:04.991
they call it the Roaring 20s?

00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:06.296
I mean--
- But it was also

00:47:06.296 --> 00:47:07.840
extraordinary inequality and corruption

00:47:08.781 --> 00:47:10.190
and it was kind of a period
of time that led ultimately

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:13.070
to the great crash and
the Great Depression.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.382
Do you see any...

00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:20.343
Consequence between, in
1928 and 2007, the top 1%

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.486
in both those years, 1928 and
2007, had the highest share

00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:30.840
of total national income
and we know what happened

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.240
in the year after 2007 and 1928.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.060
Do you think there was any--

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.862
- I mean, it is true, who are
these people in the top .001%?

00:47:42.862 --> 00:47:46.895
They're people, look, you could
take Bill Gates, Zuckerberg,

00:47:46.895 --> 00:47:51.895
who's the Amazon CEO, you
know, those five have...

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.530
More money than most of
the countries in the world

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.810
for goodness's sake so
what do you want to do,

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.950
confiscate, take their
wealth away from them?

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.770
Look, here's my problem with
the way you see the world

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.190
versus the way I see it, I
want everybody to get rich,

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.824
right, I don't care, I
want more millionaires

00:48:07.824 --> 00:48:09.796
and billionaires in this country.

00:48:09.796 --> 00:48:10.629
I want everybody to get rich.

00:48:10.629 --> 00:48:14.010
We truly want to create
a rising tide that lifts

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.011
all boats, I keep hearing you saying,

00:48:17.011 --> 00:48:19.250
there's too many rich people,
no, there's not enough

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:20.940
rich people in this country,
we need more and more and more

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.820
people to get rich.
- I'd never say

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.225
there's too many rich people.
- But the point is--

00:48:24.225 --> 00:48:27.073
- I'm not rich enough and
you're not rich enough.

00:48:27.073 --> 00:48:28.820
- What Lapper would say to you is look,

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:33.300
a good economic system tries
to make poor people rich.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.390
It doesn't try to make rich people poor,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.940
and that's where you and I disagree.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.070
You keep focusing on
these people at the top.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.674
All these people in
the middle, number one,

00:48:41.674 --> 00:48:44.900
these people are people
who created incredible

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.190
technologies, I mean, what
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:50.160
and Amazon have done have
been amazing, I mean,

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.108
they hire, I'm friends
with Fred Smith of FedEx.

00:48:53.108 --> 00:48:57.310
He's a billionaire, he
puts 100,000 people in jobs

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:58.860
and those are good paying jobs.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:02.310
- But Steve, I think what you are...

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.470
Maybe not hearing what I've
said for the last 30 years

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.668
that we've been debating.

00:49:06.668 --> 00:49:08.112
(audience laughs)

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.547
- It just hasn't come in.

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:11.750
- Is that you need a demand
side, that is you need

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.028
a middle class.
- We do,

00:49:13.028 --> 00:49:15.116
we are in complete agreement.
- A large, buoyant,

00:49:15.116 --> 00:49:15.949
and growing middle class.
- Yes.

00:49:15.949 --> 00:49:19.400
- And so I'm not saying
that it's all about

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.210
redistributing from the
wealthy to the poor.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:26.120
I'm saying that what you
need is a set of rules that

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:31.120
actually makes your middle
class larger and steadily larger

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:35.223
and more prosperous and that
includes public investment.

00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:38.350
- But I'm not hearing from
people like you, how to do that.

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.587
- Well, I was just about to tell you.

00:49:40.587 --> 00:49:43.620
That includes public investment
in really good schools

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:48.620
and job training and
infrastructure and public health

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.685
and individual health as
well, healthcare is part

00:49:51.685 --> 00:49:54.830
of a productive system, you
want to make sure people

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.060
are healthy because if
they're not healthy,

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.760
they can't be productive,
so for all of those reasons,

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.060
public investment is really critical.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.610
You can't have adequate
public investment in all those

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.600
areas unless you have sources
of revenue and where is

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.840
the big source of revenue,
well, the big source

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.360
of revenue is gonna be
either corporations.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.210
Now you just said you don't
want to go after them.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.640
Or it's gonna be very
wealthy people who now have

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.570
a huge portion of the total
income and the total wealth.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.310
- So I think you're missing
here, look, we both agree

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:30.310
we want a burgeoning and
upward moving middle class.

00:50:30.513 --> 00:50:33.800
You talk about investment in this country.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.060
The word that I disagree
with is public investment.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.360
What our goal is with this tax
cut and we're already seeing

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:43.300
very positive results in
this regard is what we call

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.270
cap ex, the capital
investment that's happening

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.290
by businesses in this
country, and guess what?

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.010
In just four, you know, the
four months since the tax bill

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.820
has passed, we have more than
doubled the capital investment

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.970
rate than we have under Obama.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:58.380
One of the reasons the
Obama, you know, recovery

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.809
was so flimsy and flat
and anemic was businesses

00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:03.430
weren't investing and
now they are investing

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.940
and there's a very direct
relationship between

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:08.720
the amount of money
that businesses invest,

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.540
when businesses invest more in capital,

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.150
whether it's equipment or
machinery or computers,

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.460
then workers are more
productive on the job,

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.380
when workers are more
productive, right, Bob,

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.010
they can be paid more,
that's the reason why

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:22.850
an American worker's paid
more than a Mexican worker.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.920
They're more productive,
so our whole thing,

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.950
I mean, if Larry Kudlow were
here right now, what he'd say

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:30.126
to you is cutting the
corporate tax is a middle class

00:51:30.126 --> 00:51:33.220
tax cut 'cause those are
the people who will benefit.

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.720
The studies show about 60%
of the benefit from cutting

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.670
the corporate tax rate,
the benefits go not to the

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.170
shareholders but to the
workers who have more capital

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.003
to work with.

00:51:43.003 --> 00:51:44.200
- Well, you better tell
that to some workers

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.211
because they haven't seen any benefit yet.

00:51:46.211 --> 00:51:47.211
- Well, it's only been four months.

00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:49.740
- But every time Republicans are in,

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.020
there is a big corporate tax cut.

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.240
There was a big corporate tax cut in 2004

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.100
and there was a big corporate
tax cut under Reagan.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.750
- And workers did well in the 80s and 90s.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.200
I mean, why do you think, I mean, boy,

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.130
it must not have worked
very well because gee,

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:05.000
we cut the taxes in 1981 and
Reagan just squeaked through

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.270
with reelection, winning
49 of 50 states, you know.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.386
I mean, I think the middle
class was doing pretty well

00:52:10.386 --> 00:52:11.378
back then.

00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:12.384
- Steve, I've got a question for you.

00:52:12.384 --> 00:52:14.650
When we sit down with Donald
Trump, and you've referred

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.087
to that several times,
you sit down with him

00:52:16.087 --> 00:52:20.733
and you brief him, how does he respond

00:52:20.733 --> 00:52:22.867
to facts, logic and argument?

00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:24.788
(audience laughs)

00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:28.810
No, I'm serious, I mean, I
have not had the experience

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.137
of sitting down and briefing him.

00:52:30.137 --> 00:52:33.050
Now that Larry Kudlow is
there, I expect I will

00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:34.210
have many more opportunities.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:38.670
- Donald Trump is an
extremely intelligent person.

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:41.700
I mean, he really is, he is
an extremely intelligent,

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.922
you couldn't pull off what he
did, I mean, he pulled off,

00:52:43.922 --> 00:52:47.740
whether you love him or
hate him, what happened

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.220
in November of 2016 was
the biggest political upset

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.270
in American history, bar
none, no other is even close

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.930
to that, and when he started
running for president

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.090
in, you know, June of
2015, he was laughed at

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.920
and this guy, television
talk show guy, I mean,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.510
he can't possibly win and
so on, and he went out

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.760
and built this campaign,
he has a sixth sense about

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.590
what the American people
want, and you can call that

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:13.028
demagoguery, but he sure
tapped into something out there

00:53:13.028 --> 00:53:16.160
that nobody else saw, I think
he's got the right vision

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.000
and his vision is very simple.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.110
It is to put America first
and that's something frankly

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.010
Obama didn't do, we had these
crazy climate change deals

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.610
and all these, the Iran
deal, all these things.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:31.520
No, everything Trump is going
to do is gonna make sure

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.090
that it's America's national
and economic interests,

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:36.904
not in the interest of
these other countries.

00:53:36.904 --> 00:53:40.680
- But isn't that a view of the
world that is a zero sum game

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.450
- No, no it isn't.
- In which either we

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.110
as Americans win or they win.
- No, no, no, no.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:47.784
- When in fact, the entire
post war prosperity worldwide

00:53:47.784 --> 00:53:50.933
has been a positive sum game,
we look for opportunities

00:53:50.933 --> 00:53:51.933
for everybody to win.

00:53:51.933 --> 00:53:53.140
- That is a great point,
I want to address that.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.496
No, the Reagan doctrine is very simple.

00:53:55.496 --> 00:53:58.220
The United States of America,
and my friend Steve Hayward

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.980
is here, he's written
three great biographies

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.050
on Ronald Reagan, the Reagan
doctrine was very simple.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.040
When you are strong at
home, you're strong abroad.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.250
When you're weak at
home, you're weak abroad.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:09.740
Why is it, you know, look at what happened

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.200
in the Carter years
when we had Soviet tanks

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.450
in Afghanistan and Nicaragua,
we had the hostage crisis,

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.520
we were weak at home,
and we were weak abroad.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.230
Trump is gonna rebuild
the American economy,

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.870
at least that's what we're trying to do,

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:26.540
so we're the alpha male
in the global economy

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:28.619
and when we get it right
in the United States,

00:54:28.619 --> 00:54:30.630
the rest of the world will get it right,

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:32.137
I really believe that.

00:54:32.137 --> 00:54:34.216
- But being the alpha
male in the global economy

00:54:34.216 --> 00:54:37.570
may be a dangerous thing to do.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.630
That is, the alpha males
of the world may not

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:44.720
actually be the model for
the future of leadership

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.553
in the world.

00:54:45.553 --> 00:54:48.120
- That's the point, we're gonna
show countries how to do it.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.540
You cut your tax rates, you
have stable money, you know,

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:55.100
you have a light touch with
regulation, these kinds

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.210
of things are what, I
mean, look, economic growth

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:00.212
is not complicated and Trump
is focused like a laser beam

00:55:00.212 --> 00:55:03.150
on the stock market and
economic growth and I think

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:04.470
that's what he should be focused on.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.420
- But at the same time, it's
conceivable that because

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:08.530
of the tax cut, he's going
to have to cut Medicaid,

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.973
Medicare, maybe even Social Security.

00:55:11.973 --> 00:55:14.800
Do you think that's a good idea in a time

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.430
when we have lots of
people who are worried

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:19.310
about income inequality and
who feel like they're not

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.530
moving forward and we're
going to take those kinds

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.610
of benefits away from
them, is this the time

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.443
to be doing that?

00:55:24.443 --> 00:55:26.730
- Trump was very clearly, I
mean, drove liberals crazy.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:29.010
I was on the campaign,
Trump said, day one,

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.670
we're not cutting Social
Security, we're not cutting

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.720
Medicare, now it's the
conservatives who don't like--

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.420
- [Henry] He said
Medicaid too, by the way.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.660
- He said Medicaid, okay, well.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.176
- I'm not sure he knew the
difference, but the point is,

00:55:37.176 --> 00:55:38.009
he did say Medicaid.

00:55:38.009 --> 00:55:39.980
- Okay, well, maybe not,
but when it comes to

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.700
Social Security and Medicare,
which are extremely popular,

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.150
look, I would reform those
programs if I were president

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:47.290
but I'm not the president,
he's made it very clear.

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:48.980
We're not cutting Social
Security and Medicare

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.360
and look, the fact is, you
know, everybody in this room

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.650
knows we're gonna have to make
reforms on those programs,

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.890
right, I mean, we're all
adults, we know if you look

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.920
at the demographic situation,
there's 10,000 Baby Boomers

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.290
retiring every year, we've
got these massive unfunded

00:56:02.290 --> 00:56:04.427
liabilities, we got to
do something about it.

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:07.050
I mean, I'm in favor of
things like gradually raising

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:08.767
the retirement age, I
don't know if you are.

00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:11.250
You know, some changes
in the benefit structures

00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:13.595
that might lower the benefits
for the highest income

00:56:13.595 --> 00:56:16.260
people, that kind of
thing, does Warren Buffet

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.180
really need Medicare, I
mean, those are the kinds

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.670
of questions we need to
ask, but for the time being,

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:23.094
Trump has said, no, I'm not
gonna cut those programs.

00:56:23.094 --> 00:56:25.030
So I don't think it's gonna happen.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:26.501
But he did say--

00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:28.052
- He did say Medicaid.

00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:31.501
- But Obamacare and Medicaid
are intertwined now,

00:56:31.501 --> 00:56:33.172
they're one and the same
program essentially.

00:56:33.172 --> 00:56:35.150
- No, no, they're really quite distinct.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:36.933
One is run through the
states, one is run directly

00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:38.740
through Washington.
- No, what Obamacare

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.600
really was was just a
vast expansion of Medicaid

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.627
and we're now paying 90% of the--

00:56:43.627 --> 00:56:46.340
- That's true too, yeah, but
he also said he would retain

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:47.970
Medicaid, but again, he may not have--

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:49.592
- Okay, so he missed--
- And it's hard to get

00:56:49.592 --> 00:56:51.013
those differences.

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.670
Bob, how would a universal basic wage be

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.160
economically feasible?

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.700
- Universal basic income would be feasible

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.350
if it's a subsistence wage.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:08.350
And in fact, some of the
places that have experimented

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:13.270
with it have used a lot
of the public assistance

00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.032
that is out there and
basically said, this is

00:57:17.032 --> 00:57:19.690
going to be a substitute
for a lot of individual

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.350
programmatic public assistance.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.630
We're just going to make
sure that everybody has

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:27.030
a subsistence level, you can
design it in a variety of ways,

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:31.200
Henry, and Switzerland just had a,

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.982
well, about 38%, I think,
of the Swiss voted in favor

00:57:35.982 --> 00:57:38.057
of this, which surprised
people because there was

00:57:38.057 --> 00:57:40.640
very little preparation for it.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.510
I don't think there's any way of avoiding

00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:46.020
a universal basic income and
by the way, this is something

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.290
that Richard Nixon was in
favor of, as you remember.

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:52.200
- Initially, yes.
- As you remember.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.430
- Yes.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:55.880
- So I think that it's
something that we will see

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.390
a lot of agreement on in the future.

00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:59.870
- Is a universal basic income a good idea,

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:02.070
or should we strive
instead to try to find ways

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:05.300
to make sure there are
jobs for everybody, perhaps

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.830
even a government guaranteed job?

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:08.150
- I think we need to do both.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.862
I think we can do a lot with
government guaranteed jobs,

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:14.020
but as we were just talking
about, it's not so much

00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.281
the number of jobs that
we need to worry about,

00:58:16.281 --> 00:58:21.220
it's the quality of those jobs,
and I am very very concerned

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.534
that as automation,
artificial intelligence,

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:28.620
continue to make progress, quote unquote,

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.390
we're going to see a lot
of people thrown into

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:35.230
what might be called the
personal service economy

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.820
in which they're doing
retail, restaurant, hotel,

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.390
hospital, surface transportation,
childcare, elder care,

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:44.450
there'll be a lot of jobs,
but these jobs don't pay much.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:47.445
And now Steve is right, there
could be some additional jobs

00:58:47.445 --> 00:58:51.950
in technician or technical
areas but Steve, you're not

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:55.580
talking about a large
number of people here.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:00.580
Sufficient to sop up all of
the people who will be...

00:59:00.986 --> 00:59:04.053
Facing lower wages, that's really it.

00:59:05.173 --> 00:59:07.820
- To Steve, suppose and maybe
you don't want to get into

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.090
this kind of conjecture, but
I think it's worth asking it,

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:12.860
suppose it turns out that
there are a lot of jobs

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:14.950
that get lost because
of automation, robotics

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.960
and so forth, what are we
going to do in this society?

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.668
Are you for a universal basic income,

00:59:19.668 --> 00:59:21.930
how 'bout a government guaranteed job,

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:23.630
I mean, shouldn't we be thinking at least

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.090
about some of these things?

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:27.640
- So it really is the issue
of our time, it really is.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:32.510
This is the big one, when so
many of the millions of jobs

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.750
that exist today aren't
gonna exist 10, 15 years ago,

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:39.010
and you know, this is the digital age

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:41.560
and it's an incredibly
exciting thing, by the way,

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.760
we shouldn't be nervous about this.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.783
I mean, my God, for those
of you in your 20s, I mean,

00:59:45.783 --> 00:59:48.120
I'd give anything to be in my 20s today.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.010
You are gonna see the most
amazing transformations.

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:53.730
This is where I think
Bob is so wrong saying

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:56.200
middle class is worse off
today than 40, 50 years ago.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.650
I mean, how can you possibly say that?

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.845
Look at all the things that
middle class people have today

01:00:00.845 --> 01:00:04.900
versus what people had, you
know, go to a middle class home,

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.030
40 or 50 years ago, and
see what they have today.

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:10.130
I mean, the affluence of America
is really an amazing thing

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:12.420
and they will be better
off 20, 30 years from now

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.492
than they are today.

01:00:13.492 --> 01:00:14.490
- There's one thing that
you've said that I completely

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.640
agree with, when you said
that you would like to be

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:22.300
20 years old again, I
would too, I would too.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.213
I would like that as well.
- Let me ask you a question.

01:00:25.197 --> 01:00:27.278
- So when it comes to
this issue of universal

01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:32.030
basic income, you know,
I'm open minded to it.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.970
I mean, it would depend,
because people are gonna be

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:38.090
so much richer 20, 30 years
ago than they are today

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:41.299
so we will probably be
able to afford to have that

01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:44.070
so that everybody has
healthcare, everybody has

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.370
a good education, everybody
has a minimal income

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:49.963
that they can get by on, but
here is my worry about it,

01:00:49.963 --> 01:00:53.040
Bob, here's, because we will
have enough money for that.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.560
The most important thing that
happiness is tied to work.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.640
There's just no question
about it, and this idea

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.570
of just giving people stuff,
I do worry that it has

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:05.190
a negative work incentive
effect and people are not

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:10.190
gonna work and the best thing,
work is where you get dignity

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:13.380
and purpose in your life
and I worry that we're gonna

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.043
incentivize people not to
work rather than to have

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:17.700
a fulfilling life.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.960
- But then who's gonna provide
the jobs, is the question?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.640
- Well, that's a good question.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.060
- If it were government, would
you feel distressed by that?

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:26.602
- Nobody knows, I mean, if
I had told you 10 years ago,

01:01:26.602 --> 01:01:30.020
just to give you a sense of
how these technological changes

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.537
are changing society, if I had
told everybody in this room

01:01:33.537 --> 01:01:36.340
10, 12 years ago, the
United States was gonna have

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.010
the biggest oil and gas boom
in the history of our country,

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.650
there's nobody who would
have believed that,

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.650
even people in the energy
industry didn't think

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.404
it would happen and arguably
the most important invention

01:01:46.404 --> 01:01:49.740
of the last 10, 12 years in
terms of the American economy

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.620
has been fracking and horizontal drilling.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.790
It's completely, we went
from a country where people

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.510
were worried about whether
we're not gonna have

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.671
enough oil and gas, now we've got it,

01:01:57.671 --> 01:02:00.110
in five years we'll be
producing more of this stuff

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:02.176
than any other country, my
point is, that technology

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:05.680
came along, nobody predicted
it, nobody predicted

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.430
the internet except Al Gore. (laughs)

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.360
I mean, all these things, so we don't know

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.720
what the future holds, we
don't, we just have to trust

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.650
that we'll get this right.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:17.834
- Steve, you raise an issue
that I want to get your

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.460
very explicit read on
and that is, do you think

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.803
climate change is a problem?

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:27.220
- I think that if it is a problem,

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.800
it's not going to be solved
by these government edicts

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.070
like cap and, you know,
this idiotic Paris Accord

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.680
where China and India keep
polluting, polluting, polluting.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.950
It's gonna be solved by technology, right?

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:40.853
Technological change and that's
why we have to get richer

01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:42.830
because if we get richer, we'll be able

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:44.174
to solve this problem.

01:02:44.174 --> 01:02:46.880
- Would a carbon tax be
helpful in terms of stimulating

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.050
technological change?
- So that's an interesting

01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:50.660
question, so maybe you
and I could sit down

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.630
and maybe we could get Laura
Tyson and some of the other

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:55.520
good economists in this
room and we might be able

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.310
to come up with a deal
here, I've always thought

01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.280
there was a deal to be made.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.711
- But George Schulz and other
- No, I don't like his--

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:01.583
- You don't like his plan.

01:03:03.457 --> 01:03:05.390
- No, you know, let's
say we have a carbon tax

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.760
and we eliminate the corporate
tax or something like that

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.699
so we're putting a smaller
tax on capital, right,

01:03:11.699 --> 01:03:14.810
and a higher tax on energy.

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:16.820
I could live with that, I
mean, look, there's a deal

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.300
to be made here, for those
of you who really believe

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.630
that climate change is the
greatest catastrophe ever

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:23.669
to hit the earth, then
let's make a deal, you know,

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:26.880
let's make a deal, but the
deals that are being put out

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.599
by liberals, they say, we
want this big carbon tax,

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:32.322
and by the way, we want
to spend all the money on

01:03:32.322 --> 01:03:35.880
wind energy and talk
about corporate welfare.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.050
We're gonna give it to all
our friends who make wind

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:40.395
and solar and things like
that, no, the deal has to be,

01:03:40.395 --> 01:03:44.250
we give you a carbon tax
and we get lower taxes

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.010
on capital so we have more investment

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:50.140
and when you all are ready
to sit down at the table,

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.440
I do think there's a deal
to be struck on that.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.150
You wanna shake on that one?

01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:57.720
- Yeah, I'm ready to shake
any time and you tell...

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.992
The president that I'm ready.

01:04:00.992 --> 01:04:01.980
- I mean, I think the
president would be open

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.555
to a deal, but not, I mean,
what Schulz wanted to do

01:04:04.555 --> 01:04:07.840
is basically combine
two bad ideas into one,

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.420
which is just give people
a check, right, everybody

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.614
would just have a check,
and you have a carbon tax

01:04:13.614 --> 01:04:15.060
and those are two bad ideas.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.870
- But Alaska has a deal
something like that, doesn't it?

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:22.210
- Yeah, they do, they have
what they call the dividend

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:24.910
from all their energy
production and so they pass out,

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.229
you know, if anybody wants to
get rich, you move to Alaska

01:04:27.229 --> 01:04:29.980
and you get, like, every
year, you get a $5000 check

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.110
from the government from the royalties,

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.290
but that's a different--

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.670
- But that's a similar
principle, isn't it?

01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:36.793
- No, well.

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.710
I'm not so sure it is because
they're actually getting

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.010
a check for producing more things.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:44.390
You're talking about--

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:49.390
- No, no, no, but here's a
check coming from the government

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:50.303
that is related--

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.580
- Well, I'm not necessarily
in favor of the dividend.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:54.380
I'm just saying it does,
that's the way the people

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.170
of Alaska have decided to
do, but they don't have

01:04:58.170 --> 01:04:59.850
an income tax in Alaska, so they can't cut

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:02.350
their income tax, they
have so much money from oil

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:05.367
that that's what they've
decided to do with the money.

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:09.398
- Okay, so I'm gonna ask each
of you very briefly to answer

01:05:09.398 --> 01:05:13.440
this question, which is,
so you've debated for

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.770
many, many years, so can you name--

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.366
- [Steve] Do we like each other, no.

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:19.810
- Okay, I'm gonna ask
you two questions, first.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.490
What have you learned from the other

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:24.820
and what do you admire about the other?

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.750
Starting with Bob.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.220
- Okay, I have learned from you, Steve,

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.704
that it is possible to stick to your guns

01:05:31.704 --> 01:05:34.618
in the face of evidence to the contrary.

01:05:34.618 --> 01:05:36.110
(audience laughs)

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.143
- Ouch, ooh, ow.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:40.950
- No, no, I think there's
something admirable about that

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:45.900
consistency, I've also
learned from you that

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:50.900
it is possible to be
loyal to somebody who...

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:55.560
Is now president, who
shows absolutely no sign

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.850
of intelligence, but,
but, but you, I think

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:02.990
there's some admirable
quality to actually giving him

01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:07.240
the benefit of the doubt
up to a limited point.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.420
I think you've gone beyond that limit,

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.816
but more seriously, let me
just say more seriously.

01:06:12.816 --> 01:06:16.370
I have enjoyed debating
Steve for many years

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:21.240
and even though we don't
see eye to eye on anything,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.073
I like you.

01:06:24.424 --> 01:06:27.261
I don't respect you, but I like you.

01:06:27.261 --> 01:06:28.830
(audience laughs)

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.663
So...

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.163
- Steve--
- On Donald Trump,

01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:34.379
I mean, I'll just say one
thing about Donald Trump.

01:06:34.379 --> 01:06:36.147
You know, I think, I read this
in the Wall Street Journal

01:06:36.147 --> 01:06:38.319
today, I think it summarizes everything.

01:06:38.319 --> 01:06:40.560
Donald Trump is the worst president ever

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.340
except if you look at his results

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.890
and the results so far have been amazing.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.680
I mean, what's happening
in this country right now,

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:50.390
the economic revival is
beyond even what I thought

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:52.067
and so the guy is producing results.

01:06:52.067 --> 01:06:55.110
The truth is, we don't
have to have this debate

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.570
week after week about whether
the tax cuts are gonna work,

01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.800
right, because the tax cuts are in effect.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.800
We'll just have to see
what happens now, you know?

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.820
I'm kind of tired of debating about it.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.286
Let's see what happens, this
is an experiment, right,

01:07:06.286 --> 01:07:09.520
and you're gonna buy me the
most expensive dinner here

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.410
in Berkeley if we
continue to have 3% growth

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:14.360
for the next three years,
which I think we are,

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.318
and I'll buy you--

01:07:16.318 --> 01:07:17.151
- I thought the prediction was 4%.

01:07:17.151 --> 01:07:19.680
- Well, I think we can
get, 3.5, 4% possibly,

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.130
you know, I really do,
if we can continue to do

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:24.150
the right things when it
comes to these tax policies.

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.993
Now look, Robert Reich
is an honest liberal.

01:07:26.993 --> 01:07:29.170
- 3.5%, I will treat you to dinner.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.027
- Okay, well, but we're
gonna get it this year.

01:07:31.027 --> 01:07:33.810
- But if we get under 3%,
you treat me to dinner.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.910
- Okay, you got it, and so look.

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:37.810
I think Robert Reich is an honest liberal

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:39.200
and I don't think there
are enough of them.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:44.020
I think you genuinely, my
view of liberals in Washington

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.020
is what they care about
is power, you know,

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.350
that's truly, now you can
say that's cynical, I think

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.360
they like power and that's why they want

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.620
the government controlling things.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:56.620
I think you have a genuine
regard for middle class Americans

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.743
and I do too and we just see
the world in a different way

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.690
but I do admire that about you.

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.163
- Let me ask one final
question that I'd like you

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.310
to give a comment on because
I think it's a question

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:07.740
that comes from the heart
of people here in Berkeley,

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.691
which is that we're concerned
about the future of democracy.

01:08:11.691 --> 01:08:15.170
We think that, many of us, that
Donald Trump has done things

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:18.928
that really have reduced our...

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:22.294
Our belief that the rule of
law is what's going to prevail

01:08:22.294 --> 01:08:24.797
and so there's a concern about that.

01:08:24.797 --> 01:08:27.920
There's a concern that
in his race baiting,

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.790
and I really don't know
how else to describe it,

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.580
I think that's really
a factual description

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.852
of what he's done, that
he's going to lead to

01:08:33.852 --> 01:08:38.428
a lot of people feeling hurt
and maybe engage in unrest

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:43.428
and in fact, reasonably be
really upset about what's

01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:46.640
going on in this country and
so that he's really caused

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.020
a lot of underrepresented
minorities and other certain

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.800
groups to feel like he's
really not their president.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.924
Now it is true that maybe white Americans

01:08:54.924 --> 01:08:59.250
in the states you talked about
think he is their president

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:02.900
but is division a good idea
right now, is that something

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.220
that conservatives, especially
Burkean conservatives,

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.220
you're a libertarian
conservative, but a Burkean

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.600
conservative, would a
Burkean conservative think

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.810
that's a good idea at this time?

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.010
Wouldn't a Burkean
conservative worry about

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:17.230
the integrity of government?

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:20.290
- I don't defend a lot of the
things that Donald Trump says

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:22.771
and a lot of times I just roll
my eyes and I can't believe

01:09:22.771 --> 01:09:25.920
he says some of the things
he says, but I will say this,

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.780
that when liberals call
conservatives racist, homophobes,

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:35.094
Islamophobes, you know, terms like that,

01:09:35.094 --> 01:09:38.340
every time that was
said about Donald Trump,

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.123
his vote margin went up
because people are tired of it.

01:09:41.123 --> 01:09:43.970
I mean, let's have a
debate about gay marriage.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.410
Let's have the debate
about climate change.

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.670
Let's have the debate about
our policy with respect

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:53.290
to Muslims, but to just basically
name call people and say,

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.540
oh, you must be a racist if
you support, well, I mean,

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.080
the other day I was on a
show and I said I support

01:10:00.272 --> 01:10:01.272
welfare reform and this
person said I'm a racist.

01:10:01.272 --> 01:10:03.940
Really, what is this?

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:06.110
I'm a racist because I
support welfare reform.

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:09.410
I think you all as left of
center people have to think

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.870
about whether that's
productive in the debate.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:14.935
- Well, let me just say,
I think it is unproductive

01:10:14.935 --> 01:10:19.935
to use labels, whatever
the labels are, including--

01:10:20.447 --> 01:10:22.320
- [Steve] But you already did
tonight, you said you thought

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.363
Trump was a racist.

01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:26.327
- I said that.

01:10:27.714 --> 01:10:30.316
- No, no, Henry can be
blamed, but I can't be blamed.

01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:32.161
- (laughs) Okay.

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:34.120
- No, I try, seriously, I
don't think it's helpful

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.010
to use labels, whether
it's phrases, but even

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:38.300
left and right and
liberal and conservative

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.150
because it means less
and less and as I started

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:46.500
to talk about before, I
think that's Donald Trump.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.940
- Sorry about that, I'm a technophobe.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.390
- Actually, I'll talk to him.

01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:53.585
- I'm almost done, all right, sorry.

01:10:53.585 --> 01:10:55.766
(audience laughs)

01:10:55.766 --> 01:11:00.547
- But I do think it is
important to investigate,

01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:05.220
keep our ears absolutely
open to different views.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:09.240
One thing I tell my students
all the time is that the only

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.310
way really to learn is to talk with people

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:15.885
who disagree with you.
- I would totally agree

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:16.887
with that.

01:11:16.887 --> 01:11:18.464
- Because that is a way to test your views

01:11:18.464 --> 01:11:21.860
and test the facts and test your analyses

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:23.470
and I worry very much, Steve,

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:28.470
and this really I think goes
to the fundamental issue here.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.250
I worry that in this country
we're not really talking

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.402
to people who disagree with us, I mean.

01:11:34.402 --> 01:11:37.570
Berkeley is a cocoon and
Washington, conservative

01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:38.810
Washington is a cocoon.

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:43.448
- Well, so are university
campuses cocoons too often.

01:11:43.448 --> 01:11:47.750
- Too often they are, absolutely,
and you know, years ago

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.760
I lived in a cocoon called
Cambridge, Massachusetts

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.890
and I decided to go 3000 miles to Berkeley

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.970
and I didn't realize at the
time that it was the same place.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:59.650
(audience laughs)

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.600
Except the weather is much better here.

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:08.010
But I am open to your ideas for how...

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.244
People of different points of view.

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:11.077
- Well, that's why I
debate you for 20 years

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:12.960
because I figure at the end of the day,

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.167
you're gonna come around
to my way of thinking.

01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.820
(audience laughs)

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.094
- So I want to thank you both.

01:12:20.094 --> 01:12:24.750
I personally feel like I've
learned more about tariffs

01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:27.752
and about, I'm serious about tariffs,

01:12:27.752 --> 01:12:30.300
that I've learned more about the thinking

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.360
that's going on with respect
to the Trump administration

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.190
and tariffs, I now have
questions about what China's

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.357
reaction is gonna be to a 30% tariff

01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:39.190
and I think those are
questions that should be

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.380
looked at very, very carefully.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.959
I've learned about what the
rationale is for the tax cut

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:48.790
and some of the issues
that surround that and then

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:50.610
the future of jobs, I
thought we had a really good

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:53.870
discussion about the concerns
that many people have

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.130
that jobs might not be as
prevalent in the future

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:57.540
and what do we do about that

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.990
and some very interesting ideas about

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:00.290
how to think about that.

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.290
I really want to thank
Stephen Moore for coming this

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:05.610
distance and being with
us and I think it was

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:08.140
an incredibly productive conversation.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.860
- Thank you all for being
so kind and generous

01:13:12.027 --> 01:13:13.867
with your time, thank you.

01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:15.202
(audience applauds)

01:13:15.202 --> 01:13:17.785
(gentle music)
