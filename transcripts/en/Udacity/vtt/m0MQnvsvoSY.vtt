00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.996
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The y intercept would be positive 1, so it would be here. Then, the slope is

00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:10.108
negative 3 4ths, so I move down 3 units and right 4 units. So I'd wind up here.

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:14.850
I could have also gone up three units and then left four units, which would put

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.857
me at this point here. So I know my line should go through these three points.
