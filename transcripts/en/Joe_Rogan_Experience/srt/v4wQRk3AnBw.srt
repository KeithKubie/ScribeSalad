1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello sweet bitches.
We're back. That's right.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,540
[inaudible] this episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,100
by ting. And what Ting is, is a
no bullshit cell phone company.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,220
They have the same service
that you'd get of you sprint,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,090
but they have it set up where they have
no early contract termination fees,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,410
no contracts at all, in fact, no early
termination fees. And they also have a,

7
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,450
an early termination fee relief program.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,670
So if you come to Tang
from somewhere else,

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:34,671
they will give you credit for 25% of
your early termination fee up to $75 per

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:38,830
device device. This is the thing that
cell phones companies are doing. They're,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,190
they're selling you a cell
phone for like 200 bucks,

12
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,350
but they're not really selling
you a cell phone for 200 bucks.

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,210
They're selling you it
for what it really costs,

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,830
but they have that money factored in to
month by month bills so that when you

15
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,030
try to cancel your service, they say,
well, you owe us x amount of dollars.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,270
And what that is is because you're really
not paying 200 bucks for your phone,

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,360
you're getting fucked. It's
weird. It's kind of deceptive.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,540
It's sneaky shit tings trying to avoid
that and they have every step of the way

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
done an awesome job of doing that.
They,

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,290
they charge you for what you
use. Only minutes, text data.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,920
There's no overages, there's
no nothing, no add on charges.

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,690
And they have the best android devices
that you can buy if you want to buy HTC

23
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,900
one, if you want to buy the HTC
one, I think it's called the mega.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,800
They're awesome one or what I have
with the Samsung Galaxy note three.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,570
You got that too. Now you're
sexy bitch. So does Doug, Darren.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,160
It's also fuck yeah bitches. It is
really an awesome cell phone company.

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,900
And again,
they use the sprint backbone.

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,290
So all the bullshit that you would have
to deal with if it was a small company,

29
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,420
you know, like bad service
you don't have to deal with,

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,010
but all the bullshit that
you would have to deal with.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,540
If it's a big company you
don't have to deal with. Um,

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,150
what they do is give you an,
an ethical cell phone company to choose.

33
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,430
I love it there.
One of my favorite sponsors,

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,270
one of the reasons I love it is we've
had zero negative response from people

35
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:03,840
that have signed up and started using
ting. Uh, our friend Chris Ryan used it.

36
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,860
Lots of our friends use it.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,490
You can use it to go to rogan.ting.com
and you could save 25 bucks off your

38
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,070
first ting device.
That's rogan.ting.com.

39
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,770
Can't say enough good things about ting.

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,390
We're also brought to you by
WHO's this today, Lumosity.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,980
Oh yeah. We're also brought to
you by Lumosity and Lumosity is,

42
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,140
let me pull this up. Lumosity is, is
uh, sort of like a gym for your mind.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,050
That's what the idea behind it is.
Lumosity has it set up.

44
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,640
So if you go to their website,

45
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,540
Lumosity has all these
different options and um,

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,700
you sign up and they provide you with
games and these Games essentially are

47
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,770
designed to just make your,

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,340
make your mind work and
they're very specialized. Like,

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,800
can we turn on the AC in here?
It's hot as fuck in here.

50
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,460
One of our camera guys loves that.
He's always dinking around with Lumosity.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,320
It's great. Yeah. He swears by it. Well,

52
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:02,380
because you can use the Massetti and
here let me pull up their, their spot.

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,910
Get around. That's what he said. Is
that okay with you Brian? Tinker. Okay,

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,810
so I got to thinking around.
Yeah.

55
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:12,310
Steve's one of the few guys that will say
frickin when he doesn't have to be out

56
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,560
in the woods. Yeah. He's
this fricking thing.

57
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,780
I can't hear myself on my
hair from the, the, the,

58
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,030
there's not even a chord on those.

59
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,190
You're not even plugged
in. Oh wait, hold on.

60
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,310
We'll figure it out. That's really
not important right now though.

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,290
What's port right now is Lumosity
exercise because exercise is good for us.

62
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,620
Ladies and gentlemen, we go to the gym,
we take care of our bodies. And um,

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,070
new Lumosity allows you to do that
same thing for your brain. Now they've,

64
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,660
they've shown during in numerous studies
that, uh, lots of different things,

65
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,810
uh, are, are good for, uh, for
your mind, for exercise. Uh,

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,930
chess in particular is, is
excellent for it. And um,

67
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,190
the idea behind Lumosity is
that they give you a work,

68
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,770
they give you things to
do but they get it sneaky.

69
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,270
They design it in a way that it's,
it's like a game. And as I said,

70
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,330
these games are very specific
to what you want to achieve.

71
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,430
If you go to the Lumosity website,

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,820
you could see all the different
options that they have available.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,020
If you go to the lumosity.com, um, you can
see like they, uh, you cleared the deck,

74
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,990
the get started now button,
they have memory,

75
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,260
all these different options from memory,
remembering patterns in locations,

76
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,490
associating names with faces, keeping
track of multiple pieces of information.

77
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,930
The more you do these things,

78
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,790
the more those are areas of your mind
will be exercised at tension. Um,

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,290
there's many options for speed decision
making quickly recalling recent

80
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,410
information flexibility,
which is a very interesting one.

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,690
Quickly adjusting and
shifting, uh, problem solving,

82
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,410
using logical reasoning.
All these different options
are available. Excuse me,

83
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,040
Kung Fu. And he come for one. There's
no Kung Fu in this, Brian Cowen.

84
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,790
I just get everything from confident. Um,
it's, it's basically a gym for your mind.

85
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,850
That's the best way to look at it and
you can also get them for your iPad,

86
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,940
your iPhone, there's a free
Lumosity APP. You can have fun,

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,840
workout your brain and make Lumosity a
part of your everyday routine and these

88
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:15,130
are all scientifically designed brain
games, scientifically designed. Brian,

89
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,940
I'm ready man. I'm mother fucker.
I'm all about sides. You know me.

90
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,920
Good for your brain.
And again,

91
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,100
lots of positive feedback from the Mosty
and I played them myself. They're fun,

92
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,110
they're fun and it gets,
it's like you know,

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,990
you can waste your time playing a lot
of games that don't do Jack Shit for you

94
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,720
or you can play games that are
actually good for your dome.

95
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,900

Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t used
the Codeword Rogan and save 10% off any

123
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:23,600

and gentlemen, Doug during Steve Rinella,

124
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,590
n Brian Calendar here. Cue
The music. Let's get there.

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,590
That shit.
Real good experience.

126
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,640
Try my day. Joe Rogan walk, gas,

127
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,880
boom.
Ladies and gentlemen,

128
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,410
in late 2013 we went to the farm of
one Douglas Duren in Upper Wisconsin.

129
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,883
Actually south.

130
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,150
It's all the same. Anything
up in Wisconsin. So it's
not like we're like, wait,

131
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,950
this is southeast. I love
southwest Wisconsin. No,

132
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
because there is a difference
because these guys in Wisconsin,

133
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:03,290
what they go by is that bottom quarter,
that bottom quadrant,

134
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,840
the bottom left quadrant. Sure. Is the,

135
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,220
they call it the driftless area because
it didn't get demolished by glaciers.

136
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,340
Yeah, that's a good point because for
folks who've never been to Wisconsin,

137
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,760
you think it was constant as being
like this flat area where you know,

138
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,080
the reason why those areas are flat
was because they got smushed. Yeah.

139
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,540
There's a guy I know who lives
up in the northeast and um, he,

140
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,600
he makes Maple Syrup and he always
makes a point to put on there from the

141
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:30,950
drifted area of Wisconsin. Like he's
trying to, he's trying to use it.

142
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,630
The shoes came over and smashed
it and flatten everything out.

143
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,540
What we reword was all hilly
and beautiful and you know,

144
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,890
all the landscape is varied.
That's because it didn't get smushed.

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,490
It was like a little median in
between the lanes of glaciation. Yeah.

146
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,870
It could've been minors. Yeah.
They just, they built it up, girl.

147
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,240
Good thing.
We're in Montana.

148
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,160
We were driving Brian's like,
oh, this is all mining large

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,420
scale mining. What the fuck are you
talking about? Minus a river through here.

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,260
Like the, at a mining expert.
Apparently I'm a mining expert.

151
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,560
I can tell by the topography at least
you don't really believe what you're

152
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:11,190
saying from you just start
saying something and you
just go with it for a goof.

153
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,430
I'll commit, I'll come in. But you know,
you don't commit with your ego. You don't,

154
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,460
you don't really attach on. No, just
my mind is changed all the time.

155
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,060
I talk about being a libertarian.
I had this guy, William Bernstein,

156
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,270
he's written all these books, you know,
on my podcast. And he started going, well,

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,961
yeah,

158
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,020
but they started giving me examples of
how being libertarian wouldn't really

159
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,170
help you if you, you're hoping that
your kid isn't wearing something toxic,

160
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,270
you know, they're, they're certainly,
when you get on a plane you want,

161
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,770
you want there to be an f,
f, d uh, you know, whatever
it is. Yeah. Whatever it is,

162
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,120
standards, federal standards
for flying. And so I was like,
yeah, yeah, you're right.

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,600
I back off everything
I've been saying here.

164
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,500
Well, being a libertarian up to a
point is not a bad idea. Of course,

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,880
the problem with any ideologies you
get lumped into, it's too rigid.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,880
They're making coffee in
there at the house. Like

167
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,870
we used to call it,
we used to call it bulletproof coffee.

168
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:03,810
Now we call it the Robb wolf
blend. Uh, but anyway, uh,

169
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
Doug Durans farm,

170
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,540
you were so gracious to have us up there
to film mediator and we appreciate it

171
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,200
very much. And you know,
as I said on the show, uh,

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,850
you can have a different time
but you can't have a better time.

173
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:17,780
We had a fucking fantastic
week there with your friends.

174
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:22,300
You got a great group of guys that you
go hunting with every weekend and just a

175
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,240
great group that represents
what hunting really should be.

176
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,220
A bunch of cool people having a good
time doing something that's fun doing it

177
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,340
ethically and you know,
getting some great meat out of it.

178
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah. Got It, got it. Talk about how I
met dog. Sure. Cause it speaks of dog.

179
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:42,680
I'll just sit here quietly. Doug's
a very big man by the way. Yeah,

180
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:46,230
Doug's a good guy. A lot of
bone. A lot of bone alone.

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,620
Well I met Doug after I wrote
my buffalo book dog, you know,

182
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,680
wrote me a letter and usually
like letters. I don't mean,

183
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,960
I don't even want to say what I was
going to say. Why not? You look at it,

184
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,740
you know, letters. I love to get letters.
They're fantastic. You know what I mean?

185
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,880
But a lot of times it's like people
you can't tell if they want to. Yeah,

186
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,960
you can't really get it.

187
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,060
It's hard to determine
sometimes what they're after
and I'm sure you get tons of,

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,270
Doug wrote me a letter that made
me actually be like, I am going to,

189
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,750
I want to contact this person.
It was just kinda like,

190
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,150
I like your book and I heard this and
here's what we got going on at my farm.

191
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,050
We started emailing
back and forth and dog,

192
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,750
I don't know what year this was, invited
me to come out to his cold asked farm.

193
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,290
And every time it comes out,
it's cool. So it's his fault.

194
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,740
So I just went out there and I didn't
know if I was going to get molested.

195
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,110
I didn't know the guy by those big
hands. I know it's like big, you know,

196
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,850
Hans molested me out that place.
I left the note, I left the note.

197
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,190
Tell him my wife,
like if I don't call an next hours,

198
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:53,490
like call nine one one what have no
must must've been called Cazenovia nine

199
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,180
version of nine one one a note. This
must have been to, it was a buyer.

200
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,940
You already know it's like a moving. No.
So I've never done anything like that

201
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,773
that ever,

202
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,160
but I did and went off the dogs
called farm and we was real cold.

203
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,560
And then I came back.
I was [inaudible].

204
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,420
Did he meet you at the door and
a robe and a warm he picked, no,

205
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,200
I think he picked me up at the airport.
I did and we got to,

206
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,510
we got a sack of cheese curds.
I took him to my house.

207
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:24,500
He met my wife so he could see everything
was legit, that I wasn't going to

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,570
take him up to the woods right away.

209
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,790
That's fine. And so you became friends
and I first saw Doug on your show,

210
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,730
mediator best, uh, best
show on television. And, uh,

211
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,500
I first saw the first time that
you guys went on, you went on a,

212
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,160
a deer hunt and you shot some rabbits and
you made some rabbits stew and it just

213
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:49,240
looked like a, a great hangout. You know,
you guys had a really good time up there.

214
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,440
So when Steve said, hey, uh,

215
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,910
you want to come to Doug's farm up in
Wisconsin and hunt deer, I was like,

216
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,620
fuck yeah,
that sounds nice.

217
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,800
I'll go on record right now and say
that beaver might be the best meat.

218
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,140
Everybody your fucking mind. And I'm
not kidding. You funded it was good.

219
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,160
It's not as good as Venice. So tend
to add here, bitch, that little rodent

220
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,700
that the, can you do like a thing? You
know, you'll have a different meal,

221
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:15,900
but you'll have a pill,
but you want to have a better

222
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,300
[inaudible] for better beavers.
Very good.

223
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,570
But what I like about Venice,
as

224
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,710
soon as you eat it rare and you
get that taste of the real blood,

225
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,120
the animal [inaudible] disguised in
a meal, you're eating the venison.

226
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,050
I just couldn't believe how Tinder viva
was. You will, the way Steve cooked it.

227
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,950
Yeah. It's real tender. Yeah. I mean, you
know, you really know what you're doing.

228
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,630
You know,
when you,

229
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,430
you got to cook it a long time and you
wouldn't be able to just take like a hunk

230
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,980
of beaver meat and grill it. No. Well,

231
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:50,330
I've been doing that with that
pig that we shot in to hone ranch.

232
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,130
And that's tough. It's delicious. But
it's tough. Yeah. Even if the Loin,

233
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,480
even the cook the lung,
because first of all,

234
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:58,510
you got to cook it all the way
through. It's gotta be, you know,

235
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,870
it's gotta be like medium because it's
pork, you know? But it's not like venison.

236
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,550
Venison is just like so soft and
delicious. Pork is good, man.

237
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,470
Pork loin is damn delicious,
but it's definitely tougher.
It's definitely tougher.

238
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,730
Right. So how did the, the mule deer
venison compared to the white tail?

239
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,550
Um,
the whitetail was so damn good.

240
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,700
I don't think you can get better
tasting meat on the planet.

241
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,520
That whitetail venison that we made in
your kitchen when we cooked up those bags.

242
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
[inaudible] good man.
That's the best meal I've ever had.

243
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:32,420
I don't think it gets any better than
the way you cooked it with the butter and

244
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,910
garlic salt and a hot flame p. Oh my God.

245
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,870
We got to use butter and then
get that grill good griddle,

246
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:46,130
really hot and just cooked that bitch
for just not even like 30 seconds each

247
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:50,070
side and then beaten it up with
the beard. Smash it down. Yeah.

248
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,130
Smash it down with a beer.
So he cut like,

249
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,480
you know, an inch thick, cute,
you know, a slice of the, uh, the,

250
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,870
the loin pounded down so it's kind of
flat. And then when you throw it in there,

251
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,580
it'll seriously 30 seconds each
side. Max crackle, crackle, and then,

252
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,290
oh, it's so good. I was pretty amazing.
I'm the, I'd love elk. I've had,

253
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,530
you know, elk, that's just about as good
as any meat I've ever had in my life.

254
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,820
That I think, but that those, the
backstraps cook that way, it's just,

255
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,720
it's hard to fuck with.

256
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,390
And plus those deer that we shot at
your farm are so fat and healthy.

257
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,740
Those are some health corn
after corn fed young also.

258
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:30,950
They were also young. That's
bad there. Yes. The bad part.

259
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,590
Well how much different do they taste?
If they're really old?

260
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,600
It's a bit of a difference with you ever.

261
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,040
What's the oldest dear you've ever shot?
You think? Uh, that one buck I shot was,

262
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,330
he was at least five and a half and it
gets hard to tell after a while though.

263
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,850
Right on the age they
do it by their teeth.

264
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,430
Take it to a, like a DNR station and
they'll look at it and they'll tell you,

265
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,990
they say it's two and a half.
It seems like it's like every two years.

266
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:56,480
Two and a half years old because they
can't make a mistake there or something.

267
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,620
But,
um,

268
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,730
I guess that when it at five and a half
just based on the teeth and then I shot

269
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,270
one, uh, with Mike Arkins, uh,

270
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,040
or hutches he's affectionately
known by Steve. Um,

271
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,960
a couple of years ago that wasn't
an older deer than that and it was,

272
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,270
that was a little little gaming game.

273
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,510
He is the wrong word
because Cameron Hanes,

274
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:18,950
I don't think white tails ever gave me.

275
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:22,520
So Kevin Hanes was on the podcast and he
shot a water buffalo that was 20 years

276
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,360
old.
Yeah.

277
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,800
And he said he had a piece of meat that
he put in his mouth there at the camp

278
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,500
and uh,

279
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,670
he was practicing with his bow is steady
practice with his bow for half an hour

280
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:36,110
with the same piece of maintenance
mountains like Pac man trying to break it

281
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:36,944
down.

282
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,650
I killed it. I killed a blackberry that
was 17. They do a two sentence thing.

283
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:45,600
17 year old bear. How long do they
live back? Blackberries about that.

284
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,470
Want me to get a little older? But he
was 17 but he and I sent his tongue.

285
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:54,190
They're like the Montana State University
used to run a program where, um,

286
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,780
you could send a chunk of the tongue in
and they'd do a test for trig analysis

287
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:01,050
on the tongue, cause it cons like I
guess you get a good concentration.

288
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:03,630
I'm the tongue,
good concentration the shoulders.

289
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,220
So I butchered this whole thing and it
was funny as hell as we went down to my

290
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:12,750
room and I was in school and my
roommate was cotton fish at this uh,

291
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,310
bailo grocery. Okay. And
he's like, well shit,

292
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,550
let's just take that barrier down and
grind at after hours at work, you know.

293
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,300
So we go down this thing and look like
we went down there and run it through the

294
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,400
grinders. We had those little,
you know, little foam things.

295
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,290
They get meat on this stuff look like,

296
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,850
I mean my freezer looked like someone
had just went and raided a grocery store

297
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,880
cause I had it all those
foam bottom things to Saran
wrap, just look perfect man,

298
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:40,080
like stacked up like bars of gold. And
then we got done. I met, we cleaned,

299
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:40,891
you know,
we clean,

300
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:45,060
but I started wondering about the depth
of clean we did because a couple of

301
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,180
weeks go by and they sent me this
thing like, yeah, your bears trick.

302
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,870
Knowles is positive. I know you can go
in and throw the bear out if you want,

303
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,030
but we won't reissue you a new bear tag.
So if you,

304
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,460
you now have the right to like,

305
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,130
you can get around because it's
illegal to waste Gamey, right?

306
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,180
So it's one wastes law. They said you're
exempt from wanton waste on that bear,

307
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,030
but you can throw it out,
but we won't give you a new tag.

308
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,860
And I just went down and
bought a meat thermometer.

309
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,530
I had a hundred this bear was,

310
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,910
you couldn't even think about even
moving this bear. You know, I had a,

311
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,130
I think it was hundred is
either 130 or 160 pounds.

312
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:20,700
A fricking ground meat off that bear.
Damn. I ate it to the bitter end,

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,080
man.
They're fricking meat thermometer.

314
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,080
I'd be out in my yard like with
breaking bear burger meat thermometer.

315
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,950
I do say Frickin,
yeah.

316
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,490
My Mom's listening to a certain degree,
but mum was talking about

317
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,910
before,
before the podcast,

318
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:40,010
sorry we were saying the Steve's one
of those guys that says Frickin when he

319
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:43,550
doesn't have to,
cause I know that my mom,

320
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,310
my mom likes to listen to your show man.
So,

321
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,890
so what's the temperature
that kills chicken? Awesome.

322
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,450
Yeah,
we're just look this up there.

323
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Day One 15 no it's one 55 or one 50 I
remember one 54 different gangster trick

324
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,770
and just change it like three you
know the Usda just lowered pork.

325
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,420
Really? He goes well cause
like USDA inspected pork. They,

326
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,790
I mean 90% of the trick gnosis cases
in the u s are coming out of black bear

327
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,430
meat. That's incredible. I
heard that on your podcast.

328
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,050
So they control how they feed pill.

329
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,930
They lowered the temperature on port
because what they were, what they think,

330
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,620
what they eventually found out is the
way people were used to be able to fatten

331
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,190
pigs. A restaurant slop in restaurant
slop had rats and mice in it,

332
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,100
in rats and mice are picking up
trick gnosis by eating flushing.

333
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,440
Nothing's born with trick gnosis.

334
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,030
It has to get it through
consumption of an infected animal.

335
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,120
And when they got it figured out enough
where they know what's going into the

336
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,210
miles of inspected pork,
they don't have any more.

337
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,780
Now they say you don't need to cook pork
to, it can be rare. You get a rampart.

338
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,860
It's like they serve it medium.
I can't believe Doug's not.

339
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,970
Doug's like always fact checks. Everything
you say as you say, I can't leave him

340
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,460
my phone off, so I'm just going
to go, uh, you know. However,

341
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,910
do you ever hunt wild pigs, Doug? I have
never done it. You should come with us.

342
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,410
All right. This is a place up here, the,
the um, to hone ranch. They're infested.

343
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,620
It's incredibly, I lot of them,
oh, they're everywhere and they're,

344
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,330
they're wild man. We were me and
Steve and the Cody, Cody, the guide.

345
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,770
We were walking down this road and I'm
telling you like where that curtain is,

346
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,660
there was some pigs duking it out.

347
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,630
We couldn't see them because they were
in the bush and we're sitting there like

348
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:20,990
waiting for one to pop out.
But

349
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,860
it's like you're in a monster movie or
something. Like there's some gremlins.

350
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:31,420
They carry it out and carry on
the brushes. Shame had no idea.

351
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,480
We live in a show before they come out.
I had no idea we were there.

352
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:38,620
So they were just making all this
crazy noise, right. 15, 20 feet away.

353
00:20:38,621 --> 00:20:41,470
Maybe she's just plain gray.
I was hitting the Austin

354
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,130
and I and I,
when I came on stage,

355
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:46,180
this guy who was introduced to me and
my buddy used to be at this Delta Guy,

356
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:48,010
Delta Force Guy.
So this his buddy

357
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,230
was a seal seal seal team six guy.

358
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,410
So we've got to know each
other and talking and, and
uh, he said, look man, I'm,

359
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,850
I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan's. Uh,
he and I think alike and he said,

360
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,420
if you guys ever want to
come down to Austin, we'll,

361
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,700
we'll throw you in a couple of small
birds that would be helicopters and you

362
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:06,220
guys can shoot pigs with
a bell fed machine gun.

363
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,730
Sounded like he doesn't know me that
well. I don't have any desire to, to that.

364
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,990
I like hunting pigs, but I I, you know, I
felt weird about doing it out of a truck.

365
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,950
Right? I felt weird about driving around
in a truck and jumping out and bang.

366
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,090
You don't want to pull a Ted Nugent.
Well, it looks like fun for sure.

367
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:27,140
And if it was my farm, don't get
me wrong, if I had a giant farm,

368
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:28,430
these pigs are fucking up my farm.

369
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:32,450
I would absolutely hire Ted Nugent and
pig man to fly around and shoot nuclear

370
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:36,980
weapons at though. But the reality
is that's not what I want to,

371
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:41,030
I'm not going to fly down to Austin strap
into Ellicott seems like it would be a

372
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:41,721
lot of fun,

373
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:45,830
but it might turn on an area of your
brain that you don't really want.

374
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:50,750
Turned off. My delta force buddy
literally goes, oh, I'll teach you.

375
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,780
I'm really good at shooting from a
helicopter. I'll teach you all about that.

376
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,630
A lot of guys don't know how to teach you.
I'll teach you exactly how to do it.

377
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,800
Not a skill set. I necessarily,
I don't really need it. You
not, I don't plan on it.

378
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,990
I was like, all right, well
thanks. I guess that pig man,

379
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:07,710
dude shot a pig from a helicopter with
a bow and arrow. What? Yeah, yeah.

380
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,760
You got to compensate to
compensate for the downdraft.

381
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,690
You know you have to shoot like
way over the pig's head aero drive.

382
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,900
That's impressive.
We shot from about 20 yards too.

383
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,400
I mean it wasn't like that close.

384
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:23,540
So there's 20 yards with the downdraft
and you got to like gauge it all and try

385
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:26,120
to figure out that. That's crazy. Yeah.

386
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,590
But he also killed like 400 of them that
day with a machine gun. I'm not kidding.

387
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,250
400 pigs. They've done it twice. Him
and Ted Nugent had done it twice.

388
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,120
They call it a pork lips. There's a pork
lips one and it was a pork lips too.

389
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,190
I mean it's, it's basically
like apocalypse now. That
scene in apocalypse now.

390
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,880
Look, look, look, look, look, look
at the screen. Look up, look up.

391
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,800
If you're going to eat
it, and you know, look,

392
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,300
he's got a fucking bear looking at him.

393
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:55,070
He's going to bear bow and he's sick
and he's going to shoot this fucking pig

394
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,760
from a helicopter. Look at
this shit. Look at that.

395
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:02,610
That's incredible. Boom.
Oh, that's impressive.

396
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,160
That is very impressive by the
way kind of bed there. Wow. Wow.

397
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,240
What do you expect pigs running
things in the helicopters.

398
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:13,950
A lot of shit going on there and here is
all I'm saying. Did the pig pile up? No.

399
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,790
No. Piglet pick looked like it didn't
even know. I've never found that pig.

400
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,470
Oh yeah, they got that pig.
They got them all. I mean they,

401
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,160
they killed 400 pigs that day.
I mean I'm not,

402
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,250
I'm not exaggerating when
I say 400 pixels. When you
see big like that are those,

403
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,630
those are not indigenous to
absolutely not. No Man there
from there. You're Asian.

404
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,900
They used to be all over from north
North Africans, British isles. So they,

405
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:38,790
they are, are they were they were they
domestic pigs and now they are wild pigs.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,810
It happens a whole bunch
of ways. How do, can I,

407
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,940
am I loud but yeah,
every pig one.

408
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,370
I just wanted to get in like a geeky pig
thing. No, no, no, no. Please go ahead.

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,990
So thought it's a secret or something. Oh
No, no, no, no. I got confused like, oh,

410
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,940
like every pig, every pig and
whether it's in a farm barn yard,

411
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,640
feral, wild, okay.
Eurasian bore razorback,

412
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,460
whatever the name you hear applied
to it all is like sue scrapper.

413
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
It's all the same species.
So

414
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,100
prior to domestication by humans,

415
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,030
this species was found all
over Europe and Asia. Like,

416
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:21,290
I mean they were in the British isles,
North Africa and the Middle East all over.

417
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:26,060
You know, what does not Russia. Okay.
They were everywhere. Europe. Um,

418
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
we'll slowly over time different people
in different areas domesticated and

419
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:37,010
develop domestic strains
off of this, this, you know,

420
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:42,011
sue scrap off the wild pig and they then
spread it around the rest of the world

421
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,160
where it didn't exist.

422
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,270
Like Polynesians brought wild pigs to
Hawaii perhaps 1100 years ago when they

423
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,840
showed up there. Right. But then
at the same time you've made,

424
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:55,370
there's maintain like the actual ancestral
population in certain pockets where

425
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:59,420
you really have like the actual wild pig
that became the basis like what we got

426
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:01,460
the cow from as an animal called the oryx,

427
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:04,070
but the oryx went extinct and now
we can't look back and go like,

428
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,690
so what was the cow? Right?
Like what did we make cows home?

429
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,120
But we know in this case what it wasn't.
It still exists out there.

430
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,510
So we had where people
brought these domestic strains
around and inevitably they

431
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,190
go feral.
Okay.

432
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:23,750
So just Sodo release pigs inadvertently
released pigs in, you know,

433
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,330
in the new world hundreds of years
ago according to Charles. Man.

434
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:28,580
That's kind of one of the reasons
that that might've been. What,

435
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,380
what caused the plagues about that book?
1491 yeah.

436
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,610
I might've been the reason that they,

437
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:40,430
they did a lot of the native Americans
died in such massive numbers from typhus

438
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:43,820
and all kinds of, cause they gets it
because like pigs share so many diseases.

439
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:47,180
But then at the same time what would
start to happen in the late 18 hundreds

440
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:50,830
early 19 hundreds is people started
going and catching the ancestors,

441
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,680
like the ancestral pigs,
undomesticated ancestral pigs,

442
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,030
taking them as wild creatures and
cutting them loose. So in California,

443
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,060
lot areas in California,

444
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:05,061
you go there and the pigs resemble and
there's some integration probably from

445
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,530
domestic strains, but they
really like, you look at them,

446
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,090
you're looking at like what we
now call like a Eurasian board.

447
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:14,270
They got long snout razor back. I mean
everything about them like straight tail,

448
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,231
everything.

449
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:18,080
A bottom screens like wild pig and you're
kind of looking at like what is the

450
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:21,020
wild pig in other places you can
go on there just as wild what?

451
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:25,400
They're feral domestics. Oh okay.
How big is the, is the original bore?

452
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,850
How big do those guys? They get there, you
know, it was funny there. They get big,

453
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:31,430
they get, you know, they'll,
they'll shoot ones in the wild.

454
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,330
That can be four or 500 pounds. Wow.
I mean that's, I think that's pretty,

455
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,470
that's like a big board,

456
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:40,490
but they get to be bigger than how
much of that is muscle. Oh yeah.

457
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,010
But that pig was such bs, that
whole Hogzilla thing. Total BS.

458
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,680
Well, it's a perspective issue
for sure. Well, yeah. Well guys,

459
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,080
like he sees one of these Hogzilla short,
he goes,

460
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:50,790
I sold that guy that pick a week ago.

461
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,860
[inaudible] he turns up and he's got
a picture up in the back of his truck.

462
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,990
Which guys? A few of those
Hogzilla is out. Yeah, those
are domestic strains. Okay.

463
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:08,610
And every hogs, like every Hogzilla in
his past was sitting there on the court,

464
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,050
was on a corn crib. It's not unusual
to make an 1100 pound domestic.

465
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,340
So that guy before by livestock
than any almost put together.

466
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,910
Let's hold that makes sure up again.

467
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,970
So that guy basically just
cover that thing in dirt.
No, listen, you can take it.

468
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:24,540
The mastic, you could
take a domestic pig. Okay.

469
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,000
Leave them intact or whatever.

470
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,010
Give them all the corn he's
gonna want and you're going to,

471
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,450
you can make giant pigs.

472
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,000
Then all you do is you take
it out and do a pen to place,

473
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,490
turn it out on the pen location,
go shoot,

474
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:39,150
and then you go like hunt it in quotes.
Yeah,

475
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,680
that's interesting. And they're just
buying them and putting out there.

476
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,410
Now that thing has hair all over it.
You know Nugen runs those things.

477
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:49,080
He runs things where that he runs like
these little pen facilities where they

478
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,590
got like,
like suppose the wild pigs in a pen.

479
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,560
Dairy and people come out and pretend
to hunt for them and it's like one of

480
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,770
these pods. Zillow's that turned up.
It wound up, there's a picture of it.

481
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,970
There's a picture of the guy with it in
the back of his pickup. That's hilarious.

482
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,830
Well, we would want to be that. Some
guy bought it for his kid to shoot. Oh,

483
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,740
cut it out. He cut it all out
on some little parcel of land.

484
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,760
But when you get a wild boar that's
500 pounds, how much of that is muscle?

485
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,070
They got a high yield man.
Speaking of that, a lot of
game animals, like 40% yield,

486
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,260
I mean pigs out of high yield.

487
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,960
I mean on a wild one it's gotta
be 50% yield Manga Vanilla

488
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,280
and I, okay, we shot this
pig. It's five 15 okay.

489
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,630
5:15 PM it gets dark at five 30 and
the pig is probably like 200 pounds.

490
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,670
We take this pig and a, I shoot it and it
rolls down this fucking hill. I'm going,

491
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:39,830
this hill is like really steep.

492
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I mean Riddick like hard to walk
up like really steep to just walk.

493
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:45,390
You kind of have to crawl up,
right?

494
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,330
So we have to figure out
how to get this pig out.

495
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,900
We try to drag it up with this guy's cord.
He tries to pull up this truck,

496
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,500
but it's a good word for that
road. Yeah, it's of course

497
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,690
the court keeps caching on rocks and snaps
and snaps twice. So we're like, fuck,

498
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:02,690
what do we do? So we're trying to figure
out what to do. I said, frick. Yeah.

499
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,720
So Steve says we should cut it.
We should. We should butcher it,

500
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,630
cut it up and then walk up the
hill with it. Yeah. But Cody,

501
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:15,410
the guide says you guys should kick
it down to the bottom of the hill.

502
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:19,400
There's a creek bed there and you'd be
like pushing it the whole way and then at

503
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:22,520
the end of it as a street and uh,
I'll come get you this treat.

504
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,400
Well I guess he was a little
off and it's fucking typography.

505
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,770
I didn't really recognize how
fucking far the hill goes down.

506
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,670
Right where we were. And by the
way, pushing a 200 pound pigs.

507
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:38,260
I like it has wheels. We
tried it. We tried to push
this thing for like, I dunno,

508
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,830
like two or three hours. First of all, I,
yeah, you'd roll it just wind up in the,

509
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,050
in like some hell hole.

510
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,540
And then we wound up in the hell
hole somewhere down the stream.

511
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,510
So we're down there. It's,
we're at the bottom now.

512
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:53,230
We're nowhere near close to the road.
We're fucking miles from the road. Okay.

513
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,650
And we've got this pig and it's pitch
black out. I mean in pitch black,

514
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:57,970
you could see stars in the sky.

515
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,560
We're hearing twig snap behind us because
there's only like 50 mountain lines up

516
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:05,470
there. And to hone ranch, it's
one fucking waterhole. They have,

517
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:10,180
he told us we have pictures
of 16 different mountain
lions at this one waterhole.

518
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,310
It's a huge ranch.
This ranch is shit.

519
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,910
This ranch is 270 plus thousand acres.
Yeah, California banned Lion Hunt.

520
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,470
Yeah. So let me got, you know it was a
lot lighter. They're all over the place.

521
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,830
So Steve says, look, we gotta,
we gotta cut this thing up.

522
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,950
There's no way we're going to get this
thing out of here. What? Cut it up. We'll,

523
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:26,830
we'll,
we'll put it,

524
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:29,950
throw each throw half over our
shoulders and we'll just carry it out.

525
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,030
It seems most reasonable, right? We're
cutting this thing and Steve's joking.

526
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,620
Oh there's line. Mine is, I hear a
line cause we hear like snap crack,

527
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,850
we hear like twigs snapping and we're
out there with blood all over our hands

528
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,550
pulling hearts out of this
fucking that same client base.

529
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,370
Then we have to carry it
and we carry it for what,

530
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,110
another two fucking hours
or something like that.

531
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,140
And it's starting to get really
sketchy because it's super steep.

532
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:55,150
It's dark as fuck.
Can't see where we're going.

533
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm slipping all over the place
and I'm like, I'm going to,

534
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,120
I've twisted my knee up, kind of
fucked up. Not Bad, but I'm like,

535
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,790
I'm gonna fucking break my neck
like this is, this is kind of crazy.

536
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
We finally get to the
bottom after he like,

537
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:07,990
who knows how many fucking
hours Cody needs to stay.

538
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,790
We want them hang in this pig up.

539
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,880
But where we came to just so happened to
be an ancient shack that they had that

540
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:19,570
they had built during prohibition so
that Hollywood people could come up there

541
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:20,710
and drink booze.

542
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,300
They had a still build out a native
timber with fire fireplaces made out of

543
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,220
native rock. The most amazing
places. I'm going to put it,

544
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,890
I'm going to F for folks
who listen to right now.

545
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,660
I'm going to throw photos of it on.

546
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,950
I'll throw it up on Instagram while we're
doing this podcast. Incredible. Like,

547
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,440
he can't even imagine the work that
went into this place, man. Yeah,

548
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,960
it was really fucking, it just ran.
It's just into the ground is not here.

549
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,730
You can't even,
you can't drive to it.

550
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,540
So it's run down and just sitting
there and it's beyond. There's no,

551
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,170
there's no saving, Huh? Yeah,
it was really incredible.
So you get to that thing?

552
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,740
Yeah, we just hung it up off
of, we hung it off overhead.

553
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,730
Like hanging over a drain. Yeah. This
is the, this is the shack. So, so,

554
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:01,810
so let me ask you this. Are there any
danger of a mountain lion coming in?

555
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,550
Well we were armed.
No,

556
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,840
but I'm going to be coming and getting
the meat over night. No, I mean I,

557
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,540
any danger of getting attacked by a
mountain. Oh Man. In the last, what,

558
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,570
80 years in the last 80 years has been
like maybe more than 80 years has been

559
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:20,380
six or seven line fatalities and Mommy's
and Washington state yesterday and 11

560
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,380
year old girl shot a mountain line
that was going after her brother.

561
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,460
You want to talk about it?
A little gangster cat? Yeah.
Pull up that story. Hold on.

562
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:31,690
11. Yeah, this was, yesterday was a 50
year old cat. Apparently the cat was,

563
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,920
or 50 pound cat.

564
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:35,740
Apparently the cat was like real skinny
and they were saying that was probably

565
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:40,050
just starts hurting. That's
a small cat. Yeah. Yeah. But

566
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,140
I mean, it kind of drives me nuts when
people act like lions are, you know,

567
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:47,320
any more dean, I mean,
will you said after all,

568
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,670
they're not as dangerous
as yellow jackets are.

569
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,060
Ground nesting Hornets scared all
of them too. So they're out there.

570
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,600
We're going to go fuck themselves. They're
all through with the, with the, I mean,

571
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,840
they're feeding on these,
these hogs at this place.

572
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,750
Paul to gotta be cleaning house
on man. You know, come on,

573
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,593
you can run them down to,
oh,

574
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,160
look at this little girl and
they got a picture of the cat.

575
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,020
It's fucking little girl. She's 11
years old. Shot a fucking mountain line.

576
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,030
That's shot. Shot that mountain lion.
No, there's no, no, no. It's a picture.

577
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,180
There's a picture of the glass.

578
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:21,190
Like it must not have been too stressful
of a situation. Well, the girl,

579
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:24,830
um, she's apparently she's a hunter
and her, her whole family hunts.

580
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,300
And so she knew how to use a gun.

581
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:29,390
Like there's a picture of her with a
raccoon that she killed that's available

582
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,990
online. She knows how to use a
gun. And this rack, this, uh,

583
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,320
this fucking panther was coming
after her brother and she shot it.

584
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,250
That's a crack shot for an 11 year old.
That's great. A fucking mountain lion.

585
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,160
So find the article. Can I go back to
the machine gun out of the helicopters?

586
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,140
Yeah. Cat. So needless to say,

587
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,720
well maybe I will say that
that's not something that I,

588
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,850
that I have any interest in, but what
I do have an interest in is, uh, uh,

589
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,080
talking about what good is,

590
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,160
how good a shots you to
where I was just amazing.

591
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:04,700
My favorite topic right now, well,
the cashmere killer. Yeah, exactly.

592
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,690
I've learned from Steve Vanilla,
I learned from the best well in.

593
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,620
And what was so gratifying about the
way you guys hunted in the way you were

594
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,950
there and in,

595
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,450
and I'm just thinking about Brian and
how that deer came down through the woods

596
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:21,410
and you know, he's honest and he's on it
and it's like, Yep, I've got it. Boom,

597
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:25,940
one shot down. It went. That's in
my book the way it ought to be done.

598
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,630
They call me game. I of course, it wasn't
that far away, but I appreciate it.

599
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,590
You know what, man, I'm telling you.

600
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,300
Ever since I started practicing archery
and practicing with bows and arrows and

601
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,920
I've been doing it for a few months now.

602
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,000
You really like about shooting Amy with
a rifle when you can actually rest the

603
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:43,010
rifle down on something
and look through a scope.

604
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,510
God Damn is that easy in comparison
to a bow and arrows effective way more

605
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:49,730
effective.
It's fucking hard.

606
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,680
Like to aim at something more than 30
yards away with a bowling out. Yeah,

607
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,780
especially like a live animal matter.

608
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,850
It's hard to stand with a
scope and try to shoot. Yes.

609
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,180
I don't think you'd ever do that anyway.
Right. Well, I've been doing that.

610
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,950
I've been doing that.
The range. Really? Yeah.

611
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:05,740
I've been doing almost all of my
practice, right. Whole different ballgame.

612
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,630
The sitting, even, even sitting,

613
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,800
doing almost all my practicing at the
range locked into my shoulder because I

614
00:35:11,801 --> 00:35:14,770
remember when we were, um, we
were pig hunting. I had one shot,

615
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,240
the one pig that I missed.

616
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,760
I was trying to rest up against a
tree and I'd never done it before.

617
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:21,670
I've never taken, I was like, I don't know
what I'm doing. This is a weird thing,

618
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,730
but try to put the gun up against a tree.
It felt awkward.

619
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,190
So I've been practicing just like this,

620
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,980
just sitting there like this
with my elbow up against my body.

621
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,150
Practice with your knee up. Yeah, just
it's way, it's a whole different thing.

622
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,130
Just even I did a few standing. It's
fucking hard. Yeah. I don't know many,

623
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,790
I don't know many serious hunters
who've been in a lot of situations.

624
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,620
You take even a hundred yard
shots without having a rest. Yeah.

625
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,940
Yeah. I probably wouldn't matter
what it, than less somethings like

626
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,530
heading out. Well that, yeah, generally,
yeah. Generally you'd, you'd want to,

627
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,330
I mean,

628
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:02,120
free hand shooting out to certain
is real deadly all to a close range.

629
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:05,660
But you know, you imagine the
trajectory of that thing and you know,

630
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,350
and if you're an inch off that 10 yards,

631
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:11,840
you're two inches off at 20
yards and on and on and on,

632
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:14,720
and then you run the risk of an
injury in the animal. So, you know,

633
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,460
you gotta be careful. Yeah. Or not
are not good. You don't want to take,

634
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,270
when you're hunting, do you get
the chance to shoot, uh, you know,

635
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,080
as we would off the bencher when we
were just practicing in our place.

636
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:30,340
So you do need to be able to, you
know, adjust and lean off of something.

637
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,550
And that was the other thing you
did when we first got in the blind.

638
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:36,640
I was thinking you were kept pulling it.
I mean, I just don't do that, you know,

639
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:40,600
pulling the gun up and pointing it out
the window and he's just like pointing in

640
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,700
different places and
I'm like watching him.

641
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:48,240
Okay. Why is that bad? No, no. I mean it
was, he was moving a lot, does move a lot.

642
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,750
I'm Connecticut and I kept
trying to look through,

643
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,080
I go through these weird games
where I'm like pretending I'm,

644
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:57,680
I'm whore and I'm looking through my scope
for the enemy is wrong with you cause

645
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:00,120
I'm cause I'm talking
about here's all the war.

646
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm pretending I'm such a bitch.
I had,

647
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,500
I had a warm thermos in my tummy and
I had all those heating pads. I stayed

648
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,950
very toasty. But the point
is is that he then, you know,

649
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,250
took the rest, made the
shot twice. Yeah. And uh,

650
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,950
uh, I mean shot two
different deer and, and

651
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,870
I guess what I was going to say about
shooting is that if you are in a situation

652
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:26,704
where like,
uh,

653
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,040
I don't know if I missed a buck on that
last day that we hunted and jumped him

654
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:34,180
and he ran. And you know, I had,

655
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,750
I took like three steps down the hill
and he wasn't very far away and cleaned

656
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,550
mist. And, um, but I will, I
practice shooting that way. I mean,

657
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,660
I don't shoot a lot, but I
will actually practice, you
know, free hand. But I'm not,

658
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,320
you're right, I'm not gonna shoot a
hundred yards or 150 yards at something,

659
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:53,290
but 50 or 75. I mean, I've killed
a lot of deer are really close.

660
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,680
Well, because they get up and running.
How when you get that deer in your sites,

661
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,760
you know, like everything
goes away, right? I mean, it's
just like, it almost feels,

662
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,420
it's almost like that's the rush.

663
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,760
Thinking About Your Chore
List and now Instagram, do
you have an Instagram? No. Oh

664
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,250
No. What is it? Meat
Eater. Tea Country TV. TV.

665
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,250
It's Steve's at Steven Rinella. Okay. Um,

666
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,790
I've been doing videos on my
Instagram was Brennan show.

667
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:25,340
We're not asking about you are we? I
was going to, well, I'll show it to you.

668
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:28,640
Let it remind me. I'm not
really interested. Oh No,
you are. I want, you know,

669
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,920
I want to make, I want to, I want
to have Doug talk about like the,

670
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,970
like the,
the like hit

671
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,420
the deer on his place and all that.

672
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,210
But one thing that's just really bugging
the hell out of me is last time I was

673
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:44,800
on here I uh, I said
something wrong. Oh, okay.

674
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,300
I was talking about to hone ranch and I
said they have to [inaudible] which is a

675
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,980
native elk in California.
It was like,

676
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:54,580
you know the Elgar divide like rocky
mountain note to Lee's Roosevelt's,

677
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,840
no saying they had to release which is
the native California out onto home.

678
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,730
They don't, there are some real close
to there but those are rocky mountain.

679
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,490
Thank God you cleared that up because
it's been bugging me nuts. But no,

680
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:09,100
it is important because
the Tulio Carne is big.

681
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:13,270
The rocky mountain elk or unusual for
that area and the only place in California

682
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:16,870
that has them is to hone ranch and then
they bought the free from some guy had a

683
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,320
captive facility into Boston free
50 years ago now run wild out there.

684
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,383
It's incredible.

685
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,990
We only got to see a few of them but we
tankers man huge because they don't have

686
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:29,350
a winter problem like a lot of the elk
in the mountains too. Like, I mean,

687
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,670
there were snow while we were up there,

688
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,390
but it's not snow where they don't
have food. They're getting food.

689
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,050
They're probably putting fat on right now.

690
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,370
He's fucking elk were GI
in there, Joe, we saw,

691
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,430
we saw some cows and we saw
one bull from a distance,

692
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:46,540
but Steve picked up a shed that was like
a fucking limb on a hundred year old

693
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,450
oak tree. It was, it was huge. It
was longer than both of my arms. No,

694
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,230
they, they, they, I mean they regularly,
you know, what do they weigh? Oh,

695
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,110
thousand to 1200 pounds. That's a
horse. A horse. They're huge out there.

696
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,660
I should tell everybody that's interested.
You can hunt at that place. They were,

697
00:40:05,661 --> 00:40:09,340
so they were kind enough to bring us up
there and let Steve and I hunt there.

698
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:12,700
But you know, anybody can
go hunting there. You hire
a guide and you pay for it.

699
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:17,470
It's not cheap, but it is a game rich
place. If you're good a pig man, you know,

700
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,920
I mean, that's, yeah, but the most of
that, can you, can you find elk up?

701
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,030
There are no,
yes you can.

702
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,630
They do it. Yeah, you can. And they do a
very, I think that they're saying they,

703
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:28,100
I mean they kill like honestly,

704
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:31,670
they kill a handful of elk off
that place every year. They kill,

705
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,610
they kill thousands of pigs
out that place every year.

706
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,640
It's really aggressive dude. Really
aggressive pig calling. Please.

707
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,100
I heard you can't shoot your way out
of a pig calling pro. They picked up.

708
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,220
They keep a handle on
me, but they, they, they,

709
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,550
I mean throughout the year on
average they're killing like many,

710
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:53,480
like several a day just to keep,
uh, just keep grips on it. You know,

711
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,580
I look at Gels, look at that. That's
the peg that is, that looks good.

712
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:01,030
It's got a long snout. Is that
a, is that a wow pass. Very raw.

713
00:41:01,031 --> 00:41:03,260
It's very Russian looking Eurasia.
Yeah.

714
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,280
To hone ranch. If you're in La and
you're looking for a place to hunt,

715
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,300
that is a game rich environment and it's
only an hour and a half outside of La.

716
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,980
Real Nice folks who run that
play. Dude. Cody plank is
solid. Yeah. Very, very nice.

717
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:18,770
Cause I'm like Tom, I thought there were
solid, very nice guys, both of them.

718
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:22,670
We had a great time. Cody was your
guide. He took us out, showed us every,

719
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:27,620
I mean the place is gigantic. We saw
it at least 50 deer. We saw at least,

720
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,620
I don't know how many fucking pigs.
Hundred easily,

721
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,250
easily a hundred pigs in the two days
we were there, we saw about maybe seven

722
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,330
or eight elk. We saw Turkeys, we saw about
a dozen Turkey hill. We saw everything.

723
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:43,930
I got a buddy in New Mexico whose body
works out there like at an administrative

724
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,130
level out there.
And he kept telling over the years,

725
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,560
and this guy hunts like a lot of,
you know,

726
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,030
serious back country honing my friend
in New Mexico. He kept saying, man,

727
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:52,700
he gotta go out and see this to homeplace
you would never in a million years

728
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:53,730
guessed that sitting there never.

729
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,730
And then you'd get up way up
high and there's like Cedar,

730
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,890
it's like there's a ton of
different bio types there.

731
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,170
You know you get way up behind her
was like cedars and it just like,

732
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:03,380
you couldn't imagine that you can then
like drive out of there and go down to

733
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:08,150
lax and fly. Yeah an hour and a half.
I mean it's crazy. It's so bad ass.

734
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,030
Not only that, it's a private ranch so
there's not that many people up there.

735
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,120
How big is not fence to like when you say
we told you you weren't paying for it.

736
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,820
Acres millionaires accordingly.
If he's not,

737
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,370
if he doesn't get to talk he doesn't
listen. No, I'm not good with numbers

738
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,650
but I do want to get something because
I didn't want to bring up something like

739
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:31,730
management, you know, so they,
they work really hard out there.

740
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,720
They work hard to keep a grip on the pigs
because pigs it hard on ground nesting

741
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,090
birds for instance,
there used to be a lot of quail out there.

742
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,360
They suspect and turn be a lot of
turkeys out there and antelope,

743
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,660
they suspect it.
They've seen a,

744
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,030
they suspect that one of the things
might be going on with quail out.

745
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,700
They're just pigs, you know,
cause they hammer eggs.

746
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,730
They like the ground nesting birds. So
they do a lot to do that. But in Japan,

747
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:55,520
but I want to bring up,

748
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,030
I want to bring up deer like oh I want to
talk about deer in southwest Wisconsin.

749
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,440
Look at that place. That's the
pig ranch. Before we talk about,

750
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,330
here's the other thing
was the two pictures.

751
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:09,050
You had the one of the Hogzilla and that
looked like a domestic pig that, I mean,

752
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,020
yeah man. We used to raise
on the farm when I was a kid.

753
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:15,780
We had shorts now as opposed to the one
that I chose the erasion and that was in

754
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,170
multicolor front ones.
But then you go to New Zealand,

755
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,590
I hunted pigs in New Zealand and every
one of those pigs looks like something

756
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,700
just walked off a farm.
They look,

757
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,110
they look great and then you throw them
in the crick and get the mud off them

758
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:28,180
and they'll be like black
and white and brown man.

759
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,230
Crack is correct if it has no crick
crack a crick as a crick according to

760
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:37,190
Patrick McMahon is if you can
find automotive parts in it.

761
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,660
[inaudible] it's clean.
It's a creek.

762
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,440
And this is most certainly quick,

763
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,600
like if you went up and down you'd
find a spare tire making it a crip.

764
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,020
But the other thing about
pigs too is when I was a kid,

765
00:43:51,021 --> 00:43:52,460
we had picked out you were here.

766
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,860
I keep trying,
I keep trying to tee,

767
00:43:56,861 --> 00:44:00,640
I keep trying to cheat it ours time
and I'm in the media. Give him a break.

768
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,840
I'm trying to t dog off
talks about his damn phone.

769
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,370
So let me talk about the
farm for a minute please.

770
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,520
Uh,
we raise pigs when I was a kid and uh,

771
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,170
had,
you know,

772
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,750
there were chickens on the farm at one
point we had dairy cattle and all that

773
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:18,280
kind of stuff, but the pigs were
never anything. When you say domestic,

774
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,600
you could see where, where as soon as the
fence is open, they're gone. You know,

775
00:44:22,601 --> 00:44:23,410
they aren't,

776
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,410
they're not like Holsteins or even the
herds that you saw or the angles that I

777
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:30,010
had there that'll,
you know,

778
00:44:30,011 --> 00:44:33,060
they'll come around and he'll just
stand by and stuff. And pigs were,

779
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:33,850
they were pretty quick.

780
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,690
[inaudible] not here.
I'm going to eat that song

781
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,490
really naturally.
Far As let's just go to the woods.

782
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,170
Right. And, and his, his uh,
Steve's comment about, uh,

783
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,560
about the eggs or the quail and the Turkey
makes complete sense because they're

784
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,370
there, what are we calling it
written around in the written,

785
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,660
the routine,
the routine take about

786
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,560
and, and that's what they do. So they're
always, you know, tearing stuff up.

787
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:02,380
So anything that's a
ground nesters going to be,

788
00:45:02,381 --> 00:45:03,760
of course it's going to be in harm's way.

789
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:07,390
So it makes complete sense that that's
an issue much against the pig. And one,

790
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,830
one sow pig has, you know, 16, you know,

791
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,290
between 10 and 20 little
ones. Each time they, they,

792
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,480
I wonder how,
I know Craig out multiple year.

793
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,700
Meanwhile a deer's putting off wondering

794
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,200
to fall back to the darn deer again.

795
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,510
Rights activists feel about pig hunting
because that is clearly an animal that

796
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:29,570
you have to control their bodies.

797
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,910
Yeah. Like that's the thing
in one went to New Zealand.

798
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:37,180
All the animals in New Zealand are not
all, not all the animals, but you know.

799
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,170
Oh yeah.

800
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,180
The game man was around and
introduced and there the um,

801
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,980
the guys that like to hunt there are
always complaining about the greenies,

802
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,053
you know,

803
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,810
and their complaint about the greenies
in New Zealand is the greenies want to

804
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:56,660
kill all the animals. Oh,
that's hilarious. They
want to preserve something.

805
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,150
Why preserve native?
They want to preserve native ECO systems.

806
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,170
So like these damn greenies would like
to get up in the helicopters and shooting

807
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:08,090
all the animals. The opposite.
They're greenies are done. Well,

808
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,610
you're allowed to do crazy shit.
They're like,

809
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:13,330
you can have Canadian goose with a rifle.
Right? Oh, you do. Lot crazier now.

810
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,340
I mean there's no, they have acted
well. They have active programs.

811
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,660
They have active programs where there's
like government shooters who are just

812
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,970
shootings. They have no predators.
Well, they can't introduced predators.

813
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,660
They can't do that. No, because they
have, they have the sheep is a huge,

814
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,420
well they didn't like sheep caused
a major problem with pollution.

815
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:35,170
Apparently paid their take on is
they're not going to introduce a little,

816
00:46:35,171 --> 00:46:39,180
they're not going to have to gas.
Methane gas like grabbed me. Great.

817
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,670
Literally was a problem. Smog was a
problem in New Zealand. We looked this up.

818
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,600
It was a prophecy from, from there. Yes,
from their forest. From the methane gas.

819
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:51,130
But I don't think methane forms the smog.
It does some form of smog and it's,

820
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:53,600
it was a major issue in New Zealand.

821
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,100
Methane gas was a major smog problem
and I don't know if it still is.

822
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,210
I doubt they put devices on their asses
too. You know, I heard the equipment,

823
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,870
they put the bags so dark.
This place you got right.

824
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:11,420
But I'm curious about this lead
sheet. Flatulence. Oh my God.

825
00:47:11,421 --> 00:47:15,620
Solution Law. I believed him
because he said look it up. Yeah.

826
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,910
Other times he just says
he doesn't bullshit. No,

827
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,690
I just count and talks a
lot, but he doesn't bullshit
now. I know what I'm saying.

828
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,350
That's incredible. And that amazing.
Well that's an issue in California too.

829
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,060
I knew it was an issue in Pennsylvania.

830
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,480
Parents used to live in Harrisburg and
there was an area that I used to drive

831
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,990
when I was living in New York.
I'd drive to Pennsylvania.

832
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,200
There was an area where you could
not roll your fucking window down.

833
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:42,340
You couldn't do it. You wouldn't die. My
newer pools, just like the little ammonia.

834
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:47,230
Yeah. So bad. It's stocked so horribly.
It made you not want to eat meat.

835
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,513
It really does.

836
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,600
And when, when we, I went to China, uh,

837
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,680
when I literally in 1985.
Okay. I think it was, in fact,

838
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:00,730
it was 1983 I was with my family
once the mainland of China.

839
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,480
And I dunno if I were to tell you this,
there's one,

840
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,110
we go to a restaurant in Canton.
Where is that doesn't matter. Oh,

841
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:11,530
you told me about this.
And underneath the restaurant we're pigs.

842
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,250
So underneath the restaurant were pigs.
A lot of pigs.

843
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,780
The pigs were eating the shit that,
so you,

844
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:24,430
you would take a dump and it would come
down and the pigs would eat the shit and

845
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,320
then, no, we don't eat all
the slops from the restaurant,

846
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:29,560
but they were eating human feces and
then they were eating those pigs and then

847
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:30,394
they're reading those pigs.

848
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:33,460
The roads are that joke. It's
like that joke. The punchline is,

849
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:37,130
I had lunch with them two weeks ago.
Monday, no joke. No, no, my mom.

850
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,720
But that was that. That
was always like, no,

851
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,770
I wasn't that always
the job of up of pigs.

852
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,840
Didn't they eat really grow stuff
like my dad, my dad is always say,

853
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,260
you lay there long enough and you'll
eat you. That was like is, oh they will.

854
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,580
That's the number one animal that kills
off life livestock that kills farmers.

855
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,030
Oh really? Yeah. Guy died recently.
They say he might've had a heart attack,

856
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,010
I think it was in Washington state.

857
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,460
He fell into is a pigsty and
they just fucking devoured him.

858
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:06,030
They found his clothes, like
parts of his clothes left. Yeah.

859
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,510
They say that the mafia in Italy
would fit in that movie snatch.

860
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,080
Remember the movie snack
and it's in the deadwood.

861
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:18,580
They spoke to the cargo. That's right,
but it's true. It is. There it is.

862
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,710
There's a scene that lead to your head.

863
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,460
Everything. Huh? There's a scene.

864
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,833
Clean it up.

865
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,220
That guy was awesome to
do is feed them two pigs.

866
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,370
You've got to start off
the picks for a few days.

867
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,730
Then the side of a chop top body
would look like Carly to a peer side.

868
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,190
You've got to shave the edgy a bit button
and pull the teeth up for the sake of

869
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:42,280
the piggies digestion. You're cooked
through this afterwards of course,

870
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,390
but you don't want to go sit in
for the pig shit now though. Yeah,

871
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,240
they will go through bone like butter.

872
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,890
You need at least 16 pigs to
finish the job in one setting,

873
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,430
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

874
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,390
They will go through our body that
weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes.

875
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,970
That means that a single pig can consume
two pounds of uncooked flesh every

876
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,163
minute.

877
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,270
Hence the expression as Grady as a plague.

878
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,420
It is that guy freaking [inaudible].

879
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,510
Those are great character that
what a great vines realize.

880
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:26,170
I've never seen that movie. I've never
seen snatch. No. Really. Our scene,

881
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,250
fucking tremendous

882
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,460
guy. Ritchie's masterpiece. Wow. I got
to see that. That's a great movie man.

883
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,350
Lock stock and two smoking barrels.
That's the you,

884
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,170
so you never saw the Brad Pitt character.
I saw lots of that where he's a boxer.

885
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,300
Yeah. Accent. That was what
people say. See? Oh yeah,

886
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,970
Gypsy is, what's the word? Cock.
Cockney what's not cognitive?

887
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,760
It's like I talk to me.
He's not tipsy accent.

888
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,430
They have like a jibberish sort of a
way of talking where you really can

889
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:56,620
understand them. It's really difficult.
They use rhyming slang and stuff. I've,

890
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:00,100
I've heard it and you can't understand
the thing they're saying travels

891
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,470
worldwide. I won't lie to
you. I travel a great deal.

892
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,640
What were we talking about right
before the podcast started?

893
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,990
Where we're talking about said you
have to bring this up on the pilot.

894
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,220
About about,
um,

895
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,610
so I did a podcast today with a guy from
crack.com Dan O'brien wrote a really

896
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:16,360
funny book called how to fight presidents.

897
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,910
He literally took every president in
the history of America to see who is the

898
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:23,631
baddest ass,

899
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:26,630
who is the one guy you wouldn't want to
fight and who would win in a fight if

900
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:27,710
they were pitted against each other.

901
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:32,090
It's like it's in some ways the greatest
book of all time. And like I said, I go,

902
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,400
this is the, this is going to be
the greatest podcast of all time.

903
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,260
It was the funniest thing because we got
into a heavy heated argument about who

904
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:42,710
would win in a fight and you got to put
a cup of presidents up at the top of the

905
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:46,040
list. You got to put a blanket cause he
was renowned for his physical strength.

906
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,230
There it is.
It's about he fought vampires to right.

907
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,710
Well he did it but he used an ax. He
used an ax, but Abe Lincoln was six,

908
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:55,970
four and had, what's that? That
disease where your arms are longer,

909
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:58,850
you have really long arms, like longer
than your body had crazy England.

910
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,290
And he was, he was known to be really
strong and, and very, very tough.

911
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,200
Like he was,
I'm sorry.

912
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,220
I think you also have to think of
people that lived during that era.

913
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,400
There were a lot tougher. They grew up
doing everything with their hands, right.

914
00:52:13,401 --> 00:52:16,550
Building things. Andrew
Jackson was a gentle, I mean,

915
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,990
he committed a little something called
genocide buck. And you talk to historians,

916
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,890
they're like, well, he,

917
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:25,160
he killed a great deal of native
Americans with extreme prejudice. So He,

918
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,820
I dunno what, he's not a,
I wouldn't, that's a strong
word. It's a strong EU thing.

919
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,820
It's a strong lung disease.
I don't think disease transmission counts.

920
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,420
I agree with you.
Is that what lead he did?

921
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:42,290
He was a soldier and did,
I mean he was, uh, he,

922
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,070
he clearly probably killed a lot of
men with his bare hands. I would've,

923
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,420
I mean that was barons, but certainly
with a gun or a knife. I mean,

924
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,990
he was a pretty warlike fella.
Yeah. And in fact challenged.

925
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,060
He had a number of duals.
Historians are actually,

926
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:57,680
he got shot and live most of his
life with a bullet in his rib cage.

927
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,030
Shitty guns back then, but he had
it cleaned through. He had there.

928
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,940
There's a debate how many duals
he actually hat when you have,

929
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,600
when there's a debate on how
many duels [inaudible] president,

930
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:12,770
you're a bad mother fucker or you're an
idiot, right? Keep getting a Doula. Well,

931
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:15,650
he got shot because he let the
guy take the first shot. He goes,

932
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,240
take the first shot guy shot him,

933
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,680
and then he shot the guy and live that
way for the rest of his life. He had,

934
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:26,110
he had a gaping wound that would
cause problems periodically. Anyway,

935
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,110
take the first shot. You got to
Andrew Jackson, who was six to

936
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,180
probably George Washington,
six four who was a tough guy.

937
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,690
George Washington was six. He was,
people weren't that big that I know.

938
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,600
He was a giant.
I'll tell you six for Jesus Christ.

939
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,720
George Washington was as big as George
Washington could've beat dog gone money

940
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:51,780
on Doug. George has wooden teeth.
He's got a fucking goofy wig on.

941
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,080
You pull that wig off,
he's all insecure. Yeah,

942
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,670
you build that wig off. He's not
gonna know what the fuck to do is.

943
00:53:58,671 --> 00:54:00,630
You're going to search for his wig.
You kicked him in the Dick.

944
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,561
Next thing you know,

945
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:03,560
you're pulling out his wooden teeth
and beating the shit out of him.

946
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,413
There it is money on.

947
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,000
But then there was Lyndon Johnson who's
also six four but Teddy Roosevelt who

948
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:10,380
practice,
who boxed,

949
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,590
wrestled and practice judo with the
guy who brought you out to the United

950
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,520
States,
the first judo guy,

951
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,270
and was obsessed with all things
wrestling and fighting. He was about five,

952
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:24,630
10 and very thick, but very sickly kid.
Died of heart disease, had a weak heart.

953
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:25,464
So I don't know,

954
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,070
my thing is Gerald Ford played football
and could have played for the bears as a

955
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,800
middle linebacker.
That says a lot when you play in the NFL.

956
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,060
So I might have to go with,

957
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,240
we had a huge discussion about this for
a good hour with Brian Cowen show and a,

958
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:42,430
it was a good time. I got Lincoln.
So no, that's not what you're taught.

959
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,950
So then he said, I said, what about
Barack Obama? And he got quiet.

960
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,760
It Dad's a comedian, really good
guy. He got quiet and he said, well,

961
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:54,030
I can't be like that. You
know, I, I'd rather leave that
alone. I said, why? He said,

962
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,500
well,
I tried not to,

963
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,920
you try not to include any
living presidents because
it caused too much trouble.

964
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,300
I said, what do you mean? He said, well,
I went through sort of a thing about how,

965
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:03,811
you know,

966
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:07,290
Barack Obama's not that tough a president
and it'd be easy to kick his ass.

967
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,920
And uh, you know, I was doing
it tongue in cheek, you know,

968
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:13,290
you'd probably kick him here and he's
kind of skinny and you could take,

969
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,620
and he gets a call from the secret
service because he posted it as a blog.

970
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,200
You Post it as a blog on
[inaudible] dot com well,

971
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:26,700
he said the reason the only blog that's
not up there anymore is that because he

972
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:30,960
got called down to the federal building,
I believe. I think that's what he said.

973
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,920
It's on my podcast.

974
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:37,260
And he had to go line by line with these
agents on what he meant by what he was

975
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:39,480
saying. And he was like,
well, I said, you know,

976
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,720
I said Dick Tornado instead of a penis
cyclone because it's kind of funnier.

977
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,960
He was trying to teach them a humor.
These guys were totally fucked with us.

978
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,410
He got all nervous. He was
like apologizing. He made,

979
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:55,590
they made him take it down and it was a
chapter that was somebody from the book

980
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:58,830
I believe so that I was like,
we live in America now.

981
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:01,350
You have to be careful
when you've threatened the
president you will get called.

982
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:05,380
But guys, guys, come
on, come on man. I mean,

983
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,370
and he took probably can't,
they probably can't.

984
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:12,360
Well they tend to probably no way to
go. Like yeah, they probably knew.

985
00:56:12,361 --> 00:56:14,670
Of course he's joking,

986
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,120
but there's a thing that you
set in motion a certain size.

987
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:22,350
What happens because they said we will
subpoena everybody that made a comment on

988
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,150
your on blog,
like

989
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,060
kick his ass and, and, and, and Dan
said, well it's a bunch of 14 year olds.

990
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:32,350
Have Fun with that. And the, the main
guy had called him first. He goes, look,

991
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,240
I know you're kidding.
I know you've got a sense of humor.

992
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,820
You've got to go down and talk to
these guys. It's just the way it is.

993
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:41,821
Powell had shotgun animal in my bag
one time going through the TSA line and

994
00:56:43,021 --> 00:56:46,870
Anchorage and they were like, you
got shot, go in and I am on your bag.

995
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:47,990
And I'm like,
Hey,

996
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:52,090
so I know my brother or I didn't know
my brother were Ptarmigan hunting this

997
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:56,980
morning. I kind of like, and they say, and
it was like, of course, that makes sense.

998
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,690
Of course we know that that's true. Yeah.
But no, because you did this, we know.

999
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,080
Got to act a certain way and run through
a whole set of things and it's really

1000
00:57:05,081 --> 00:57:08,440
annoying that you had that shit
in your bag. Dumb ass. You know,

1001
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,350
same thing happened to me when I
was going up to Alaska last summer.

1002
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:12,280
I had three rounds,

1003
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:15,860
three or six rounds in a glove pair of
gloves that I just threw in the bag at

1004
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,780
the last minute. And, um, yeah,
they, they took that real seriously.

1005
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,270
They get sniffing around.
There you go.

1006
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,930
There's the no live rounds
in your bags or a night.

1007
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,890
I was, I had no idea. That
can be a problem. Yeah. But

1008
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,990
without the rifle or a gun, they shoot
him on. What was I going to do? Hit uh,

1009
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,220
hit them with a nail biter

1010
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:39,070
but you can't even,
you can't fly with a shotgun choke.

1011
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,040
I just got a new icon.
Choke.

1012
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,100
That's the thing like what a shotgun
barrel on the end of the barrel.

1013
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,900
Like there's a monitor,
there's constriction or not.

1014
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:52,840
And so when you talk about like
you hear the term full choke. Okay.

1015
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:56,290
Full show cause like tightly constricted
anyways. Now they make shotguns.

1016
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:59,230
I have a thread now they made shotguns

1017
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,960
threaded end. Oh yeah. Full choke partial.

1018
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,350
Cause I always go for the full
chunk sodas like improved cylinder,

1019
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,730
modified cylinder, full show,
ski joke. So they make a trend,

1020
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,510
they make it threaded fitting.

1021
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,550
They make a threaded thing on the end
and you can put in variable chokes. Okay.

1022
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,020
That one in the middle has
a variable show. Okay. Why
do I have a boner right now?

1023
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:23,710
That's so weird. You call the one on
the right as variable choke. Oh, I see.

1024
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,450
So yeah. Fix. All right. So anyways,

1025
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,550
you can't fly the choke and I
just think that's ridiculous.

1026
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:32,020
But then I started realizing what have
you in like 20 of your buddies all has

1027
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:35,170
some dinky little shit gone the part
and you're all waiting in line to get on

1028
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:36,970
the plane. That's right.
You're like, well,

1029
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:41,080
it's just a barrel just to barrel on that
day. I was like, I just got a trigger.

1030
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,360
That's why. That's what dad
does. National Security.

1031
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,720
They always talk about now with three d
printers that the threat of being on the

1032
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:48,470
print your own gun. That's a big, yeah,

1033
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,860
I was just talking to someone about
that. Yeah. I got pulled out a line, uh,

1034
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,670
flying to Washington DC from
Madison or no, from Green Bay, uh,

1035
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,863
with,
uh,

1036
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,760
some friends lived in the DC area and
it was going to help him with a patio.

1037
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:08,330
They say, we'll pay for you to come out
if you want to help us with this patio.

1038
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,300
So I'll put that out there if you ever
need any patio work, that kind of stuff.

1039
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:16,790
And I was late getting to the
plane and so I didn't have a,

1040
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,370
I just had both of my bags. I'm was
going to check one and I a Mason's chisel

1041
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,230
in a stone hammer in there. Okay.
So you can't go on there and say,

1042
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:31,330
I'm thinking to myself, oh, Hastings
chisel and hammer stone here, man.

1043
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:34,040
Yeah, you're big enough to
actually kill an entire lane,

1044
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,570
which has two weapons. I know
it's weird. Arbitrary about that.

1045
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:41,630
Like you can't bring a pool cue on,
but you could bring a skateboard.

1046
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,470
And if I had to fight a guy and he
had a pool cue and I had a skateboard,

1047
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:50,200
I will fucking, skateboards are
really hard to break in there.

1048
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,410
It'd be hard to land a shot.
Well,

1049
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:56,000
the pool cue on a guy who's got
escape or by the trucks pull cues,

1050
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,160
break defendant, pool cues break. They
break pretty easy. I've seen guys break,

1051
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,590
get mad at her, a shot and whacked
her stick and snap even the,

1052
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:05,420
but then you can break the bus.
So he could put,

1053
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:08,780
just put some kind of rod inside there
and make it really tough pool cue.

1054
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,130
You could do that.
You could do that,

1055
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:12,200
but I'm assuming they're going to actually
understand where you're calling from.

1056
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:15,650
I mean it's gotta be, but they'll
take to let you take deer antlers on.

1057
01:00:15,651 --> 01:00:18,050
If you've covered the times,
you can wreak havoc.

1058
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:23,510
I put [inaudible] run show gave
shit through the fucking now,

1059
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,820
by the way, by the way, at the head,
there was this story about this huge,

1060
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,870
this huge,
um,

1061
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,340
there's a story he played in the NFL
for a long time as a defensive end.

1062
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,760
He's a giant man. Are you going to
name drop? No, I don't know his name,

1063
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,410
but he got crazy on the plane. What?
Cause he had an, he has, but he's bipolar.

1064
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:46,040
He's a, he's not tried to pull the
door off the plane. Mid Flight.

1065
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:49,340
So he's trying to pull the door
off this child. He's 270 pounds.

1066
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,460
All muscle played in the NFL
and nobody knew what to do.

1067
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,590
He was having an episode finally,

1068
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:57,440
I think instead of attacking him
because everybody would have died,

1069
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,430
the stupidest talked him down to sit down.
He ended up going to jail for it.

1070
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,990
But I think about how scary that would
be with a giant trying to pull a door off

1071
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:08,840
a plane a little bit. Yeah.
Yeah. That's scary shit man.

1072
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:13,520
Because if you get a plane full of
cowards, you really fucked. You know,

1073
01:01:13,521 --> 01:01:16,630
if you get a plane full of cowards are
people with asthma or something and you

1074
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:18,390
didn't go real situation going on now,

1075
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:23,450
but cowards bowling's nothing probably
emboldens the playful of cowards.

1076
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:24,501
Quite like so new.

1077
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:29,501
Trying to rip the [inaudible]
fear overrides the other
feeling how long it takes

1078
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:33,290
to open up a door. It doesn't take that
long. And you know it's actually ready

1079
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,040
vacuum and turning the law. You can't,

1080
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,980
you basically can't do it in mid flight.
Physical power.

1081
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,630
Has Anybody ever done it? No. I'll never
heard of it. You can blow a door off,

1082
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:49,450
but you can't. You know, so,

1083
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:55,050
Oh and also everything Brian
Collins says just getting validated,

1084
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:00,690
unless Brian writes makes all these
[inaudible] USB drive flow is a little

1085
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:06,410
documents. Here's a really cool
piece of trivia. Here's a crazy,

1086
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:08,270
I just found out this is
a crazy piece of trivia.

1087
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:13,370
If you shot a 30 odd six at a plane
window at the cockpit window, it would,

1088
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:17,720
it would stop it. The window. It stopped.
I didn't, that's a problem I should say.

1089
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,510
I mean yeah cause to stop.
Good.

1090
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,900
Cause you could potentially hit
something at four or 500 miles long.

1091
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,270
That's how thick it is.

1092
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,360
It actually would stop a really fucked
is that they go down because of birds.

1093
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,810
Like that's a real common sucking
in the engines. Yeah. Yeah.

1094
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,230
That dude to land in the Hudson.

1095
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:39,290
Do you know how they keep birds away
from runway hunters up higher peep they

1096
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,490
poisoned them and shoot

1097
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,400
[inaudible] what do you
mean to say is like no,

1098
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,990
in addition to that? Well for [inaudible]
say no the fucking guys. Right.

1099
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,410
Well, in addition to that,
in Afghanistan for example,

1100
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:02,910
when you know where they went,
how boom in Kabul and then come to heart,

1101
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,510
where were they? When they, when

1102
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,580
they're always taken off, right.
So how do they keep birds away?

1103
01:03:06,581 --> 01:03:08,980
They had a lot of them. Do you know
if they do take one guest? Come on.

1104
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:12,460
Think that's kind of why I
did better than taking guests.

1105
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:17,230
I just named a litany. But you're, but
you're a liar. So here's the thing. No,

1106
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,010
you're right. But here's what they
do. They get Peregrine Falcons,

1107
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,040
they get to peregrine falcons and they
literally fly the Para Peregrine Fly

1108
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,760
Falcons in a circle around the earth
and they stay the fuck away from, yeah,

1109
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,970
they stay away from the,
from the, from the Falcon I,

1110
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,070
which was surprising to me that all
of them to see the Peregrine Falcon,

1111
01:03:36,071 --> 01:03:37,420
they're like,
I want to stay away from that.

1112
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,840
And all the birds stay down
[inaudible] transmitter on the falcons.

1113
01:03:40,841 --> 01:03:44,260
So Nolan's sucks at news
engine. Well I don't, but they,

1114
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,450
the guy had it on his arm
and that's how they did it.

1115
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:50,500
So that's pretty surprising. I didn't
know that time of European contact,

1116
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,440
we had x number of whitetail
deer living in this country

1117
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,200
and they were nearly
decimated at a point in time.

1118
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,710
Now we have 100 million deer, far, far,

1119
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:07,711
far more white tail deer live here
now than at any time in history.

1120
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,780
Doug will jump in at any point.
When Doug was a kid,

1121
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,810
what was a big deal,
Doug?

1122
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,800
It was a big deal to see
a deer around our area.

1123
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:23,840
Wow. I mean, he would run
home and tell him hello Dan

1124
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,370
car and drive out and mean you go out
in the evening. I mean, we still drive,

1125
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,660
get out in the evening and drive
around and look for deer. But you know,

1126
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:31,320
you're really disappointed if
you don't see any. But, uh,

1127
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,230
you went up north hunting my grandfather.

1128
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,713
MMM.

1129
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,440
Yeah. According to my dad
who never makes anything up,

1130
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,913
uh,

1131
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:44,080
hunted deer would go over to the Baraboo
hills on the edge of the driftless area

1132
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,930
and that was the only place that were
white tail deer. And I, as a kid,

1133
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:49,240
I just don't remember
seeing that many deer.

1134
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:52,360
My Dad used to go up north deer hunting
and they would bring dear back from up

1135
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:56,800
there. But then when I got to be
14 when I was in, um, you know,

1136
01:04:56,801 --> 01:04:58,570
in high school and started
playing basketball and whatnot,

1137
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,103
uh,

1138
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,110
we couldn't go away for opening weekend.

1139
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,060
We went to north the
first couple of years,

1140
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:08,850
so we'd go up north and hunt like
crazy to see one or two deer and,

1141
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:13,070
and not get one. And uh,
so then when I was 14, um,

1142
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,490
we started hunting on the front and
I'm like, wow, look at all these,

1143
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,490
I got a deal right away. Um, but,

1144
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,460
but you're absolutely right
that the management of the,

1145
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:25,660
of the white tail deer in Wisconsin
is a real success story, even though,

1146
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,700
you know,
newspaper articles and,

1147
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,060
and whatnot to the contrary
that it's been such a,

1148
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:31,321
well,

1149
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:34,030
some would argue too much of his success
cause it wasn't till I was like the,

1150
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:37,350
for the last few years, you couldn't
shoot a buck until you killed a doe.

1151
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:41,900
Right. Um, we had a thing called
earn a buck. In fact, we still do.

1152
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,140
After you shoot your first buck,
um,

1153
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,450
Kinda got into that whole thing about
how many tags can you get. And it's like,

1154
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,100
well,
in our area you can get as many,

1155
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,850
you can choose as many deers
you have bullets for. Um,

1156
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,870
but you're absolutely right and
there's such an adaptable creature.

1157
01:05:56,871 --> 01:06:01,590
My sister lives up in the town, a
city called ash caution on it. It's a,

1158
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,610
they live kind of on the
edge of town on that. Really,

1159
01:06:04,611 --> 01:06:08,150
I'm that much to the edge of town, but
there's a little a quarry there and uh,

1160
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:12,410
armory and whatnot.
And they have wildlife problems there.

1161
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,830
A deer and Turkeys both.
Um,

1162
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,740
and they've had to do a whole
thing where they brought in,

1163
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,270
they bring in snipers to shoot him
because there were a bunch of bow hunters

1164
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,670
that said that they would do it.
Well, just let us come in and we'll

1165
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:26,640
do it. We'll be like, well,

1166
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:30,660
why would we have the public do it
when we can pay government [inaudible]

1167
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,900
government officials as a
private private snipe? Why?

1168
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,560
Why would we have the public pay to be
able to do it when we could just pay

1169
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,690
someone else to come in and
do it real discrete and quiet.

1170
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:41,400
That's what's going on
right now in the Hamptons.

1171
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:43,800
The stories coming from the Hamptons,

1172
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:48,100
they have a huge deer problem in the
Hamptons where all these multimillion

1173
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:51,430
dollar estates and China houses up there
and they're going to hire snipers. Yeah,

1174
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:55,530
they're dicking around with trying to
give the deer a conscious contraceptives.

1175
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,460
Higher numbers of dollars are going to
spend trying to eradicate these deer with

1176
01:06:59,461 --> 01:07:01,620
birth control and with snipers.
Wow.

1177
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,310
I had a landscape business in door county,

1178
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,370
which is the thumb of
Wisconsin and you know,

1179
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:09,270
so it's a lot of folks from
Chicago and Milwaukee and Madison.

1180
01:07:09,271 --> 01:07:13,330
We have places up there and one person
would want to raise hostas and all these

1181
01:07:13,331 --> 01:07:17,590
exotic flowers and whatnot and the
next one would want to see deer. So

1182
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:22,470
exactly. I mean you pull into places and
then you'd be laying right in the bed.

1183
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:27,110
My mother in Connecticut,
she spent like literally like,

1184
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:30,260
I don't know how long planting
this beautiful garden.

1185
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,830
I remember getting like flowers
and then the minute they bloom man,

1186
01:07:33,831 --> 01:07:37,100
literally it was just a decimation of
deer came in and just ate them all.

1187
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,760
My mother went to the store to go find
a crossbow cause I want to apply a

1188
01:07:40,761 --> 01:07:42,860
crossbow and the guy goes for what?
She goes,

1189
01:07:42,861 --> 01:07:46,550
cause I want to kill all the deer on my,
uh, on my property. She had a garden.

1190
01:07:46,551 --> 01:07:48,890
It wasn't a big, it wasn't like
it was a yard and the guy goes,

1191
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:52,430
you can't kill a bunch of deer. It's
not legals. He goes, I don't care.

1192
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:53,300
I'm going to kill the deer.

1193
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,280
And then he had to explain to
her like what kind of line.

1194
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,140
It was a little more involved
or more involved in that,

1195
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:00,850
but she literally was going to kill,
you know, she never shot across pope,

1196
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:03,160
but she was gonna. She thought
it'd be easy. The client

1197
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:07,180
and door county, uh, uh, older
woman that um, like the deer,

1198
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,560
but she really liked all her,
her different gardens and whatnot as well.

1199
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:15,100
And somewhere along the line she got
this idea that if you buried wine bottles

1200
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,970
upside down, sticking out of the ground
in a perimeter around your place,

1201
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,600
that the deer would hit those and then
they wouldn't, they wouldn't come in and

1202
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:25,990
for blow their mind and they'd be like,
no way am I going in there

1203
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,760
glass. So she was, yeah, so she was,

1204
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:31,810
she was drinking a lot of wine to
surround that place too. But uh,

1205
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,720
which I may have been a part of the skews,

1206
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,750
but you'd go into here what
they got going on in this area.

1207
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:43,110
Where are we on it in November is you
know what's going on in the state of

1208
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:43,571
Wisconsin,

1209
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:47,220
a bunch of other states that you have
CWD they cause chronic wasting disease.

1210
01:08:47,221 --> 01:08:52,221
Chronic wasting disease is the
deer and elk aversion of mad cow.

1211
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:56,100
So it's with, with Kyle, we say
mad cow or like with Jacob. Jacob.

1212
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:01,020
And then you have, and
sheep scrapey deer and elk,

1213
01:09:01,021 --> 01:09:02,670
they call it chronic wasting disease.

1214
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,910
So how are they so far they haven't
found it. And some people say like,

1215
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:06,750
we wouldn't know yet,

1216
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:11,730
but they haven't found where
any human has contracted,

1217
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,960
you know,
hasn't contracted mad cow from,

1218
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:19,230
well it's Jacob Christ felt in the
human, has a contracted from deer. No,

1219
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,940
it hasn't happened yet,

1220
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:24,030
but a lot of states are taking measures
to try to get a handle on this and

1221
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:26,520
they're,
they're taken where you can't move some,

1222
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,180
some states you can't move deer bones
from other states into the state.

1223
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,730
You can't move to your
bones out of the state. Um,

1224
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:36,450
one thing that could be
driving the transmission of
this is just having way too

1225
01:09:36,451 --> 01:09:41,040
many deer. Another thing that drives
transmission of, of, of deer diseases,

1226
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:44,460
bringing them into like an unnatural
proximity's is baiting dear.

1227
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:47,600
So you go out and put a bunch of corn
down, you get eight deer standing,

1228
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:50,370
their nose, the nose, the nose.
I'll eat eating corn. It's not,

1229
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:54,990
they're not configured in a way that's
really replicable in a natural setting,

1230
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,050
like dear tend to graze a little bit
further apart and they're not sharing.

1231
01:09:58,051 --> 01:10:01,590
Swapping spit quite so much
in Wisconsin.

1232
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,620
Got The CWD area where they're
trying to Cole knock back numbers.

1233
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,430
So we're on the northern edge of what
they call the CWD management zone.

1234
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,560
And actually right before I came out here,

1235
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:17,510
I check the map to see how
close the deal they test your,

1236
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,150
obviously they test here
for um, and it, the,

1237
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:25,720
the latest ones are about three miles
south of the farm. So next year, um,

1238
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:29,330
everything's getting tested. Um,
you'll send the heads in to get tested.

1239
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:32,560
But actually what they did, the friend
of mine actually has a check station now.

1240
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,640
And um, I, and I didn't know that,
um, this year, but uh, she's,

1241
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,230
she was trained to take the lymph nodes
so you don't have to take the head and

1242
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:42,680
do all that kinds of stuff. So it's
much simpler process. But the thing is,

1243
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:45,170
no one really knows what it
means yet. Well, right. And,

1244
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,750
and they have all these recommendations.
You guys remember when,

1245
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:52,790
when we were butchering, we
were, other than the front legs,

1246
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,930
everything was boned and you're staying
and you stay away from the spine and

1247
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,860
that's where you get it, right? So if you
eat them, if you get the meat, you know,

1248
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,733
the preop,

1249
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:04,310
like the pre ounce concentrate in
the brain and brain and spinal fluid,

1250
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,190
spinal column.
So even if it was a deer that had it

1251
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,110
by not, you know, messing with the
spine and whatnot, you'll be okay.

1252
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,350
That's the,

1253
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,440
okay. Because the way they were bumping
it from animal to animal is, you know,

1254
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:20,430
it was like bone meal. So yeah,
that's, that's how your transmitter on.

1255
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:25,730
And one of the big arguments against
Penn raising livestock to have like full

1256
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:31,401
hunting facilities is that CWD jump to
our wild herds from captive animals.

1257
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,900
Um,
I think the ground,

1258
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:40,640
the ground zero was in Wisconsin or
Minnesota since the first time at jump.

1259
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:45,690
Yeah. Uh, uh, south of us. And if
you in Wisconsin. Yeah. So, um,

1260
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,810
on the,
on the south side of the Wisconsin River,

1261
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,710
and it was interesting
because you were a specular,

1262
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,100
had some information that I hadn't
heard before about how it had been

1263
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:59,710
transferred and whatnot,
but raising a whitetail deer as a,

1264
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,510
uh,
as a,

1265
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:06,210
as a domesticated animals
actually become fairly big.

1266
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:07,700
One of the big things is antlers.

1267
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,210
Yeah. Cause he can grow bigger
antlers if you've given them all this

1268
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,120
and whatnot.
And you know,

1269
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:17,121
it's in Wisconsin that is regulated
by the Department of Agriculture,

1270
01:12:17,461 --> 01:12:20,450
trade and consumer protection.
Whereas wild dude,

1271
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,290
so those are domesticated deer in wild
deer are the purview of the Department of

1272
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:30,200
natural resources and the
two don't. So the, the,

1273
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:35,550
the deer farmers want to
stay in the Department of
Agriculture and the DNR would

1274
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:37,530
like to have a little
more control over that.

1275
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,570
Yeah.
Because if you cause like the,

1276
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,240
the wildlife that's held in the public
trust is that detriment from a lot of

1277
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:45,170
that deer.
That's exactly.

1278
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,870
Well, yeah. I'm, I'm always, I'm actually
amazed in the two times I've hunted how,

1279
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:51,820
well,
and maybe I'm wrong about this,

1280
01:12:51,821 --> 01:12:56,800
but how well the government does in
conservation efforts and in policing,

1281
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,170
you know,
the whole hunt game.

1282
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:03,260
Look what happened when we didn't, man,
you got up in the 1920s 1930s and we will,

1283
01:13:03,261 --> 01:13:05,360
we were not just running out,

1284
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:07,700
I mean we are gonna run out
of a lot of game animals.

1285
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:10,820
I mean it was on the horizon that we're
going to lose many, many species of dogs.

1286
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:13,220
We're going to lose the wild Turkey.
I'm going to lose dear. Lose the elk,

1287
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:18,070
lose the big horn sheep all
to hunting on, on on. Yeah,

1288
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,030
the perfect storm of things.

1289
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:24,950
Unregulated market hunting being one of
the, I'm not trying to downplay the role,

1290
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,050
one of the principal factors, but it
was going on in conjunction with a lot,

1291
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,730
you know a lot of habitat
destruction north things, but yeah,

1292
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:34,130
just shooting it and selling it.
Unregulated.

1293
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:37,460
Hunting what animals and then not even
like not regulating what kind of weapons

1294
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:40,460
you use. You could set charges,
pack with ball bearings up in trees.

1295
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,980
The blow roosting turkeys out
of the trees. So he's just like,

1296
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:46,730
it was a free for all.
And it was Daniel Boone man.

1297
01:13:46,731 --> 01:13:51,590
He killed 108 hundred
16 bears in one year.

1298
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:56,070
One time. Hold on. The big on the
Big Sandy and Kentucky. So wow.

1299
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:57,510
Unregulated.

1300
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:02,510
Mark did cause a lot of damage when it
came to 1920 to 1930s that's when we got

1301
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:06,590
this idea where we were going to get
aggressive and we didn't do it a second,

1302
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:07,700
you know too soon.

1303
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,520
And we came up with certain things like
we have hunting bag limits seat like a a

1304
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:17,080
ban on the sale of game wild game. So when
you're, when you go into a restaurant,

1305
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:19,300
when you go and do a wild
game restaurant in the US,

1306
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:24,820
you're getting imported meat or you're
getting farmers where they're taking out

1307
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:27,040
taking d, You're raising them
on the farm, killing them,

1308
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,330
run into as a livestock model on wild
animals and settlement and you're not

1309
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:31,960
getting like,

1310
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,570
I didn't know that hunter killed while
game unless they're importing it,

1311
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,690
you know? But then even now they used to
import a lot of stuff from New Zealand.

1312
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:39,970
But even now, most of that when
you, when you're getting red deer,

1313
01:14:39,971 --> 01:14:40,804
which is like most,

1314
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:45,160
the most common Venice and sold in
restaurants is red deer often from New

1315
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,300
Zealand,
sometimes from Scotland.

1316
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,620
Even the stuff from New Zealand
now they're just, it's just farmed.

1317
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,540
They used to sell some wild stuff, but
the, but the industry's changed so much.

1318
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,460
Is there an animal that is still in
danger of being extinct in this country?

1319
01:14:57,461 --> 01:15:00,850
As far as like grizzlies or not?
There are many,

1320
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:03,820
many animals that are endangered
or become an extinct. But no,

1321
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,680
not no game animals, no game
animals. There's a game animals.

1322
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,550
I mean most of them are expanding or
stable and the states under mandates.

1323
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:13,330
So there's lots of,
there's like little understood.

1324
01:15:13,331 --> 01:15:14,860
I mean there are many like frog species,

1325
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:16,510
all kinds of things that
are in huge trouble.

1326
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,840
Bird species that are in big trouble.
But right now with game animals,

1327
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:22,390
I take that back.
Not in the danger of being extinct,

1328
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:23,890
but in danger of being big trouble.

1329
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:29,510
Sage grouse because of many
manufacturers. Um, sage grouse are,

1330
01:15:29,511 --> 01:15:31,930
are hurting right now and are,

1331
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,960
some people are starting to I at four
for endangered species protection.

1332
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,410
It could have. What about
eagles? Like there's, I mean,
they're not a game. Animal.

1333
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,080
Eagles are kicking it. You mean
Bald Eagles? They're the new cro.

1334
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,820
Oh Man. Yeah, that's, that's
a huge success. The new cro,

1335
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,820
that was something that was really
a big deal to see when I was a kid.

1336
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:55,680
Bald Eagle. We have them come through
the farm all the time. Ddt Man,

1337
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:59,880
all they had to do. What about
Golden Eagles? Hold on a second. DDT,

1338
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:05,160
DDT was killing eggshells too thin. They
crushed, crushed, crushed her own egg.

1339
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,120
So that was what they were using for
pesticides. Just turn it, turn it shit

1340
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,280
around so fast. Yup. Yeah,
yeah. Wow. Not like would docs,

1341
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,240
will they realize the wood ducks?

1342
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:15,610
We almost thought we were going to lose
woodchucks. Well they realize with darks,

1343
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:21,010
old dead trees like wood ducks are cavity
nesting doll. It's kind of a funny,

1344
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:21,731
odd idea.

1345
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:25,090
But this wood duck like lands and damn
tree walks into a hole in the tree and as

1346
01:16:25,091 --> 01:16:29,530
the cavity Nestor, various,
you know, factors at play.

1347
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:33,700
We lost a lot of these big old cavity
trees. We people brought the wood duck

1348
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,610
backed by.
This guys are like the hunt darks,

1349
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,540
going out and building these little
things to look like a mailbox on a post.

1350
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,860
We had a couple of them up.
Well we weren't by those places.

1351
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:45,360
But then even in our forestry program
on the farm, we leave wildlife trees.

1352
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:50,060
Um, and Mark O'Neill, you mark them with
a big w and just got all the guys in it.

1353
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:51,750
If it's got a kv one,

1354
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,110
it's not worth a shit anyways probably
cause you're gonna cut a nude and it's

1355
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:56,400
gonna be rotten wood to wildlife habitat.

1356
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:58,680
But you make these fake ones
by putting a mailbox on a pole,

1357
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:00,250
take some sheet 10 and tack it on her.

1358
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:03,270
So raccoons can climate and all
of a sudden, like overnight, boom,

1359
01:17:03,271 --> 01:17:06,510
wood ducks are back.
No pesticides, certain

1360
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:10,160
pesticides, uh, being, uh, a
problem with bees. Are they doing

1361
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,770
anything about that? Same with
colony collapse disorder. Yeah,

1362
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,940
they've got real issues. So
funny you bring that up. Um,

1363
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,990
one of the things that I'm going to do
when I get back to Wisconsin is too, um,

1364
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:23,260
there is in the, in the
latest farm bill, uh,

1365
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,360
some funding for encouraging
farmers to plant bee friendly

1366
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,990
Forbes in their, in their
pastures. Um, I again,

1367
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:38,990
right by where Ryan and I were hunting
out in that open field, there's,

1368
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,690
I planted about two thirds of an
Acre of, of pollinator habitat. Um,

1369
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,640
what does that mean? Like, like bring
even flowers particular, yeah, pretty,

1370
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:51,020
you know, so that there's, there's flowers
at different stages of the season. Um,

1371
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,840
you know, how much is two thirds of
an acre going to do? I don't know.

1372
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:57,500
But since I'm putting so
much of the farm back into,

1373
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,530
into a conservation reserve program,

1374
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:03,260
which means we're planning it to
grasses and Forbes and whatnot, um,

1375
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:06,200
when I get back,
I'm really going to look into this and

1376
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,560
cause a lot of the interesting things,

1377
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:13,490
a lot of like Alfalfa and clover and
those are things that deer like too.

1378
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:18,140
And Turkey's like and other wildlife like,
and then during the flowering time,

1379
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:19,580
of course,
the Beazer part of it,

1380
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:23,840
but it's kind of cool in this most recent
farm bill in the conservation measures,

1381
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:24,674
it's,
I mean it's not,

1382
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,640
it was like $3 million for the entire
driftless area or the Midwest. I'm sorry,

1383
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:31,190
not just the driftless
area, but um, you know,

1384
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:35,010
when you start to parse that up into bags
of seed that people would go into the

1385
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,630
other,
I'll overseed my pasture with it or yeah,

1386
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,460
that mixed in with my
CRP and whatnot and hell,

1387
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:43,940
I'll do that without them paying me to
do it. So That's interesting. You know,

1388
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:47,540
what I've heard is that there's also
some connection to genetically modified

1389
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:51,920
crops at some crops have been genetically
modified to make them more resistant

1390
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:55,850
to certain bugs and that this is
what's fucking up bs is that well,

1391
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,250
truth in that.
I think there's truth in that.

1392
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,960
The GMO is certainly
could have a part of it.

1393
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,610
We were talking about her daughter at
your daughter before and my daughter who's

1394
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:06,560
17 who's taken the
biotech class right now.

1395
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,170
That's one of the things that
they've been talking about. And I,

1396
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:12,530
my hackles go up when you say GMOs.
And interestingly,

1397
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:15,800
she kind of talked me down from it because
she's, you know, on both sides of the,

1398
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,750
of the thing. I honestly
think that the, um,

1399
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:23,480
pesticides probably have more to
do with it than anything. I mean,

1400
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:28,430
we're using insecticides on everything,
you know, and the idea that, you know,

1401
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:32,450
in our area you saw it who were,
the crops are essentially two things,

1402
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:33,350
corn and soybeans.

1403
01:19:33,650 --> 01:19:38,060
And so you've got these
monocultures and you know, there's,

1404
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:42,730
and they're all, those are all GMOs.
Roundup ready. That's the big, you know,

1405
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,880
the big thing, what does that mean?
Roundup? Roundup herbicide glyphosate,

1406
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:51,840
which is a nonselective herbicide means
it'll kill everything. They recommend it,

1407
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:55,420
but not to cry because it was regarded
as having the toxicity of coffee.

1408
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,410
Yeah.
It's

1409
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:59,330
like if you, if you went to
drink the stuff, you know,

1410
01:19:59,331 --> 01:20:02,420
but [inaudible] been what that's been,

1411
01:20:02,421 --> 01:20:04,750
what people have said
for a long time later.

1412
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,070
Roundup has always been the friendly
herbicide because doesn't it, when it

1413
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,430
hits,

1414
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,430
it does his job on the plant and it goes
into the plant and the plant dies down

1415
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:18,420
and dies. The, the, um, doesn't it grow
itself to death in some way or like, well,

1416
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:22,410
that's right, but the chemical then,
um, doesn't translocate in the soil.

1417
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:25,940
There's chemicals, herbicides and
whatnot. I was just spraying one, um,

1418
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:30,000
a couple of days ago that I'm real careful
with it. I'm out in the woods spring,

1419
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,320
um, uh, basal bark applications
to kill undesirable trees.

1420
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,700
And you're careful with that
stuff. Undesirable trees. Yeah.

1421
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:41,400
What kind of trees are undesirable
in this case? Red Maple.

1422
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:42,780
I remember the woods where we walked,

1423
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:46,350
where all it was just the big giant
trees where it opened up and it was,

1424
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:51,650
I'm trying to regenerate red and white
oak in there and they're red and white

1425
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:54,690
oak are a sun loving
species, so they, they,

1426
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,880
that some needs to hit that
hit the ground. They're real.

1427
01:20:56,881 --> 01:21:00,030
They w oaks don't grow real fast either.
And the first,

1428
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,260
their first two or three years,

1429
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:04,290
they spend all their energy sort
of building the root system.

1430
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:06,120
And then after about their fifth year,
they'll take off.

1431
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:11,190
But in between all this stuff has
grown over the top of them, the, um,

1432
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,661
the,
you know,

1433
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:16,410
the perennial stuff like burdocks and
that kind of stuff don't seem to bother it

1434
01:21:16,411 --> 01:21:20,700
too much. Um, because they're
gone, you know, quite a bit.
But it's the shade of the,

1435
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:24,740
of the other trees. So it's a fast
read. Maple is a faster growing tree,

1436
01:21:24,741 --> 01:21:28,080
so they'll get up over the
top shade out the oaks,

1437
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,620
and if you don't control that,
the red maple,

1438
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:34,590
not sugar maple red maple will take over,
kill the oaks off.

1439
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:37,210
And now you've got red maple.
So were wrong with you.

1440
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:41,690
Get into the deer thing too though.
I mean the deer effect on red. Yeah.

1441
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,750
And the deer, the deer,
the deer effect on, um,

1442
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:50,280
on red and white oak is they
like white oak acorns. In fact,

1443
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:52,680
they prefer white oak
acorns as do turkeys,

1444
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,770
but they like to browse
on red oak seedlings.

1445
01:21:55,771 --> 01:21:57,660
So the oaks just don't stand a chance.

1446
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,400
Part of the reason why we're
trying to kill somebody dear.

1447
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:03,130
You wanted to know why,
why you love Red Oaks?

1448
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,820
Don't like the bagels in the
driftless area. It's the area

1449
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:14,190
drifted the glaciers and mining really
flattened area. I'd keep going down the,

1450
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:18,690
in the driftless area, it's a pathway
from migratory songbirds. First of all,

1451
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,470
and migratory songbirds come up the
Mississippi River and that's that.

1452
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,600
They're traveling long distances,

1453
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:29,760
the oaks or one of their favorite
nesting areas in that sort of thing. So,

1454
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:35,010
um, oaks were a big part of our
forest for, for quite a while.

1455
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:39,570
Um, because of things like
fire and that sort of thing,

1456
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:42,870
which we don't have anymore.
So what's happening is there,

1457
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,780
the percentage of all kinds
of landscape is a lot less.

1458
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,470
So when you have an opportunity or what
we're encouraging land owners through

1459
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:52,980
this network of forest land
owners that I work with,

1460
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,630
when you have an opportunity
to regenerate, okay, you
have a good spot to do it.

1461
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,510
They're not every spot where
oak is growing now isn't
necessarily a good spot to

1462
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:01,344
regenerate oak,

1463
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:05,560
but when you have a good spot to do that
you should because it's disappearing

1464
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:08,200
from our landscape and
it's affecting wildlife,

1465
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:11,320
it's affecting all those sort of things,
but also the migratory songbirds.

1466
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,780
So it's really interesting
how it's all kind of together.

1467
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:15,940
It's fascinating the
management aspect of that,

1468
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:20,110
that people have decided
to take a concerted effort
to make one plant grow and

1469
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:23,330
make another plant dye
and encourage you know,

1470
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,520
you to reduce deer population because
the deer hammering the seedlings,

1471
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:31,460
it's an, it's an advertent effort
to correct an inadvertent wrong,

1472
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,590
I mean so much of our self as like we
have, we live in disturbed ecosystems now.

1473
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:40,490
Like in debt that disturbance brings
about the radically transformed, you know,

1474
01:23:40,491 --> 01:23:41,440
biome that we live in.

1475
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:44,700
Right. Why do we have so many white tail
deer? Well, because we have all these,

1476
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:48,480
we have everything that they need.
They have crops that we have crops.

1477
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:51,870
So we have covered, we have water, we have
all that. You know, you made the comment,

1478
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:55,180
um, I don't know if it was on a
podcast or when we were just talking.

1479
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:58,230
You said they're like, deer here
are so different than the mule deer.

1480
01:23:58,231 --> 01:24:02,940
They're like farm animals that you have
to shoot. Yeah. It's kind of, you know,

1481
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:07,440
that's kind of right. Um, yeah. Deer,
Geese, Turkeys, crows. They really,

1482
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,860
you know, because of farming.
There they are. And there are some,

1483
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,790
there are so many of them. So to my mind
it's sort of a bonus, but the, you know,

1484
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:17,430
that we have that,
but at the same time you can't let it run.

1485
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,660
You can't let any of those species
overrun things. So it's uh, you know,

1486
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:25,350
it's a balancing act.
And so on our 400 acre farm,

1487
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:30,320
even in just a little over 200 acres
of woods, I have like 16 different, um,

1488
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,500
uh,

1489
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:36,500
areas where we're doing different kinds
of management based on what is there

1490
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:41,930
that a hundred years ago you wouldn't
have to, had to have done that.

1491
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,640
We didn't have invasive species, which
is one of the huge issues that we have.

1492
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:50,310
You know, you get to close turn off, you
buy that stuff called multi flora rose.

1493
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:55,380
Um, invasive species
are a big problem. Um,

1494
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:58,130
encouraging the different kinds of,
of,

1495
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:03,300
of trees and therefore encouraging
different kinds of wildlife. It's all in,

1496
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:06,750
it's all a part of it. Um,
unfortunately, you know,

1497
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,680
Brian was saying before that
he thought that the, uh, uh,

1498
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,030
the government agencies are
doing a great job and you know,

1499
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,150
I'd probably get sick,
I'll probably get skewered for this,

1500
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:17,160
but I think that is the case.

1501
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,620
The Department of natural resources in
the state of Wisconsin does a heck of a

1502
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:23,370
job. They're horrible at public
relations, but they're really good.

1503
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:26,840
They're really good at,
um,

1504
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:29,970
counting and understanding numbers and,
and you know,

1505
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:32,580
what are carrying capacity
and it's an inexact science.

1506
01:25:32,581 --> 01:25:34,340
It's not our friend pet Stephen,

1507
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:37,360
my friend Pat Dirk and writes about this
a lot and one of the things he says are

1508
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:40,230
our hunters out there who
think it's like a bathtub.

1509
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,260
Like you can turn the water on to get
more deer and then you shut it off and

1510
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,840
then you can pull the plug in.
That's not really the case.

1511
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:51,000
And you'll hear grumbling hunters talk
about how the dnrs killing all the deer.

1512
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:55,410
Well, I, you know, honestly, I've never
seen the department of natural resources.

1513
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:56,830
Yeah. Every, yeah, every state's got it.

1514
01:25:56,831 --> 01:26:00,160
So you get like a department of
fish and game department, fish,

1515
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:00,940
wildlife and parks or

1516
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:04,550
the government agency that's controlling,
um, hunting in each, in each place.

1517
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,410
Could you elaborate though
when you were saying this,

1518
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:11,090
cause I want to know how are they bad
at public relations? Um, when CWD start,

1519
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:14,610
when CW, the chronic wasting
chronic wasting disease, um,

1520
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,350
was discovered in Wisconsin. It's only
really only been in the last 12 years.

1521
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:21,800
Let's, yeah, in the
early two thousands, um,

1522
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:26,060
one of the things that they came out with
was we need to eradicate the disease.

1523
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:29,180
In order to do that, we have to kill
all the deer in this area. Well,

1524
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:32,710
if my farm was in that area, I'm not
going to be, I'm going to say, well,

1525
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,360
I don't know if we need to. I mean you
said there's a couple of sick dear,

1526
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:37,160
do we need to kill all the deer?

1527
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:40,970
And then they kind of went into this sort
of heavy handed government attitude of

1528
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:45,630
here's what we really need
to do. Um, whereas you,

1529
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,740
you probably realize this, that
you were here, you weren't,

1530
01:26:48,741 --> 01:26:51,660
we weren't really following
government regulations on our farm.

1531
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,270
Look at that deer,
deer,

1532
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:58,220
that's a deer with CWC dam and
that, by the way, by the way,

1533
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:02,390
by the way, Mr [inaudible] that
came from from farms, correct?

1534
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,830
Like that came from Deere farms,
right?

1535
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,150
Well, I came across some
livestock. It's alive.

1536
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,260
It's a Eurasian livestock
diseases cross to, um,

1537
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:16,600
got into some wild herds or I'm sorry,
got into some domesticated deer.

1538
01:27:16,601 --> 01:27:17,291
Hurts.
Yeah.

1539
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:22,291
Domesticated deer kept kept captivities
captivity but was not originally on a

1540
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:25,840
commercial facility. It wasn't like a
guy out there trying to sell fo hunts.

1541
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:30,760
It was a research facility and there were
deer coming up and smelling knows what

1542
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:33,250
the deer inside his research facility.
And that's what they think.

1543
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,950
Correct me if I'm wrong. This is, this
is everywhere on the web for you guys.

1544
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:41,830
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hold on a second. That,
so the, the, there's a fence between the,

1545
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:45,260
the domesticated deer and the wild deer
and they touched each other somehow or

1546
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:47,570
another. There's a fence. I don't,

1547
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:51,020
I really don't have knowledge
of that because it's, I, I've,

1548
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,560
I've asked a lot of questions about where,
how did this start in Wisconsin?

1549
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:59,180
There's a lot of people don't seem to
have the answer and you don't get that

1550
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:02,630
answer from the government guys.
And then you talk to the private guys.

1551
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:07,310
But if you go into southwest
Wisconsin, there's a area, um, um, uh,

1552
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:10,710
county there, and the town that
I'm thinking of is Hollandale.

1553
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:14,300
And if you look at a CWD map, you'd
just, it just, it was just massive.

1554
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:18,020
So there was a, you know, sort of
ground zero, um, and I don't know

1555
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,860
how many states is it in Novo?

1556
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:25,310
Well, it's in Illinois now too, but they
speculated this came from out west is,

1557
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:30,050
I mean the thought really well because he
had been in, there you go. Yeah. Yeah. So,

1558
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,220
wow,
that's crazy.

1559
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:36,680
Our farm is up where the CWD or some
other states have had some CWD farm is

1560
01:28:36,681 --> 01:28:37,170
where the,

1561
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:41,540
the top part of the D is on CWD behind
the thing and they're right in there.

1562
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:46,430
Yeah. So that's where it, um,
so that's six, 10 in 2005.

1563
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:50,320
And if you were to find a, uh, a
more recent map in the DNR has,

1564
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,350
has those out there. Um, it, it, it's
just spreading and it's being spread.

1565
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:56,620
And I,

1566
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,290
this makes sense to me that there are
so many deer in some areas that they're,

1567
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,280
especially young bucks are getting pushed

1568
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,930
out because you know,

1569
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,470
big daddy doesn't want them around and
so they get pushed out and they're the

1570
01:29:07,471 --> 01:29:11,710
ones who are um, there you go.
This scary disease man. Um,

1571
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,781
we don't know.

1572
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:16,260
But that's the thing is like we don't
know if it is or not because there are all

1573
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:19,530
manner of wildlife diseases,
some imported, some,

1574
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:24,710
some that have always been here that
periodically come through and wipe out.

1575
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,000
You know, 70, 80, 90%. You got
blue tongue tularemia in rabbits,

1576
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:32,790
all kinds of things like now.
And then you get a bunch of animals,

1577
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,480
the animals get sick, a ton of
them die. You have some disease,

1578
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,090
disease tolerant individuals
and it comes back.

1579
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,940
One thing we try to do when I say we,
like I worked for the government.

1580
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:43,800
One thing that,

1581
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,120
that our wildlife model generally tries
to do is take out some of the peaks and

1582
01:29:48,121 --> 01:29:50,390
valleys, you know, um,

1583
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:55,740
I'm impatient with people who get to
easily overly critical with state fish and

1584
01:29:55,741 --> 01:29:56,431
game agencies.

1585
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:00,000
Whereas I think in the United States
of America do a pretty phenomenal job

1586
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:00,541
considering,

1587
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:04,380
and when Doug talks about like bad public
relations is you make some management

1588
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:07,250
decisions and the way guys find
out about the management decisions,

1589
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,320
they open up the rule books. There's
no explanation of why. It's just like,

1590
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,700
it might be that, you know what
dude, you can't kill. You know,

1591
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:17,370
used to be able to kill a doe.
Now you can't kill a don't county.

1592
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,310
Everybody gets really mad. And they
could go down and be like, why is that?

1593
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:23,790
And there'd be some really well thought,
scientifically based decision about,

1594
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,770
wow is a bad idea for this year to do it.

1595
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:28,080
But people just see it and
they go like, oh, it's the,

1596
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:32,410
it's the right wing is the left wing.
It's the Cuckoo's, you know, [inaudible].

1597
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:36,090
They don't really even bother to really
put forth like why we're making these

1598
01:30:36,091 --> 01:30:39,810
decisions we're making and insurance
companies, insurance triple a,

1599
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:41,970
I shouldn't point out one individually.

1600
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,270
Insurers are generally a force for
wanting less Deere agricultural interests.

1601
01:30:47,731 --> 01:30:49,960
I'm generalizing agricultural
interests with Jerilyn,

1602
01:30:49,961 --> 01:30:53,910
your force running less Deere guys that
want to go out and hunt or generally

1603
01:30:53,911 --> 01:30:54,960
forced one more year.

1604
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,050
But I heard that the,
that,

1605
01:30:56,051 --> 01:31:00,540
that the biggest pollution source of
pollution I may be wrong is not even cars

1606
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:04,410
or anything. It's agricultural runoff.
Like that's, that's the big threats.

1607
01:31:04,411 --> 01:31:08,370
Hog farms are bad, right? Am I
wrong about that? Fertilizer,

1608
01:31:08,371 --> 01:31:10,990
phosphorous in the fertilizer going
into the water source, you know,

1609
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:12,960
those sort of things
that cue nitrates in the,

1610
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:17,160
in many years in the water yet in that,
that's a huge concern. I mean, yeah.

1611
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,990
Can you tell that story about that trout
stream in that God had all that frozen

1612
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:21,780
knurling and out?
Can you tell that story?

1613
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:25,700
Well, so, uh,

1614
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:31,330
south of us there's a class one trout
stream and a guy names like titties,

1615
01:31:31,731 --> 01:31:35,570
trout fishing. Yeah. Well for
southwest Wisconsin. Anyway.

1616
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:40,760
What does that good, good. Oh,
titties Michigan in Michigan for two.

1617
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:45,230
That's an expression. But
it's hilarious. Titties lady.

1618
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:50,840
Like that car is Cherry. That stream
is titties. I haven't heard that.

1619
01:31:50,841 --> 01:31:53,000
I've heard Cherry. Yeah. But
if it's chuck full of fish,

1620
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:55,120
if you're feeding your
car with chuck this,

1621
01:31:55,121 --> 01:31:59,560
you'd be like brushing their titties
in Michigan. Apparently in Wisconsin.

1622
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:02,880
It's nobody says no Steve
or analysis titties.

1623
01:32:02,881 --> 01:32:05,890
He's he like my wife's
nickname, man. I'll pull it up.

1624
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:11,340
Saved like that on my phone.
Nothing wrong with that. So, uh,

1625
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,570
what are we talking about?
Oh, tell him the story about
boat. Like a, just a, like a,

1626
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,820
like a occurrence, you
know. Okay. So what happened

1627
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,580
that was, uh, their, their uh,
storage maneuver, storage, uh,

1628
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:26,810
regulations and whatnot in times when
you're supposed to spread manure times

1629
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:29,570
when you're not, and then we get these
huge megafarm, it's like, you know, again,

1630
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:32,510
when I was going to be,
you saw that barn and that milk cows,

1631
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:36,940
we milk 40 cows in there. Well, 40
cows in the barn during the wintertime.

1632
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:37,221
You know,

1633
01:32:37,221 --> 01:32:40,590
once a day you'd go out with a load of
manure and spread it on the fields and

1634
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,840
you know,
it wasn't that big of a deal.

1635
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,320
Now you're talking about
thousands of cows in a barn,

1636
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:50,600
liquid manure going to these huge storage
facilities and there's semis driving

1637
01:32:50,601 --> 01:32:53,420
this stuff around. Well, in
this instance, this wasn't,

1638
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:58,421
this was like sort of a medium
sized Pharma but 500 milk cows.

1639
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:03,650
So the guy was doing things pretty much
right, spread manure, but he spread it on,

1640
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,830
on frozen,
uh,

1641
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:11,260
snow and ice and whatnot with a buffer
strip back from the trout stream.

1642
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:16,010
But it rained and melted into the trout
stream that went and wiped them out.

1643
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,920
All those fish went tits up,
such as I was still tits,

1644
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,820
tits up. So did some justice.

1645
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:30,940
I'm learning so much. Yeah. So,

1646
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:36,440
you know, one would argue, well, let's,
we should be regulating that. Well, right.

1647
01:33:36,441 --> 01:33:39,200
But then there's the concern that
while we're regulating things to death,

1648
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,980
and this sort of goes back to the
deer hunting thing, um, you know,

1649
01:33:42,981 --> 01:33:47,690
in the eighties and nineties, the deer
population went, just peeked in Wisconsin.

1650
01:33:47,691 --> 01:33:51,470
Is just huge. I mean, you saw, you
saw, you thought you saw a lot of um,

1651
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:54,170
do your opening day and by the way,
you didn't,

1652
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:59,180
by the way, by the way. Yeah.

1653
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:03,330
I mean there were days when I would
see 75 year opening day they would come

1654
01:34:03,331 --> 01:34:07,300
running through a group would come
running through. Yeah. Um, and,

1655
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:10,050
and it's not good though, right?
No, it's not good. That's the point.

1656
01:34:10,051 --> 01:34:12,230
Somewhere in between is,
is there's a balance.

1657
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,330
You guys get pretty used to that guys
get used to it. That's exactly right.

1658
01:34:15,331 --> 01:34:17,310
I'll go out and sit and while I
want to see it here, when I go out,

1659
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,000
I'm on the shoot

1660
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,830
on every time. Well, you know, then they
call it shooting and killing, not hunting.

1661
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,380
You know,
you

1662
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:23,491
know,

1663
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:27,130
it's interesting during this podcast I
put up a picture on Instagram or that pig

1664
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:31,870
that I shot and I have had a fucking
tidal wave of people mad at me.

1665
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:36,640
Is that right pig? Not cool man. Dude.

1666
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:37,331
I mean,

1667
01:34:37,331 --> 01:34:42,290
I don't know how many of them are cause
you shop all day because you shot a non

1668
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:46,060
native animal that these guys have been
eating their entire fricking life in

1669
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:50,590
bacon form and had the audacity to like
actually come face to face with the

1670
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:54,760
animal. Yeah, I mean the, the, this,
the fucking comments on, on Instagram,

1671
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:58,040
it's quite hilarious.
Just tap tapping way

1672
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,740
over their self righteous shit.
Heads come on.

1673
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,320
[inaudible] you need a filter thing.

1674
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:07,700
Like where you can filter out everyone
who's not vegan and then like at least go

1675
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:11,810
like, okay the vegans, you know,
they have some moral right.

1676
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:14,540
Some consistency, you know,
I don't even think it's sad.

1677
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:17,300
I mean it's just like people just
don't want to see a dead animal.

1678
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,163
They don't want to see it.

1679
01:35:18,580 --> 01:35:22,640
It's this weird disconnect that we
have that we talked about on your show.

1680
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:25,880
We this weird disconnect that people
have about their food and they feel,

1681
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:29,090
even if they're, they're meat eaters
and if they're wearing leather shoes,

1682
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,360
they feel like they can take the moral
high ground and say there's something

1683
01:35:32,361 --> 01:35:33,410
wrong with you posing.

1684
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,470
Especially because apparently people don't
like the fact that I'm smiling. I say,

1685
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:39,140
you're going to me. You're
glad you're, aren't you glad?

1686
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:42,560
Because it just got all kinds of pork.
Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy. Grin.

1687
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:47,480
I got 200 pounds of pork and a I shot
at at five 15 we have 15 minutes left in

1688
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:50,370
the day. It was the last chance
of romance. No, you should.

1689
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:53,140
You should apologize for being
happy about having a windfall of me.

1690
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,950
It looks like a good shot. It was a
great shot. I'm sorry, I'm picking,

1691
01:35:55,951 --> 01:36:00,320
never knew what was going on. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I shot a pig perfectly.

1692
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:02,650
160 yards and I didn't cry and I'm crying.

1693
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:05,810
I'm coming over to eat some of that
today. Come on. I've got a smoker, man.

1694
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,640
I bought a beautiful western smoker.

1695
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:12,470
I'm brining the pig as we as we speak
and brining a ham. Nice. Why don't we,

1696
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:16,850
why don't we farm venison
the way we farm cows?

1697
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,390
Paying attention.

1698
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:23,360
[inaudible] I know we do,
but I I,

1699
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,100
but we don't do it a lot is
what I'm saying. Like, well,

1700
01:36:25,101 --> 01:36:27,350
I'm surprised that we don't,
it's such good meet.

1701
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:29,210
Why don't we do it as
much as we do with calcium

1702
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,330
problem with,
um,

1703
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:35,000
one thing is prom with
disease transmission.

1704
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:37,830
We've been talking about and there's the,

1705
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:41,300
there's a thing where there's an
aesthetic issue and there is that,

1706
01:36:41,301 --> 01:36:44,420
I mean there's, there's a
demand for it. The demands met,

1707
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:45,740
there's arguments to be made before.

1708
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:51,370
One of the arguments against it is we
have like an obligation to protect native

1709
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:57,380
wildlife. Right. All right.
So keep it native and there's,

1710
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,940
and there's a heritage of having these
animals as wild animals of some people

1711
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:06,810
feel, myself included, is some
people feel is that there's a,

1712
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,950
that these ants, there's a sacredness
of these animals as wild creatures,

1713
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:14,390
you know, and we try to like
foster their wellbeing. And

1714
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,250
from a practical standpoint, um, you know,
I don't know how much you guys noticed,

1715
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:24,360
but there's some fences around the, the
barnyard and whatnot at our place there,

1716
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:29,370
four strand Barb wire fences and it kinda
mediocre fences is what I would put,

1717
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,430
the cattle won't bother.

1718
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:34,260
They just walk over to him as
long as cattle got hay in the,

1719
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,020
in the band and whatnot is what kind
of walk over and you might get the

1720
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:39,390
occasional ones like ah,
I think I wanted to get out today.

1721
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,030
Yeah,

1722
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:42,790
like the one that destroyed almost ended
your marriage cause they your wife's

1723
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:46,310
guard. Yeah. Well I left the gate
open so it wasn't really that,

1724
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:50,320
that almost ended your
marriage. It's fucking shaky.
Is that ground you're saying?

1725
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:55,110
[inaudible] it was,
yeah.

1726
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,170
Well it was a beautiful car,

1727
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,260
Huh? He was a hanging garden.
There was a hanging garden.

1728
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:01,620
I should say something
about my wonderful wife.

1729
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:04,100
Most feature's actually really cool.
Yeah.

1730
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:06,620
She was very understanding
of the whole thing after her.

1731
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:11,100
You have to understand that she puts so
much time and energy and love into that

1732
01:38:11,101 --> 01:38:13,410
garden. You've, you want
to see my wife smile,

1733
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:17,010
call her name when she's in her garden
and her head will come up and she'll

1734
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:19,920
smile. That she just fucking
fun. It's good for you man.

1735
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:22,440
Much like hunting in a way.

1736
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:25,490
There's a primal sort of a
connection that we have to gardening.

1737
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:30,390
We grow our own food in my house, we grow
tomatoes, we have cucumbers, Broccoli,

1738
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:32,880
and it's delicious.
We Cook it needed.

1739
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,720
It's a some really satisfying
about growing something
and put your hands in the

1740
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:41,250
dirt and it's equally satisfying
hunting your own food. Yeah. You know,

1741
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:43,740
I know a lot of people don't like
that cause the hunting park cause they

1742
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:48,000
connected to cruelty, but uh,
it's, it's a primal thing.

1743
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,170
It's a primal thing.
Oh,

1744
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:53,280
I should point out that even though a
lot of people have been angry at me way

1745
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:54,570
more people are supporting me,

1746
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,500
I should say that a lot of people
like to focus on the negative way more

1747
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:00,300
positive comments.
I've,

1748
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:04,980
that picture went up 10 minutes
ago is 3,950 likes already.

1749
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,070
Yeah.
So it's more positive than negative,

1750
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,510
but there's just a lot of hypocritical
bullshit out there and you got to take

1751
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:15,210
the hit in order to sort of
get that subject out there.

1752
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,520
It's one of the things about it that I,

1753
01:39:17,521 --> 01:39:20,670
I find a men now it's
up to 4,000 as we speak.

1754
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:25,560
One of the things that I
think is important is to
take that hit is to get that

1755
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:28,980
conversation going and I think a lot of
people that said the negative things,

1756
01:39:28,981 --> 01:39:30,960
then they,
it's a knee jerk thing.

1757
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:34,200
It's because we've been shielded
from where food comes from.

1758
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:38,310
We've been shielded from how do you get
meat, but you don't get meat from a seed.

1759
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:42,200
Okay. You get get meat from an animal
and it has to die in order for me to,

1760
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:45,540
and the seat you're sitting in and you
and your shoes, you're wearing no shit.

1761
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,640
Right?
I got these motherfuckers at office depot.

1762
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:49,380
How many cows had a die for this?

1763
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:52,180
Nobody has a problem with me wearing
a murdered animal. Animal Skin.

1764
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:57,220
If you got a photo of you smiling with
the new leather couch noted, give a shit.

1765
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:01,550
Right? That's so true, right? No one's
smiling from your cash. You're really,

1766
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:05,800
you're on cow skin. Have a steak from
the supermarket and you're smiling.

1767
01:40:05,801 --> 01:40:06,460
I'm cooking.

1768
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:11,200
I've put up a hundred pictures
of me cooking on the grill
with a big smile on my

1769
01:40:11,201 --> 01:40:12,610
face.
No one cares.

1770
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:16,470
You have one picture of the actual
intact animal and you can see his face.

1771
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,200
It's like,
I have this joke about how you,

1772
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:20,440
you can kill an animal
but you can't fuck it.

1773
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:25,220
But what you can do is kill it and
cut it into a bite size portion,

1774
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:26,920
meal size portion and jerk off with it.

1775
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:29,650
You can use that to wrap it
around your Dick and jerk off.

1776
01:40:29,651 --> 01:40:32,800
And no one could really say
anything because we have this weird,

1777
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:35,590
we have weird disconnect.
You would not going to jail for that.

1778
01:40:35,591 --> 01:40:38,260
Can't go to jail for jerking off with
a chicken cutlet. But if they call you,

1779
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:40,120
caught you in the middle
of fucking a chicken,

1780
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:43,420
most likely a cop's gonna fucking
take you down and have a talk.

1781
01:40:43,421 --> 01:40:46,570
At least at the very least, they're going
to go with the fuck is wrong with you.

1782
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,400
I'm tired of my hands.

1783
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:52,540
I want to call my friend right now as a
common San Francisco caught yet, dude,

1784
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:53,980
fucking at this picture.
Here's

1785
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,800
another thing that Steve Vernella and I
had a conversation about the other day

1786
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:59,410
about,
about people who complain about hunting.

1787
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:04,830
But every fucking restaurant except for
a tiny percentage serves me like you're,

1788
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:10,480
you're dealing with murder houses
all over the country. I mean,

1789
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:14,320
essentially animal murder houses
every fucking burger king,

1790
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:18,610
every McDonald's, every other,
almost every regular restaurant,

1791
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:23,140
Coco's fucking Red Barn, whatever
it is that you're serving food at.

1792
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:27,070
Those are murdered animals. But we
have this weird disconnect. The,

1793
01:41:27,071 --> 01:41:30,490
this is a picture of me with duck
in the window. No one complained.

1794
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:33,610
No one complained. Why? Because
I didn't kill those ducks.

1795
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:36,310
That was you and I when we
were in Toronto. Ooh, yummy.

1796
01:41:36,311 --> 01:41:39,610
We're going to eat Chinese food. No
one gives a shit. Oh, that's great.

1797
01:41:39,611 --> 01:41:42,820
I love the Anthony Bourdain show.
He goes and eats it a bunch of places.

1798
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:46,030
He eats murder. That's what he's
eating. He's eaten murder everywhere.

1799
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:50,230
But we are shielded because we're a bunch
of fucking babies were shielded from

1800
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:50,440
that.

1801
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:54,340
Well, there's certainly a hypocrisy
to it. Um, one of my, uh, uh,

1802
01:41:54,630 --> 01:41:58,670
an old friend of mine, uh, was eating
veal ordered veal one night. And,

1803
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:03,490
and I'm not a big fan of Villanova
because I've been a part of raising them.

1804
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:08,380
We had a neighbor who he used to raise
the braised veal and honestly it was,

1805
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,910
to me it was inhumane. And, uh, anyway,
uh, I said to this friend of mine, Geez,

1806
01:42:12,911 --> 01:42:16,600
you know, you know about
how veal is raised and how
it's handled and everything.

1807
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,480
He took a cut out of it, put his
mouth, said this one is already dead.

1808
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,730
So tell these guys about that. Tell
these guys about that, that time you,

1809
01:42:26,731 --> 01:42:30,670
uh, did that cost them slot or for that
person gave him a picture of the thing?

1810
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,730
So, um, uh, some, some years ago,

1811
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,400
um, we, uh, I,

1812
01:42:39,710 --> 01:42:44,710
I gave some relatives a half
of a beef for a present and uh,

1813
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:50,230
so I delivered some of the meat already
and we are bringing the rest of it.

1814
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:54,370
And they were going to have this big
meal while they had just beautiful steaks

1815
01:42:54,371 --> 01:42:56,530
and roasts mean they made several things,
wonderful cooks,

1816
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,750
and they invited the
neighbors over and here's,

1817
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,280
they bring their couple
of daughters along. And,

1818
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:05,650
and on the farm we had a pen
that we always raised. This one,

1819
01:43:05,651 --> 01:43:09,100
we had a lot of cattle around where
we always were. We always raised,

1820
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:13,000
I'm the one that was going
to be slaughtered because
in those days we weren't

1821
01:43:13,001 --> 01:43:16,360
doing the grass fed thing. We're
giving them corn and whatnot. And the,

1822
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:19,060
the catalog had the same name was dinner.

1823
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:24,640
And so I had taken a Polaroid picture
of this steer before I had it butchered

1824
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,670
and wrote on the bottom of it dinner.

1825
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:31,780
And so in presenting the meat at that
dinner that night and these neighbors were

1826
01:43:31,781 --> 01:43:35,080
there with a couple of young girls that
grow on was maybe 10 and the other one

1827
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:37,200
12, um, you know,

1828
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:41,140
we're about to begin eating and I make
the presentation and I hand him a picture

1829
01:43:41,141 --> 01:43:44,140
of dinner. And so the girl,
and that's all they, you know,

1830
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:45,290
they didn't think anything of it,

1831
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,280
just pass it around the table
and one girl would need it.

1832
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:52,940
And last I heard she was still a
vegetarian. She couldn't do that, um,

1833
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,050
connection or no, didn't, couldn't
believe that that's what you're doing.

1834
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:58,610
On the other hand,
my,

1835
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:02,930
I wanted to say something about this
whole thing with people eating meat and,

1836
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:06,200
and not, you know, being a part of it and
whatnot. So I live in Madison, Wisconsin,

1837
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:10,070
which is a very liberal town. And, uh,

1838
01:44:10,071 --> 01:44:11,840
the east side of Madison is particularly,

1839
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,990
but there's a food co op over
there that our friend Carl,

1840
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:19,980
our friend Carl Malcolm, uh, did a
learn to hunt program through. Yeah.

1841
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,540
And it was wildly successful.
Um,

1842
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:28,810
and so in Madison where I know an awful
lot of people and most of meat meat,

1843
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,590
very few of them hunt.
But none of,

1844
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:37,040
I can't think of anyone who has a
problem with me doing it. In fact,

1845
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:38,450
they'll ask about it and whatnot.

1846
01:44:38,451 --> 01:44:43,451
So even the vegetarians and
vegans that I know are pretty,

1847
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,090
you know, they're pretty okay
with it. My, my comment is eyes.

1848
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:49,010
I don't have any objection
to what you're doing.

1849
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:53,960
And I re read pollens article from the
New Yorker they posted the other day and

1850
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:58,610
it was, was just a wonderful,
it was a long read. But um,

1851
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:03,370
intelligence, the intelligence of plants
and how they adapt. And so wait a minute,

1852
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:07,030
you know,
it's just a different Darwin vegans,

1853
01:45:07,031 --> 01:45:09,880
just because they don't have
a brain doesn't mean they
don't have a certain kind

1854
01:45:09,881 --> 01:45:11,110
of intelligence.
Not only that,

1855
01:45:11,111 --> 01:45:14,200
it's been proven that plants
actually can make calculations.

1856
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:18,040
Cotton plants are not as simple as a rock.
You know,

1857
01:45:18,041 --> 01:45:20,380
we'd like to think that in eating a plant,

1858
01:45:20,530 --> 01:45:24,820
you're not eating anything that's alive,
but you are, you have to eat life,

1859
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:26,410
life consumes life.

1860
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:30,010
We just have this ability to differentiate
between the life of an animal that we

1861
01:45:30,011 --> 01:45:33,220
believe has emotions or we'd
think has feelings and plants.

1862
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:38,290
They can get roots to grow
toward the sound. The sound
of running water. Yeah. Wow.

1863
01:45:38,530 --> 01:45:39,363
They'll steer in that.

1864
01:45:39,490 --> 01:45:43,000
There's a type of intelligence and plants
that we don't understand and that's

1865
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:46,300
also bad fertile sons of bitches. A friend
of mine read that article and he goes,

1866
01:45:46,301 --> 01:45:48,270
man, I just never thought of
how stressful most people,

1867
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:53,280
when I fire up my lawn mower
[inaudible] when you take mushrooms,

1868
01:45:56,681 --> 01:46:00,670
it's one of the things you experienced
is this weird connection with that fungus

1869
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:03,520
and you know, obviously a fungus
is not quite the same as a plant.

1870
01:46:03,521 --> 01:46:07,420
In fact funguses or actually more
closely related to animals and the art of

1871
01:46:07,421 --> 01:46:07,841
plants,

1872
01:46:07,841 --> 01:46:11,470
but there's some weird thing that's going
on while you're eating a mushroom and

1873
01:46:11,471 --> 01:46:13,990
part of you know, the,
the psychedelic Glor.

1874
01:46:13,991 --> 01:46:17,590
What people believe is that
you're communicating with
is this plant by eating it.

1875
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:22,260
They also believed that about Iowasca
Iowasca the common atory plant beverage

1876
01:46:22,261 --> 01:46:25,900
that everybody goes down to Peru and
Brazil to take and have these visionary

1877
01:46:25,901 --> 01:46:26,734
experiences.

1878
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:31,980
They believe that you're experiencing
some sort of intelligent connection to the

1879
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:34,330
spirit world through this vehicle.

1880
01:46:34,331 --> 01:46:37,720
This plant vehicle plants
aren't as simple as, you know,

1881
01:46:37,721 --> 01:46:41,620
everybody likes to think that, oh
you eat broccoli. It's so Karma free.

1882
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,630
You know that might be the only way to
eat Karma free is to eat shit. All right.

1883
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,990
If you want to go around eating shit,

1884
01:46:46,991 --> 01:46:50,130
that might be Karma for
what organisms you would

1885
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,360
switch to eating.

1886
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:56,220
What are the next step is you would
switch to eating like non terminal

1887
01:46:56,221 --> 01:47:00,150
productions for plants. Mila, you
need apples. You wouldn't eat,

1888
01:47:00,151 --> 01:47:01,680
you wouldn't eat rubella.
But that Jane's,

1889
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:04,740
the Jane's like those fierce yoga
is like those, those sacks with eat.

1890
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:08,730
They will never eat onions or potatoes
and things because that's the route to

1891
01:47:08,731 --> 01:47:10,000
life source,
the light source.

1892
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:13,470
So what they do is they eat everything
that grows above the ground so you are

1893
01:47:13,471 --> 01:47:16,330
allowed to eat anything that
will regenerate so you can eat.

1894
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:20,990
Leave leaf is actually, I had an aunt
who was fucking crazy. She's funny.

1895
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:24,120
She's not my aunt anymore. They
got divorced. She's fucking crazy.

1896
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:28,950
And she's a fruitarian. Oh, nice. She
probably has no blood in his body.

1897
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,810
How should I? She on his Ip, she was so,

1898
01:47:31,811 --> 01:47:35,610
but she was one of those really fucking
annoying people that like you couldn't

1899
01:47:35,611 --> 01:47:38,580
have a ham sandwich around her.
She would just start talking shit about,

1900
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:42,720
do you know how they treat those animals?
You knew that you have to murder in. Oh,

1901
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:44,910
fucking Christ.
It was just this craziness.

1902
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:48,930
But the bottom line is the what people
don't want to take into account.

1903
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:52,890
What they want to say is, hey, you
shouldn't kill an animal and eat it. Okay.

1904
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:56,490
Should we ever kill animals? No.
Okay, you should never kill animals.

1905
01:47:56,670 --> 01:48:00,660
What are we going to do with all
these animals? Fucking, yeah,

1906
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:03,840
we can stop that from fucking,
are we going to control the population?

1907
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:06,210
What are we going to do about
predators will, well, you know,

1908
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:09,270
let nature control on it. Do you
know how nature controls populations?

1909
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:12,660
They fucking eat them while they're
alive. All right. Coyotes. There's a,

1910
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:15,930
there's a video that I found online. It's
a crazy video. Maybe you could find it,

1911
01:48:16,050 --> 01:48:18,060
but these two D or get locked up,

1912
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:20,310
they were battling and they
were national horns together.

1913
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,020
Then they got locked up and
while they're locked up,

1914
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:26,340
a lot of times they can't get unlocked
because the horns are organic. They flex,

1915
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:29,310
the antlers are organic, they flex and
move. And if you hit it the right way,

1916
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:32,730
they can get connected. The point it's
really difficult to get untangled.

1917
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,640
So while these two deer,
we're going at it and they got locked up,

1918
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:38,270
coyotes ate one of them a lie.
Wow.

1919
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:43,110
So one deer is like gutted and its legs
are half missing and the other deer is

1920
01:48:43,111 --> 01:48:44,130
like connected to him.

1921
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:48,780
Fucking freaked out and these hunters
came along and disconnected these two.

1922
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:53,100
That's what you're going to get if you
don't get hung up just that bad though.

1923
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,040
Well not bad to people because
people aren't involved in that.

1924
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:58,350
But I'm saying I'm not
like I don't go like,

1925
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,860
oh we need to get rid of predators
cause there's still mean to animals.

1926
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:06,010
But I feel like it's a treat to watch it.
When I watched the two deer here,

1927
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:07,920
I don't know if that's
the very specific video,

1928
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:11,250
but there are situations also like in
certain indigenous cultures where you

1929
01:49:11,251 --> 01:49:15,330
can't grow anything. Tell Eskimos
to be vegetarians. You're basically,

1930
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:20,070
you have to eat the animals in parts of
the Middle East where you're not growing

1931
01:49:20,071 --> 01:49:23,280
anything in on the topography of the land.
You have to live off animals.

1932
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:27,510
You've got to let them off the milk of
your camel in the bond to belt in Africa,

1933
01:49:27,511 --> 01:49:30,720
you have to basically live off.
It's very hard to grow stuff there.

1934
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:35,310
You basically have to live
off of, you know, game meat,

1935
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,910
you know, try living off of, try growing
something in the, it is the video.

1936
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:44,370
The support here is connected to this
other deer that's pretty just alive.

1937
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:48,280
And the hunters found the coyote
eating it. The hunters found the coyote

1938
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,470
eating the one deer and this,
you're like, mother Fucker,

1939
01:49:50,471 --> 01:49:53,550
let me go and he can't get
go. I can't let go. And the,

1940
01:49:53,551 --> 01:49:56,290
the other deer is just like
half of his body is missing.

1941
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,390
So they had to hold onto
them and look where they are.

1942
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:01,590
Farm country starts please.
Yeah, it's Doug's house.

1943
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,170
I owed his hands in his pockets
going, hey, what's going on dude?

1944
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:08,110
If I lived in your house, man,
that, that whole area, you know,

1945
01:50:08,111 --> 01:50:11,740
we've talked about me buying land in
your area and I'm still really interested

1946
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:15,160
in now because there's something
so fucking cool about that area,

1947
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:19,840
the driftless area and there's something
so fucking cool about just your house.

1948
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,440
We could go out of your house in
the morning, go for a walk pit,

1949
01:50:23,620 --> 01:50:27,160
pitch up a tent and fucking hang out
and wait for someone to come by. Yeah,

1950
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:29,980
I mean it's, it's really
an amazing spot. Well

1951
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:33,650
thanks. Ah, you know, I've, I feel really
lucky to be the one who gets to take

1952
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:36,930
clearly that is the driftless area
for this generation. Beautiful.

1953
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:40,040
That place as he looks like in
the summer song. Seriously. Yeah.

1954
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:44,790
We can say we keep saying you
saying Doug's place, but dogs. Oh,

1955
01:50:44,791 --> 01:50:48,900
thank you Steve. I want to point out it's
Debbie. Doug's family's place in Doug's.

1956
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:49,883
How long

1957
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:52,310
you got or it's been
in my family 112 years.

1958
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:58,490
Yeah, 112. He, yeah, he had a relative
loses sound bits on the next generation.

1959
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:00,950
Went Back [inaudible] I
told you that in confidence.

1960
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,870
[inaudible] what happened was during

1961
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:08,300
the, uh, depression, my,
my great grandfather, um,

1962
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:10,980
so when I say it's been in my family
112 years, there was a little,

1963
01:51:10,990 --> 01:51:11,920
there was a couple of months

1964
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:14,110
listen,
so we don't

1965
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:18,050
qualified to be a century farm
or something. But, uh, uh,

1966
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:22,190
my great grandfather had a railroad
that went from Cazenovia to Laval,

1967
01:51:22,191 --> 01:51:23,480
which is seven miles away.

1968
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:26,960
And the depression came and then there
was a flood and wiped out all the bridges.

1969
01:51:26,961 --> 01:51:29,330
And uh,
then he had this one.

1970
01:51:29,331 --> 01:51:32,870
I can tell it my dad
would be okay with this.

1971
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:35,650
So one of his uncles,

1972
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:40,010
I guess always had these harebrained
ideas that he could talk his father into

1973
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:45,440
financing him on. So, um, he mortgaged
our farm. So our farm is not,

1974
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:46,640
it's been in the family that long,

1975
01:51:46,641 --> 01:51:50,510
but it's not the original family farm
over where, by where we were duck hunting.

1976
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:54,650
I pointed that out. Um, that's where
the, um, the homestead was anyway

1977
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:58,320
in every guy in his area is Doug's,
Doug's got cousins he never even met.

1978
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:00,120
They're like down the road.
Yeah.

1979
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:04,930
Pop out of the woodwork when
November rolls around. Cousin. Hey,

1980
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,393
let's go Emily.

1981
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:11,220
Yeah, I think folks are on
kids know, you would say, well,

1982
01:52:11,221 --> 01:52:14,560
some people would say that, you know,
I wouldn't get that fucking driven.

1983
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:19,650
There's a dude that ran at hunter.
There's the dude next to me. Yeah.

1984
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:21,270
That ran that uh,
that,

1985
01:52:21,271 --> 01:52:23,750
that hunter recruitment program
out of that whole foods places

1986
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:29,630
as a co op. Yeah. And uh, Carlos,
just one of those guys, you know,

1987
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:34,200
he's just wonderful, uh, advocate
for the outdoors and uh, yeah,

1988
01:52:34,201 --> 01:52:35,790
that was the,
that was our first time,

1989
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:38,820
I guess the first time that we did
together cause Durkin was there.

1990
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,420
So there was no, that was the
second time you hunted on my farm.

1991
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:46,190
Been this is the fourth time anyway.

1992
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:51,970
Huh? What was I talking
about? Hunting? No, you're old
man. You're all [inaudible].

1993
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:54,230
So, yeah, railroads. And so anyway,

1994
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:58,950
uh, it came to a point where
we'll, we've got to have some,

1995
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,060
something's got to give.

1996
01:53:00,061 --> 01:53:04,830
So he gave the farm what let the farm
go back to Northwestern mutual life is

1997
01:53:04,831 --> 01:53:08,610
what my dad said. And uh,
and my grandfather had,

1998
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:11,940
interestingly, it didn't make sense
for him to buy it from his father.

1999
01:53:11,941 --> 01:53:15,300
He bought it from the insurance company,
had the paper on it.

2000
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:18,600
So there was like a few month period
of time where it was in no man's land,

2001
01:53:18,601 --> 01:53:23,050
but no one else has owned the place
for 112 years. That's the alarm.

2002
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:26,150
Is it a ministry of foreign man?
It's amazing spot. It's a beautiful,

2003
01:53:26,151 --> 01:53:27,890
beautiful spot. Well, there've been people

2004
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:29,210
well taken care of it for a long time.

2005
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:32,310
I give my father an awful lot of
credit for, you know, his, um,

2006
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:37,760
vision on the whole thing
in my, my grandfather was a
really interesting guy too.

2007
01:53:37,761 --> 01:53:42,110
And, um, you know, they, Eh, I didn't
know my great grandfather obviously, but,

2008
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:44,770
uh, but yeah, I mean it's just, I,

2009
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:48,440
it's just my turn right now and I happen
to have four brothers and sisters who

2010
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:52,000
are very, uh, uh, willing to, uh,

2011
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:56,510
sort of let me be in charge and, and
uh, we're all partners in the thing. Um,

2012
01:53:56,690 --> 01:54:00,800
and my folks are still heavily
involved but are as they always say,

2013
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:02,750
we control the purse strings like there.

2014
01:54:02,930 --> 01:54:05,550
Yeah. Like they're the house of
representatives or something.

2015
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:10,260
I wish you had a picture of the standard
that we could put up on the thing there,

2016
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:15,120
man. Yeah. I don't know where you
find one of the standards. Yeah.

2017
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:19,200
Douglas Standard. Dot. Yeah. Don't
kill the one time killed a giant. Well,

2018
01:54:19,201 --> 01:54:22,800
you have pictures of that on your first
time here. Don't know where there,

2019
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:26,070
Joe dog killed a giant buck
became known as the standard,

2020
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,740
as a standard on that property. It's
a really funny story. I feel like I'm,

2021
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:31,280
I feel like this is like Mary Ann
[inaudible] going to tell him. Doug,

2022
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:33,580
tell him about this dog.
Tell me about that dog.

2023
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:39,600
Why don't you tell him Steve Youtube to
the standards of funny story without a

2024
01:54:39,601 --> 01:54:42,270
picture. I got a lot of people die and
watching anyways. They're listening.

2025
01:54:43,470 --> 01:54:46,090
Tell the story a fair enough.
Tell us story about the standards.

2026
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:48,810
Do you want me to, are you curious
about here to start? Yeah, absolutely.

2027
01:54:48,811 --> 01:54:51,390
What I like about the standard story is,
um,

2028
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,900
how I went up there with the tractor
and set this whole thing on the part.

2029
01:54:54,901 --> 01:54:55,734
I like,

2030
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:59,760
this is never gonna work because the part
I like is when you tell when you took

2031
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:04,340
it down to the Oh, oh yeah, yeah.
Okay. Took it down to the guy. So, so,

2032
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:06,870
so here's what happened.
I like two weeks before,

2033
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:10,660
uh, this early, it was an early gun
season. It was actually during bow season.

2034
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:13,510
At that time it was very controversial,
but you can earn a buck.

2035
01:55:13,511 --> 01:55:17,200
So this is like the end of October.
So rod is just kicking off.

2036
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:21,970
And my nephew a shot a doe with the night
before and had never got into deer and,

2037
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:26,770
and um, in fact he shot one earlier that
day. And, uh, I said, well, go ahead Sam,

2038
01:55:26,771 --> 01:55:29,080
you know, got it out. He said, well, I
didn't go. I don't know how to do it.

2039
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:30,940
And they said, well, if I got that deer,

2040
01:55:30,941 --> 01:55:35,110
I'm gonna tag it so that I could have
the buck tag. Two weeks before this day,

2041
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:39,190
my wife and I were driving down through
the farm on that road that comes down

2042
01:55:39,191 --> 01:55:42,400
through there in this just enormous
buckets up out of this brush and goes just

2043
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:46,470
lumbering into the woods. And my wife who
doesn't get excited about deer is like,

2044
01:55:46,471 --> 01:55:49,050
oh my God, look at the size
of, but she got excited.

2045
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:53,020
So later that day I went up with the
tractor and a brush hog, you know,

2046
01:55:53,021 --> 01:55:54,090
and nothing going on here.

2047
01:55:54,091 --> 01:55:58,080
I'm just driving through cutting the
trails on the farm and left the tractor

2048
01:55:58,081 --> 01:56:02,340
idling, jumped down off the tractor,
grabbed a, I had a tree stand along,

2049
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,380
strapped it to a tree, um, got back
in the tractor while it was, you know,

2050
01:56:06,381 --> 01:56:08,850
just as I said, let it run the whole
time and then drove out of there.

2051
01:56:08,851 --> 01:56:09,571
Two weeks later,

2052
01:56:09,571 --> 01:56:14,571
I had this buck tag and
shoot the deer 10 minutes.

2053
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:16,291
Unfortunately,

2054
01:56:16,291 --> 01:56:19,520
it's not one where I can tell a long
story about why can make any story line

2055
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:23,730
apparently. But, um, along story
about hunting the steer and all that,

2056
01:56:23,731 --> 01:56:26,460
it showed up 10 minutes after I
got into standing boom shot yet.

2057
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:29,760
And that's the standard. So,
and this thing is just enormous.

2058
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:31,540
I mean it's just one on
your wall. Yeah. That,

2059
01:56:31,590 --> 01:56:35,270
that rope and it was just a
huge deer. Besides how much
did it weigh? Let's think.

2060
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:41,340
I Dunno, I go to 65 or, or
something like that, maybe to 70.

2061
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:42,170
And I'm,

2062
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:44,660
well the thing is like,
it's like, uh, it, you know,

2063
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:47,700
it had to be as quick as did here. You
get into like how many inches of antler.

2064
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:48,900
So it was a hunter.

2065
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:53,590
It was almost a 200 inch deer in the
Antler, but it was an enormous body dear,

2066
01:56:53,591 --> 01:56:58,030
besides, so, um, never shot
anything like that before.

2067
01:56:58,031 --> 01:57:01,900
So I call this tax the dermis and said,
so I want to bring this deer in.

2068
01:57:01,901 --> 01:57:04,480
And he said, well, how big
is it? And I said, well,

2069
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:08,920
I have size 13 shoes and I can put
both of my shoes between the antlers.

2070
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,340
Oh, well you didn't want to get that
in here real soon. And you know,

2071
01:57:12,341 --> 01:57:16,110
so the skin doesn't, the high doesn't
slip and all this stuff. So, um,

2072
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:18,280
my dad's got this little
Chevy F's 10 pickup.

2073
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:20,710
We dropped the thing in the back so it
looks like an elk in the back of this

2074
01:57:20,711 --> 01:57:23,110
little tiny pickup.
And we drive it to the taxi type.

2075
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:25,120
And by the time we get
to the texts and stuff,

2076
01:57:25,121 --> 01:57:27,190
there are two or three vehicles behind
us cause they want to see where it's

2077
01:57:27,191 --> 01:57:30,110
going. We pull into the place
and I walk up and there's this,

2078
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:32,560
this texted them shop where
they also registered dear.

2079
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,860
You guys had the experience with
places where they registered dear.

2080
01:57:35,861 --> 01:57:38,100
It's a madhouse.
And uh,

2081
01:57:38,710 --> 01:57:41,500
so we pull in there and I walk up
to the guy and said, oh, by the way,

2082
01:57:41,501 --> 01:57:45,670
I'm the guy who, who called and you've
got the buck with. They said, oh,

2083
01:57:45,671 --> 01:57:46,480
can I see it?

2084
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:50,050
And they've got trucks are backed in there
and they're unloading Dyrand skin and

2085
01:57:50,051 --> 01:57:51,100
amount and doing all this stuff.

2086
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:55,420
And my little dad's a little s tennis
sitting down at the bottom of the hill and

2087
01:57:55,540 --> 01:57:57,280
he walks down there and he goes,
all right,

2088
01:57:57,281 --> 01:57:59,140
everybody get all these
vehicles out of the way.

2089
01:57:59,141 --> 01:58:01,120
We're back in this one
up in here right now.

2090
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:04,720
So we back it up there and they'd
get it out of the thing and uh,

2091
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:07,990
out of the back and they, they do a
quick skin of it till they get it to the,

2092
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:13,110
to the head. And so I, and he's got a guy
who all he does is surgically removed,

2093
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:14,860
you know,
do the Cape and whatnot.

2094
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:18,410
We go in there and guys start
chucking $5 bills into a,

2095
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:22,870
or $10 bills into a hat and
start writing numbers down.

2096
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:26,050
So they're guessing as to how
many inches of horn there is.

2097
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:29,580
So every big deer that comes in, that's
what they were doing. But it was just a,

2098
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:34,560
the whole scene was how many inches
was, it was 192. That's a big,

2099
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,600
the one that you got was like 1218

2100
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:42,040
what is that right

2101
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,440
there? That mule deer.
How big is that? Oh Shit.

2102
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:49,180
110 that's how big fucking
animal you had then. But it is,

2103
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:53,620
it's just like something happens kind
of magically when they get up into that.

2104
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:58,090
They just started, I mean
genetics, genetics, food.
There's a big one right there.

2105
01:58:58,091 --> 01:58:59,180
That's a mule deer though,
isn't it?

2106
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:04,240
It's not even type in 200 inch whitetail.
Well,

2107
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:06,850
I've seen some of them they have that
looks like they have trees grown out of

2108
01:59:06,851 --> 01:59:07,400
their heads.
Yeah.

2109
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:11,350
Type in 202 whites and you'll probably
hit like 220 now Alberta is the place

2110
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:14,260
where I came here and has the big ones.
They got big bodied.

2111
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:16,600
You're in for a long time. They
were the reigning. There was like,

2112
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:20,200
there was a place to go if you
wanted to shoot a huge racked.

2113
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:23,530
I mean just besides body, you get the
body to think. We talked about that.

2114
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:27,940
Bergman's principal bought why animals
in the north are big. What the fuck?

2115
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:32,920
That's crazy. That's big.
That's big. That's insane.

2116
01:59:33,550 --> 01:59:36,170
So it's very elk like,
uh,

2117
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:40,240
for Awhile Alberta was the place to go
if you wanted to kill it and they still

2118
01:59:40,241 --> 01:59:43,450
got plenty of who's deer. But then all
this stuff started happening and Illinois,

2119
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:48,130
Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, and they're
just killing fricking tankers now. Wow.

2120
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:51,270
Like tech for awhile. Like
Texas was the man. There you go.

2121
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:56,080
That's ridiculous food plots.
Right? Soybeans make. So for awhile,

2122
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:59,860
like Alberta was the man in Texas was
the man right now the Midwest is just

2123
01:59:59,861 --> 02:00:00,670
crank and huge.

2124
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:05,670
If big huge antlered white till all
your thing and you want to shoot one.

2125
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:07,450
I didn't ask you that.

2126
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:11,350
You want to shoot one in the wild and not
like shooting one that some guy raised

2127
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:14,440
on, reared on offense, reared
off his fricking study animal.

2128
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:19,470
Well I watched this one show where it
was about a deer farm and they were

2129
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:23,200
showing all these d or that they had
genetically raised and these deer farm and

2130
02:00:23,201 --> 02:00:24,560
it's ridiculous. I mean they, they,

2131
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:27,430
they have trees growing out of their
head and there are only two years old,

2132
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,200
two year old deer and the got fucking
these weird crazy antlers you can't trust.

2133
02:00:32,201 --> 02:00:33,280
You can't trust white tails.

2134
02:00:33,281 --> 02:00:35,830
If I walk into dude's house and I
walk into a guy's house and he's like,

2135
02:00:35,831 --> 02:00:39,250
check out that Greg Whitetail,
I'm like, you know, I,

2136
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:42,490
I can't even start even kind of pretending
to be impressed until I knew the

2137
02:00:42,491 --> 02:00:44,830
backstory. I, as far as I know,
you shot it up behind a fence.

2138
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:48,220
You walk into guys' place,
he's got a big tank or like big horn.

2139
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:51,550
He's probably got something.
If he's got a big tank or mule deer,

2140
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:57,250
there's a group. Very good chance he's
really got something, a big tanker elk.

2141
02:00:57,251 --> 02:00:59,440
I'm like, God, I'm going to have
to know what was going on. So elk,

2142
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:02,680
you were saying this before the podcast.
There are elk that are behind fence.

2143
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:06,880
Oh Shit. Yeah. Tons of man. Where tons
of lots of, I mean, you could probably,

2144
02:01:06,881 --> 02:01:08,680
there's probably, there's more
states that do it, but no,

2145
02:01:08,681 --> 02:01:11,140
I should say it was more that
do it then don't, but like,

2146
02:01:11,141 --> 02:01:14,450
I'll rattle off a bunch
to do Texas and it'll,

2147
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,420
Pennsylvania has got a bunch
of high offense places.

2148
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:20,260
Missouri's got high fence places.
Idaho is high fence places for out.

2149
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:23,740
There's something about an elk in a
high fence that kind of offends me.

2150
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:25,420
You get to do three, 4,000 bucks. I mean,

2151
02:01:25,421 --> 02:01:27,220
they'll drive you out and
you pick the one you won out.

2152
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:30,310
I've seen ads we say
like, it'd be like, um,

2153
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,790
someone needs to hunt this elk now.
$3,000. Isn't that a good picture?

2154
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:40,370
The other day? Something about an elk
that's a mythical sort of a mystical,

2155
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:44,510
majestic creature. I hate, I hate
to see them. I hate to see him.

2156
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,880
I'd argue the same thing
about a whitetail deer.

2157
02:01:46,910 --> 02:01:49,910
I just can't imagine going
behind, uh, you know,

2158
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:52,840
going into a fence and she's one of
those places in Texas. Well, I mean,

2159
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,930
they haven't been Wisconsin too.
There's a place called gonna.

2160
02:01:54,970 --> 02:01:59,420
I don't want it went to a place in Texas.
It's 10,000 acres.

2161
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,553
Is that okay?

2162
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:03,540
Yeah, I know you get into
weird, you get into the,

2163
02:02:03,541 --> 02:02:05,700
you get into a thing where it's become,
I mean,

2164
02:02:05,701 --> 02:02:10,590
there was a big thing you
see Hans advertise on, on
a 300 acre chunk of ground.

2165
02:02:10,591 --> 02:02:13,600
It has no fence on it or I'm
sorry, no tree on it. Right.

2166
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:16,740
And you get a nice things where someone
might be doing this amazing wildlife

2167
02:02:16,741 --> 02:02:19,500
management, you know, and doing
a really good management job.

2168
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:22,800
And for whatever reason,
it could be any number issues.

2169
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:26,760
They for their own management
purposes, fence, a gigantic track,

2170
02:02:26,761 --> 02:02:30,510
Landon and you get into, so is that
legit or not? And it's kind of like,

2171
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:33,570
who's that guy that said,
I only know I know porn when I see it.

2172
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:38,400
I know I can't define pour, but show
me a picture on tape. It's porn or out.

2173
02:02:38,401 --> 02:02:40,940
But that was the supreme court justice
who said, I don't know how to define it,

2174
02:02:40,941 --> 02:02:43,720
but I know when I see it.
So it's insanity rules. But,

2175
02:02:43,721 --> 02:02:45,110
but what I'm saying is
that what if you're,

2176
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:48,260
there's something about being
out in the middle of nowhere,

2177
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:52,010
like the Missouri breaks. That
is, that feels more challenging.

2178
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:55,820
Yeah. It's a luxury though too, because
a lot of people don't have people.

2179
02:02:55,850 --> 02:02:57,920
Like when I was growing up, man, it was B,

2180
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:00,920
we own the farthest we'd
hunt from our house.

2181
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:04,130
We typically have between two
and eight miles from our house.

2182
02:03:04,131 --> 02:03:05,630
We were going on a big ass trip,

2183
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:11,140
a big ass trip to drive 40 miles up
and hunt this place called peacock in,

2184
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:15,080
uh, in Lake County. I didn't
grow up thinking, I mean,

2185
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:17,440
we grew up hunting what we had
around us. Man. I, you know,

2186
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:21,470
now I lose sight of it now because
I have, you know, I have such a,

2187
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:26,120
like a kind of fell into such a fantastic
occupation where now I'm like, Oh yeah,

2188
02:03:26,121 --> 02:03:29,090
you know, we'll go here and go there for
all these wild hunts and like, you know,

2189
02:03:29,091 --> 02:03:32,000
the real way to hunt is this and
that and the Alaska in mountains.

2190
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:35,260
You're talking about Alpine hunting,
like when you're on the swallows. Yeah.

2191
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:37,010
When you're up in the
mountains and and you're,

2192
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:41,090
you're having it really literally bring
everything with you going up and down a

2193
02:03:41,091 --> 02:03:43,700
mountain.
That feels a lot more challenge.

2194
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:46,240
Yeah,
you get into a ton of physical challenges,

2195
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,590
but it is a luxury in most of the people.

2196
02:03:48,740 --> 02:03:52,240
I mean more hours are logged
deer hunt in the near cut,

2197
02:03:52,300 --> 02:03:54,860
logged hunt whitetail deer
ears and in your kind of

2198
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,770
the number one killed thing
is what doves are co doves.

2199
02:03:57,771 --> 02:04:01,820
I think number one is killing me. That's
a real issue with people, man. That doves,

2200
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,950
they go crazy.
It's the symbol of,

2201
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:09,410
in Michigan you can dumps piece.
Camper mentioned we used to,

2202
02:04:09,411 --> 02:04:13,190
we used to. We used to when we were
kids, we hunted them on the sly.

2203
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:17,120
You guys shouldn't cut off branches
either because them and adults together

2204
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:22,310
equal piece. He said good heating
or tubs that tastes very good. Dark,

2205
02:04:22,311 --> 02:04:25,620
flush, dark flavor,
flavor. Fast is the best.

2206
02:04:27,570 --> 02:04:31,860
Don't say it. Don't look
pheasant, but I mean look at us.

2207
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:36,830
Here's why tops, but pigeons are okay.
Not, Doug's apparently chickens, chickens,

2208
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,010
pigeons and dogs have

2209
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:42,930
a lot in common. But a dove
is better morning doves
business. All right. This dark

2210
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:47,750
liver colored. Yeah. So I'm the exact
opposite of Steve though. I mean, I've,

2211
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:51,830
I've hunted to other places
than our area in my entire life.

2212
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:55,130
I'm 55 years old. I hunted
the boundary waters, uh,

2213
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,480
deer hunted up there four or five years
ago and last spring and went down and

2214
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:02,240
hunted, uh, Twinkies.
What's the boundary waters?

2215
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:03,770
Boundary waters in northern Minnesota.

2216
02:05:03,771 --> 02:05:06,860
It's the boundary between Wisconsin
and Minnesota. It's very wild.

2217
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:10,240
No, it isn't. It thought isn't
the boundary waters. It's
Canada minutes. I'm sorry.

2218
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:13,330
Canada, Minnesota. Yeah. I don't even
need to look that up. My New Internet.

2219
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:20,510
Yeah. So, um, but so most
of my hunting, you know,

2220
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,530
and I've been doing it since I was
12, so it's a lot of years, um,

2221
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:29,370
has been done on that farmer in
that area and, and really not,

2222
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,860
you know, elsewhere. I guess I
hunted a little bit when I was in,

2223
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:36,710
when I lived in New Hampshire for a few
years too. But, um, you know, sort of the,

2224
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:41,220
um, the optic opposite
experiences of, of Steve. Um,

2225
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:47,730
but nonetheless it challenging. Yeah.
I don't disagree with you at all.

2226
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,550
Whitetail deer hunting's really
accessible. It's becoming

2227
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:53,940
because of guys like me I suppose,
um,

2228
02:05:54,300 --> 02:05:58,830
a little less accessible because I don't
necessarily just when I was a kid you

2229
02:05:58,831 --> 02:06:00,300
could pretty much go hunting anywhere.

2230
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:03,270
I mean we just get in the
car on a Saturday morning
and just go and go into that

2231
02:06:03,271 --> 02:06:07,500
woods and you know, not deer
hunting something. But when
I was a kid, deer hunting,

2232
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:12,270
you had to put four guys together in like
August or September, fill out a form,

2233
02:06:12,271 --> 02:06:15,510
send it into the DNR to
get a tag to shoot a doe.

2234
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:20,010
So that's the whole idea. So
one dough for four, four guys,

2235
02:06:20,011 --> 02:06:23,980
everybody else had a buck tag. So, and
that was the idea was that there was the,

2236
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:25,350
to bring the population up,

2237
02:06:25,351 --> 02:06:28,680
well now it's exactly the opposite
where we're encouraging, I mean,

2238
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:33,630
they have earn a buck rules that kind
of got shot down, but earn a buck is,

2239
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:36,630
is in place that Steve
asked me the other day,

2240
02:06:36,631 --> 02:06:38,730
well how many deer could you
shoot on your tag? And I was like,

2241
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:40,740
there's no limit that

2242
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:43,500
I'm just trying to calculate the cost,
the hunting during Wisconsin,

2243
02:06:43,501 --> 02:06:47,610
it's like what you buy a tag for 18 bucks.
It's good for in your area.

2244
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:52,660
Yeah. In our area. Um, you
get a buck tag, a doe tag,

2245
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,430
a second doe tag,

2246
02:06:54,431 --> 02:06:57,850
and then every time you go in they'll
give you another paper tag. That's

2247
02:06:58,510 --> 02:07:01,270
interesting. That's off a
permit. The cost of what?

2248
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:03,370
Well,
it was $24.

2249
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:07,770
$24. Yeah. That's crazy. That's a good way
to get meat for cheap if you, yeah, man,

2250
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:11,100
it's a, it's like if you're, if you're
hunting local and it's economical

2251
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:16,140
and when I was, yeah, yeah. And when I was
a kid, if, if a deer got hit on the road,

2252
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:18,320
people stopped and picked it
up and put it in the back.

2253
02:07:20,250 --> 02:07:25,090
But now it's like now because of the snow,
we've had a big melt recently.

2254
02:07:25,091 --> 02:07:29,340
You see the big drifts or the snow piles
along the edge of the road and here's

2255
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:30,900
deer carcasses turned it on.

2256
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,990
You can't eat them.
You can't pick them up too late now.

2257
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:36,070
But it depends on the states,
the Galtee. But you know

2258
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,400
like now, now in Montana you
can, you can now it was illegal.

2259
02:07:39,401 --> 02:07:42,490
Now you can pick up certain species.
You can, you can salvage them.

2260
02:07:42,491 --> 02:07:44,380
You've got to let the state know.
We used to just have to call,

2261
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:47,350
you said call nine one one they'd give
you a permit for deer were coming back

2262
02:07:47,351 --> 02:07:50,920
one time. Mile man hit a
deer with his bow. Okay.

2263
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:55,000
We all go out to blood trail of
deer blood trail dear till one,

2264
02:07:55,001 --> 02:07:57,190
two in the morning. Never followed
the deer. Never recovered a deer.

2265
02:07:57,430 --> 02:08:00,070
I can't remember where he hit it. Probably
hit it in the paunch or something.

2266
02:08:00,220 --> 02:08:03,700
Never found it coming back.
He's got me, my brothers now.

2267
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:06,340
Little little like I was so little
that me and my other brother,

2268
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:10,840
we got left behind and he left us to sleep
in the woods and our land and ran out

2269
02:08:10,841 --> 02:08:12,460
of gas.

2270
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:16,090
So I light was out and we fell
asleep and so he couldn't find us.

2271
02:08:16,091 --> 02:08:17,870
And they're running around and goes,
Dave Dad,

2272
02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:21,710
cause you'd have to get close enough to
yell and wake us up. Two in the morning,

2273
02:08:21,711 --> 02:08:26,380
we're coming home finally driving
a jeep AMC eagle or dry GF,

2274
02:08:26,381 --> 02:08:31,090
AMC Cherokee. And by him hit this deer.
So it's, you know, everyone's tired.

2275
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:34,780
I'm sleeping up front. My brother was
in the back seat, mailman gets out,

2276
02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:39,220
grabs his deer and throws the on bits
and back of the jeep Cherokee on a tarp,

2277
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:42,640
sticks in Arrow in it. Nope.
Start on down the road.

2278
02:08:42,641 --> 02:08:46,540
And all of sudden my brother was in
the back flipping out like freaking.

2279
02:08:46,570 --> 02:08:48,400
And we turned around that
somebody just standing up,

2280
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:52,410
oh no.

2281
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:56,590
Slams on the brakes, gets out in the
halls head, you're out of the bat,

2282
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:59,890
cause its throat weights come and stills
it back in there on a tarp and continue

2283
02:08:59,891 --> 02:09:00,724
on our way home.

2284
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:04,600
That was a hard man. Oh my God. For
Life. You guys sleep in the woods.

2285
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:10,850
You fucking pussy. Here's a lantern with
three ounces of fluid in it right now.

2286
02:09:11,060 --> 02:09:16,010
Go to sleep. I came back, I gave the kid
a compass, whatever. No, he was, he was,

2287
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:20,610
um, he was, uh, he was a
hard guy, man. Yeah, I guess,

2288
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:25,710
yeah, I guess that sounds
like a hard guy at the time.

2289
02:09:25,711 --> 02:09:28,700
Like it up until,
you know,

2290
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:34,200
it's funny cause it's like there's this,
uh, there's a, there's like this music,

2291
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:35,310
I don't even want to name her name,

2292
02:09:35,311 --> 02:09:38,370
but she's got the song like I'm not
angry anymore. Like my dad's been dead.

2293
02:09:38,371 --> 02:09:42,780
Like my dad died in
2002, 2003. I'm just now,

2294
02:09:42,781 --> 02:09:45,750
I just turned 40, a couple,
like a week or two ago.

2295
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:51,260
I'm just now getting where I'm not so
angry at him and I'm starting to go like a

2296
02:09:51,481 --> 02:09:53,430
lot of what he did made sense
and love it has to do with,

2297
02:09:53,431 --> 02:09:56,940
I have a three year old now. Oh yeah.
And now I'm like, you know what?

2298
02:09:56,941 --> 02:09:59,850
Maybe he wasn't like, so you
know, it just looked like, look,

2299
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,350
I look at it through that angle now having
a little kid and I see like you want

2300
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:09,570
that person to be just like able to
fend for themselves and know and to be

2301
02:10:09,571 --> 02:10:13,320
capable and know how to fix stuff and
know how to take situations in their own

2302
02:10:13,321 --> 02:10:16,200
hands and know not to complain about
stuff. You know what I mean? Well,

2303
02:10:16,201 --> 02:10:19,020
you came out pretty good. I mean, yeah,

2304
02:10:19,021 --> 02:10:22,680
but most people disregard everything
they learned from their parents.

2305
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:24,360
Even if they turned out really good.

2306
02:10:24,361 --> 02:10:27,150
Like you could have a whole slew of
siblings all be turned out great.

2307
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:30,980
And in every one of them will be like,
do the opposite of what their parents did.

2308
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:33,470
What do you think you were so angry
about? I mean, what was the thing?

2309
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:37,010
I don't wanna get you to me in a hard
ass. Yeah, Megan's work all the time.

2310
02:10:37,310 --> 02:10:38,810
All the time.
These pads,

2311
02:10:38,811 --> 02:10:43,400
he used to have a longer one and he
start making chores and he wouldn't like

2312
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:47,120
suck. He would just keep going until
he had two columns down to the bottom.

2313
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:50,060
My Dad would do that but then you get on
your first day of summer break and he'd

2314
02:10:50,061 --> 02:10:51,140
be like,
you know,

2315
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:56,610
can you believe this shit that's going
to take you through August two that

2316
02:10:56,670 --> 02:10:59,730
somebody didn't have any staying power
like he was. He would write up list. I,

2317
02:10:59,731 --> 02:11:00,750
I crashed my car,

2318
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:03,340
this car and it cost him like I don't
know how much it's going to cost some

2319
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:05,930
Vegas. You're working for this,
you're working for this boy.

2320
02:11:05,931 --> 02:11:08,300
I'll tell you that much right now.
Hope you hope you think,

2321
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:10,880
I know you had plans for the summer
cause cause you can kiss those plans,

2322
02:11:10,881 --> 02:11:12,950
go back cause you're going to be
working or not. And he was so mad at me.

2323
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:16,450
Meanwhile I knew he
wrote this long Lizzie.

2324
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:18,580
I knew he just kind of forgot about it.

2325
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:21,830
It just means it never had any staying
power. He'd get busy and I'd be like, see,

2326
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:26,480
you later dropped this list and it
wasn't I supposed to mow the lawn. Sorry,

2327
02:11:26,481 --> 02:11:29,150
I've got a trick niece.
No, you probably know dad.

2328
02:11:29,151 --> 02:11:32,050
I'm going to grow up and be a comedian
to my mother. My mother used to,

2329
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:35,240
my mother used to change my grades.

2330
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:40,220
I would get my report card and
it sucked and I knew my father,

2331
02:11:40,221 --> 02:11:43,520
my father, I need to change
it for you. Oh my God.

2332
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:48,050
I couldn't go to my dad with a d in
math and I was just, I mean, you know,

2333
02:11:48,051 --> 02:11:51,980
you don't think I listened now can you
imagine you fucking in fucking high

2334
02:11:51,981 --> 02:11:54,290
school. Holy Shit. Was I a mess?

2335
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:56,840
What did your parents think when you
said you wanted to be a comedian?

2336
02:11:57,290 --> 02:12:00,760
My father grew up really poor, so when
I told him I wanted to be an actor,

2337
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:03,210
not even a comedian, an actor
that we just told them first. Yup.

2338
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:06,380
I was 2122 I remember,

2339
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:10,850
I remember he looked at me and his face,
I remember his face,

2340
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,200
the worry and the regret and the
dread, but you know what? He's like,

2341
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:17,900
I should've never even [inaudible]
a drone in when he was little,

2342
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,690
he was so, he was so to see, right.

2343
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:25,370
He was so depressed because he,
he just wanted me to be, you know,

2344
02:12:25,371 --> 02:12:27,440
he just want to be, he loved
me. He's wanting to be safe.

2345
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:30,710
So he just looked at me and he
goes like this. He goes, well,

2346
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,280
why are you asking me if I'll support you?
I mean,

2347
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:38,480
you want some money for your rent?
I go, I go, no. He goes, well,

2348
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:42,980
you're going to need it because you're
not paying your way around with acting,

2349
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,950
so you're good. We have
to talk brass tacks. You,

2350
02:12:45,951 --> 02:12:50,030
you can't live in New York
without my help. And I never
forgot that about him. He,

2351
02:12:50,031 --> 02:12:54,200
he, he, he kind of, he just, you know,
he said, oh, well he's a dreamer.

2352
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:56,360
Here goes nothing.
But then when I got my first job,

2353
02:12:56,361 --> 02:12:59,480
when I got mad TV and I called him,
it was the greatest thing in the world.

2354
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:03,290
He goes, what are you doing in la? And
I go, ah, I'm on a TV show. And he goes,

2355
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,030
what do you mean when I go,

2356
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:09,280
I'm going to be on a TV show every week
and he got commercial, I don't know,

2357
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:11,660
commercial. I'm going
to be on a TV show, use.

2358
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:16,220
I can turn the channel on and you'll
be on the show. I go, that's right.

2359
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,880
And he goes like this. There was
a pause and he goes, Oh my God,

2360
02:13:20,850 --> 02:13:22,850
I've got to call your mother.
And he hung up.

2361
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:27,680
And then my mother called and my cousins
call, everybody called and he just,

2362
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:30,080
he didn't know how to even deal
with the emotion of it cause I was,

2363
02:13:30,110 --> 02:13:31,980
I was ultimately the first time you don't,

2364
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,210
but, but forget all that bullshit. What,
what ended up bringing us really close,

2365
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:38,730
because we didn't really get
along that well, was how,

2366
02:13:38,790 --> 02:13:41,940
how well I kept my head up during
the fact that I wasn't working.

2367
02:13:41,941 --> 02:13:45,460
I spent a lot of time and you know,
for years not working as an act,

2368
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:49,590
you didn't say quit. I never quit, man.
And I never got down. I never got down.

2369
02:13:49,591 --> 02:13:52,200
I would just go, well here goes
another one. I just never fucking game.

2370
02:13:52,201 --> 02:13:53,340
I don't give him wait way.
We will.

2371
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:56,030
You didn't spend that much time not
working because what? I'm to you,

2372
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:59,890
when I met you, you were like 26
yeah. And you were working. Yeah,

2373
02:13:59,891 --> 02:14:01,670
but I went a long time without the fuck.
I'm saying,

2374
02:14:01,671 --> 02:14:05,050
I mean TV show from college to
not working. What does that work?

2375
02:14:05,170 --> 02:14:08,010
A little bit probably doesn't mean
you're making about being an actor,

2376
02:14:08,011 --> 02:14:11,730
like all the years of not getting jobs.
And about how long is that?

2377
02:14:11,731 --> 02:14:15,990
If you were 26 well, from the age
of when you get out of college,

2378
02:14:15,991 --> 02:14:19,560
how old were you? 21 so you five years?
No, I worked at a bank for two years.

2379
02:14:19,610 --> 02:14:22,520
And so five years. Five years from school?
No, I'm talking about, it's not like,

2380
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,950
it's probably not like a
[inaudible] magazine Articles,

2381
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:30,000
magazine articles 2000 but it was, it took
me five years to get it. I can be like,

2382
02:14:30,001 --> 02:14:33,250
yes, I'm a publishing writer.
I'm a writer. Writer. Right,

2383
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:37,800
but he was on mountain talking about
a match after that work a lot like

2384
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:43,140
[inaudible] I'm doing gay comedy, whatever
dirt. No, I was insisting on doing,

2385
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:46,860
I'm doing acting. Joe would be
like, Dude, stop with the act.

2386
02:14:46,861 --> 02:14:49,290
I'd be an acting class. We get in
these huge arguments. He'd be like,

2387
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:53,010
just do stand up just to stand
up with this acting step.

2388
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:56,700
I would freak out and pilot
season. I'd call him up. I
didn't get a job. This pile.

2389
02:14:56,910 --> 02:14:59,220
Why wouldn't you want to be
autonomous when you could be?

2390
02:14:59,221 --> 02:15:02,930
I just didn't understand the greatest.
Like when I was on news radio, my,

2391
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,650
the producer actually said to me, he
goes, why are you still doing standup?

2392
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:08,280
You're an actor now. I was
like, oh, really? Like, oh,

2393
02:15:08,281 --> 02:15:11,220
I get to get the fuck away from you
right now before. This is contagious

2394
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:16,320
to be a stand up for stand up.

2395
02:15:16,321 --> 02:15:19,640
The most beautiful thing about standup
is you've got everything with you. You,

2396
02:15:19,670 --> 02:15:23,130
you, you're, you carry your
equipment. You are who you are.

2397
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:27,270
You go to a club and you
don't need anything to turn
on the microphone and we'll

2398
02:15:27,271 --> 02:15:30,780
do this. Turn the lights off, turn
on the microphone. We're good.

2399
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:34,710
The last thing you want is to stand up
is to have to check in with a bunch of

2400
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:37,340
other people. If you got to do
what you have to do as a standup,

2401
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:40,920
what you have to do as an act or like
go to producers and writers and the

2402
02:15:40,921 --> 02:15:43,740
network, get everything approved.
It's a fucking disaster.

2403
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:46,650
Which is one of the reasons why it's so
hard to get a good show on television.

2404
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:51,150
That perfect storm of good writing and
good acting and all that stuff coming

2405
02:15:51,151 --> 02:15:51,481
together.

2406
02:15:51,481 --> 02:15:55,980
It's incredibly difficult to
play practically impossible
and let's be honest,

2407
02:15:56,190 --> 02:15:58,110
we have the greatest job in
the world. Am I right? Well,

2408
02:15:58,111 --> 02:16:02,670
it's also the most fun to me when I'm
a con, when I'm an audience member,

2409
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:05,580
I would way rather go see
Brian Cowen do stand up.

2410
02:16:05,581 --> 02:16:08,670
Then I'll go see you in a movie
and then go see you in a movie.

2411
02:16:08,671 --> 02:16:13,230
And you can see Brian Cowen to stand up
in San Francisco this weekend, Thursday,

2412
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:15,270
Friday, Saturday at the punchline. Yes.

2413
02:16:15,450 --> 02:16:17,490
See you and you're very
funny doing stand up,

2414
02:16:17,491 --> 02:16:21,480
but you know the odds of you getting a
role that represents you the same way it

2415
02:16:21,481 --> 02:16:24,300
does your, your standup.
It's not only that, like you,

2416
02:16:24,301 --> 02:16:29,100
when you go to see a good
comic, the laughs that you
have in an hour and a half,

2417
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:32,600
like you get out of there, your fucking
stomach hurts. Yeah. You know, you're,

2418
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:36,220
you were howling laughing when we went
to see you. I remember I told you,

2419
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:39,070
my wife said,
might like my arms and my face hurts.

2420
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:44,730
If you go from holding that like
big smiley thing for whatever,

2421
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:48,760
15 minutes, Joe Rogan or you see
bill burr, you see these guys,

2422
02:16:49,330 --> 02:16:52,670
let me tell you something. You take the
funniest movie in the world. The hangover,

2423
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:54,910
any movie, I don't care what it is. They,

2424
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:59,260
there was no way that that audience is
going to laugh as much at the hangovers

2425
02:16:59,550 --> 02:17:01,710
last per minute. It's not
gonna happen, you know,

2426
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:04,810
and there's a real problem with the
way it's expressed on television too.

2427
02:17:04,811 --> 02:17:09,580
And I'm having an issue with that now. Um,
my new special bar, the word comes out,

2428
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,260
uh,
this,

2429
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:15,280
this Friday night on this Friday
night on comedy central. They're,

2430
02:17:15,281 --> 02:17:19,030
they're airing my, not my latest.
I know that my last special, yes.

2431
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:21,030
Live from the Tabernacle.
Uh,

2432
02:17:21,090 --> 02:17:24,280
the special that I did I guess was about
a year and a half ago and now I'm doing

2433
02:17:24,281 --> 02:17:28,000
a new one. I'm going to film a new
one in June because I this special,

2434
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:29,350
if you see this special,

2435
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:31,870
there's none of this is on my
new comedy that I'm doing now.

2436
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:35,050
So over the last like year and a half,
I've been putting together my new hour.

2437
02:17:35,051 --> 02:17:38,500
It's done now and I'm probably going
to film that most likely in Denver,

2438
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:41,230
most likely in June.
We're at piecing it together.

2439
02:17:41,290 --> 02:17:43,450
I want to do it at the comedy
works cause I love that cloud.

2440
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:45,820
If I can do it there, I'll do
it there. If not, I'll do it.

2441
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,930
I want to do it at a club.

2442
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:51,190
I'm trying to figure out
how to represent con.

2443
02:17:51,220 --> 02:17:55,090
Like when you see a comedy
show on television, I'm sorry,

2444
02:17:55,091 --> 02:17:59,350
it's just not as good as seeing it live.
There's something he miss.

2445
02:17:59,590 --> 02:18:02,980
There's something about the person's
saying that shit right in front of you.

2446
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:06,010
That's just way better than someone
saying that shit on a video.

2447
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:08,500
It's like watching the concert.
It's like watching a concert video.

2448
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:12,210
There's nothing more painful than
watching the concert video. True.

2449
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:16,470
When I saw you recently in Chicago,
one of the neat things is, you know,

2450
02:18:16,471 --> 02:18:19,170
sitting there with a friend but,
but the people around you,

2451
02:18:19,230 --> 02:18:23,250
like what struck somebody else says
just like gut wrenching, you know,

2452
02:18:23,251 --> 02:18:27,420
busting funny. Um,
yeah, that's funny. But,

2453
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:30,800
but then the thing that would get me
would be the other people are kind of

2454
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:32,700
chuckling and I'm just roaring,
you know?

2455
02:18:32,701 --> 02:18:34,860
And it's like that shared
experience I think as a part of it.

2456
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:37,500
I think it is too.
There's something about going and and I,

2457
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:41,300
and I think the shade experience somewhat
gets diminished when there's like more

2458
02:18:41,301 --> 02:18:46,010
than 3000 people. I've had great times
like when we did a Toronto, what we do.

2459
02:18:46,011 --> 02:18:48,650
Would you to Denver with me
when it came out as me? Yes.

2460
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:49,440
Oh Great.

2461
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:54,440
[inaudible] I had them introduce of
Calvin goes out there and they're all

2462
02:18:55,161 --> 02:18:58,430
looking at me like, wow, pretty cool.
Let's get to get that reception.

2463
02:18:58,950 --> 02:19:03,350
I felt like the Messiah and then I
could see the front row going on.

2464
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,640
Joe Looks, he looks thinner. I

2465
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:11,070
Scott Eight [inaudible] tall,

2466
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:18,130
gained three inches, lost 50 pounds.
Joe Rogan light. There it is. Oh yes.

2467
02:19:18,190 --> 02:19:19,260
This is actually the video.

2468
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:22,240
Just come walking out.

2469
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,260
How high were we then?
We thought this was a good idea

2470
02:19:32,470 --> 02:19:37,430
to in Toronto is amazing. Yeah. 3000
people. Well this was, this was Denver.

2471
02:19:37,431 --> 02:19:40,630
I wasn't a Denver.
This is several thousand haven.

2472
02:19:43,390 --> 02:19:48,040
Well you hear the like, well what time
you fucking freaks. That's what Joe says.

2473
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:50,150
What's that you fucking phrase?

2474
02:20:00,730 --> 02:20:01,690
No,
what the fuck dude?

2475
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:10,820
One of the best things about seeing,

2476
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,980
like you talk about that experience
of being an audience. When I,

2477
02:20:12,981 --> 02:20:16,490
when I saw you recently in New York,
it was like you brought up the,

2478
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,100
you kind of launched into the duck
dynasty thing. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2479
02:20:20,540 --> 02:20:23,000
It's some dudes in the audience.
I could see a lot of guys in the audience.

2480
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:26,120
They started getting real excited because
they're like awesome because now he's

2481
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:27,470
going to start bashing the queers.

2482
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:29,750
Like now we can talk really
bad about gay people.

2483
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:34,410
Don't charge something like come on,
talk bad about queers. I can't wait.

2484
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:38,750
And then Joel like solely turns it on
its head and it's most vicious way and

2485
02:20:38,751 --> 02:20:43,650
like the palpability these
dudes disappointment that
it wasn't going to be that.

2486
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:46,400
We were talking about like how much
we hate gay people and they of,

2487
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:50,430
they're kind of like, yeah,
bring it, bring it in in a,

2488
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:54,560
in a does like just shot him down in the
worst way and they're kind of getting

2489
02:20:54,561 --> 02:20:55,710
this little like Yoda,

2490
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:58,580
I think this pissy little mood and this
whole thing's playing out right in front

2491
02:20:58,581 --> 02:21:01,340
me. Like, no one would ever know to send
you your wife and these guys get like,

2492
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,791
aw man,

2493
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:06,791
I thought I was gonna be more fun
than [inaudible] gets crushed.

2494
02:21:07,330 --> 02:21:09,510
Well what it is is that you know,
they,

2495
02:21:09,511 --> 02:21:14,100
they think that you're going to like
support his freedom of speech. You know,

2496
02:21:14,110 --> 02:21:16,540
cause that's like the big argument
that you see on, on Facebook.

2497
02:21:16,541 --> 02:21:18,470
What about freedom of speech?
What about his,

2498
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:22,440
his Christian beliefs about supporting
his Christian beliefs? You know,

2499
02:21:22,730 --> 02:21:26,620
my point on all that has always been
why would you care what gay people are

2500
02:21:26,621 --> 02:21:30,560
doing? Like what's going on at you care
about gay people. And if it's the Bible,

2501
02:21:30,561 --> 02:21:34,100
if you're, it's, you're really
fucking cherry picking. If
you go on after the game,

2502
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:36,150
like your Cherry,
Cherry Creek,

2503
02:21:36,250 --> 02:21:39,130
you should go after people that were two
different types of cloth because that

2504
02:21:39,131 --> 02:21:39,900
shit's in there too.

2505
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:41,580
Yeah.
But the whole premise of the show is like,

2506
02:21:41,581 --> 02:21:42,750
did they made a boatload of money?

2507
02:21:42,751 --> 02:21:45,690
But isn't there a line in the Bible
like a rich man has as much chance of

2508
02:21:45,691 --> 02:21:48,060
getting into heaven as a camel
passing through the eye of a needle?

2509
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:49,860
That's what Jesus said.
Yes,

2510
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:52,870
that's exactly what you're more worried
about whether reality TV stars get

2511
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:54,740
to go to heaven.
Well,

2512
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:58,460
you're a liar if you're doing that show
and you're not telling people that it's

2513
02:21:58,461 --> 02:21:59,990
scripted,
you're a liar.

2514
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:03,620
So that that is an issue and that's a
real issue with those reality shows.

2515
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:07,510
They are not reality.
Those shows are fucking scripted.

2516
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:11,270
So most often you have to
sign a nondisclosure. If
you work for duck dynasty,

2517
02:22:11,450 --> 02:22:13,940
she worked for a lot of those shows.
If you're a camera man,

2518
02:22:13,941 --> 02:22:14,780
if you're a sound guy,

2519
02:22:14,781 --> 02:22:18,410
you have to sign a nondisclosure so
that you can't go out and tell everybody

2520
02:22:18,411 --> 02:22:19,430
that it's all bullshit.

2521
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:23,690
Yeah. That, that's, that's like one of
the most basic things I get is this,

2522
02:22:23,691 --> 02:22:26,130
like how it comes that when
you look at what's going

2523
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:30,750
on in the world, the bad things are
happening, the world, starvation,

2524
02:22:30,890 --> 02:22:33,300
abuse, the children, all these
things go on in the world.

2525
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:38,360
And you and you hone in on like what's
going on in some guy's private life,

2526
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:40,133
whether or not there's like

2527
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:43,420
point, by the way, all the problems that
really are affecting people, you, you,

2528
02:22:43,890 --> 02:22:44,100
you're,

2529
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:48,570
the problem in this world really is
homosexual two dudes having brunch with

2530
02:22:48,571 --> 02:22:52,080
disposable income Sunday,
who gives a fuck?

2531
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:56,880
It's, it's very weird.
We're very weird about that.

2532
02:22:56,881 --> 02:22:59,670
We're very weird about what we decide
to get upset about and what we don't

2533
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:02,520
decide to get upset about it.
It's, it's a strange thing.

2534
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:06,240
And what we should be upset about.
We're not. And on a show like that,

2535
02:23:06,241 --> 02:23:08,940
well you should be upset about it as
a fact. They're fucking faking it.

2536
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,510
That's not a drama. It's
not like watching, you know,

2537
02:23:12,511 --> 02:23:15,930
fill in the blank fucking game of
Thrones where you know, it's scripted.

2538
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:18,990
This is a show. They're pretending
this is their real life and it's not.

2539
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:23,790
One of the things that I really appreciate
about your show is that it's 100%

2540
02:23:23,791 --> 02:23:27,900
legit above board all the way.
If you don't get an animal,

2541
02:23:27,901 --> 02:23:30,870
you show the whole fucking show
and you've had several shows.

2542
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,980
Well you don't get an animal.

2543
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:36,420
And one of them that I really respected
man was that episode this year where you

2544
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:40,590
had that bear in your site and you just
decided not to shoot it and you had,

2545
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:45,570
this is a very unique episode because
you're fucking bear hunting and you are a

2546
02:23:45,571 --> 02:23:46,740
hunter and you've killed,

2547
02:23:46,741 --> 02:23:50,070
God knows how many animals in your life
and you had your cross hairs on his bare

2548
02:23:50,071 --> 02:23:52,740
and it was a done deal. And
he said, I'm not feeling it.

2549
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:54,640
I don't want to shoot this animal.
And just weird

2550
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:59,650
for me. No, I say that. But then I went
shot one shot burned out long after that.

2551
02:23:59,651 --> 02:24:02,740
But, but no at that.
Yeah, that happens to me.

2552
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,870
But you apologized after
you shot that bear,

2553
02:24:04,871 --> 02:24:07,930
which I thought was weird too because you
wounded it and then you had a shoot it

2554
02:24:07,931 --> 02:24:10,480
a second time and you said
you were sorry for hurting it.

2555
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:14,240
Yeah. But like, yeah, I
feel, I don't know man bears.

2556
02:24:15,350 --> 02:24:19,550
I love to hunt bears and I like to look
at barriers and sometimes I confuse

2557
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:23,600
which of those I like. It's confusing
to me, which I like more, you know,

2558
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:27,410
why is that? I feel, um,

2559
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:30,980
kind of an f I feel like an
affinity to bears in a way.

2560
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:34,080
I just kind of is that someone,
somebody,

2561
02:24:34,090 --> 02:24:37,220
their favorite foods are
so favorites of mine too.

2562
02:24:37,310 --> 02:24:39,050
Like I'll watch bears go eat blueberries.

2563
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:42,800
It's like I love eating blueberries
at that place. I got in Alaska,

2564
02:24:42,801 --> 02:24:45,350
the bears all blue mussels and boom,

2565
02:24:45,351 --> 02:24:48,320
muscles are like one of my favorite
things in the world. And so I was like,

2566
02:24:48,321 --> 02:24:50,030
you look at it bear, it's
like, man, we're kind of,

2567
02:24:50,830 --> 02:24:54,080
I always feel like we like the
exact same foods, you know?

2568
02:24:54,380 --> 02:24:56,210
And another thing about bears,
um,

2569
02:24:57,370 --> 02:25:01,880
is I feel that bears kind of wake
up a little different every day.

2570
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:07,460
You know, they, they're, they're,
they, they, they experiment, you know,

2571
02:25:07,500 --> 02:25:10,940
they're processing things and
experimenting with things. And, um,

2572
02:25:12,590 --> 02:25:14,990
and so it's a,
it's a potent animal for me.

2573
02:25:14,991 --> 02:25:19,160
And I think that if you look at just
the history of hunting in the history of

2574
02:25:19,161 --> 02:25:20,780
hunters as represented through art,

2575
02:25:20,781 --> 02:25:24,490
did they leave behind an oral tradition
they leave behind is not a new concept

2576
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:29,590
that a homeowner would develop
an affinity to certain animals.

2577
02:25:29,710 --> 02:25:34,330
You know, oftentimes people respected
the animals that they hunted the most.

2578
02:25:34,331 --> 02:25:39,040
You look at the, the, the, the race
relationship plains tribes to Buffalo,

2579
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:42,910
Bison, it was like an object
of worship, very sacred object.

2580
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,200
You have a very conflicted,

2581
02:25:44,201 --> 02:25:48,730
complicated relationship with the animal
and Johan it and kill it. So I'm not,

2582
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:53,530
I don't even need to feel funny about the
way I feel towards some of the animals

2583
02:25:53,531 --> 02:25:54,490
I hunt because it's like,

2584
02:25:54,491 --> 02:25:58,180
it's just something that has obviously
happened to hunters for long, long time.

2585
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:02,260
Um, and, and as a hunter you
kind of develop your own system.

2586
02:26:02,261 --> 02:26:04,990
Like we never use the word taboo
when we're talking about ourselves.

2587
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:08,080
We always use tab. We, when we're looking
at other cultures and be like, oh,

2588
02:26:08,081 --> 02:26:11,800
those crazy people, they won't eat that
because they have a taboo. Meanwhile,

2589
02:26:11,801 --> 02:26:15,190
like we don't eat dogs, you
know, we have a taboo system,

2590
02:26:15,191 --> 02:26:18,340
we have a taboo system that
governs the things we do. And I,

2591
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:23,110
through hunting and through
observations of animals and there's,

2592
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:27,790
I've developed a set of things that I
will and will not do and there's animals

2593
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:32,060
that to me are really special,
you know,

2594
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:35,350
not that I dislike other ones,
but just the bare to me is special.

2595
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:40,060
I'll go bear hunting this June and I'm,
I'm thinking about it.

2596
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:41,400
It's just something that,
you know,

2597
02:26:41,401 --> 02:26:44,770
I look at a bear and I respect
it as a renewable resource.

2598
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:48,640
Something that if managed properly
I can kill the bear, have it's hide,

2599
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:52,720
render its fat down and make my own lard
with it. Eat all the meat. I like that.

2600
02:26:52,721 --> 02:26:57,610
But I also something about him,
he really likes the individual bear too.

2601
02:26:57,640 --> 02:27:01,820
And just to observe them and, and now
and then just to let one walk. Yeah.

2602
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:05,530
You said something really interesting
to me just now about the fact that they

2603
02:27:05,531 --> 02:27:08,040
wake up differently every day and
that that's something getting,

2604
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:10,630
cause what you're saying is that
they kind of learn as they get older.

2605
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:14,980
I feel that's the case. That process.
Whereas a deer, you don't feel that way.

2606
02:27:14,981 --> 02:27:18,580
I don't a failure,
well it's two or it's one or it's five.

2607
02:27:18,581 --> 02:27:20,320
I mean they learn but
it's not the same thing.

2608
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:21,910
I have a hard time thinking of whites.

2609
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:23,740
I have a hard time
thinking of whitetail deer.

2610
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:25,780
Most things I have a hard
time thinking of as as um,

2611
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:29,290
as individuals [inaudible]
bear like really?

2612
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:32,620
Especially after I killed that bear I
was talking about was 17 and I got that

2613
02:27:32,621 --> 02:27:36,260
back and they, the tooth, I think it's
called a dentist that they do. Yeah,

2614
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:40,660
they cut a cross section on that tooth.
They got back and thought 17 man.

2615
02:27:40,690 --> 02:27:44,740
Cause at the time I was mad. I was
in my early twenties man. Awesome.

2616
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:46,180
My early toys.
I'm like that's some bitch.

2617
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:51,210
Then the rock for 17 that's what Tesla
with that 17 year old bear tastes like.

2618
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:56,710
I kept some rolls off the back legs and
I kept the loins and things fine man.

2619
02:27:56,740 --> 02:28:00,850
But like I said, I ground a lot of it, but
I did keep some rolls off it. We ate it,

2620
02:28:00,851 --> 02:28:05,350
we sloppy Joe, we did everything. And then
the loins, we just grill. And how was it?

2621
02:28:05,351 --> 02:28:07,020
The grilled lines,
they'll still a good barrier.

2622
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:11,410
You have to make it medium right with a
bear because plus with that bear I knew,

2623
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:15,960
I knew he was head trichinosis
so it was good. You know,

2624
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,570
I can't even like, it was so long ago
now I, I mean I remember it being good.

2625
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,010
Everybody being really surprised
by I was good. But I'll handle bear

2626
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,870
meat in different ways.
You know,

2627
02:28:23,871 --> 02:28:26,990
I don't just like cut a chunk of
bear meat and throw it on the grill.

2628
02:28:26,991 --> 02:28:28,370
Like I do a lot of,
you know,

2629
02:28:28,380 --> 02:28:32,060
you might want to tenderize it or I'll
do marinades on and I'll smoke it.

2630
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,540
Like I bring more effort to bear
meat than I would to like that,

2631
02:28:35,740 --> 02:28:39,200
that fine tastes and driftless area
Wisconsin Whitetail, we were eating,

2632
02:28:39,201 --> 02:28:42,170
which is basically warmed up.
You know,

2633
02:28:42,171 --> 02:28:43,700
I mean you're just like
putting a little bit, yeah,

2634
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:46,970
well for the teeny bit of heat. Do
you do that with, with, with, with,

2635
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,863
with everything,

2636
02:28:48,490 --> 02:28:51,560
we've got a lot of emails and comments
from people about the duck and there was

2637
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:54,350
how good was the duck really? And
I'm just like, oh, it was incredible.

2638
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:58,340
What do you mean? Yeah, people are just
like, well, you know, ducks. I was like,

2639
02:28:58,341 --> 02:29:01,040
are you talking about mallards and
Windex? I mean, cause you know,

2640
02:29:01,041 --> 02:29:03,730
you're talking about diving ducks. That's
a whole nother thing. But you know,

2641
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:06,710
mailers or heard that screw
a mailer it up. I think

2642
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:10,010
Joe showing some footage of rendering.
Yeah.

2643
02:29:11,410 --> 02:29:14,810
That's rendering bear fat down in oil.
And that's a bear that had been eaten.

2644
02:29:14,811 --> 02:29:18,910
Blueberries. Right. Those and those
are, uh, fall bears the fall. They,

2645
02:29:18,911 --> 02:29:20,630
they're fattening up.
There's nothing bad. I mean,

2646
02:29:20,631 --> 02:29:22,430
there really is nothing better than that.

2647
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:26,270
Then those bears that you would
get him in late September, October,

2648
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:27,440
and you're up there eating blueberries.

2649
02:29:27,441 --> 02:29:30,290
They'd been eating blueberries for
months. Oh my God, they're good. I mean,

2650
02:29:30,291 --> 02:29:34,230
they're just good. We've got to make
that happen. Listen, Brian Cowen,

2651
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:36,680
we've got to go on more hunting trips.
I know I'm not shooting a bear,

2652
02:29:36,681 --> 02:29:39,640
but I'll go on home. I want you
to bear now. I want you to bear,

2653
02:29:39,650 --> 02:29:42,500
but I'll definitely shoot a deer or
an elk or anything. I'm going to you,

2654
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,810
you'll see them in this fall for
sure. When we go moose hunting. Yeah.

2655
02:29:47,060 --> 02:29:50,450
I want to come. Can you come? There's
enough room. No, figure it out.

2656
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:51,560
We'll figure it out.
Oh,

2657
02:29:51,561 --> 02:29:56,260
that sounds like there's [inaudible].

2658
02:29:56,650 --> 02:30:00,320
No, it's a boat. Dot. Say it. If you,
if you, if you are honestly like, dude,

2659
02:30:00,321 --> 02:30:03,110
I want to go so bad. Well, let's see.

2660
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:08,180
I really think that the public needs to
know how fucking good your show is and I

2661
02:30:08,181 --> 02:30:09,850
think that,
I think we're,

2662
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:14,810
we're doing our best to expose it on
this show and to expose it online and let

2663
02:30:14,811 --> 02:30:17,030
people know. And I, and I know
that your ratings are growing,

2664
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:20,930
but I can't help feel like
you're under utilized on,

2665
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:24,960
I love the sportsman channel. I watch it,
don't get me wrong, but they just large.

2666
02:30:24,961 --> 02:30:28,310
But channel gives us, gives us the
ability to make the show. Absolutely.

2667
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:28,700
There's a lot.

2668
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:32,930
You can't just go and do the stuff we do
and show the stuff we show on a regular

2669
02:30:32,931 --> 02:30:36,050
network. You can't, they wouldn't
let you know because they have,

2670
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,320
they have it in their head. He can't gut
animals and all they have in their head.

2671
02:30:39,321 --> 02:30:42,410
There's a set of things that the
American public will tolerate and won't

2672
02:30:42,411 --> 02:30:45,110
tolerate.
And we had the ability to do.

2673
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:50,140
We have absolute creative freedom to
show the things that I'm interested in

2674
02:30:50,991 --> 02:30:53,750
talking about.
But do you feel that that's changing?

2675
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:57,980
Like when you watch these shows, like
these Alaska, the last frontier, yeah.

2676
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:01,700
It shows, they're showing a lot of hunting
and a lot of stuff. Gutting animals,

2677
02:31:01,701 --> 02:31:05,390
a lot of skinning animals. They show an
animals hanging up in Barnes and shed.

2678
02:31:05,570 --> 02:31:08,730
Then they're showing the raw real
deal and they're doing onto the,

2679
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:13,130
there's something that they feel like
is more romanticized about subsistence

2680
02:31:13,131 --> 02:31:14,840
living. Well. Yeah, but that's, but they,

2681
02:31:14,890 --> 02:31:17,660
there's a fabricated thing there where
they're always trying to like make up

2682
02:31:17,661 --> 02:31:20,250
this idea that this person's
gonna die if he doesn't do this,

2683
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:21,270
which is just horse shit.

2684
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:25,020
Well the most fabricated thing was when
they were fucking fly fishing and this,

2685
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:25,651
they're like,
oh shit,

2686
02:31:25,651 --> 02:31:28,470
a bear's coming and then you see the bear
eating a fish and the fish is fucking

2687
02:31:28,471 --> 02:31:33,290
filleted. Like they baited that. Yeah.
You get a lot of trouble for that man.

2688
02:31:33,291 --> 02:31:38,220
That that fish was totally filleted clean.
Filets missing from the sides.

2689
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:42,990
Like absolutely cut the bears eating.
And I'm like, you didn't fucking do that.

2690
02:31:42,991 --> 02:31:46,440
The bear did not do that. That
was a knife. Goddamn fillet knife.

2691
02:31:46,450 --> 02:31:51,090
A straight clean line from the
gills back. So yeah, we don't need,

2692
02:31:51,180 --> 02:31:53,070
we don't need it then.
We don't need to.

2693
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:57,720
It can be the drama that you're living
a lifestyle out of choice and not just

2694
02:31:57,721 --> 02:32:00,270
some guy act like we've got a
whole damn film crew out here.

2695
02:32:00,271 --> 02:32:03,630
We're flying back and forth with batteries
and broken cameras and lenses every

2696
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:07,560
damn day and we're going to pretend like
this guy out here is going to perish

2697
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:10,710
you. What do you need to come up with
like cockamamie justification's I live a

2698
02:32:10,711 --> 02:32:14,700
lifestyle that I want to live and I have
very concrete resolute reasons why I

2699
02:32:14,701 --> 02:32:15,300
live that way.
Well,

2700
02:32:15,300 --> 02:32:18,420
what they're missing is the entertainment
value because a lot of those people

2701
02:32:18,421 --> 02:32:22,850
are fucking boring. That's where Collin
and I come in. So comedians and hunting,

2702
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:26,880
that's it. You've got your content, your
fucking shell man. I'm telling you there,

2703
02:32:26,881 --> 02:32:30,210
it should be an hour long cause there
was so much great shit extended footage

2704
02:32:30,390 --> 02:32:31,350
that you guys have released.

2705
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:35,400
Just this shit of a Brian singing while
we're pigeon hunting and trying to get

2706
02:32:35,401 --> 02:32:39,750
the Tony two minutes, man, 22 minutes.
Shit on the stick thing. I was laughing,

2707
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:43,710
I was crying, I was so, I don't
remember even saying that stuff.

2708
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:47,550
But then when you were you, when you
laugh at me, that's what I start laughing.

2709
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:49,430
I'm like your laughter.
So ridiculous.

2710
02:32:49,690 --> 02:32:53,310
We're sitting there and literally having
a conversation and then I edit it with,

2711
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:54,450
I have a lot of shit stolen.

2712
02:32:55,080 --> 02:32:58,290
Well that's the video that they shit
on the stick to the hundred mile.

2713
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:01,740
The the hundred mile an hour
shit. Yeah. That's, by the way,

2714
02:33:01,741 --> 02:33:04,740
that shit on the stick video got over
a hundred thousand views already.

2715
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:09,390
150 [inaudible]. That's our
best. It's this meat eaters.

2716
02:33:09,660 --> 02:33:13,710
It's mediators. Best Vision. I'm assuming
I was doing it. That's what happened.

2717
02:33:13,711 --> 02:33:16,800
I was doing standup in New York and
somebody goes, tell the shit story,

2718
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:19,800
tell us a shit story. And I, I didn't
know what he was talking about though.

2719
02:33:19,801 --> 02:33:21,150
Talking about the one where I was hiking.

2720
02:33:21,450 --> 02:33:24,360
Remember that story I told about hiking?
I had to shit with that girl and,

2721
02:33:24,361 --> 02:33:29,010
and and, and I thought that's the thing. I
go, I don't have time. I'm doing my hack.

2722
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,230
But he was talking about fucking bat.
That's crazy.

2723
02:33:31,980 --> 02:33:36,930
What did you say to have a look at like
about what the Shit was? Well of course.

2724
02:33:36,931 --> 02:33:39,700
You know what? I'm trying to
interject some education to the,

2725
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:44,760
like we had talked to her. Yeah,
no kidding. So it was black,

2726
02:33:44,761 --> 02:33:47,200
not an OT,
which is a,

2727
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:53,040
but I call my shit at black
knots call I call anyway guys.

2728
02:33:53,490 --> 02:33:55,860
Like yeah, that's what I'm
saying. Call my asshole.

2729
02:33:55,870 --> 02:33:59,070
That balloon now slicks Black Cherry,

2730
02:33:59,071 --> 02:34:03,270
which is what that plan was in.
There it goes again. Black Cherry.

2731
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:05,200
I like to see chair. So it's, yeah,

2732
02:34:06,070 --> 02:34:10,770
it's three days old is 340,000
hits so far. I can play this one.

2733
02:34:10,830 --> 02:34:13,650
Yeah.
That was so fun too.

2734
02:34:13,651 --> 02:34:16,260
And that was the day when
we didn't see a single deer.

2735
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:17,860
We went up in the afternoon.

2736
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,873
Yeah.

2737
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:24,120
Is that not that wind up on that stack
probably got like me decide I'm going to

2738
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:29,400
actually see each other stick before.
It's a common expression,

2739
02:34:29,820 --> 02:34:31,560
but up until now I thought it was a myth.

2740
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:34,290
It also might be something
called black done.

2741
02:34:34,710 --> 02:34:37,200
If we could get Brian to
break the branch off it,

2742
02:34:37,201 --> 02:34:42,180
crush it up and put it in his mouth.
He just needs to smell it for attention.

2743
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:47,860
Well, you can see there. Let's let
people see the rest of the video online.

2744
02:34:47,861 --> 02:34:52,600
But we were fucking howling laughing.
There was many of those instances,

2745
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:54,160
the talk and the monkey thing.
Although,

2746
02:34:54,230 --> 02:34:58,150
how about the where we're all sitting
around and uh, was he your brother's son?

2747
02:34:58,250 --> 02:35:02,020
That was their 17 year old kid. And we
start telling him fuck stories. Oh my God,

2748
02:35:02,021 --> 02:35:05,980
this kid's eyes light up like
plates. Joe was just saying, Joe,

2749
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:09,010
John Joseph to the dad's guide,
the Kids Dad,

2750
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:11,360
the kid's dad kind of looked
a little bit like, oh,

2751
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:16,050
it was my brother David and Joe's
like, he's got the Internet, man.

2752
02:35:16,051 --> 02:35:20,880
There's no way we're going to tell him.
Oh no punches. Even I was, I was like,

2753
02:35:20,910 --> 02:35:24,760
oh Jesus, you want to know a little bit?
You didn't pull any punches either, pal.

2754
02:35:24,810 --> 02:35:27,870
You went with me on it. I guess you're
right. The kid was great pressure though.

2755
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:32,010
And he ended up right
here that killed a rally.

2756
02:35:32,011 --> 02:35:35,970
Nice buck from the stem that you guys
were sitting in right by that white oak

2757
02:35:35,971 --> 02:35:39,270
tree that I said. One that's going
to walk by. I believe it. He's, yeah,

2758
02:35:39,271 --> 02:35:43,740
he's a good kid. Too. Fun.
Hilarious. Yeah. Good, good checks.

2759
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:46,070
That whole area's sauce.
You're so lucky man.

2760
02:35:46,071 --> 02:35:49,650
It's such a beautiful area to go hunting
in the fact that you're there, you know,

2761
02:35:49,651 --> 02:35:54,540
for how long has hunting season from
archery to, to write archery started

2762
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:58,580
September 15th. And then,
um, in our area there's some,

2763
02:35:58,670 --> 02:36:02,420
there's a little bit of time in
December where you can't hunt, but um,

2764
02:36:02,900 --> 02:36:07,640
it's pretty much until the weekend
after New Year's Day. That's crazy.

2765
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:11,530
Then two years ago when we
did the first episode, um,

2766
02:36:12,500 --> 02:36:13,970
they've,
I think they've stopped this now,

2767
02:36:13,971 --> 02:36:17,540
but you get land owner tags cause again,
we're trying to reduce the herd.

2768
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,960
And so when Steve called me about
that, he said, what do you think we do?

2769
02:36:20,961 --> 02:36:23,630
That rabbit hunting thing and maybe we
can do a little trapping or something.

2770
02:36:23,631 --> 02:36:24,770
And I was like,
well I can go one better.

2771
02:36:24,771 --> 02:36:26,780
We can still deer hunt
at the end of February.

2772
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:32,260
So actually you've been to my place toy
or talk to my family's farm twice in the

2773
02:36:32,601 --> 02:36:36,890
last four or five years at this time
of the year when we went hunting,

2774
02:36:36,980 --> 02:36:40,460
you can go hunting at the end of
February with a land owner tag. Yeah.

2775
02:36:40,820 --> 02:36:42,170
How does that work?
Well,

2776
02:36:42,210 --> 02:36:44,670
it's private land hunt, so you're
not dipping into, you know,

2777
02:36:44,671 --> 02:36:47,540
they're not trying to
diminish the managers,

2778
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:49,410
the harvest that might
happen on public lamb.

2779
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:53,980
Right. And in, especially in our ear where
they're trying to reduce the deer herd,

2780
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:56,410
um,
because of the CWD thing,

2781
02:36:56,411 --> 02:37:01,040
largely because it spreads faster than
more deer there are. Right. So, you know,

2782
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:03,820
that's part of it. And I'm, I
believe that we have, you know,

2783
02:37:03,821 --> 02:37:06,280
that we have too many deer
in our area, um, you know,

2784
02:37:06,281 --> 02:37:10,090
in terms of a balanced
ecosystem. So, um, yeah.

2785
02:37:10,091 --> 02:37:14,440
So I think that I had to buy the
land owner tag, which was like $2.

2786
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:16,540
And I remember Dodi like,
oh, he's going to step up.

2787
02:37:16,541 --> 02:37:19,100
And there were other guys
from board attacks and um,

2788
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:20,690
and pat was there and I mean,

2789
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:23,930
and Carl and we had seven or eight
or nine guys and Jody's steps up,

2790
02:37:24,030 --> 02:37:24,580
he's going to buy them

2791
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:26,710
licenses.
It's like $18.

2792
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:30,350
He's like,
that to me,

2793
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:34,960
I've got the car door puts
a 20 [inaudible] hunted on
that trip for two bucks.

2794
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:39,190
Yep, that's right. That's exactly what it
was. Yeah. That's incredible, man. Yeah.

2795
02:37:39,191 --> 02:37:40,100
You didn't need to have it.

2796
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:42,080
A regular hunting license.

2797
02:37:42,081 --> 02:37:46,960
Then it was the land owner permit and
then these guys can have tags that the

2798
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:47,240
deal.

2799
02:37:47,240 --> 02:37:50,030
Since you've been hunting since you were
a kid and both of you guys had been,

2800
02:37:50,070 --> 02:37:50,290
what,

2801
02:37:50,290 --> 02:37:53,330
what's your approach to
dealing with people like the
people that are going crazy

2802
02:37:53,331 --> 02:37:58,130
on my Instagram? People that don't
think that there's, that it's a,

2803
02:37:58,140 --> 02:38:02,330
a good thing to do to go hunting. They
think there's something evil about it.

2804
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:04,240
They think there's something
wrong with it. This,

2805
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:05,930
how do you deal with that disconnect?

2806
02:38:06,730 --> 02:38:11,720
I, I don't run into it very much. I mean
I do a little bit in Madison, but I,

2807
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:13,460
as I said,
I people,

2808
02:38:13,770 --> 02:38:18,150
most of the people that I know that
don't hunt don't have a problem with me

2809
02:38:18,151 --> 02:38:22,170
doing it because of where you live. It's
a culture. But it's also, I mean Madison,

2810
02:38:22,171 --> 02:38:23,620
Wisconsin is a pretty,
you know,

2811
02:38:23,820 --> 02:38:26,250
liberal town and folks from
all over the world there.

2812
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:31,590
And there's a certain fascination
with that. Actually the,

2813
02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:36,150
I've gotten a little more hot water.
D I'm talking about feral cats.

2814
02:38:37,700 --> 02:38:41,090
Rarely. That's something I've, I'm even
careful about bringing up that subject.

2815
02:38:41,091 --> 02:38:43,220
People yet real hunky about feral cats.

2816
02:38:43,221 --> 02:38:46,580
And I mean on the farm there
were always extra cats around.

2817
02:38:46,581 --> 02:38:51,110
And when you got to a point on the farm
where I used to do some contracts where

2818
02:38:51,180 --> 02:38:56,180
[inaudible] field and that
field of business we talked
about that first podcast

2819
02:38:58,980 --> 02:38:59,813
ever came on.

2820
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:04,820
And so that's way more sensitive
subject then, you know,

2821
02:39:04,821 --> 02:39:08,150
hunting wild lands well. Right. And
people have a different connection to it.

2822
02:39:08,151 --> 02:39:12,750
And so friends of ferals is as big group
in Wisconsin and I know some friends of

2823
02:39:12,770 --> 02:39:14,540
ferals friends of ferals.
Yeah,

2824
02:39:14,541 --> 02:39:17,150
they're spaying and neutering
them and putting them back out,

2825
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:21,560
back out and putting them back. Going
somewhere. Songbirds. Well, yeah,

2826
02:39:21,561 --> 02:39:25,070
I mean it's sort of sort of
that they also kill rodents.

2827
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:29,930
This one friend of mine, guys that
run farms, I mean you gotta have cat,

2828
02:39:29,970 --> 02:39:32,840
you got lunch of cats like
Kiefer's get man, he's got,

2829
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:35,560
every once in awhile he'll say, hey,
by the way, when we're up walking,

2830
02:39:36,400 --> 02:39:39,350
there's a cat up there. We
need to, I need a few less.

2831
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:43,870
But I mean for just for
road and contamination and
a friend of mine who's, um,

2832
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:44,180
yeah,

2833
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:48,550
uh, I dunno, she belongs to
friends, friends of ferals. But um,

2834
02:39:48,810 --> 02:39:52,670
was one of the people who started chastise
me about talking about a gunny sack

2835
02:39:52,671 --> 02:39:56,840
and Iraq, which is how you get
rid of cats. Uh, extra cats,

2836
02:39:56,950 --> 02:40:00,720
gunny sack in a rock. You need throw
him in the water and just ground. Yeah.

2837
02:40:00,930 --> 02:40:01,311
Mild,

2838
02:40:01,311 --> 02:40:06,311
mild man's grandpa honestly
made him dispatch disposables
of a litter of puppies

2839
02:40:06,431 --> 02:40:09,250
that way. One time. Whoa. Anyway,

2840
02:40:09,251 --> 02:40:14,070
I made a comment about it somewhere
cause I actually, I said about, I

2841
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,250
didn't even go into that. I just went
into songbirds and all that sort of stuff.

2842
02:40:17,251 --> 02:40:19,680
And she said, look, you know, on my,

2843
02:40:19,681 --> 02:40:21,840
and she's got the horses
and stuff and she said,

2844
02:40:21,841 --> 02:40:24,480
I might place all I have is feral cats
and they've all been spayed or neutered

2845
02:40:24,481 --> 02:40:26,940
and then I put them out there and yeah,
I get the whole thing about songbirds,

2846
02:40:26,941 --> 02:40:30,960
but in my area here in my place,
I'm taking care of it. You know,

2847
02:40:30,961 --> 02:40:33,480
they're not bothering songbirds are
not doing this. Then I'm like, yeah,

2848
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:38,490
but that's not what's happening
everywhere else. Yeah. So you know,

2849
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:42,450
the discussion ends up being, to my mind
at least the same kind of thing. Well,

2850
02:40:42,451 --> 02:40:46,820
how many, how many cats is enough?
How many deer or enough? Um, you know,

2851
02:40:46,970 --> 02:40:50,640
what's the balance that we're trying to
achieve here? What's the cause, you know,

2852
02:40:50,641 --> 02:40:53,290
we're the ones who made the problem.
Steve Sochi.

2853
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:54,310
I mean they,
they killed,

2854
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:57,700
they got the brushing government came
in and killed a bunch of stray dogs

2855
02:40:58,030 --> 02:41:01,850
because they had a real straight
dog rob. Yeah. And that made news

2856
02:41:02,070 --> 02:41:03,540
and healthy looking straight up.

2857
02:41:05,210 --> 02:41:05,460
Yeah.

2858
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:07,740
But they shot a bunch
of dogs. See you've, uh,

2859
02:41:07,741 --> 02:41:11,970
you've had this conversation
many times, I'm sure. And I,
one of them I watched, uh,

2860
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:15,170
in a a book signing that you had.
I thought it was, it was it books.

2861
02:41:15,430 --> 02:41:20,170
Yeah. Pt Guy came fascinating, you know,
and he was cool because he came to a,

2862
02:41:20,171 --> 02:41:23,530
a book event I did and sat
there through the whole thing,

2863
02:41:24,090 --> 02:41:29,090
can wait until the question period raised
his hand and then took me to task on,

2864
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:30,820
on the idea of hunting and the,

2865
02:41:30,821 --> 02:41:35,140
that everything I was saying was just
like a justification for Wanda farm

2866
02:41:35,141 --> 02:41:39,520
animals, animal harm, animals to kill
animals. And I pointed out to him,

2867
02:41:39,521 --> 02:41:43,210
and it's something that I've said many
times and I'll say many times more.

2868
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:44,300
So I think that people who,

2869
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:49,060
who come at it with a perspective of
having an anti hunting perspective are

2870
02:41:49,061 --> 02:41:50,710
defending a set of ideas

2871
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:56,610
that th th th th their concern for
animals, they're concerned for wildlife.

2872
02:41:56,611 --> 02:41:59,250
They're concerned for the wellbeing of
the natural world. They're defending us.

2873
02:41:59,251 --> 02:41:59,890
That animal,

2874
02:41:59,890 --> 02:42:04,890
a set of ideals that I know that
I understand better than they do.

2875
02:42:07,380 --> 02:42:10,960
I care more about it than they do.
I know much,

2876
02:42:10,961 --> 02:42:12,900
much more about it than they do.

2877
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:17,960
I'm more vested in safe guarding the
things that they think their safeguarding

2878
02:42:19,050 --> 02:42:23,580
than they are. I mean,
I just am, you know, um,

2879
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:26,280
I might not in my mind,

2880
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:31,281
there a vast difference between an
individual wild animal and the idea or the

2881
02:42:33,871 --> 02:42:36,570
essence of that species.

2882
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:38,063
Okay.

2883
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:41,610
It's difficult for people to understand
an idea that, that they're saying like,

2884
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:44,670
if you love this animal so much,
how could you kill it?

2885
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:49,990
And it might be if you came down from
Mars, you cannot from outer space.

2886
02:42:49,991 --> 02:42:51,870
It might seem like this really
counterintuitive notion,

2887
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:55,050
but because of the way we manage
wildlife purely in this country,

2888
02:42:55,620 --> 02:43:00,420
we have where we manage wildlife as
a public trust thing as a renewable

2889
02:43:00,421 --> 02:43:04,020
resource.
The funding for wildlife research,

2890
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:05,610
the funding for enforcement,

2891
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:09,000
the funding for habitat improvement in
this country is coming out of hunting.

2892
02:43:09,001 --> 02:43:14,001
License sales is coming out of excise
taxes that are on firearms and sporting

2893
02:43:14,351 --> 02:43:15,184
goods.

2894
02:43:15,670 --> 02:43:19,900
Guys that hunt our financing
to a large measure,

2895
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:24,580
American wildlife particular, that's
particularly the case and even more,

2896
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:27,040
I mean you could say that,
oh sure. At just inadvertent,

2897
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:27,800
they don't mean to do that.

2898
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:30,040
That need to be have a gun and they
want to have a hunting license,

2899
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:34,090
but then you look at the work of
organizations like National Wild Turkey

2900
02:43:34,091 --> 02:43:36,280
Federation,
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,

2901
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:40,300
ducks on limited Theodore Roosevelt
conservation partnership back country

2902
02:43:40,301 --> 02:43:43,300
hunters and anglers.
You're these groups that are hunter based,

2903
02:43:43,390 --> 02:43:46,330
habitat improvement,
hunter based wildlife organizations.

2904
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:50,380
Those are the people
paying for the things in,

2905
02:43:50,430 --> 02:43:51,940
in financing the research

2906
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:57,570
that gives the anti hunters even an idea
of what they're trying to defend it.

2907
02:43:57,580 --> 02:43:58,480
Like in this country,

2908
02:43:58,481 --> 02:44:02,590
it would not exist if we didn't
have some idea of publicly owned,

2909
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:07,120
commodified wildlife where we recognize
that wildlife is has value and should be

2910
02:44:07,121 --> 02:44:08,080
maintained for the future.

2911
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:11,680
You could have a bunch of
Rosie opinions about all that.

2912
02:44:11,681 --> 02:44:15,850
We would just take care of these
things because we should, and I agree.

2913
02:44:15,910 --> 02:44:17,230
It'd be great if we did,

2914
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:22,560
but one of the best things that can
happen to a species now in contemporary

2915
02:44:22,931 --> 02:44:26,690
America, one of the best things that
can happen to it is that it's at,

2916
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:31,700
it has a perceived value to hunters
because we want to make sure that our

2917
02:44:32,441 --> 02:44:37,441
resources are safeguarded and are going
to be around for a long time to come and

2918
02:44:37,451 --> 02:44:40,480
they're going to be round for
our kids and not talk about that.

2919
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:43,240
It's altruistic or anything
else is based on pragmatism,

2920
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:47,050
but we're taking care of our own
and we're handling our own issues.

2921
02:44:47,320 --> 02:44:51,550
Have you ever had a real legitimate
debate with someone who's an animal rights

2922
02:44:51,551 --> 02:44:54,430
activists where they sat down
for a long period of time,

2923
02:44:54,431 --> 02:44:59,320
like on a podcast and had a long form
conversation because never because no one

2924
02:44:59,321 --> 02:45:03,690
shallow, it's a shallow conversation
on their part. It's a shell

2925
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,930
station on my part because like
if I sat down with someone, um,

2926
02:45:09,070 --> 02:45:13,570
I'd go into it just as,
as holy as they would just be like,

2927
02:45:13,571 --> 02:45:14,830
I'm never going to change my mind.

2928
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:19,110
I don't think you would because that
conversation that you had with that guy at

2929
02:45:19,111 --> 02:45:22,170
that book signing shows that you've got
a pretty nuanced point of view when it

2930
02:45:22,171 --> 02:45:24,180
comes to this.
It's something you've considered.

2931
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:28,740
I've tried to defend it from that point
of view in order to understand it better.

2932
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:32,430
And the problem is there's nothing
there it goes, it gets shallow.

2933
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:35,900
When you go into this idea
of overpopulation, you go
on the idea of what, what,

2934
02:45:35,901 --> 02:45:37,290
what are you gonna do?
You're gonna bring in predators.

2935
02:45:37,291 --> 02:45:40,080
Like how are you going to control
this population? Because if you don't,

2936
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:45,120
you don't really love these animals
because the bottom line about game animals

2937
02:45:45,121 --> 02:45:49,830
when it comes to like things like deer
and elk and they must be hunted either by

2938
02:45:49,831 --> 02:45:53,730
wolves or by mountain lions or
by people because of they're not,

2939
02:45:53,820 --> 02:45:56,460
they're just going to fuck and they're
just going to overpopulate and they're

2940
02:45:56,461 --> 02:45:57,190
going to,

2941
02:45:57,190 --> 02:45:59,380
you get like something like the hand,
are you gay?

2942
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:03,220
Are you wind up where you're at with
the Hamptons or where you're at with New

2943
02:46:03,220 --> 02:46:08,220
Zealand where then you have government
financed control efforts where you have

2944
02:46:09,621 --> 02:46:13,370
people willing to pay to do something
or you finance the, you know,

2945
02:46:13,371 --> 02:46:15,050
the sort of managed,

2946
02:46:15,310 --> 02:46:18,760
well I wanted, I would love to hear that
conversation. Like what is the, what's,

2947
02:46:18,970 --> 02:46:21,760
what's the contrary point of
view? It's, I did Bill Maher. No,

2948
02:46:21,761 --> 02:46:24,400
he's a fucking silly bitch.
Yeah, that guy is so silly.

2949
02:46:24,401 --> 02:46:25,960
He's friends with Anne culter and he's,

2950
02:46:26,740 --> 02:46:29,170
he's such a weird dude when
it comes to Sony things.

2951
02:46:29,380 --> 02:46:32,950
But the Pieta thing is a
knee jerk reactionary thing
that you can do if you're

2952
02:46:33,190 --> 02:46:38,190
getting all your food from
a fucking supermarket and
you're so not in touch with

2953
02:46:38,381 --> 02:46:41,170
the natural world, you're banging
playboy playmates at the mansion.

2954
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:43,600
That's a fucking wildlife preserve
right there. That's a fence.

2955
02:46:43,601 --> 02:46:48,010
Didn't preserve well another
area, I'm sorry, go ahead.

2956
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:50,800
But it's just,
I want to know what the point of view is.

2957
02:46:50,801 --> 02:46:53,530
What is the debate against,
because I've never seen it done.

2958
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:54,870
I've never seen it success

2959
02:46:55,400 --> 02:46:57,860
talking about two different things,
but you're not really,

2960
02:46:57,861 --> 02:47:01,850
but I think that people would come and
they'd be talking about just suffering.

2961
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:06,740
Okay. Animal suffering. I could never
look someone in the eye and say,

2962
02:47:07,130 --> 02:47:10,750
I could never look someone in the
eye and say that an animal is, uh,

2963
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:14,540
willfully lending themselves to slaughter.

2964
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:17,150
I could ever look someone in
the eye and say that, oh yeah,

2965
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:19,760
hunting animals is painless procedure.

2966
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:24,910
And so they have a thing where they value
if their primary thing is stopping any

2967
02:47:25,131 --> 02:47:29,210
level of suffering happening to
any individual sentient being.

2968
02:47:30,050 --> 02:47:32,360
And that's their goal.
My goal is just so different.

2969
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:37,550
My goal is to have a managed,
when I say manage,

2970
02:47:37,551 --> 02:47:38,510
I'm just saying sustainable.

2971
02:47:38,511 --> 02:47:43,511
I'm not saying anything to
have a sustainable suite
of North American wildlife

2972
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:48,990
that we can manage into the future for,

2973
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:52,130
for myself and future
generations to enjoy.

2974
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:56,100
And that we can leave the
country and leave the world in a,

2975
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:57,290
in a better place.

2976
02:47:57,460 --> 02:48:00,610
The logic and than we found it. I think
that's a scientific perspective, Steve.

2977
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:05,110
And when you're talking to Peter People,
the reason that chart, it's a religious,

2978
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:08,280
you're talking about religious
fanatics in a way. Well,

2979
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:11,740
it's a shallow thought thinking process
because they've only looked at it on the

2980
02:48:11,741 --> 02:48:15,520
surface and they've looked at it in a way
where they've conveniently ignored the

2981
02:48:15,521 --> 02:48:19,150
fact that these are animals that have
a finite lifespan and that the animals

2982
02:48:19,151 --> 02:48:21,530
that are traditionally
hunted by predators, human,

2983
02:48:21,560 --> 02:48:24,300
you're partnering with people
who are religious, but are they,

2984
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:25,990
are they or are they just trying to,

2985
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:29,200
are they just nice people that
haven't looked into it? Some people,

2986
02:48:29,201 --> 02:48:33,460
I think some of the Peta people and some
of the movement came when we realized

2987
02:48:33,461 --> 02:48:37,870
that a big Pharma and, and
uh, cause cosmetics industry,

2988
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:43,110
and we're using animals for experiments
like chimpanzees and bunny rabbits with

2989
02:48:43,451 --> 02:48:46,300
lipstick. And a lot of people
said, you know, why are,

2990
02:48:46,301 --> 02:48:49,780
why are you making animals suffer on
these farms where you're using them for

2991
02:48:49,781 --> 02:48:54,280
their fur and using testing makeup on
them and they're going blind or you're,

2992
02:48:54,281 --> 02:48:58,350
you're seeing how a monkey reacts when
you take its baby or way you in the end,

2993
02:48:58,360 --> 02:49:00,310
the animal sobs or even,

2994
02:49:00,550 --> 02:49:05,550
and I don't know the extent of how
much HIV drugs have benefited from,

2995
02:49:05,650 --> 02:49:07,240
from experimentation on chimpanzees,

2996
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:11,670
but I've read very heartbreaking accounts
of chimpanzees that are given HIV.

2997
02:49:12,030 --> 02:49:16,920
And they just saw because they feel
sick and they feel terrible and they

2998
02:49:16,921 --> 02:49:20,760
literally just put their head in their
hands and sob in a alone in some cases.

2999
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:24,360
So you can understand all of us, I
think all of us go, wait a minute,

3000
02:49:24,390 --> 02:49:27,810
I can understand going, that's
not right. I don't want,

3001
02:49:27,811 --> 02:49:30,780
I don't want to buy products that are
tests on animals. And we all do that.

3002
02:49:30,870 --> 02:49:35,870
So I think some of the Peta movement
was fueled by that particular thing and

3003
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:42,600
Doug Raises Doug raises beef cattle and
he just said that there's some cattle

3004
02:49:43,021 --> 02:49:44,940
practices that he's uncomfortable with.
Yeah.

3005
02:49:44,941 --> 02:49:47,930
And suddenly we were all drawing
lines and you're right, you know,

3006
02:49:47,931 --> 02:49:51,490
a lot of us could look like if you can
put some kind of shampoo and a rabbit's

3007
02:49:51,491 --> 02:49:56,440
eye and determined that that's not a good
recipe for shampoo and you could have

3008
02:49:56,441 --> 02:49:59,340
read the same conclusion in some way
that didn't involve animals suffering.

3009
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:04,260
It's a, it's a potent argument. Yeah. But
a lot of trucks that save lives, they do.

3010
02:50:04,261 --> 02:50:06,960
You do. You start in a petri dish,
then you do test them on animals.

3011
02:50:06,961 --> 02:50:10,080
In the last group is a, is a,
is a controlled group of humans.

3012
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:12,030
She read a book about this,
that that's what you do.

3013
02:50:12,210 --> 02:50:16,140
And the reason you test on animals is
because you have to see initially how it's

3014
02:50:16,141 --> 02:50:18,600
going to react in an organism
is complex as a, as a,

3015
02:50:18,810 --> 02:50:23,730
as an animal organism to see if it has
adverse side effects before you go on to

3016
02:50:23,731 --> 02:50:27,690
test it on to a human.
So it's a, but I can,

3017
02:50:27,691 --> 02:50:30,210
I can appreciate, like I
said, when somebody says,

3018
02:50:30,630 --> 02:50:34,650
if you're testing animals to see if you,
if somebody can look prettier,

3019
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:37,650
I can see that being somebody
can have an objection.

3020
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:39,920
So then it becomes a question of what,
what's,

3021
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:44,510
what's worth what's worth testing
on animals. Yeah. And I, yeah,

3022
02:50:44,511 --> 02:50:46,850
I couldn't agree with more.
And Steve's right.

3023
02:50:46,880 --> 02:50:50,570
I've in my people will call you if you're
mistreating your animals in our area,

3024
02:50:50,571 --> 02:50:52,190
other people who have
animals and people who hunt.

3025
02:50:52,191 --> 02:50:54,860
And it's hard if you're mistreating
your animals, you get called out on it.

3026
02:50:54,861 --> 02:50:57,110
I'm in our area. People will
say, you know, wait a minute,

3027
02:50:57,111 --> 02:51:00,440
just like if you're doing poor, uh, uh,

3028
02:51:00,470 --> 02:51:02,840
management practices and your
fields and what not, people will,

3029
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:05,600
will call you out on it.
Why aren't you doing contour stripping?

3030
02:51:05,601 --> 02:51:08,810
Or why aren't you taking
care of, you know, why don't
you take care of things. So,

3031
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:11,140
you know, it's sort of an
extension of that. So it, you know,

3032
02:51:11,150 --> 02:51:14,590
in my view it ends up being, there's
a balance in all of this. And Yeah,

3033
02:51:14,610 --> 02:51:17,530
case by case, I, I'd go with you.
There's things, I mean, I don't,

3034
02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:21,170
I'm not worried about personally not
worried about I make up or that kind of

3035
02:51:21,171 --> 02:51:23,130
stuff.
So I don't think it makes

3036
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:24,720
you shouldn't be,
you'd look beautiful.

3037
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,670
There was a question about whether I
was going to something that literally,

3038
02:51:28,990 --> 02:51:32,460
I know, but the marketplace,
by the way, because of that,

3039
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:36,310
that education that a lot
of the marketplace has said,
you know, you see a lot of,

3040
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:39,530
how many products do you see that
not tested on animals? So not a ways.

3041
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:41,940
The marketplace kind of went, you know
what? A lot of people, all of us went,

3042
02:51:41,970 --> 02:51:43,560
I don't want an animal.
I don't want that. Well,

3043
02:51:43,580 --> 02:51:47,460
there's big difference between testing
cosmetics, which is so frivolous,

3044
02:51:47,461 --> 02:51:50,910
or testing medicine, which you can save
your children. There's a huge difference.

3045
02:51:50,911 --> 02:51:52,530
In my eyes,
I don't have a problem with them.

3046
02:51:52,531 --> 02:51:55,980
Testing medicine that can save babies
are really, I'm sorry. I don't,

3047
02:51:55,981 --> 02:51:59,460
I like people more than I like animals.
I have to the whole vaccine.

3048
02:51:59,461 --> 02:52:02,850
I mean all of our major vaccines, man,
we wouldn't have, yeah, I have two dogs.

3049
02:52:02,851 --> 02:52:05,980
I have two cats. I love animals.
I fucking do animals. I love to

3050
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,420
eat. I'm too though. I'll tell you a
surprising thing I saw one time did we?

3051
02:52:09,421 --> 02:52:12,180
Did we got to, do we have more? Do
we have a couple minutes? We're,

3052
02:52:12,181 --> 02:52:15,670
we're running out of steam here. I'll do,
I'll, well, I'll say it for next time.

3053
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,560
We turn into a Pumpkin at three hours in.

3054
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:22,980
We talked about a lot of this on the,
on the show eater. He gets on. Yeah.

3055
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:25,960
Tomorrow night.
The show needs to be an hour.

3056
02:52:25,961 --> 02:52:27,130
Don't you think you show
needs to be an hour?

3057
02:52:27,131 --> 02:52:30,610
I'd love to see the show
because sports channel, the
candidate, Sarah Pailin, broad

3058
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:35,100
fucking [inaudible] some
questions about that one too. But

3059
02:52:35,710 --> 02:52:37,800
sure. It's going to bring
attention to the network,

3060
02:52:37,801 --> 02:52:40,630
which is a great thing because
it's a great network and they,

3061
02:52:40,670 --> 02:52:41,760
they support that show,

3062
02:52:41,761 --> 02:52:45,450
which is the best show on television
all the time about going into hour.

3063
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:48,900
And we talked about the
upsides and downsides. Don't
know, there's no downside,

3064
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:51,690
there's no downside. There's
something really just, but I,

3065
02:52:51,691 --> 02:52:55,190
I've fallen in love a little bit hesitant.

3066
02:52:55,191 --> 02:52:59,540
Love with just how clean
and crisp 2020 well done.

3067
02:53:00,260 --> 02:53:04,890
How, how clean and crisp like a well done.
It's too good a show. Um, you're right.

3068
02:53:04,970 --> 02:53:08,150
That's flattery. Flattery,
44 minutes please.

3069
02:53:08,151 --> 02:53:10,280
It means in ease an hour
and needs no commercials.

3070
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,700
That's great.
I couldn't agree with you more,

3071
02:53:12,701 --> 02:53:16,870
but I really got to get this in or Helen's
going to give me heck after awhile.

3072
02:53:17,070 --> 02:53:19,720
Helen's you can give me hell
and that is the show on.

3073
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:23,230
But then also the show tomorrow night
is the second part of our episode.

3074
02:53:23,231 --> 02:53:24,370
And I honestly,

3075
02:53:24,371 --> 02:53:28,630
I'm excited to see it because I have no
idea what happens in this second part,

3076
02:53:28,660 --> 02:53:30,940
other than I know what
happened while we were there.

3077
02:53:30,941 --> 02:53:32,050
But what became a part of [inaudible]

3078
02:53:32,490 --> 02:53:37,040
what out of that 80 hours made
it really interesting that Steve,

3079
02:53:37,041 --> 02:53:38,540
you know what the first show we did,
Steve

3080
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:43,270
warned me and said, well, you know, nobody
likes the way they come across. And I,

3081
02:53:43,550 --> 02:53:46,380
yeah, and I, and I was, it
felt exactly the opposite.

3082
02:53:46,381 --> 02:53:50,490
And then the other thing is that
you can download episodes on,

3083
02:53:51,990 --> 02:53:56,020
I can never remember the name.
Dot. Vtx Dot. Txt checks,

3084
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:00,160
meat eater Dot v H X. Dot. TV.
That's exactly right. Okay.

3085
02:54:00,270 --> 02:54:04,530
Go there in the street. You can stream
and download. There it is right there.

3086
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:08,120
Oh yeah, yeah. Awesome.
Fucking show. Live Bra.

3087
02:54:08,230 --> 02:54:10,800
It really is the best show on television.
And you know,

3088
02:54:10,801 --> 02:54:13,290
I get a lot of compliments about the show.
People that love it,

3089
02:54:13,291 --> 02:54:16,290
that I turned on to it and did not even
hunters. They have no desire to hunt.

3090
02:54:16,291 --> 02:54:18,600
They never want to hunt. They
just love it. It's a great show.

3091
02:54:18,601 --> 02:54:21,690
It's great narration. It's just,
it's a really special thing, man.

3092
02:54:21,900 --> 02:54:23,520
Joe Rogan is the best thing that
ever happened with the show.

3093
02:54:24,220 --> 02:54:27,790
There it is. Like, well, I'm honored. I'm
honored that you've had us on not once,

3094
02:54:27,791 --> 02:54:29,930
but twice. And that we're going to
do it again. And maybe with Collin.

3095
02:54:30,470 --> 02:54:33,610
You don't want to laugh. No, I
don't have to go into Alaska.

3096
02:54:33,611 --> 02:54:36,610
We're going to fuck up some boosts.
All right. It's happening. If I,

3097
02:54:36,611 --> 02:54:40,060
if there's room, I don't want them to
make room. We'll make another raft. We'll,

3098
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:44,620
we'll, we'll buy some more land
from the Soviet Union you send.

3099
