KENDRA COMMANDER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.920
Welcome to Authors At.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.320
My name is Kendra Commander.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.340
I am on the partnerships team
at google.org, focusing on

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.930
access in the developing
world.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.530
We have a very exciting
talk today.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.780
We have author, filmmaker,
entrepreneur, professional

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.450
climber, Majka Burhardt joining
us today to talk about

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.430
coffee, education,
sustainability in Ethiopia.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.890
And I think you guys
are in for a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.970
really, really big treat.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.010
It's a sort of combination of
multimedia presentation as

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.680
well as talk.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
There will be some distortion
perhaps in the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760
quality of the video.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.250
So please, it's not her fault.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.220
It's our fault.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.790
So welcome to the talk.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.991
And hope that you
guys enjoy it.

MAJKA BURHARDT: All right,
how are you feeling?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.903
Anyone feeling a
little anxious?

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:31.500
A little scared?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.740

catch my breath?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.100
Anyone want to go climbing?

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.480

MAJKA BURHARDT: So let's take
that edge with us for the next

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.110
30 minutes.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.350
So I'm going to start off.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.240
Anyone in this group
Ethiopian?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.470
OK, zero hands are going
up right now.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.890
So I'm going to give
you guys a hint.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm going to ask you guys
that question again at

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.810
the end of this talk.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.490
Before I do, I'm going to tell
you three stories that I can

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.360
guarantee are going to change
your perspective on Ethiopia,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.460
adventure, coffee,
development, and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.610
our role in the world.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.830
I do speak this fast.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.780
We have a lot to talk about.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.480
So we're going to get
right after it.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.125
First, let me introduce you to
Marsha Aday, his wife, Gete

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.140
Tebo, and six of their
seven children.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.880
Marsha Aday is the tribal leader
of the Messa tribe and

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.640
lives on the flanks of Mount
Yero Wallo deep in the Amaro

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.080
Mountains of Ethiopia.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.270
I wasn't looking for Marsha
Aday exactly.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.330
I was looking for the
best storyteller.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.220
I traveled for six hours that
day by car and by foot and for

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.840
two days previous to that
from Addis Ababa,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.300
the capital of Ethiopia.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.950
And when I got to Mount Yero
Wallo, I walked through--

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.070
it's basically the Switzerland
of Ethiopia.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.060
You're walking through
shocks of Kelly green

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.400
false banana trees.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.700
The coffee trees, the wild
coffee trees, are growing with

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.170
such ferocity they seem to
sprout new leaves and coffee

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.580
cherries by the second.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.520
When I got there, I asked
everyone and I said, who's the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.150
best storyteller here?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.640
And without long, I knew that I
was looking for Marsha Aday.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.800
Marsha Aday lives in a
home without a door.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.580
That signifies his status as
the head of the tribe.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.510
He's protected by everyone
around him.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.930
And he can also have full
vantage point of the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.080
valley below him.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.260
So he knew I was coming to talk
to him a full hour before

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.370
I even knew who he was
or where I was going.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.530
He was getting ready.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.280
He was taking all of the
furniture out of his home and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.290
putting it outside, covering it
with skins and with furs to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.790
make sure that we'd
be comfortable.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.530
And when I finally arrived, we
sat down and started talking

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.340
about coffee.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.090
Marsha Aday is a coffee farmer
in one of the most rural parts

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.280
of Ethiopia, which means he
makes less than $1 a day.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.330
However, he drinks a fortune
every day in coffee.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.210
Coffee is so plentiful here in
Ethiopia that people have

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.185
coffee trees in their
backyard.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:43.610
They have coffee forests
in their backyard.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.550
And they drink coffee so much
that if Marsha Aday's personal

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.760
coffee grove was getting top
value in the market, which is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.670
about $150, $160 a pound, he
himself would drink $75 a day

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.340
in coffee, which is a four month
income to him that he's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.940
just drinking away
in his coffee.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.195
So is he a poor Ethiopian
coffee farmer?

00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:07.860
Or is he a rich Ethiopian
coffee farmer?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.250
Totally depends on how we're
willing to look at Ethiopia,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.610
coffee, economics, any of it.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.140
Coffee in the Amaro Mountains
didn't come here from people.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.620
But it came here from nature.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.500
Wef Zerash is the term for
natural seed dispersal by

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.510
birds and by animals
in Ethiopia.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.520
And the coffee, as I said, is
so plentiful in this part of

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.400
Ethiopia that Marsha Aday likes
to say that there's no

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.370
way for the cherries
to leave the trees.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.880
His coffee is accounted for in
legend in Ethiopia in the 10th

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.210
century BC.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.350
But Marsha Aday's ancestors
didn't start drinking it until

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.070
3,000 years later in
the 20th century.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.060
And the story is told that they
were convinced that these

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.620
bright red coffee cherries, if
you would eat one of those,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.570
you would be burned.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.960
Because whatever was in it was
clearly going to explode in

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.880
your mouth.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.460
And it wasn't until the mid
1900s where actually traders

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.570
came into the Amaro Mountains.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.930
They came on camels from the low
lands of Kerdea on camels

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.240
to the highlands of
the Amaro and

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.680
started trading for coffee.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.450
And Marsha Aday's ancestors
were like, hmm.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.230
What's going on here?

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.790
We thought these were
going to burn you.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.420
And they waited until the same
traders returned, unburned,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.190
before they started actually
consuming that coffee.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.660
And once they did, it
was off the hook.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.710
This coffee consumption is
like anywhere in Ethiopia

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.660
three times a day, four times a
day multiple cups of coffee.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.850
That's part of the every
day culture there.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.920
Marsha Aday told me this story
while holding a bright red

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.080
coffee cherry in his hand
and handing it to me.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.150
And I bit into it.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.420
And when you bite into a ripe
one, your teeth kind of pierce

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.450
the outer skin.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.360
And I thought, what if this
could be the best

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.520
coffee in the world?

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.560
What if this is the coffee that
could also get that kind

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.440
of value on the market?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.760
What would that mean for
these people here?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.580
Marsha Aday lives a half a
drive away from any town,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.570
assuming you can actually
drive on the roads.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.010
The roads are more often used
as flat spots for drying

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.205
coffee than they are for any
sort of transportation.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.880
When you're actually driving
there, you have to stop and

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.130
let people move some of the
coffee away off the road.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.395
Because it's so unlikely to
have a vehicle show up.

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:10.720
I was there for four days.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.020
It was the only vehicle
we had.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.160
We almost didn't get out.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.430
Because a huge flash flood
came in and made

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.360
everything a mud slide.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.670
So we could have been there for
quite a bit longer before

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.130
another vehicle would've
been able to come up.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.840
As I said, the coffee topples
over itself as it stretches up

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.910
the flanks of Mount
Yero Wallo.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.370
Marsha Aday and I were speaking
for about a half an

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.180
hour at this point.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.190
And he was so excited.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.420
Because no one had ever asked
him about his coffee.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.000
And to the best of his
knowledge, no one had ever

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.200
asked his ancestors.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.540
But he was sure, without a
doubt, that his coffee was the

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.580
best in Ethiopia.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.630
And I've actually never met
anyone who thought differently

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.570
about their coffee, right?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.830
And we were speaking.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.030
And he kept telling
me, my coffee

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.360
is the best in Ethiopia.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.030
And by the time he'd said it
three times, he was saying it

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.220
to me in English.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.610
Because the translation had
computed at that point.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.690
And at that point, I said, well,
we're going to have to

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.370
have some coffee.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.610
We're going to have to really
celebrate this.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.120
And he said, yes.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.910
But first, we should
kill an ox.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.290
Because that's a logical
thing to do when

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.330
you're pretty excited.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.580
And you're in Ethiopia.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.570
And you're thinking, we should
have a celebration.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.245
But it's the afternoon.

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:12.740
And these clouds are mounting.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.450
And actually grabbing the ox,
killing the ox, slaughtering

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.150
it, cooking it, this
can take some time.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.040
We were a little bit pressed.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.960
So we decided that the
alternative was that Marsha

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.255
Aday was going to
dance for me.

00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:22.650

So post-coffee, we're going
to amp it up a little bit.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.720
And we went into his home to
find out what post-coffee was

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.200
going to be.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.110
And we walked inside.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.230
And Gete Tebo was already
preparing coffee.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.010
So she had raw coffee beans.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.220
They were over a charcoal
fire on a flat pan.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.470
She's roasting them.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.020
All a sudden, that sweet smell
is infusing this earthen home.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.380
My stomach's growling.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.380
The clouds are building
in the east.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.710
And then she takes
those perfectly

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.740
roasted coffee beans.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.820
She puts them in a mortar and
pestle, takes her 30 seconds.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.800
I've been working in Ethiopia
for 10 years.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.690
It takes me still about 35
minutes to do what it took her

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.230
30 seconds to do to grind
those things by hand.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.580
Pours them into a thick-bellied
and thin-necked

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.860
jabana, a clay pot.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.030
Puts it on the stove.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.490
And the smells just keep
infusing, sweet

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.940
and citrus and honey.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.520
And I keep thinking, God,
this is going to be

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.870
the best coffee ever.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.560
And then this huge
clap of thunder

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.960
comes in and lightning.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.020
And everything goes
dark in the home.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.530
And I take one last breath.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.130
And I run as fast as I can
to escape a flash flood.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.710
And I never had that coffee.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.230
70% of Ethiopia lies
between 2,000 and

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.790
8,000 feet in elevation.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.660
50% of Ethiopia is incredibly
vegetated, moist, dark

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.510
volcanic soil.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.120
It's the perfect place
for growing coffee.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.280
The images we're used to seeing
of Ethiopia, dry,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.350
barren desert.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.740
That's only a third
of Ethiopia.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.220
This is the land where
humanity began.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.910
And if you listen to legend,
coffee showed up right after

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.010
humans and in fact in
the sixth century.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:19.000
Ethiopia has 10,000 different
types of coffee, 10,000 unique

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.520
flavors, varietals.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.950
And at this point, the
estimation is that only half

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.910
of them have actually been
found, tasted, and cataloged.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.980
So 5,000 different types of
coffees are still lying in

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.360
wait in the forest
in Ethiopia.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.800
That's incredibly intoxicating
for any sort of coffee

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.270
aficionado, entrepreneur to say,
what does it mean that

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.420
this country, one of the poorest
countries in the

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.810
world, has the greatest supply
of one of the globe's richest

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.720
commodities?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.470
What can we do to kind of
push that together?

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.750
What can we do to take those
tastes out of the forest?

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.270
Ethiopia, over 60%
of its foreign

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.780
earnings come from coffee.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.310
If you gave every coffee farmer
in Ethiopia 10 cents

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.100
more, Ethiopia's annual income
from coffee would go by $60

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.390
million a year.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.350
But I don't think that's
a really good idea.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.040
Because Ethiopia is also kind
of this bastion, has been a

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.050
bastion of aid.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.600
It's been the largest
recipient of aid in

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.970
sub-Saharan Africa
since the '80s.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.590
It's been the place where great
failures of aid have

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.920
happened and great successes
of current sustainable

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.950
development.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.230
And if we go in from a coffee
perspective and just say,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.930
let's pay more to Ethiopia
because it's Ethiopian coffee.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.760
And we bet it's good.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.570
We're going to be doing the
same thing by going in

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.720
with a blind eye.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.850
And I think what will be more
interesting and what's

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.970
starting to happen is to go into
a nuanced conversation

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.670
about nuanced coffee.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.510
So here we are in California.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.380
You all have probably been in
restaurants or in cafes when

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.630
you walk in, you actually get
a bit of a coffee menu.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.250
And you know that there
are different tastes.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.740
There are different flavor
profiles for coffee.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.390
Imagine if you went to the best
restaurant in Palo Alto.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.040
And the coffee list was as
big as the wine list.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.360
That's the potential we're
talking about.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.620
And if we do that, then suddenly
you're rewarding

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.920
quality and taste.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.460
And you're actually entering
a complicated conversation,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.950
which is where things, in my
opinion, start to get a lot

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.200
more interesting.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.740
This is what we're used to
seeing about Ethiopia,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.050
drought, famine, poverty.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.910
It's a constant and consumate
negative trifecta.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.520
I think coffee can actually
change this.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.490
And I think it can do it because
I'm kind of addicted

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.260
to complexity.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.750
And I think that this
is probably a crew--

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.060
people at Google are thinking.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.220
People are striving.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.420
And it's like, instead of going
towards a simple life,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.830
how can we go towards a complex
life in the way that

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.590
we interact with the world?

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.360
For me, it started simply
with a free latte.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.400
We're going to go back
in time here.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.980
So it's 2007.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.630
And I was going to my
neighborhood coffee shop.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.200
And there's this creepy guy
outside whispering to me,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.390
which I'm not sure
about you all.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.380
But whispering in public
to strangers, not cool.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.920
It's just not the way
you make friends.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.520
But then I'm walking into
this coffee shop.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.300
And this guy's like, hey, free
latte across the street.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.710
It's like, yeah, OK.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.110
That's great.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.460
You're weird.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.310
Just kind of move away.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.730
I'm going to go into
the coffee shop.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.910
No, free lattes.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.660
I said, but I don't
drink lattes.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.940
He said, but they're free.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.620
It's like, that's a
pretty good point.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.600
And then I look across
the street.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.810
And this kind of smoking
handsome man was serving up

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:12.430
the free coffee.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.730
So I was like, all right,
the free latte is

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.540
looking really good.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.280
So I cruise across the street.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.860
And I'm lactose intolerant.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.270
So this is already not a good
idea to be doing this.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:21.810
But I go up there.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.800
And I get a free latte.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.500
And I sit down.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.230
I start eavesdropping
on the conversation.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.760
It's a coffee company
called Novo.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.610
They're in the Front
Range of Colorado.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.050
And they start talking about a
coffee called geisha that was

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.740
at that time getting $150
a pound on the market.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.840
That's grown in Panama.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.690
And they were going on a trip
to try to find the genetic

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.760
roots of it in Ethiopia.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.310
It took me about 30 seconds.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.940
I stood up.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.870
I introduced myself.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.540
I'm like, do you guys
need a journalist?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.080
Three months later,
I'm in Ethiopia.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.290
When I got to Ethiopia, I
understood about 0.003% of the

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.490
coffee world.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.690
I was a writer.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.625
I was an educated coffee
consumer to

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:54.340
the best of my ability.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.390
And I went into Ethiopia
being like, local,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.610
organic, fair trade.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.860
Those are what matters.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:12:59.900
And suddenly, I'm in Ethiopia.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.510
And I'm like, whoa, I have no
idea what the heck I'm doing.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.280
This is completely
overwhelming.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.900
And frankly, it was really
scary for me.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.140
And so what I did is I turned to
a part of Ethiopia that was

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.730
way more comfortable for me.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.780
And that's because in my other
life, I'm a professional

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.335
climber, which I just got out of
the Wyoming wilderness and

00:13:16.335 --> 00:13:17.870
the winds where I was climbing
for seven days.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.970
And we were laughing.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.300
Because I'm covered in scratches
and scrapes because

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.180
of shoving my hands into
granite cracks.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.050
So when I was in Ethiopia and I
was scared about coffee and

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.420
I saw a picture of these towers
in northern Ethiopia, I

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.885
was like, yeah, that's
my home in Ethiopia.

00:13:31.885 --> 00:13:34.140
I'm going to go climbing
in Ethiopia.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.620
An Ethiopian publisher caught
wind of this plan.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.090
And they came to me with
a plan of their own.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.660
And they're like, this
is super cool.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.530
You're going to go climbing.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.080
You're a writer.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.280
Why don't you write a book about
climbing in Ethiopia?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.420
I was like, yeah, that
sounds great.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.480
And they said, and by writing
a book about climbing in

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.980
Ethiopia, you're going
to save Ethiopia.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.230
So check it.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.120
You're a climber.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.860
You're a writer.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.700
And someone tells you, if you
write a book about doing what

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.470
you love, you're going to save
one of the poorest countries

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.620
in the world.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.650
That's a pretty good deal.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.780
That feels pretty good.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.870
So I was on board.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.780
And the plan was that if I wrote
this book, that millions

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.120
of climbers would then
flock to Ethiopia.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.280
And they'd change the economics
of Ethiopia.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.040
So a little show of hands, who
in the room is a climber?

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.170
OK, cool.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.460
And everybody else basically
knows what climbing is.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.580
How many of you have flocked
to Ethiopia since my first

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.140
book came out?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.500
Awesome.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.120
Everybody in the room raise
their hand just

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.660
for point of reference.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.380
So it was hard to pass up.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.250
You think this could be
a really good idea.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.070
And we got there.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.290
And we showed up the
Gheralta massif--

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.480
this is in northern Ethiopia.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.120
It's never been climbed.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.990
We thought, we are so smart.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.360
Look, it-- we're so proud
of ourselves.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.450
It was myself and a team
of four other women.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.310
And my friend Gabe Rogel was
shooting photos for the book.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.980
And we're like, no
one's been here.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.465
God, well how silly everybody
else is, how smart we are that

00:14:45.465 --> 00:14:46.700
we figured this out,
that we're the

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.150
ones discovering this.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.950
And we're in this landscape
in northern Ethiopia.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.670
This is the site of the
famine in the '80s.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.310
This is the place that was
hardest hit where millions

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.580
starved, millions died.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.930
They were affected by political

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.110
power plays, food shortages.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.210
This is the heart of it
in northern Ethiopia.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.150
And here we are climbing
there.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.280
This is actually what pretty
much created aid as we all

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.500
know it in this room.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.640
Because in '84, you had this
really neat confluence where

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.460
you had the fact that crisis
could be delivered direct to

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.070
our television sets at home.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.290
You had a very affluent US,
Canada, Western Europe ready

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.370
to help, ready to save things.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.770
And you had this dismal country
entrenched in famine.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.820
And how could we not react?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.080
Most of us in this room have
probably been affected by that

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.770
part in 1984.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.120
I was 8 during the famine
in Ethiopia.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.165
I was in Minneapolis
where I grew up.

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:44.430
I went to Montessori school,
which is relevant.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.170
Because when Michael Jackson,
Cyndi Lauper, Waylon Jennings,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.740
when they all got together and
did "We are the World," at

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.360
Montessori school, you sing
it like twice a day.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.240
It would be like school
assembly.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.320
And we'd be singing it.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.310
And then it would be
in the afternoon.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.590
And you'd be singing it again.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.950
And I was so inspired by Michael
Jackson that I was

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.210
like, I should write
a song of my own.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.240
If Michael Jackson writes about
Ethiopia, I'm going to

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.101
write about Ethiopia.

00:16:05.101 --> 00:16:05.600
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:13.384
-(SINGING) I want to help
a kid in Ethiopia.

00:16:13.384 --> 00:16:19.940
Nobody else can help this one.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.840
MAJKA BURHARDT: He we go.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.760
-Everybody needs somebody.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.070
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.170
MAJKA BURHARDT: See?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.370
There's three and a half
more minutes of that.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.010
I'm sure you all wish
you could hear it.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.885
I will make it available, pop it
up on my drive later on so

00:16:36.885 --> 00:16:38.910
you all can download it and
listen to it or torture

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.260
yourselves with it,
depending on what

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.550
you're thinking of doing.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.920
23 years later after I wrote
that song, I was

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.160
doing this in Ethiopia.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.190
And as I said, we thought we
were the smartest people in

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.980
the world that we'd
figured this out.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.220
And it went incredibly well, to
climb, to put first ascents

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.890
up on sandstone towers where
you're shoving your hands and

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:57.830
your feet into cracks.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.710
And they're getting purchase.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.380
And you're putting your
equipment and your metal gear.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.350
And you're clipping
your rope in.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.570
And you're pretty sure
it's going to keep

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:04.819
you safe if you fall.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.190
And it went great
for like a day.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.720
And then it went
horribly wrong.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.710
So here's the difference.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.819
It's going great on the left.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:12.990
It's a really cool photo.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.750
On the right, it's a
really bad photo.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.400
This is sort of the difference
in what happened.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.430
Because there was professional
photographer Gabe taking

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.400
photos when we were happy.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.599
And there was Mike is very
scared and doesn't want to die

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.839
in Ethiopia on the right
side of the screen.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.930
Because what happened is this
crack that we were following--

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.819
we were trying to climb
this 500 foot tower.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.770
The crack disappeared.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.570
And suddenly, we just had
the face to climb.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.980
And the rock that we were
climbing there was the kind of

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.630
rock that if you went up, you
could snap off the face hold

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.210
with your finger, with
your pinkie.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.550
You felt like if you just stared
at it for too long, it

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.450
would return back to its
natural sand state.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.340
And that was all we had to go
on when this crack ended.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.370
And it was a point for me in my
climbing career that I was

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.580
like, wow, I don't even know
if I want to do this.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.730
But I'm writing a book about
climbing in Ethiopia.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.940
And if I can't get beyond here,
what kind of book is

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.940
this going to be?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.000
And I ended up doing it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.460
And we got to the top
of this climb.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.090
And when we got to the top of
it, I was like, OK, now what?

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.110
How are we going to get down?

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.690
And I'm probably going to
have to do this again.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.810
Because last I checked, it
wasn't a children's book that

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.280
I signed a book deal for.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.080
So I'm probably going to have
to climb more than one of

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.780
these things.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.330
And I'm scared about how
I'm going to do it.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.630
This was the safe and
known route for me.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.990
Coffee was supposed to
be overwhelming.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.390
Climbing was supposed to be
what would be easy for me.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.590
And yet, when we got down from
climbing this tower--

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.390
we did our first ascent
on that--

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.570
we started hanging out with
a family at the base.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.860
And this is a 14--

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.980
excuse me, a 13-year-old girl
with her 4-month-old daughter

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.250
on her back.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.070
So here I am thinking about
exploring a country through

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.270
climbing, through opportunity,
through adventure.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.810
And then at the other side,
I'm looking at one of the

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.370
highest needs for maternal
health care in the world.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.110
How do you put those
things together?

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.520
And how was I going to
put those things

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.590
together in the book?

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.740
And the only way that I figured
out how to do it was

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.450
to get comfortable with what I
now think about as the middle

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.250
place, where some things
make sense.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.250
And some things never do.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.970
Where that climbing and that
need for maternal health care

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.530
can go together.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.865
Back in 2007, I never thought
I would go back to Ethiopia.

00:19:01.865 --> 00:19:02.830
I thought, I went there.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.760
I had a really good time.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.620
I spent four months.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.610
I wrote a book.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.360
But then I went on a speaking
tour for 50 cities when my

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.360
first book "Vertical
Ethiopia" came out.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.780
And I tried to tell these really
big complex stories

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.970
about Ethiopia from
that middle place.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.330
And what I saw is that people
wanted to know more.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.060
And they would come up
to me afterwards.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.810
And they would be like, hey,
so about that coffee?

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:24.690
What's the deal with that?

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.120
Whatever happened to that?

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.630
Have you ever gone back and
thought more about that?

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.280
And pretty soon, I saw that
two things were going on.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.560
Number one, people really
like coffee.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.300
That's kind of obvious.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.990
But it became very clear
to me at that point.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.920
And number two, we're sort of
obsessed with Ethiopia.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.930
And part of that-- it's like if
I had written my first book

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.770
about the Ivory Coast, it
probably wouldn't have been on

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.170
a 50 city speaking tour.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.510
But we've all been trained to
pay attention to Ethiopia from

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.230
global media, in part because of
what happened in the '80s,

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.530
in part because it just became
this relative point for us to

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.210
all cast off of in its aid
center of gravity, but also

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.080
because of the ancient Aksumite

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.030
empire, Haile Selassie.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.210
It's the only country in Africa

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.230
that was never colonized.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.780
It has this rich history.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.950
We've just been taught to
pay attention to it.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.050
And I started thinking about,
well, how can I leverage that

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.980
for Ethiopia?

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.550
What's going to be the most
interesting and enticing way

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.670
that I can do it?

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.450
And I went back.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.250
And I was back in the States.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.880
And this is not Ethiopia.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.120
This is New Hampshire, which is
where I went that winter to

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.350
go ice climbing, in 2008.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.780
And while I was there, I was
like, I'm going to go back.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.490
What's my plan?

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.740
And I decided that I would go
back and write a book about

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.150
coffee and culture and
connecting those two things to

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.260
try to tell a broader story
about Ethiopia.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.630
And then something
else happened.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.880
I got a phone call.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.450
This is Imagine 1 Day.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.550
Imagine 1 Day is a Canadian
nonprofit that is basically a

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.420
leadership development
powerhouse in Ethiopia veiled

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.810
as an education nonprofit.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.310
And Image 1 Day had this idea
that they were going to go

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.990
into Ethiopia and support
primary school education.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.420
And that's how they
started out.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.400
But last year, they were working
in Bale, which is in

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.960
south central Ethiopia.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.370
And they working with
their teachers.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.730
And they're working
on what they're

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.530
going to teach in schools.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.200
But they're also doing this
whole life skills training.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.480
So they're talking to them about
communication skills,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.710
about goal setting.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.430
And these teachers flooded the
Bale chapter of the Commercial

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.260
Bank of Ethiopia and opened bank
accounts the day after

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.670
this life skills training
happened so much so that the

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.170
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
called Imagine 1 Day and was

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.820
like, um, who are you?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.690
What are you doing?

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.240
We've never had teachers open
savings account like

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.800
this in this area.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.190
Imagine 1 Day, up in the north
of Ethiopia, they have this

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.970
great scholarship program
for high school kids.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.930
They wanted to work in
primary education.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.900
Now they're giving scholarships

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.890
to high school kids.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:40.510
And they're doing it where
they're like, you, you're

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.320
super motivated.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.970
So I'm going to give
you a loan.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.360
Because in Ethiopia, to go to
high school, it's basically

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.380
like going to boarding school.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.550
Because you're going
to have to travel.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.410
You're not going to have it
in your remote village.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.550
So in order for you to have
the money to go to school,

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.820
we're going to give
you seed money.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.610
Get your supplies.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.410
And we're going to give your
parents a loan to buy a really

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:56.590
skinny cow.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.310
And then your parents are
going to feed that cow.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.980
And they're going
to have a whole

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.400
animal fattening program.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.620
They're going to sell
that fat cow.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.810
They're going to save
some money.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.110
They're going to buy some
more skinny cows.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.120
And at the end of four years,
these parents are going to

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.540
have actually financed three
years of that kid's high

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.350
school education.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.910
And the one year that
Imagine 1 Day did

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.470
is going to be forgiven.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.650
This is a program that this
was never their intention.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.680
This was completely outside
of their wheelhouse.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.010
What the heck is a nonprofit
focused in education doing

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:28.020
fattening 177 cows and opening
497 bank accounts and working

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.170
with schools and going to some
of the poorest people in the

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.060
world and saying, you
want a school?

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.690
That's great.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.120
Help us pay for it.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.570
Asking the poorest people
in the world to

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.000
actually spend money.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.930
And that's part of what Imagine
1 Day does is they're

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.240
like, what do you want?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.770
Can you help us get there?

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.320
And what they've seen is a
resounding yes from these

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.250
communities in Ethiopia.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.910
Like, we want to help.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.480
You have communities who go
and petition the cement

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.530
companies nearby and say,
we really need a road.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.280
And those communities
created that road.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.750
It wasn't Imagine 1
Day who did that.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.010
It was the community.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.540
And there are examples of this
happening throughout Ethiopia

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:03.960
with these non-profits.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.580
And part of it is because you
have this confluence.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.050
So many people flooded
to Ethiopia in the

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.260
'80s and the '90s.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.110
And so many people were doing a
very large and messy version

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.670
of aid that it was bound to
happen that people were going

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.880
to start getting streamlined
and working towards

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.910
sustainable development.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.100
When Imagine 1 Day gave me a
call in 2008, we were like, we

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.030
need to work together.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.130
Because what we're both trying
to do is somehow change the

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.290
conversation about Ethiopia.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.690
And we're here in the US.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.920
There's a pretty international
crowd in this room and the

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.620
people that I've talked
to already.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.600
We all know what national
identity is on a global scale,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.700
that countries are
misrepresented and

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.050
misunderstood constantly in
our world and truncated to

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.700
become smaller and
easier to digest.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.900
And we thought, if we can help
change the conversation about

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.720
Ethiopia, where are those
conversation shifts going to

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.920
be more important on the global
scale down the road?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.800
I've since worked with
Imagine 1 Day.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.830
We've combined rock climbing,
education, coffee, eye care,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.970
all of these different ways
to keep blowing it out.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.820
And a lot of non-profits
will approach me.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.760
And they're like, we want
to work with you.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.780
And one of the first questions
I say is, are you willing to

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.390
go outside your wheelhouse?

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.960
Because non-profits have had a
focus for a long time about

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.810
saying, this is the one
thing I'm going to do.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.500
I'm going to make sure that
I'm focused on foot care.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.160
Because foot care is the
way that people are

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.920
going to move around.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.540
And it's going--

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.810
whatever my mandate is.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.310
But if there isn't
collaboration, if people

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.380
aren't saying, in order to do
this, then I need to work with

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.610
the schools, and I'm
going to work with

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.170
the health care systems.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.510
Then these things die.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.290
And these things die a really
long death that gives aid the

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.920
bad name that it kind of had.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.060
And it's really fascinating to
me that if you take a country,

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.660
like Ethiopia, that was once,
like I said, that largest

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.870
recipient of aid in sub-Saharan
Africa, what if we

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.540
could kick total butt on
sustainable development and be

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.780
the leader for that?

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.330
Wouldn't that be one of the
greatest things to come out of

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.130
what's happened in Ethiopia
in the past 30 years?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.120
It's not super easy.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.260
And one thing that I will
definitely admit is Ethiopia

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.350
is not a perfect country.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.690
I mean, no one in this room
can come up with a country

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.820
that's perfect.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.170
But that's sort of the point.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.400
And I like to think Ethiopian
is like the ultimate

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.500
doppelganger for all
of us in the world.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.430
And if it can succeed, then
we can succeed at this

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:16.400
complexity.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.660
And for me, that all comes
back to coffee.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.840
And the reason it does is
because in Ethiopia, you have

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.160
80 languages, 200 dialects,
10,000 types of coffee.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.420
Multiply that all, do some extra
numeric, get to infinite

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.130
numbers of stories about
coffee and complexity.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.380
And in Ethiopia, when you
drink coffee, you

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.630
drink it as a ritual.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.000
You drink it as a way to
celebrate your culture.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.860
And the stories that
there are abound.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.510
This is a guy named Gebru who
lives up in northern Ethiopia.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.380
And he told me that when he was
growing up, he was told if

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.510
he drank coffee, he wouldn't
make it to paradise or heaven.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.120
And the proof from his parents
came in the following story.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.250
That when Jesus was
killed, coffee

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.210
didn't mourn Jesus properly.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.500
So when Jesus was killed, the
Earth went into mourning.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.110
So the rivers were dry.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.030
The trees were completely
barren.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.420
The wind was still.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.470
But the only plant that kept
growing was the coffee plant.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.760
It sprouted new leaves.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.070
It had fresh cherries.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.410
Coffee, as Gebru says,
didn't cry for Jesus.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.140
So he wasn't allowed to drink
it when he was growing up.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.800
He told me this story over a cup
of coffee in his mid '40s.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.730
So clearly, we've moved
on from this.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.940
He thinks he still has a decent
shot at paradise.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.780
But most of the kids in his
generation didn't drink coffee

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.410
growing up but then kind of
moved on to having it when

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.240
they got older.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.180
A couple hours south of where
Gebru is in northern Ethiopia,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.940
on the shores of Lake Tana,
there's a place called the

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.370
Zegay Peninsula where in 1307
Bishop Abuna Mariam gathered

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.310
his flock of people.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.490
And they settled there.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.870
And they said, what are
we going to do?

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:49.435
How are we going to survive?

00:26:49.435 --> 00:26:50.770
And he said, don't
worry about it.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.805
And he took his prayer stick.

00:26:51.805 --> 00:26:53.750
And he broke it across
his leg.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.520
And he planted one piece
in the ground.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.670
And he broke it again and
planted two more pieces.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.260
And he said, come
back tomorrow.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.450
So everybody came back
the next day.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.850
And there were three
crops growing,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.180
coffee, hops, and lemon.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.860
And the bishop made his people
promise that those were the

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.590
only crops that they
would ever have

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.800
on the Zegay Peninsula.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.100
And to this day-- this
was in 1307.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.280
To this day, those are
the only crops grown

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.550
on the Zegay Peninsula.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.660
And they're transported across
Lake Tana on these papyrus

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.150
boats every day.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.490
Coffee origin stories
abound in Ethiopia.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.360
Like I said, we have the
multiplier, right?

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.280
A friend of mine once said
that if you flew over

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.710
Ethiopia, and you had a lot of
gentle darts, just like little

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.945
stickies or something
like that that

00:27:32.945 --> 00:27:33.890
had a little traction.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.860
And you just dropped them.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.920
Every place they landed, you'd
have a new story about coffee

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.680
in Ethiopia.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.080
And that's probably true.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.550
Have any of you guys heard
of the story of Khaldi?

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.620
So Khaldi, there's a very famous
story that if coffee

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.530
comes from Ethiopia, there
was a guy named Khaldi.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:49.105
He's Christian.

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:49.700
He's Muslim.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.620
He's a delinquent.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.250
He's a scholar.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.780
There's lots of different
variations.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.750
The bottom line is, Khaldi
saw some goats having

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.920
a really good time.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.830
And he's like, that looks fun.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.390
And he went and was like,
wow, they're having fun.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.410
Because there were
eating coffee.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.430
So he started eating coffee,
brewing coffee.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.940
Boom, coffee.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.340
Khaldi, most stories,
is from Kaffa.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.735
Kaffa is a region, the kind
of kingdom of Kaffa in the

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:11.530
central Ethiopia.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.260
And it's a great onomatopoeic
link to say Kaffa, coffee,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.460
which is not actually true.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.410
It's a really cool story.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.230
But coffee, the word, comes from
the Arabic word Qahwa,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.300
which is a drink made
from the brew.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.550
There's a great story about
the seventh century coffee

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.150
being discovered by Prophet
Muhammad's grandsons.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.690
His mother was giving
them a bath.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.400
And she tossed their bath
water out the window.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.390
And the next morning, a coffee
forest had sprung up there.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.310
And that began the Muslim
ritual, in Ethiopia, of using

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.670
coffee beans for ceremonial
purposes.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.750
There's a story about a ox
that smelled really good.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.820
And he started coffee.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.920
Because he smelled good.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.890
And people wanted to smell
as good as the ox.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.700
There's no right story.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.110
And that's part of the beauty
of the way stories are

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.670
expressed in Ethiopia.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.240
And when you have coffee,
that's your

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.390
time to share that.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.340
Coffee is usually drunk in a
three step ritual called a

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.480
coffee ceremony.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.620
So when I was with Marsha Aday,
the coffee I didn't get

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.730
to drink, Gete Tebo, his wife,
was making the first cup of

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.050
coffee, super, super
strong coffee.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.700
And once we all had that, she'd
pour water into that

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.630
same pot and re-brew it.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.620
And then we'd have a second
weaker cup and then a third

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.740
weaker cup.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.350
And in the Amaro Mountains, if
you show up in the first cup

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.330
of coffee, and there's an
unmarried woman who's in that

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.160
house and you cross the
threshold during the first

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.140
cup, she's yours.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.850
Marriages have been brokered
over that.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.700
You show up during the second
cup of coffee, nah, it's a

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:28.850
little iffy.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.840
You're pretty suspicious
to that family.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.330
Third cup arrival of a
stranger means peace.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.020
To drink coffee, to drink three
cups of coffee, not just

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.410
slam them down, but to
drink three cups of

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.960
coffee, takes time.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.410
And that time is sort of how a
lot of Ethiopia transactions

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.330
have been brokered
for centuries.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.820
And I like to think about
Ethiopian that in four miles,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.060
you can have seven different
languages.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.820
And how do you work with
that kind of diversity?

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.430
It's sort of a microcosm for
what we're dealing with in the

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.370
world right now.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.790
And I like to think that in
Ethiopia, you deal with it by

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.430
sitting down and taking
time and drinking

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:03.620
three cups of coffee.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.820
Because if you spend that much
time with other people, you

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.450
work through differences.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.690
This is a country that's 60%
Christian and 40% Muslim and

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.200
largely harmonious.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.700
It's kind of amazing that
Ethiopia has existed the way

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.720
it has with its complexity and
yet been as stable as it has.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.350
I would, of course, like
to tell you that that's

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.450
completely because of coffee.

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.420
But that might be
an unrealistic

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.670
claim to put on there.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.970
Taking the time and settling
down for someone like myself,

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.980
when I go to Ethiopia, is always
hard to remember to do,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.300
to be like, I'm going to sit
here and not have a fast cup

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.060
of espresso that I can have if
I just go around the corner.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:42.630
But if I do that, and I get
thicker with it, then where

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.920
can I be as a complicated
person?

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.620
And that's kind of what
I want to leave this

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.840
conversation with.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.880
Because in the beginning, I
asked you all, who's Ethiopian

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.690
in the room?

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.480
And no one raised their hand.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.500
But I think that if being
Ethiopian can mean embracing

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.270
complexity, that we might all
be willing to be Ethiopian.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.970
And if we, as a group, if we can
work with-- if it's just

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.830
with coffee that you want to
take out of this conversation,

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.530
then go into your local
coffee shops.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.910
Go into your restaurants, and
say, where's this coffee from?

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:11.050
Tell me a story.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.930
But don't just tell
me the good story.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.220
Tell me the big story.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.910
Tell me the good and the bad.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.560
Identify coffee not just with,
well, there's this really nice

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.180
coffee farm.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.330
And they don't make quite
a lot of money.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.380
But they really care about it.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.880
And they have really
great children.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.810
I don't want to hear
that story.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.770
I want to hear the stories about
what matters to that

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.080
community, what's happening
in that world.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.720
Because we have access to that
through the people who are

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.790
working in coffee.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.730
So let's push them
a little harder.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.260
And let's push ourselves a
little harder to tell these

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.010
big stories that are
scary that come

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.270
from that middle place.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.360
So I'm going to ask
you all again.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.440
We all come from Ethiopia.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.620
It's the cradle of humanity.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.810
But if being Ethiopia means
being our best complex selves

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.280
as human beings, being
curious, having full

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.310
conversations, who's Ethiopian
in this room?

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.680
Right on.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.322
Thanks very much you guys.

00:32:00.322 --> 00:32:06.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.610
MAJKA BURHARDT: I'm doing a
new project right now in

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.500
Mozambique.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.120
And I was laughing with some
of my friends in Mozambique

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.050
saying, we're going to be
Ethiopian in Mozambique.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.820
And all my Mozambican friends
were like, what the heck are

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.980
you talking about?

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:18.350
I was like, no, because we're
combining and climbing this

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.760
2,000 foot granite big wall, so
pretty big objective from a

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.770
climbing standpoint, and
bringing scientists up on it

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:26.260
to find new species of ants
and geckos and beetles and

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.850
bugs and then starting a
new conservation area.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.980
And it's all on Mozambique's
second highest mountain.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.610
It's sort of insane to put all
those things together.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.720
But it's been really fun.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.410
And it keeps getting richer with
all the layers that we

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.000
add into it.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.970
But I've been made fun of quite
a bit by my team in

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.860
Mozambique by telling them to
just embrace their inner

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.490
Ethiopian for it.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.380
My favorite story of
coffee in Ethiopia?

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.350
I think one of my favorite
stories is there's a woman

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.460
named Asnakech Thomas.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.360
And she's the only female miller
in Ethiopia, which is

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.560
quite a distinction.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.300
And she's worked really hard
to kind of create this

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.360
speciality coffee there.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.950
And she'll make sure
that things are

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.850
being separated out.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.990
And she's following them all the
way through the process so

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.420
she can watch the
unique profiles.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.090
And one of the main reasons
she wants to do this is

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.680
because she's lost two sisters
to fistula, basically early

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.210
death from child when they
were going through labor.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:22.120
And maternal health has a long
way to go in Ethiopia.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.400
And there's been a
lot of work done.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.770
And when you talk to Asnakech
and you can

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.940
get her to that point.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.110
And you're like, why are
you working so hard?

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.120
She's so innovative.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.810
She comes up with all these
brilliant ideas.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:31.910
She's been a cheese maker.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.780
She made wedding cakes.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.860
She grew castor plants.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.590
And now she's thriving
in coffee.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.960
And she's like, I want coffee to
create a hospital in Amaro

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.890
so that people like my sisters
don't come home two in a box.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.440
And two in a box means
mother and child

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.520
together in the same box.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.300
Because they died during
childbirth.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.470
And it's not an origin
story of coffee.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.490
But it's the passion and that
she can see that coffee has

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:59.020
the potential to do that in her
home is really amazing.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.390
AUDIENCE: We had an author a
while ago who was talking to

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.930
us about the Bordeaux region in
France and like all of the

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.739
different things they
do to make their

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:09.850
wines what they are.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.469
And half of that
is technology.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:17.770
But the other half is just the
practices that they use to

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.630
grow and to activate
the vines.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:28.370
Are there things that these
people could sort of transfer

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.090
from that--

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.290
MAJKA BURHARDT: From the
winemaking culture?

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.469
AUDIENCE: From the winemaking
culture.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.090
I mean, if we're talking a wine
list in a restaurant, and

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.560
we're talking now
a coffee list.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.800
Seems like--

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.610
MAJKA BURHARDT: There's
quite a bit.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.980
Because it's all about--

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.290
AUDIENCE: It's a family
business in Bordeaux.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.719
I mean, it's a very family
business thing.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:51.030
They're keeping the big players
out, so to speak,

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.700
which I think may be important
in Ethiopia if it--

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.409
MAJKA BURHARDT: Well,
it's interesting.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.020
Because Ethiopia was
sort of forced--

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.460
because of what was happening
in Ethiopia in the '70s and

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.260
the '80s from a regime
standpoint, you basically had

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.940
the Derg, this Communist,
Marxist bloody regime.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.370
Everything was forced to
not industrialize.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.530
And in fact, that was one of
the tenants of the Derg.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.600
But because of that, it's not
like you're going to Brazil.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.730
And you have coffee being
processed at that level.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:17.270
It's really small lot

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.060
differentiation can still happen.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:23.490
And right now, it's kind
of a classic evolution.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:26.560
There's the Jimma research
station that does all this

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.490
research on the morphologies
of different coffees and

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:29.780
what's going to make
them thrive.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.700
And when they first started
doing the work, they would

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.100
release these [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.340
And they would take a coffee
from central Ethiopia.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.380
And they'd be like,
this is great.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.190
And then they'd shoot it over
to eastern Ethiopia.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.830
And it would just fail
miserably, which now we would

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.310
all look at it and be like,
well, of course it failed.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:44.840
But when they started, they
were thinking, well, we're

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.950
making a very drought resistant,
beautiful coffee.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.240
It will always taste the same.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:50.420
And now it's like, no, no.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.590
We need to make the best Harar
coffees from Harar.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.160
And then, what do you do
to take care of them?

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.490
And there's lots of experts
going in, working with the

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.280
experts in Ethiopia and
saying, what is

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.490
the best soil situation?

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:02.800
What's the best forest canopy?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.090
How do we do this?

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:08.680
And then the question becomes,
if small lot coffee is

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.800
actually going to be the wave
of the future, which I would

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.670
argue it is.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:12.710
It's very elitist.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.405
It's very expensive.

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:15.210
But it's the same thing that
happened with wine.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.550
You had super expensive wine.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.220
And then eventually,
it trickled down.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.730
And you have the
differentiation.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.620
And if that's going to happen,
then the hardest thing is that

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.830
when I show up with my bag of
cherries from my trees, I have

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.280
to watch that bag of
cherries then go

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.300
through all the processes.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.730
So that finally we know, when we
taste that beautiful lemon,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.970
where it came from.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.810
And so that's a pretty
big commitment.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.550
But there's a lot of structure
going into place

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.300
with that in Ethiopia.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.110
So it's pretty exciting
there right now.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.220
It's complicated to get coffees
out of there sometimes

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.190
because of the way export
trade happens.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.980
I'm sure you all at Google run
into, how do you work with

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.490
Ethiopia as a company
with its laws?

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:51.570
My first book, that was
published by an Ethiopian

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:56.340
publisher, actually had to be
purchased from a cousin of the

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.310
publisher in England to be
shipped out of Ethiopia.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.840
Because they were like, well,
we can't just have a book on

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.970
loan out somewhere.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.715
We have to purchase them all.

00:37:04.715 --> 00:37:05.500
It's crazy.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.230
So I got into export policies.

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.297
And I was a writer.

00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:09.730
Who knew?

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.520
AUDIENCE: Are there any major
players exporting coffee?

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.240
I never really hear.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.800
Maybe you do.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.070
MAJKA BURHARDT: Major players
exporting coffee.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.770
MAJKA BURHARDT: In Ethiopia?

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.050
Or which countries?

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.780
Or which companies?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.810
AUDIENCE: Out of Ethiopia.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.280
MAJKA BURHARDT: Yeah, so there
are Ethiopian companies.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.710
But usually they're
partnering.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.660
You have the whole range.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.000
You have someone like
Blue Bottle

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.460
Coffee in San Francisco.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.230
Those guys are great.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.115
They do a really good job with
small differentiation.

00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:33.330
You have Starbucks.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.860
Starbucks has massive power in
Ethiopia, not in like sketchy

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.880
power way, but in like legit.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.800
They have made really big
changes in Ethiopia because of

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.430
being able to work with such a
big group of people and then

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.360
work on some of that.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.080
So most major coffee companies,
be it something

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.490
like Starbucks, be it something
like Intelligentsia,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.450
be it a company like Novo
in Denver, they have a

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.620
relationship in Ethiopia.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.500
And now the big thing a lot of
people in Ethiopia are trying

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.940
to do is actually not just
export green coffee, but

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.160
export roasted coffee.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.240
So they have a little bit
more control over it.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.810
The problem is that when you're
exporting roasted

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.912
coffee from Ethiopia, it's like
if you're going to roast

00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:12.110
it and then drink it in a couple
days, it gets a little

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.380
bit murky with how you're going
to do that with large

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.210
amounts of it.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.590
I realize I should show you
the photographers' names.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.240
Because they would love it
if everyone knew that the

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.620
beautiful images are not mine.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.270
Because I'm lucky.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.940
And I get to work with great
professional photographers.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.030
AUDIENCE: You touched
on politics a

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.030
little bit in Ethiopia.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:34.190
Is the political situation
in Ethiopia such that the

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.280
development that you're
talking about

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.120
can actually happen?

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.120
Or is the politics getting
in the way?

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.480
MAJKA BURHARDT: Great
question.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.150
Ethiopia has a goal itself that
it wants to be a middle

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.870
income country by 2050 or
something like that.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.310
It's an incredible goal.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.230
It's actually a little bit
insane if you really think

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.870
about it, which makes
it really beautiful.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.690
So actually, the Ethiopian
government is-- depending on

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:55.810
which initiatives you're
working with.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.690
Education is one of the things
that they've really set out as

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.310
a mandate to go after, which is
one of the reasons Imagine

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.710
1 Day chose to work
in Ethiopia.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.200
Because they're like,
we're going in.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.600
The government really wants
to buttress education.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.250
So we're going be able to
work hand in hand there.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.420
So it depends on what
kind of development

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.760
you're trying to do.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.840
When you step over into press
freedom, Ethiopia is not-- if

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.140
it's like, let's make
more journalists.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.540
That's not really going
to be supported

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.720
that well right there.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.380
But the same thing with like
internet access or the way

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.780
that texting works
in Ethiopia.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.190
But I think that one of the
things that the Ethiopian

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.190
government is really trying to
spearhead is actually wanting

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.980
to be that progressive.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:35.580
If you set a mandate that you
want to be a middle income

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.430
country in a very short amount
of time, then you're going to

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.550
have to be willing for people
to get in and kind of get

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.090
grisly and dirty with how
they're going to do it.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.850
And they've been really
supportive, I think, to a lot

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.110
of sustainable development
groups.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.030
Sustainable development is one
of those things that's almost

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.410
becoming a phrase that doesn't
mean anything anymore.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.190
And I think that's really
unfortunate.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.820
Because it's a big difference.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.180
Sustainable development
and aid are on other

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.380
sides of the spectrum.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.380
And I'd love to see us have that
word not fall away and

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.610
become like, nah, whatever.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.300
But actually support that word
and ask people what it means,

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.950
what it means to extract
yourself from somewhere, what

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.350
it means to have these schools
support themselves because

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:18.320
they have income generating
strategies for schools.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.320
There's this great group I work
with called the Himalayan

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.090
Cataract Project.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.680
Horrible name for a group
working all over the world.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.930
But they do eye care.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.500
And when they do eye care in
Ethiopia, they've trained tons

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.470
of nurses and local surgeons
to do these cataract

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.000
interventions so that they come
in and bolster it and

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.070
more numbers happen.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.990
But it's being self-sustained
in Ethiopia.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.590
AUDIENCE: How are you seeing
sustainable development work

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.730
out in Ethiopia?

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.710
Coffee has a really long
history and tradition,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.040
especially in Brazil, of really
not being sustainable.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.730
So are there organizations?

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.870
Or how are people learning to
become sustainable farmers or

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:55.460
build a sustainable
food chain?

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.280
MAJKA BURHARDT: When you
bring up Brazil--

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.720
it's sort of Ethiopia's
blessing

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.860
because of its history.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.460
Because it wasn't
industrialized.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.280
Because it wasn't using massive
amounts of chemicals.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.790
Because everything wasn't
getting poured in the same

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.810
place, it kind of has a bit of
a weird advantage to that.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:12.700
But when we're talking about
sustainability on that level,

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.310
there's a lot of work
being done to that.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.190
It's been really difficult
in Ethiopia.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.900
It's probably the same thing
in the Bay Area, right?

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.850
You have a really small farm.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.670
They want to get an organic
certification.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.480
The money they have to pay to
get an organic certification

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.774
is really prohibitive.

00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:28.560
So there have been different
coffee companies that will go

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.860
in and be like, we'll
cover this.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.910
Or you guys get your
Rainforest Alliance

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.500
certification.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.900
And we'll help you work
through that.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.430
Because the rest of the world
wants to see that stamp and

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.650
wants to know that you're going
through those practices.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.460
I would say that a lot of the
coffee grown in Ethiopia

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.580
already sort of falls under
sustainable practices.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:50.160
But it's about actually being
cognizant and focused on

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.730
continuing it as things start to
get industrialized and also

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:55.120
as money starts coming
in for coffee.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.330
Because once you get more money,
it's like, let's grow

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.230
the coffee faster.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.100
Let's get it going.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.570
It's like, whoa.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.130
Actually, we need to
go the slow way.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.530
Because that's going to
be where that value is

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.130
going to come in.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.710
So there's a fair amount of
agricultural support.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.760
It's an agrarian country.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.910
So you have that.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.060
And it's an interesting thing.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.380
Because there's actually a lot
of intervention from China

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.460
right now, especially
in the roads and the

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.840
telecommunications industry
in Ethiopia.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.700
And then as that starts to bleed
into agriculture, where

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.450
those kind of sustainable
mandates, where they hold up

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:25.120
and when they don't.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.740
And I'm really curious to see
where Ethiopia is going to

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.530
fall on that in the
next couple years.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.750
AUDIENCE: How does fair trade
play into the economics of

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:34.890
coffee in Ethiopia?

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.410
And what do Ethiopians
think of fair trade?

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:41.390
MAJKA BURHARDT: My favorite and
least favorite question.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.280
So fair trade's complicated.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.580
Because fair trade is like
this great idea, right?

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.840
And I use it as an example.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.580
When I first went to Ethiopia,
I'm like, fair trade,

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.460
organic, let's go.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.910
And then when you get into the
nitty-gritty of it, you

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.460
realize that fair trade can
sometimes be a limiter.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.970
Because fair trade
sets a price.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.960
And then sometimes those farmers
can't get more than

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.870
that for their coffee.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:05.160
So it kind of has this back end
limitation involved in it.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.830
So in Ethiopia, fair trade
initially was seen as

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:10.860
something that was
really great.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.470
Because it meant that you got
a little bit more money for

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.540
your coffee.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.030
But now it's seen as,
how can we make

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.570
fair trade more flexible?

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.530
Because that's how fair trade
has to evolve to be most

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.310
effective for some
of these products

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.360
as opposed to saying--

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.655
the fair trade price does
fluctuate depending on what

00:43:26.655 --> 00:43:27.800
the commodity price is.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.330
But it doesn't allow for the
price to be like crazy because

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.550
all of a sudden people tasted
this one coffee and think that

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.600
it should get $95 a pound.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.880
It doesn't accommodate
for that.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.680
So how can we kind of use
fair trade would be my

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.130
recommendation and use--

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:42.540
it has such a hold
over people.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.480
It's amazing.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.410
We see it as a stamp.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.460
Like when you buy things,
you're like,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.030
oh, it's fair trade.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.870
It's probably better.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.860
It's been really effective
at its marketing.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.590
And I would say, if fair trade
can keep evolving so we can

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.310
use that mind share it has, then
it's going to be the best

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.980
circumstance for Ethiopia.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.120
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
harmony between the Muslim and

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.680
Christian communities
in Ethiopia.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.340
In almost all around the world,
there's some trouble in

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.960
between the two.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.580
What's the secret sauce?

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.120
MAJKA BURHARDT: I think the
secret sauce in Ethiopia is

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.770
that it's just mingled.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.240
I have a good friend named Teddy
Berhanu who I've worked

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.440
with on probably seven

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.060
different projects in Ethiopia.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.540
And Teddy just tells
it how it is.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.500
This is a guy who at one point
was pulled over by some

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.990
militia dude with a
big machine gun.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.680
And he walked out.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.580
And he was so mad that
he went hand-to-hand

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.590
combat with this guy.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:33.630
Got rid of the machine gun.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:34.150
Tied him up.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:35.550
Put him in the back
of his car.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.170
Drove him to the nearest
police station.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.460
That's Teddy.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.320
He's just like-- he's
like, [GRUNTS].

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.830
But he's kind of this little
really nice guy.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.140
And I always ask him about the
Muslim, Christian thing.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:46.640
And he's like, Majka,
whatever.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.470
I grew up.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.660
And it was my birthday.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.730
We would have my birthday.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.370
And then it was like,
oh, you're fasting.

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:52.200
But I'm not fasting.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.660
So I'll make sure that your
Muslim father cuts

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.520
the meat for you.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.830
And then when I come over, I
make sure that your Christian

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.300
neighbor shows up and does
what I need to do.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.480
I think that there's just been
so much integration that it's

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.450
worked really well.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.310
On the flip side of it, there
are parts of Ethiopia where

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:09.160
that's not happening.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.880
And there's parts of
Ethiopia where that

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.820
tension is being prodded.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:14.650
And that's really unfortunate.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.890
Because sometimes there are
reasons for tension because of

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:19.530
the way that assets have been

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.200
allocated, land's been allocated.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.400
But I actually think that quite
a bit, because of it's

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.590
position in the Horn of
Africa, other groups

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.240
are going in there.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.050
There's a big insight in from
the Protestants groups trying

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.540
to be like, let's
stir the ashes.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.000
Let's feed the fire
a little bit.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.700
And if anything, that's the
thing we should be fighting to

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.020
not happen.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.370
Because I think that--
it's like I said.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.980
There's so much diversity in
Ethiopia that it isn't really

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.680
about if you're Christian
or if you're Muslim.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.780
It's really about, well,
what else you got?

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.710
Because there's a lot more
things that make us different.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:49.050
And so it becomes less
relevant within that.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:53.280
And you just have that mapping
and continuous overlapping.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.170
AUDIENCE: Please, give
a hand to Majka.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.770
[APPLAUSE]
