00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.840
One downside of using the native dom selectors,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.360
such as document.querySelector or document.getelementbyID is

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.820
that what is returned is a dom node and not a D3 object.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.310
If we try to call any D3 functions on what's returned from the dom selectors,

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.910
we'll get an error saying a method is not defined.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.280
In order to leverage the full power of the D3 chainable API,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.720
we need to create a D3 element from a selection so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.988
that the selection is wrapped with all of the functions D3 defines.

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:37.760
The d3.select function looks very

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.710
similar to query selector defined in the api of the dom.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.620
And just as we passed in .viewermain as a CSS selector to

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.210
signify that we want a dom node that had class viewer-main,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.040
we can do the same with d3.select function.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.340
Notice what gets returned is an array rather than a single dom node.
