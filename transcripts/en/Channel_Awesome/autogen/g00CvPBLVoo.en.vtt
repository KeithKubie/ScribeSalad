yeah you know watching this episode I I

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129
yeah you know watching this episode I I
 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.830
yeah you know watching this episode I I
guess the show isn't over so you know

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840
guess the show isn't over so you know
 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.929

nobody knows but I have a theory that

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:51.939
nobody knows but I have a theory that
 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.959
nobody knows but I have a theory that
maybe all of this I'm sure there's other

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969
maybe all of this I'm sure there's other
 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.519
maybe all of this I'm sure there's other
stuff that's gonna go on to prove me

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529
stuff that's gonna go on to prove me
 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.080
stuff that's gonna go on to prove me
wrong by always have it I have a theory

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090
wrong by always have it I have a theory
 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.529
wrong by always have it I have a theory
that maybe all of this is like one big

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
that maybe all of this is like one big
 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.300
that maybe all of this is like one big

again I just see this very easily being
 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.730
again I just see this very easily being
an 8-bit game if they have made an 8-bit

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740
an 8-bit game if they have made an 8-bit
 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.140
an 8-bit game if they have made an 8-bit
game how this they should like for the

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150
game how this they should like for the
 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.980
game how this they should like for the
computer because I think that'd be

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990
computer because I think that'd be
 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.550
computer because I think that'd be
awesome

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560

off of it I think they should do like an
 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.659
off of it I think they should do like an
8-bit game you know like the really

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669
8-bit game you know like the really
 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.969
