00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.620
When you think of an extrovert odds are you're imagining a loud obnoxious party animal.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.920
Instead of falling back on old often inaccurate stereotypes, we want to focus on the strengths of extroverts.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.940
We encourage you to do the same. Here are six things extroverts are best at doing.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.900
Number one, extroverts are enthusiastic.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.660
According to research, extroverts are actually wired to be enthusiasts because they strongly associate their environment with rewards.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.600
This is why they're often known as the life of the party in some circles.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:47.440
Studies have shown that when people find themselves in a positive experience, they are likely to move faster, remember better and take on an optimistic demeanor.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.380
This is very much instant gratification for an extrovert who is motivated by their impulse to be happy.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.800
Number two, they're natural risk takers.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:06.820
While risk is often negatively associated with reckless and unhealthy choices, in healthy doses, risk-taking is actually one of the best things you can experience.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.040
Extroverts are always searching for the next exciting adventure, whether it'd be traveling the world, having an unconventional career or creating the latest invention.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.960
Extroverts are one of a kind. Thanks to biology, dopamine is more active in their brains.

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:27.429
Dopamine is the neurotransmitter in our brains which motivates us to seek external rewards and take risks.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.100
This makes extroverts natural explorers and the least boring people you'll ever meet.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.780
Number three, they're able to make friends from all walks of life.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.200
Their friendly and easygoing disposition makes them easy to talk to, which often attracts many people to them.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.200
They enjoy variety and rarely fall in with cliques too.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:58.080
Since extroverts are not intimidated by large social gatherings, they are also skillful at navigating their way around like a butterfly and network while also making it a fun enjoyable experience for everyone.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.200
Number four, their curiosity brings them unique experiences.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.040
Adventure is always out there and extroverts take the leap to embrace it.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.660
Their curiosity helps them gain knowledge about the world, that can make them wise informative individuals with great stories to tell.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.880
Number five, they're likely to succeed in their career.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.660
Extroverts make great workers because they're highly conscientious individuals.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.680
They are constantly figuring out how things work and are motivated by challenges.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.280
This enthusiasm and creative problem-solving sets them apart from their peers, making them approachable leaders, but also great team players.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.420
Since extroverts are people-oriented, they value interpersonal connections with their co-workers and are always willing to reach out to check in with someone to see how they're doing.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.860
This mutual openness really helps a company grow closer as a unit.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.360
Number six, they're open with their feelings.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.060
Making a good impression is what helps land a job interview or score a first date.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.720
But vulnerability is the essential ingredient for cultivating deep relationships.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.880
Because extroverts are open about their feelings, as well as the feelings of others, they open the line of communication easily.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.960
While introverts are widely considered interesting because of their mysterious nature, the more underrated extroverts' transparency makes them endearing and honest individuals.
