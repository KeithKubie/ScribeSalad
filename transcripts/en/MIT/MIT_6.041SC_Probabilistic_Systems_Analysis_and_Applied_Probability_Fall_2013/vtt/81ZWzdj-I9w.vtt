00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.250
Welcome back guys.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.080
Today we're going to work on
a problem that tests your

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.550
knowledge of joint PMFs.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.620
And we're also going to get
some practice computing

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.200
conditional expectations and
conditional variances.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.740
So in this problem, we
are given a set of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.610
points in the xy plane.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.290
And we're told that these points
are equally likely.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.210
So there's eight of them.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.410
And each point has a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.500
probability of 1/8 of occurring.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
And we're also given this
list of questions.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.670
And we're going to work
through them together.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.590
So in part a, we are asked to
find the values of x that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.010
maximize the conditional
expectation of y given x.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.300
So jumping right in, this
is the quantity

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.190
we're interested in.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.610
And so this quantity
is a function of x.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.430
You plug-in various
values of x.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630
And then this will spit
out a scalar value.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.970
And that value will correspond
to the conditional expectation

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.640
of y conditioned on the value
of x that you put in.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.690
So let's see, when x is equal
to 0, for instance, let's

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.410
figure out what this value is.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.790
Well, when x is equal to 0
we're living in a world,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.660
essentially, on this line.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.520
So that means that
only these two

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.730
points could have occurred.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.550
And in particular, y can only
take on the values of 1 and 3.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.580
Now, since all these points in
the unconditional universe

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.740
were equally likely, in the
conditional universe they will

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530
still be equally likely.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.620
So this happens with
probability 1/2.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.640
And this happens with
probability 1/2.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.960
And therefore, the expectation
would just be 3/2 plus 1/2

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.380
which is 4/2, or 2.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.700
But a much faster way of seeing
this-- and it's the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.300
strategy that I'm going to use
for the rest of the problem--

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.720
is to remember that
expectation acts

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.780
like center of mass.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.490
So the center of mass, when
these two points are equally

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.010
likely, is just the midpoint,
which of course is 2.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.400
So we're going to use that
intuition on the other ones.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.730
So I'm skipping to x is
equal to 2 because 1

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.230
and 3 are not possible.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.000
So when x is equal to 2,
y can only take on the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.490
values of 1 or 2.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.240
Again, they're equally likely.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.390
So the center of mass is in the
middle which happens at

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.000
1.5 or 3/2.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.540
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.230
Similarly, x is equal to 4.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.736
We're living in this conditional
universe, where y

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:34.380
can take on of these
four points with

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.870
probability 1/4 each.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.920
And so again, we expect
the center of mass to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.850
be at 1.5 or 3/2.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.555
And this quantity is undefined
otherwise.

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:48.650
 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.540
OK, so we're almost done.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.240
Now we just need to find which
value of x maximizes this.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.460
Well, let's see, 2 is the
biggest quantity out of all of

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.630
these numbers.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.320
So the maximum is 2.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.090
And it occurs when
x is equal to 0.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.860
So we come over here.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.400
And we found our answer.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.780
x is equal to 0 is the value,
which maximizes the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.930
conditional expectation
of y given x.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.970
So part b is very similar
to part a.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.310
But there is slightly more
computation involved.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.170
Because now we're dealing with
the variance and not an

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.395
expectation.

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:28.220
And variance is usually a little
bit tougher to compute.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.250
So we're going to start
in the same manner.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.490
But I want you guys to see if
you can figure out intuitively

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.160
what the right value is.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
I'm going to do the entire
computation now.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.070
And then you can compare whether
your intuition matches

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.320
with the real results.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.560
So variance of x conditioned
on a particular value of y,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770
this is now a function of y.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.430
For each value of y you plug in
you're going to get out a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.500
scalar number.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.680
And that number represents the
conditional variance of x when

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.040
you condition on the value
of y that you plugged in.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.440
So let's see, when y is equal
to 0 we have a nice case.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.680
If y is equal to 0 we have no
freedom about what x is.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.820
This is the only point that
could have occurred.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.279
Therefore, x definitely
takes on a value of 4.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.920
And there's no uncertainty
left.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.220
So in other words, the
variance is 0.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.040
Now, if y is equal to 1, x can
take on a value of 0, a value

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.990
of 2 or a value of 4.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.220
And these all have the same
probability of occurring, of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.240
1/3,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.920
And again, the reasoning behind
that is that all eight

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.430
points were equally likely in
the unconditional universe.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.990
If you condition on y being
equal to 1 these outcomes

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.970
still have the same relative
frequency.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.190
Namely, they're still
equally likely.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.020
And since there are three
of them they now have a

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.730
probability of 1/3 each.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.430
So we're going to go ahead and
use a formula that hopefully,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.080
you guys remember.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.010
So in particular, variance is
the expectation of x squared

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.520
minus the expectation
of x all squared,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.920
the whole thing squared.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.380
So let's start by computing
this number first.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.770
So conditioned on y
is equal to 1--

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.095
so we're in this line--

00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:27.140
the expectation of x
is just 2, right?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.660
The same center-of-mass
to argument.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.650
So this, we have a minus
2 squared over here.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.450
Now, x squared is only slightly
more difficult.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.960
With probability 1/3,
x squared will take

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.650
on a value of 0.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.510
With probability 1/3,
x squared will take

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.990
on a value of 4.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.190
I'm just doing 2 squared.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.180
And with probability 1/3, x
squared takes on a value of 4

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.520
squared or 16.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.960
So writing down when I just
said, we have 0 times 1/3

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.610
which is 0.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.310
We have 2 squared, which
is 4 times 1/3.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.960
And then we have 4 squared,
which is 16 times 1/3.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.710
And then we have our minus
4 from before.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.260
So doing this math out, we get,
let's see, 20/3 minus

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.320
12/3, which is equal
to 8/3, or 8/3.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.790
So we'll come back up
here and put 8/3.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.270
So I realize I'm going through
this pretty quickly.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.280
Hopefully this step didn't
confuse you.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.850
Essentially, when I was doing
is, if you think of x squared

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.180
as a new random variable, x
squared, the possible values

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.240
that it can take on are 0,
4, and 16 when you're

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.380
conditioning on y
is equal to 1.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.490
And so I was simply saying
that that random variable

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.960
takes on those values with
equal probability.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.730
So let's move on to
the next one.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.370
So if we condition on y is equal
to 2 we're going to do a

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.030
very similar computation.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.180
Oops, I shouldn't have
erased that.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.790
OK, so we're going to use the
same formula that we just

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.330
used, which is the expectation
of x given y is equal to 2.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.090
Sorry, x squared minus the
expectation of x conditioned

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.040
on y is equal to
2, all squared.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.470
So conditioned on y
is equal to 2, the

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.350
expectation of x is 3.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.630
Same center of mass argument.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.150
So 3 squared is 9.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.370
And then x squared can
take on a value of 4.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.870
Or it can take on
a value of 16.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.280
And it does so with
equal probability.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:51.200
So we get 4/2, 4
plus 16 over 2.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.620
So this is 2 plus 8, which
is 10, minus 9.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.630
That'll give us 1.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.710
So we get a 1 when
y is equal to 2.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.120
And last computation and
then we're done.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.070
I'm still recycling
the same formula.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.000
But now we're conditioning
on y is equal to 3.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.610
And then we'll be done with
this problem, I promise.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.620
OK, so when y is equal to 3 x
can take on the value of 0.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.710
Or it can take on
the value of 4.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.110
Those two points happen with
probability 1/2, 1/2.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.790
So the expectation is right
in the middle which is 2.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.210
So we get a minus 4.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.460
And similarly, x squared can
take on the value of 0.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.830
When x takes on the value of
0-- and that happens with

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.530
probability 1/2--

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.735
similarly, x squared can take
on the value of 16 when x

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:42.929
takes on the value of 4.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.400
And that happens with
probability 1/2.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.540
So we just have 0/2
plus 16/2 minus 4.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.752
And this gives us 8 minus
4, which is simply 4.

00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:59.540
So finally, after all that
computation, we are done.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.010
We have the conditional
variance of x given y.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.070
Again, we're interested in when
this value is largest.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:11.495
And we see that 4 is the biggest
value in this column.

00:09:11.495 --> 00:09:15.840
And this value occurs when
y takes on a value of 3.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.420
So our answer, over here,
is y is equal to 3.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.200
All right, so now we're going to
switch gears in part c and

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.680
d a little bit.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.660
And we're going to
be more concerned

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.930
with PMFs, et cetera.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.840
So in part c, we're given a
random variable called r which

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.250
is defined as the minimum
of x and y.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.970
So for instance, this
is the 0.01.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.710
The minimum of 0 and 1 is 0.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.180
So r would have a
value of 0 here.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.250
Now, we can be a little bit
smarter about this.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.250
If we plot the line,
y is equal to x.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.855
So that looks something
like this.

00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:00.360
 

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.780
We see that all of the points
below this line satisfy y

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.920
being less or equal to x.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.640
And all the points above this
line have y greater than or

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.290
equal to x.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.332
So if y is less than or equal to
x, you hopefully agree that

00:10:18.332 --> 00:10:21.660
here the min, or r,
is equal to y.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.510
But over here, the min, r, is
actually equal to x, since x

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.440
is always smaller.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.890
So now we can go
ahead quickly.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.760
And I'm going to write the value
of r next each point

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.190
using this rule.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.960
So here, r is the value
of y, which is 1.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.270
Here, r is equal to 0.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.410
Here r is 1.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.200
Here r is 2.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.650
Here r is 3.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.600
Over here, r is the
value of x.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.980
So r is equal to 0.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.620
And r is equal to 0 here.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.000
And so the only point we didn't
handle is the one that

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.120
lies on the line.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.750
But in that case it's easy.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.250
Because x is equal to 2.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.100
And y is equal to 2.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.590
So the min is simply 2.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:05.040
So with this information
I claim we're now done.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.690
We can just write down
what the PMF of r is.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:15.225
So in particular, r takes
on a value of 0.

00:11:15.225 --> 00:11:17.820
 

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.200
When this point happens,
this point happens,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.820
or this point happens.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.990
And those collectively have a

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.170
probability of 3/8 of occurring.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.420
r can take on a value of 1
when either of these two

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.120
points happen.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.830
So that happens with
probability 2/8.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.960
 

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.540
r is equal to 2.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.030
This can happen in two ways.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.450
So we get 2/8.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.740
And r equal to 3 can happen
in only one way.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.170
So we get 1/8.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.710
Quick sanity check, 3 plus
2 is 5, plus 2 is

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.920
7, plus 1 is 8.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.230
So our PMF sums to 1.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.120
And to be complete, we
should sketch it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.220
Because the problem asks
us to sketch it.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:07.760
So we're plotting PR
of r, 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.575
So here we get, let's
see, 1, 2, 3.

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:14.490
For 0 we have 3/8.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.870
For 1 we have 2/8.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.880
For 2 we have 2/8.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.530
And for 3 we have 1/8.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:30.090
So this is our fully labeled
sketch of Pr of r.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.210
And forgive me for erasing so
quickly, but you guys can

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:38.280
pause the video, presumably,
if you need more time.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.160
Let's move on to part d.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.590
So in part d we're given an
event named a, which is the

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.890
event that x squared is greater
than or equal to y.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.240
And then we're asked to find the
expectation of xy in the

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.860
unconditional universe.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.240
And then the expectation of x
times y conditioned on a.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.320
So let's not worry about the
conditioning for now.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.090
Let's just focus on
the unconditional

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.040
expectation of x times y.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.630
So I'm just going to
erase all these r's

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.130
so I don't get confused.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.910
But we're going to follow a very
similar strategy, which

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.770
is at each point I'm going to
label what the value of w is.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.840
And we'll find the expectation
of w that way.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.130
So let's see, here,
we have 4 times 0.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.050
So w is equal to 0.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.440
Here we have 4 times 1.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.340
w is equal to 4.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.530
4 times 2, w is equal to 8.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.882
4 times 3, w is equal to 12.

00:13:37.882 --> 00:13:39.730
w is equal to 2.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.980
w is equal to 4.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.610
w is equal to 0.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.430
w is equal to 0.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.610
OK, so that was just algebra.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.050
And now, I claim again, we can
just write down what the

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.450
expectation of x times y is.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.550
And I'm sorry, I didn't
announce my notation.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.560
I should mention that now.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.640
I was defining w to be the
random variable x times y.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.910
And that's why I labeled
the product of x

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.760
times y as w over here.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.330
My apologies about not defining
that random variable.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:21.210
So the expectation of w, well,
w takes on a value of 0.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.680
When this happens, this happens
or that happens.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.920
And we know that those
three points occur

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.260
with probability 3/8.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.100
So we have 0 times 3/8.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.080
I'm just using the normal
formula for expectation.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.815
w takes on a value of 2
with probability 1/8.

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:43.590
Because this is the lead
point in which it

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.220
happens, 2 times 1/8.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.770
Plus it can take on the value
of 4 with probability

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.260
2/8, 4 times 2/8.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.150
And 8, with 1/8 probability.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.740
And similarly, 12 with
1/8 probability.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.150
So this is just algebra.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.674
The numerator sums up to 30.

00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.445
Yes, that's correct.

00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:13.920
So we have 30/8, which
is equal to 15/4.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.390
So this is our first
answer for part d.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.610
And now we have to do this
slightly trickier one, which

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.290
is the conditional expectation
of x times y, or w

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.110
conditioned on a.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.360
So similar to what I did in part
c, I'm going to draw the

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.510
line y equals x squared.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.870
So y equals x squared
is 0 here, 1 here.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.070
And at 2, it should take
on a value of 4.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.760
So the curve should look
something like this.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.470
This is the line y is
equal to x squared.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.410
So we know all the points below
this line satisfy y less

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.230
than or equal to x squared.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.130
And all the points above this
line have y greater than or

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.170
equal to x squared.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.870
And a is y less than or
equal to x squared.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.090
So we are in the conditional
universe where only points

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.390
below this line can happen.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.240
So that one, that one, that
one, that one, that

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.190
one and that one.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.790
So there are six of them.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.930
And again, in the unconditional
world, all of

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.190
the points were equally
likely.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.040
So in the conditional world
these six points are still

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.040
equally likely.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.630
So they each happen with
probability 1/6.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:33.310
So in this case, the expectation
of w is simply 2

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.050
times 1/6 plus 0 times 1/6.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.930
But that's 0.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.260
So I'm not going to write it.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:52.250
4 times 2/6 plus 4 times 2/6
plus 8 times 1/6, plus 12

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.820
times 1 over 6.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.650
And again, the numerator
summed to 30.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.780
But this time our denominator
is 6.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.210
So this is simply 5.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.230
So we have, actually, finished
the problem.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.940
Because we've computed this
value and this value.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.369
And so the important takeaways
of this problem are,

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.089
essentially, honestly, just to
get you comfortable with

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.410
computing things involving
joint PMFs.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.109
We talked a lot about finding
expectations quickly by

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.180
thinking about center
of mass and the

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.030
geometry of the problem.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.461
We've got practice computing
conditional variances.

00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:34.330
And we did some derived
distributions.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.170
And we'll do a lot more
of those later.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.420
