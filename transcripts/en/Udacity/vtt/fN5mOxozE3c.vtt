00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.410
So what makes games different
from other types of apps?

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.610
It's a hard question, because there
are so many different types of games.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.350
But here are a few of the things that
make writing games different from

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.170
writing other types of apps.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.360
The first thing is that games
are often built around an update loop

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.650
or a game loop.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.465
This is as opposed to an event-based
application where the application

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:22.778
basically sits around not doing
much of anything until the user

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:23.978
provides some input.

00:00:23.978 --> 00:00:25.295
Games on the other hand,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.250
are built around a timer that
fires 60 times a second.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.463
When that timer fires,
it means it's time for

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:34.092
the game to go look at the user input,
update the state of the game world, and

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:36.610
then draw a new frame to the screen.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.510
This means, games often need to
deal with pulling for user input.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.150
Next, games often involve
a ton of custom drawing.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.120
While you can make an Android
app using entirely off-the-shelf

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.550
user interface components, it's rare
that you can do so with the game.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.470
You'll have to create your UI and
your game world

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.450
using either primitive shapes like
lines, rectangles and circles, or your

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.220
own custom image aspects from pixel art
all the way up to complex characters.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.440
Many games also feature
your special effects and

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.170
animations which are a ton of fun to
make but also a lot of hard work.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.980
There are whole fields of study
that are much more relevant to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.510
games than other types of
apps like physics and AI.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.820
There's also exotic input
devices to deal with,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.850
like game pad controllers or,
more interestingly for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.270
this class, accelerometers like
the one you've got in your phone.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.700
Finally, my favorite
part of game development

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.580
is the fact that you get to
create a lot of objects that have

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.150
visible representations
in your game world.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.750
Designing an elegant object
oriented app is a lot more fun,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.280
when your objects can run around
hitting each other with swords.
