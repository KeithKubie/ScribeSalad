00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:11.521
Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s
physics lab has been amazing.

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:16.921
Until, that is, the professor accidentally
stepped through a time portal.

00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.841
You’ve got just a minute to jump through
the portal to save him before it closes

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:23.251
and leaves him stranded in history.

00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.821
Once you’re through it, 
the portal will close,

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:29.071
and your only way back will be 
to create a new one

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:32.341
using the chrono-nodules from your lab.

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.631
Activated nodules connect to each other

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.821
via red or blue tachyon entanglement.

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.971
Activate more nodules and they’ll connect

00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.911
to all other nodules in the area.

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:48.931
As soon as a red or blue triangle is
created with a nodule at each point,

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:53.801
it opens a doorway through time that
will take you back to the present.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:58.351
But the color of each individual
connection manifests at random,

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.281
and there’s no way to choose
or change its color.

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.731
And there’s one more problem:

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:08.141
each individual nodule creates a
temporal instability

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:12.061
that raises the chances the portal
might collapse as you go through it.

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.601
So the fewer you bring, the better.

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:17.291
The portal’s about to close.

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:20.201
What’s the minimum number of nodules 
you need to bring

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.906
to be certain you’ll create a red or 
blue triangle and get back to the present?

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:29.578
Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:29.578 --> 00:01:31.304
Answer in: 3

00:01:31.304 --> 00:01:33.127
Answer in: 2

00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:34.031
Answer in: 1

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:38.411
This question is so rich that an entire
branch of mathematics

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:41.771
known as Ramsey Theory developed from it.

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:45.361
Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.341
This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.721
if you approach it systematically.

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.011
Imagine you brought just three nodules.

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:57.821
Would that be enough? No - for example,
you might have two blue

00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:01.821
and one red connection,
and be stuck in the past forever.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.181
Would four nodules be enough?
No - there are many arrangements here

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.390
that don’t give a blue or red triangle.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.990
What about five?

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.680
It turns out there is an arrangement of
connections

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.630
that avoids creating 
a blue or red triangle.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.560
These smaller triangles don’t count because
they don’t have a nodule at each corner.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.420
However, six nodules will always create a
blue triangle or a red triangle.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.520
Here’s how we can prove that without
sorting through every possible case.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.310
Imagine activating the sixth nodule,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.460
and consider how it might connect
to the other five.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.000
It could do so in one of six ways:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.710
with five red connections, five blue
connections, or some mix of red and blue.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.520
Notice that every possibility has at least
three connections of the same color

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.810
coming from this nodule.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.320
Let’s look at just the nodules
on the other end

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.990
of those same three color connections.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.480
If the connections were blue,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.510
then any additional blue connection between
those three would give us a blue triangle.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.470
So the only way we could get in trouble

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.990
is if all the connections
between them were red.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.750
But those three red connections
would give us a red triangle.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.579
No matter what happens,
we’ll get a red or a blue triangle,

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.389
and open our doorway. 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.599
On the other hand,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.349
if the original three connections 
were all red instead of blue,

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.379
the same argument still works, 
with all the colors flipped.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.409
In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored,

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.119
six nodules will always create a red or 
blue triangle and a doorway leading home.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.399
So you grab six nodules and jump through
the portal.

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:45.059
You were hoping your internship would
give you valuable life experience.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.878
Turns out, that didn’t take much time.
