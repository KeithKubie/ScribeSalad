00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.670
And here we go. Hello Sean. Hey Joe. How's it going?

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.640
Thanks for being here again man. I really appreciate it. So, uh,

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.620
over the weekend I got into your book. Woo. Yes, yes,

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.390
it's great. Thank you. I mean,

5
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:20.890
I really appreciate someone like you who's trying to break down quantum

6
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.590
mechanics and quantum physics. For someone like me,

7
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.650
it's very hard to follow and there was a lot of backing up and trying it again

8
00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:32.350
and backing up and trying it again and like going over paragraphs and trying to

9
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.280
figure out exactly what it means. But, uh, it's,

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.990
it's really excellent and really perplexing at the same time. Well, thank you.

11
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:41.590
And you know,

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.370
there are different styles when it comes to writing poppy of the books.

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.750
I think there should be different styles. And my particular style is, look,

14
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:53.410
it's not going to be a breezy page Turner. Uh,

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.800
but if you read it carefully, like there's not prerequisites,

16
00:00:56.801 --> 00:01:00.190
you don't have to come into it as an expert would you have to come into it is

17
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.030
someone who's willing to sit and think about every paragraph and then hopefully

18
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:04.721
it will be rewarding.

19
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.150
And you'll truly understand what's going on after doing that.

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.010
While it is rewarding because it is fascinating and the history of quantum

21
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.160
physics is also pretty fascinating cause I've always wondered like,

22
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.270
how did anybody even want to come up with this stuff like this?

23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.000
And the fact that it was so long ago,

24
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.060
it was what the beginnings of it were in the 19th century. Well,

25
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.760
1900 is the typical, literally that year,

26
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:31.600
the turn of the century when Lux plonk first, uh, got the first 10th of it,

27
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:34.990
and then yeah, it took another 27 years to put into final shape.

28
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.530
Now for regular people that don't have a background of physics or that don't,

29
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.270
this is like the whole idea behind it is so bizarre.

30
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.270
It's like why would anybody try to figure out something that,

31
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.320
one of the things that you said that's really interesting is that you,

32
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.310
quantum physics is used all the time.

33
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.550
It's used with exact calculations,

34
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.590
but yet we don't really understand it. Yeah, yeah. No,

35
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.480
that's the main message of the book really.

36
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:14.620
Because physicists of course do quantum mechanics every day, whether it's,

37
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:17.260
you know, straightforward quantum mechanics, quantum field theory,

38
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.200
quantum information, quantum computing, clearly we're pretty good at it.

39
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.710
You know, like transistors and lasers depend on quantum mechanics.

40
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.070
The sun shining, figuring that out depends on quantum mechanics,

41
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:28.420
the Higgs bows on, et cetera.

42
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.410
So to claim that we don't understand quantum mechanics is a little bit weird,

43
00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:35.350
but then we have quotes from people like Richard FIMAN saying,

44
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:38.560
nobody understands quantum mechanics, right? And so if he says that,

45
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.090
then there's some authority behind it.

46
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.400
And the reason is what we have is sort of a black box, right?

47
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.720
We say, you know what?

48
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:50.740
I think what I said in a New York times article I wrote recently is physicists

49
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:52.030
understand quantum mechanics.

50
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:55.450
In the same way that someone who owns a smartphone understands the smartphone,

51
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.930
like they know how to use the apps. They can call people, they can make phone,

52
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.740
they can take pictures, they don't know what's going on inside.

53
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.550
And that's physicists with quantum mechanics. They, they use it.

54
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.800
They can make very, very precise predictions.

55
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.970
But if you ask them what is really going on, like what is actually happening,

56
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.310
what are all the details? They're like, yeah, no, that's not our job.

57
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.240
Let's just stick to prediction.

58
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.300
<v 2>But to someone like me, that's so terrifying because like the,</v>

59
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.530
the very nature of reality is being examined by people.

60
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.520
Like if, if it is us of smartphone,

61
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.620
it's being examined by people like me who don't really understand the

62
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.430
smartphone. I have no idea what, what's going on inside a smart phone.

63
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:36.880
I have no,

64
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.880
I know some words that have you used to describe Ram and process,

65
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.050
sorry. Electrons moving around in there, right?

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.340
<v 1>Yeah. And I think, and in some sense that's fine.</v>

67
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:52.720
Like most of us don't need to know what's going on inside the smart phone to use

68
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:55.240
it, but somebody should know. Right.

69
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.810
And my argument in the book is look, the,

70
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.730
if 500 years from now when historians write the history of 20th century physics,

71
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:07.540
they will say two things. Uh, one is my God,

72
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.430
these people were so brilliant and creative to invent quantum mechanics and then

73
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.140
they were so afraid to really take it seriously.

74
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:18.580
And try to understand it. Like they said,

75
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.270
like stop asking questions about the meaning of reality and what the world is

76
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:24.760
doing. In my mind,

77
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.360
what physics is all about is understanding reality and what the world is doing.

78
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.390
It's not just about making predictions, making predictions is good.

79
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.030
But we do that, you know,

80
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.460
mostly because we're curious about what the world is doing

81
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.460
<v 2>well for people outside the world of academia.</v>

82
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:44.461
When I read someone like you saying that you were discouraged from pursuing this

83
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.720
and you literally told that you should be pursuing your work and cosmology and

84
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.770
gravitation is that's where it's at. That's serious work. Yeah. That,

85
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:01.630
that seems to me's be so crazy. It's like if anybody should be pursuing it,

86
00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:03.520
it should be people like you.

87
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.570
<v 1>Yeah. I mean I want to be fair. So, of course,</v>

88
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:09.720
20th century physics was incredibly successful and, and there was,

89
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.880
part of the attitude was, look,

90
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:15.900
we have to understand nuclear physics and particle physics. And you know,

91
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:20.010
a lot of it was the center of physics shifted from Europe to the U S and Europe

92
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:24.300
is much more philosophical and you're willing to think about the deep ideas.

93
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.060
And Americans are pretty pragmatic and want to build things right.

94
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.480
In particular at the time they wanted to build nuclear weapons.

95
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.100
And so the idea of just really putting aside deep philosophical issues and

96
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.630
putting stuff to work was attractive. And the other issue is, you know, okay,

97
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.840
let's say we do demand that we understand quantum mechanics better.

98
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.760
How do you do it? Like what experiment is it there that you can do as,

99
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.630
as far as we know, the cookbook that we have,

100
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:51.390
even though we don't understand it works pretty well. Like what,

101
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.750
what could you type into your smartphone that would help you understand what's

102
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:56.820
going on inside? It's kind of hard to figure out.

103
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.780
So I think that those attitudes were wrong, but at least you know,

104
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.390
they're not completely crazy. It's not just that they, uh,

105
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.310
were afraid of the truth or anything like that.

106
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.030
And I also think that it is finally changing now. I think that there's slowly,

107
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.421
slowly,

108
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.870
slowly more people are appreciating the understanding quantum mechanics is

109
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.670
important. What do you attribute that to? Um, a couple of things. One is,

110
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.080
I mean there's good news and bad news that part of the good news is technology

111
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.490
has gotten better. So we're trying to build quantum computers for example.

112
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.930
And guess what, you know,

113
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:31.550
some of the ad hoc rules that we had for doing quantum mechanics might not be up

114
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.540
to the task. We need to understand the details a little bit better. Um,

115
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.570
the other Saturday thing is that so much a fundamental physics is kind of stuck

116
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.990
right now. Right?

117
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:46.280
We haven't [inaudible] we literally have not been surprised by a new

118
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:50.960
experimental result in fundamental physics since the 1970s.

119
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.270
Uh, the one, there's one exception to that,

120
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.680
which is the universe accelerating in 1998, which was the dark energy. Um,

121
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.710
we've had amazing accomplishments in experimental and observational physics.

122
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.090
We found the Higgs bows on. We found the top quark,

123
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:09.350
we found gravitational waves, the microwave background, many, many things,

124
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.900
but they were all predicted decades ago. Right.

125
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.730
So progress is driven by being surprised and it's been a long time since we've

126
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.980
been surprised. So some people, including myself say,

127
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.090
well one of the things to do in that situation is to take a step back and

128
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.530
reexamined the foundations.

129
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:28.550
Maybe maybe we can take a broader look and think that we were walking down the

130
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.384
wrong path.

131
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.850
<v 2>Now for people who don't have any background in physics there there's a a bit of</v>

132
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.040
an issue with the public perception.

133
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.230
And one of the things about public perception,

134
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.060
it's films like what the bleep yeah.

135
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.450
That sort of throw this sort of cultish monkey wrench into the,

136
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.593
you know,

137
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.840
w w quantum physics is weird enough as it is without adding let,

138
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:57.930
that movie was literally created by a channeler, right?

139
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.710
<v 1>A friend of mine, David Albert,</v>

140
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.420
who was one of the leading philosophers of physics,

141
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:04.060
and I should also give credit to philosophers here because they haven't taken

142
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:08.140
quantum mechanics seriously longer than the physicist have to be honest. Um,

143
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.560
so David is one of the many people who got a PhD in physics and then switched to

144
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:14.860
philosophy because he cared about the foundations of quantum mechanics and no

145
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.890
physics department would ever hire him. Right. And uh, yeah,

146
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:20.590
I tell the story through the back door. Yeah. I tell the story in the book,

147
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:24.370
like he wrote a bunch of influential papers as a graduate student and then he

148
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:29.140
went and said, uh, I would like to, you know, make these papers my PhD thesis.

149
00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.970
And they said, no, that's not really serious physics.

150
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:35.410
And they punished him by making him write this incredibly technical mathematical

151
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:39.400
paper on quantum field theory just to prove he could do it. And then he's like,

152
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:42.580
this, I don't want to take this anymore. I'm switching fields. But anyway,

153
00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:43.690
he was in that film.

154
00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:47.680
He was in what the bleep and they lied to him.

155
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.570
They misrepresented themselves. They said,

156
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:51.460
we're doing a documentary about quantum mechanics.

157
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:55.060
And they sat him down for three hours and asked him all these,

158
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.910
you're leading questions like,

159
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.420
doesn't this mean that we're bringing reality into existence by looking at it?

160
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.840
And, and he's like, no, that's not what it means. Let me explain to you.

161
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.550
But then in the final film, there's like 32nd clips of him going, yes,

162
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:10.620
that is a really important question, right?

163
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.080
Like completely misrepresenting what he said.

164
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.850
And so he went public after that and uh, and complained about and,

165
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.710
uh, about the film. And he did in a hilarious story, there was a,

166
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.630
uh, event,

167
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:29.631
some sort of convention put on in Santa Monica by supporters of the film that

168
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.880
they thought it'd be fun to get all of the people who were in the movie,

169
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.430
what the bleep do we know and get them at, you know,

170
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.590
and talk to them and then charge people money to listen to them.

171
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.500
But these people were not affiliated with the filmmakers,

172
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.190
so they didn't know that David Albert had been completely misrepresented in the

173
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:44.401
film.

174
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:49.320
So they invited him and he goes to this event in Santa Monica and he gave a

175
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:51.300
talk, you know, he, he decided, you know, he wondered like,

176
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:54.870
should I just go at all? But okay, why not? Let's reach a different audience.

177
00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:56.550
And he, he gave a talk and he said, look,

178
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.260
there's two things you can do when you are faced with fundamental puzzles of

179
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:02.094
reality.

180
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.570
One is you can face up to what the world is trying to tell you and you can

181
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.780
accept it and take it as what it is, no matter what you like.

182
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.760
The other is you can choose to tell a flattering story about yourself.

183
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.960
And the people who made this movie have decided that the mysteries of quantum

184
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:23.010
mechanics are really stories about how they are powerful and have influence over

185
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:25.350
reality and so forth. But it's all nonsense.

186
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.770
And the punchline is the audience loved it.

187
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.520
They went nuts because what they wanted was a guru of some sort.

188
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:36.030
And like he was just as good as anybody else. So you know,

189
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.880
he had a better story to do reality based Scality guru. Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.830
So I think you're right. I mean,

191
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:43.230
I think that quantum mechanics I've said before is a,

192
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.020
of all the theories in the history of science,

193
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.280
the most easily distorted and misrepresented in the popular mind.

194
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.491
<v 2>Well,</v>

195
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:54.750
you've done an amazing job in this book of trying to boil it down for dummies

196
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:57.180
like me. But it's hard. It is.

197
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.010
It is a complicated and insanely nuance subject. Yeah.

198
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.040
And it's one of those things where it's like this many worlds theory.

199
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.560
For one example, the, the, the,

200
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:14.520
just the possibility that there's like, explain that.

201
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.910
Explain for people that don't understand what quantum mechanics even means.

202
00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:23.940
Give them just like a little bit of that and then explain many worlds theory.

203
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.340
<v 1>Yeah, a good, this is what I'm here to do. So, you know,</v>

204
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.930
an electron take an electron,

205
00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.440
quantum mechanics should apply to the entire universe,

206
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:36.130
but it becomes unmistakable when you look at little tiny things, right?

207
00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:38.650
So we always are talking about electrons or atoms and so forth.

208
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.050
And electron has a position and, well, sorry, let me not even say that,

209
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:43.960
that even that was wrong.

210
00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:46.930
It's just so hard to correctly talk about quantum mechanics, right?

211
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.080
If you were Isaac Newton before there was quantum mechanics,

212
00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:53.110
there was classical mechanics and basically quantum mechanics.

213
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.950
Classical mechanics are the only two big frameworks that have ever existed in

214
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:57.671
physics. You know,

215
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:01.350
classical mechanics was so good that everyone thought that was just right and

216
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.800
it's all a matter of filling the details.

217
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.760
Until quantum mechanics came along and changed things in classical mechanics and

218
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:10.480
electron is a point. It has a position, a location in space,

219
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.320
and it has a velocity.

220
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.930
It's moving somewhere and from that you can predict what's going to happen.

221
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.900
Okay? Quantum mechanics says, no, no, no.

222
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.550
The electron has a wave function, so there's a wave. You know,

223
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:25.180
sometimes you hear this debate about are are things like electrons and photons,

224
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.850
particles or waves. The answer is that they are waves

225
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.760
and the wave function has this weird property that when you're not looking at

226
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:37.810
it, it's a wave. It's all spread out or it's localized somewhere,

227
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.990
but it obeys an equation. The Schrodinger equation, so far so good.

228
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:43.750
Just like regular physics, there's a thing, the wave function,

229
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:45.700
it obeys an equation. The Schrodinger equation,

230
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.230
you can predict what's going to happen next,

231
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.280
but the weird thing about quantum mechanics is that there's a whole separate set

232
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:56.020
of rules for what happens when you look at the thing, when you observe it.

233
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.830
When you measure it,

234
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.740
that's where things get squirreled with people describing it, right? Yes.

235
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.360
And that's where they want to go. Woo. On you. It's an opening to be woo. Right?

236
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:05.230
When you say like,

237
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.330
what do you mean observe something like does it have to be a conscious being?

238
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.970
Can it be a video camera? You know, that's just fear, right?

239
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.080
Is it the act of measuring the changes things? Well,

240
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.090
this is the puzzle. Okay?

241
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:22.870
This is what is called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.

242
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:27.670
That the rules we teach our students at Cal tech or anywhere else when we teach

243
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:31.000
them quantum mechanics in their sophomore year of college, uh,

244
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.650
the rules say when a system is observed,

245
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.110
when it is measured, it's state,

246
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.100
it's wave function changes dramatically suddenly and unpredictably. Now,

247
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:45.760
let me ask you this. How do we know this based on if,

248
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.240
if you're measuring it and it changes, how do we know?

249
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.070
Because we didn't measure it before.

250
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:55.930
Like what observations are we making that we understand the state of it before

251
00:13:55.931 --> 00:14:00.250
it's measured without measuring it? Good. There's a couple of ways. So, um, let,

252
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.930
let, let me make things even simpler.

253
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:05.710
Forget about where the electron is located and think about the electron is

254
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:09.160
spinning, right? Electron is spinning. Just like the earth spins.

255
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:11.230
It's really exactly like that. It's like a little spinning top,

256
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:13.750
except when you measure the spin,

257
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.690
you can sort of send the electron through a magnetic field and it'll get deflect

258
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:20.050
either up or down, depending on whether it's spinning, spin up or spin down.

259
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.650
You only ever get one of two answers. It's either going up or going down.

260
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.390
It's nowhere in between. This is an empirical measured fact. Okay? Um,

261
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.910
so that's a part of quantum mechanics.

262
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.560
That's the quantum fact that there's discreet set of possible answers to this

263
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:38.920
question. Is it's spinning clockwise or counterclockwise, yes or no.

264
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.610
It's just those two possibilities. Nowhere in between. So if you're,

265
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.430
if you have a magnetic field that is oriented vertically,

266
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.630
send your electron through it. It gets deflected up. You say, Oh, it's spin up.

267
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.810
So now measured it spin. Now I know what its state is.

268
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.950
If I send it through another magnetic field or oriented vertically,

269
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.730
it will always be deflected up every single time we know what it is we're going

270
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:04.730
to measure it. Measuring it in this case doesn't change it.

271
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.580
It's in exactly that state. We know it. Okay,

272
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.170
now let's send it through a magnetic field that is oriented horizontally,

273
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.480
so it's going to be deflected either right or left.

274
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.270
We know exactly what state it's in, it's spinning this way,

275
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.200
but when you send it through that magnetic field that's oriented horizontally,

276
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.160
it gets deflected, left or right, 50 50 unpredictably.

277
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.360
There's no way we can predict it and then once it is, so okay,

278
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.030
now it's been spinning up. You measured it, spinned, left.

279
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:35.990
Let's say send it through another magnet that is going vertically and now it's

280
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:40.460
50 50 again, it could be spin up or spin down. So somehow,

281
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:42.770
even though we knew exactly what state it was in,

282
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:46.550
we couldn't predict what would happen next. That is part of quantum mechanics.

283
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.440
So the act of sending it through these things where it makes it vertical or

284
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:55.160
horizontal in what is what is happening to it.

285
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.950
When it's going through these things. So in quantum mechanics,

286
00:15:57.951 --> 00:16:02.951
what we say is that it's not that we don't know whether the electron is spinning

287
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:07.730
clockwise or counterclockwise. Um, it can be in a super position of both.

288
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.410
That's just the spin version of the position that the electron can be spread out

289
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.570
in a, in a wave, right? It's,

290
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.070
it's truly not just that we are lacking some knowledge is that the knowledge

291
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:20.300
really isn't there. And again,

292
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:23.090
this is how we teach quantum mechanics in textbooks.

293
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:25.790
And then I'm going to correct it cause many worlds is much better.

294
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.600
But this is the standard textbook version. There's a wave function.

295
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.960
The wave function for a spin is it's either up or down or some combination.

296
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.380
And then there's a rule that says when you measure the spin,

297
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:38.990
you only get up or down. You don't see the wave function,

298
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.410
just like the cloud that you have for the electrons position.

299
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.380
When you look at it, you see it at a location.

300
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.420
So another way to get to make the same argument is take a little piece of,

301
00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:54.710
I have a nice little image of this when I give talks, a little piece of uranium.

302
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.100
So it's a radioactive, a little chunk of metal,

303
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.070
and you put it in a bubble chamber.

304
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.240
So it is emitting radioactive particles and you detect the particles.

305
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:09.350
You can see a little streak of a of motion when the particle leaves the uranium.

306
00:17:09.351 --> 00:17:12.770
Okay, well, like I said, when you're not looking at it,

307
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.430
this electron is supposed to obey in equation the Schrodinger equation.

308
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.470
And you can ask what the prediction is.

309
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:23.390
When when a radioactive nucleus decays and gives off an electron,

310
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.430
what is its wave function going to do?

311
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.590
What is the wave functioning electron going to be?

312
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:30.650
And the answer is it goes off in a spherical wave.

313
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:35.360
It goes off in all directions at once evenly. Yeah, all directions evenly.

314
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.100
But you never see that. Is that [inaudible] the shape of the piece of uranium?

315
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.150
Does it vary? No,

316
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:46.130
because the electron gets from one individual nucleus of an atom. Right?

317
00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.650
So the the what the, the uranium is doing doesn't matter.

318
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.100
It's just that one Adam matters.

319
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.730
And the easiest thing for the electron to do is just to go out in a sphere.

320
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:57.210
It doesn't have to, he can go out and higher energy States. But the point is,

321
00:17:57.211 --> 00:18:00.090
it's not going out in a straight line, but when you look at it,

322
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:01.650
you see a straight line, right?

323
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.110
That's the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics.

324
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:07.290
That how we described the thing when we're not looking at it is different than

325
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:08.400
what we see when we look at it.

326
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.460
<v 2>So when you're in pursuit of an understanding,</v>

327
00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:18.080
a deeper understanding of, of quantum mechanics, what you,

328
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.891
when you,

329
00:18:18.891 --> 00:18:22.070
you're thinking about people from the 19 hundreds that are just sort of

330
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.930
basically getting the first steps going to understand this stuff.

331
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:28.171
When,

332
00:18:28.171 --> 00:18:32.630
when you're talking about this lack of funding and the lack of encouragement for

333
00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:34.370
people to pursue quantum mechanics,

334
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:39.320
you strongly feel like there are answers to these questions. Yeah,

335
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.980
that's right. That we just need better tools and a better understanding,

336
00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:44.960
better equations. More time.

337
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.360
<v 1>Yeah, me and Einstein think that's right.</v>

338
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:50.450
So Einstein is one of the secret heroes of the book because he has this

339
00:18:50.451 --> 00:18:55.160
reputation as someone who just couldn't quite accept quantum mechanics. Uh,

340
00:18:55.161 --> 00:18:58.340
the title is something deeply hidden as a quote from Einstein. Uh,

341
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.430
when he was talking about when he was a kid and he had a compass, right?

342
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:04.490
And he was given his first magnetic compass and he could rotate it this way and

343
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:08.270
that way. And it always pointed North and you and I would go, huh, that's cool.

344
00:19:08.271 --> 00:19:10.970
But he was Einstein. He's like, wow, this is amazing. Why?

345
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:13.670
How does it know where North is? Right? And he said,

346
00:19:13.671 --> 00:19:16.940
there must be something deeply hidden that explains why it's doing this

347
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.410
mysterious thing. And he felt the same way about quantum mechanics that we have.

348
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:22.610
We gave these set of rules,

349
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.000
orchard called the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

350
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.070
One set of rules for when you're looking at it,

351
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.430
one set of rules for when you're not. And Einstein was like, Oh, come on.

352
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:35.420
Clearly this is not the final answer to the nature of reality, right?

353
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.340
He wanted you to know God's thoughts. He's like,

354
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.880
I want to know everything we're not done yet. There must be more going on.

355
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.390
And so many worlds is one of the proposed answers to what could be going on.

356
00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:50.000
It's not the only one. There's alternatives, but it's definitely my favorite.

357
00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:53.210
It's definitely the easiest one to uh, to write down. Let's put it that way.

358
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.700
Okay, so hit us with this many worlds theory. Okay.

359
00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:57.920
So think about this electron. You're gonna you,

360
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.890
you say that it could be either spin up or spin down.

361
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.610
It's a combination of both. That's its wave function. You measure it.

362
00:20:04.611 --> 00:20:06.320
You only ever see spin up or spin down.

363
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.190
So Copenhagen says that's because the wave function suddenly changed,

364
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.440
snapped into place when you observed it.

365
00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:16.190
Don't ask me what it means to observe something that's not what Copenhagen lets

366
00:20:16.191 --> 00:20:18.020
you ask many worlds.

367
00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:22.310
Says what you're missing is two things. Number one,

368
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.170
your a quantum system. You are obeying the rules of quantum mechanics.

369
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.890
You're made of atoms and electrons and so forth. You have a wave function to,

370
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.843
okay,

371
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.990
so you're secretly treating yourself as a classical thing when you make that

372
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:39.170
measurement. But you really should be treating yourself quantum mechanically.

373
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.650
Right? That's one thing. And the other thing is, uh,

374
00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:45.260
something that Einstein invented, namely called entanglement.

375
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.540
When quantum says there's a wave function for a system,

376
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.740
it doesn't say there's a separate wave function for every particle, right?

377
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.190
It says that there's only one wave function for the whole universe.

378
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:02.170
So the way I like to say it is imagine two particles come in and bounce off of

379
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:06.610
each other. Either one has a wave function and it's, you know, unpredictable.

380
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:10.270
Exactly what angle it's going to go off at. So both of them,

381
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.600
both of the particles that go off, you don't know where they're going,

382
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.100
but because momentum is conserved, if they came in at equal velocities,

383
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:22.210
they'll go out at equal velocities in opposite directions. If you measure one,

384
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:25.300
then you know where the other one is going, right? That's entanglement.

385
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.360
The observed state of one system can be related to the observed state of another

386
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:32.980
system. So those are the two ingredients.

387
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:36.430
Your quantum system and quantum systems can be entangled with each other.

388
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.450
So whoever it,

389
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:41.320
who was a graduate student when he invented this idea in the 1950s said, look,

390
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.970
when you measure that electron, what happens physically? Look,

391
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.150
forget about you're a person, you're conscious, all of that BS.

392
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.880
Like you're a physical system. You obey the Schrodinger equation. You,

393
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:54.700
you are quantum mechanical system. You obey the laws of physics.

394
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.770
So you look at the electron, your wave function changes.

395
00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.860
It used to be you're just a person doing whatever you do.

396
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:04.570
But then after you look at the electron,

397
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:07.630
you become entangled with it and it splits.

398
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.160
So there is one part of the wave function that says the electron was spinning

399
00:22:12.161 --> 00:22:13.570
clockwise and you measured,

400
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.050
it's spinning clockwise and there's another part of the wave function that says

401
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:19.870
the electron was spinning counterclockwise and you saw it spinning

402
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.920
counter-clockwise. Now everybody knows this like that that far.

403
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.360
It's not controversial at all.

404
00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:28.480
That's clearly the prediction of the equations of quantum mechanics.

405
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.940
But everyone else said, well, that means that I'm some weird combination of,

406
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:36.250
I saw it spinning one way and I saw it spinning the other way,

407
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:38.620
but I've never felt that way. When I look at real electrons,

408
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:41.860
I see them one way or the other. That can't be right.

409
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.970
That can't be the final answer.

410
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:46.270
The way function must somehow collapse and Everett said no.

411
00:22:46.271 --> 00:22:49.000
What you're missing is there's now two separate worlds.

412
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.530
Both of those part of the wave function are real, but they're different worlds.

413
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:55.390
They will never interact with each other again.

414
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:58.810
What happens in one part of the wave function will not affect what happens in

415
00:22:58.811 --> 00:22:59.471
the other part.

416
00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:03.730
So now there's a version of you that's all the electrons spinning clockwise and

417
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:07.060
there's another version of you that saw spinning counterclockwise and that's

418
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:10.060
just taking seriously the prediction of quantum mechanics.

419
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:13.870
It's not adding any extra stuff, any extra worlds, anything like that.

420
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.040
<v 2>That is the part where my brain broke the,</v>

421
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:21.450
the idea that there's a you that observes it going clockwise and the you that

422
00:23:21.451 --> 00:23:26.451
observes it going in a different direction like that is so hard to understand.

423
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.980
Do you, do you apply this in your regular life? Like, do you think,

424
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.890
like when you go home and you say hi to your wife and you open up the

425
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.610
frigerator,

426
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.260
do you think of yourself as this quantum being that's existing in this

427
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.150
superstate?

428
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.480
<v 1>So, I mean, there's a couple of answers to that. One is, you know, sure.</v>

429
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.700
If I think about it, like I really do believe it. You know,

430
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:51.140
I have a chapter in the book, which my editor resisted at first,

431
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:52.310
but then he let me get away with it,

432
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:56.150
which is a dialogue between a young philosopher.
