I became involved with conservation work

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
I became involved with conservation work
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.200
I became involved with conservation work
and through that dr. Wilson's

biodiversity foundation which are I am

on the board of because it was clear to
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.050
on the board of because it was clear to
me that that mankind human activity was

me that that mankind human activity was
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.330
me that that mankind human activity was
degrading our earth's resources at an

degrading our earth's resources at an
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240
degrading our earth's resources at an
alarmingly rapid rate and that we were

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
alarmingly rapid rate and that we were
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.400
alarmingly rapid rate and that we were
losing species right and left important

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
losing species right and left important
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.760
losing species right and left important
species perhaps in some cases we knew in

species perhaps in some cases we knew in
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.510

other cases we hadn't yet full knowledge

was lost it's my understanding that that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
was lost it's my understanding that that
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.070

much of much of our medicine much of our

reserves of biodiversity which are

reserves of biodiversity which are
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.020
reserves of biodiversity which are
rapidly disappearing and unless we have

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
rapidly disappearing and unless we have
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.790
rapidly disappearing and unless we have
fully protected

bio systems we will not will lose the

bio systems we will not will lose the
 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.580
bio systems we will not will lose the
potential to learn how nature works and

that information may be critical in our

that information may be critical in our

understanding of how to manipulate what

understanding of how to manipulate what
is in our power to manipulate to to save

is in our power to manipulate to to save
 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.100
is in our power to manipulate to to save
biodiversity save the power of our

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110
biodiversity save the power of our
 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.250
biodiversity save the power of our
planet to sustain life
