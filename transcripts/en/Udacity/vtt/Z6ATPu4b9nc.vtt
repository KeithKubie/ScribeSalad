00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.440
Reinforcement learning is different
enough from the other ideas in machine

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.150
learning that Georgia Tech
actually has a separate class on

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.890
it as well as covering it in
the original machine learning class.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.640
So those are the two classes we're
mostly going to draw from in this unit.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.755
We're going to draw from
the reinforcement learning section

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:18.065
of the original machine learning
class and then from the stand alone

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:21.125
reinforcement learning class that's
also offered at Georgia Tech.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.525
Try and keep those straight.

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:24.752
So the main things we'll cover in
this are the different methods for

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:25.855
doing reinforcement learning.

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.834
We'll cover mark of decision processes,
which are one of the major

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.590
knowledge representations for
understanding reinforcement learning.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.160
We'll cover how reinforcement
learning includes some elements of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.880
game theory and
multi agent interactions.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.180
And we'll cover other methods for
actually doing reinforcement learning.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.310
Along the way, we really want
you to focus on three things.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.890
Again, we want you to focus on
how reinforcement learning fills

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.305
in the model building phase
of the original workflow.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:51.880
We want you to focus on how you
evaluate different models produced

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.050
by reinforcement learning for
the relative strengths or disadvantages.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.700
We also what you to focus on
how reinforcement learning

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.490
differs in the kinds
of models it produces

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.940
compared to the other form of machine
learning that we've talked about so far.
