Matthias: O.K. The annual meeting of the World
Economic Forum just closed here in Davos Switzerland.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm with you know [inaudible].
She brought you all those presidents and prime

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.559
ministers in front of this webcam.
And Pablo Camacho the citizen reporter from

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.143
YouTube.
We're at the World Economic Forum and I am

00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:23.300
extremely grateful to all your contributions.
260 videos from the YouTube community and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.980
to the 125 Davos participants who replied
to you videos and who joined the Davos debates.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.829
It's amazing.
I think overall today I think 2.7 million

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.739
people have already watched these videos and
so it's a great success.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.671
Now I can tell you that [Inaudible] has pledged
to bring these Davos debates to the G20 summit

00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:50.260
in London which is absolutely great.
So I hope we can continue these discussions,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.330
these debates here on YouTube.
So I want to thank you all.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.370
I want thank also the people from MySpace
and [Inaudible] who was the MySpace reporter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.800
here, and all the people on Facebook who participated
in the polls here for our annual mission.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.550
So the debates are not over, the devates -- discussion
continues, even throughout the year at our

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.690
regional summits.
See you then.
