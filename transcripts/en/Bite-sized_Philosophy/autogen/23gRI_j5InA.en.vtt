00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.820
 If the Blue Fairy appears, it symbolizes nature. So, what I'm trying to say, is that the medical will give the kids (a space of time, or help) 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.440
 If you feel that nature is the back of the mother for example 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.760
 But even living for other people, sometimes 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.140
 Because we are used to accepting the actions of children that we do not usually accept from others 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.440
 Enough, nature pardons. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 Here she appears in her angelic appearance, she says 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.880
 what is happening? And Pinocchio (cartoon character) 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.360
 Also, because he is naïve and abnormal 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.060
 He is not evil either. It is not both together or it may be. It all depends on how you think things are. 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.900
 And 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.460
 Or has no idea of ​​his intelligence, intelligence, or intelligence level 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.880
 Rather than acknowledging his action 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.420
 He is lying 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.500
 This is interesting because this suggests 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.520
 He knows to a certain degree that he will sign himself in the future. 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.060
 Because as you know, he could have told the truth 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.900
 This evil fox 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.200
 "He kidnapped me and sold me to one of the slaves" 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.460
 And this is ... the truth, is more true than the story he said 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.200
 He tells a story about a monster 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.400
 Fantastic monster 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 He could have said three-quarters of the truth, but he did not. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 But the reality of the story is complete and this is the part that people remember from the story 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.480
 I have been editing this section for years when I talk about this film 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 I forgot why this is so important. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.420
 Khashmah grow up, right? 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.320
 Grow up until you reach an absurd height 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.240
 And why get this ?? 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.700
 I think Mark Twain 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.300
 Identified by Samuel Clemens, I think it is he who said: 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.000
 "One of the advantages of telling the truth is that you do not have to remember what you said" 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.400
 And - God, this is exciting and worthy of listening to it 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.460
 Well, there are a lot of lichens that I learned and I'm in the clinic 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640
 One of them is that, where in many cases you are sometimes awkward with people, if you are a doctor at the clinic 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.680
 Because some of the licia occurs. Often occurring does not occur normally. 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.320
 And you do not know how to behave in these situations. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.740
 Then, what I learned is to say what is happening now 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.420
 No matter what it is, I'm just trying to explain it 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.660
 In the same way, and not more concerned about its consequences 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.060
 As you know, I'm not looking for problems but 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.420
 If you are in ... this may save you and save your life sometimes 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.020
 Especially if you are working with a frightened person and is very paranoid 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.080
 Do not lie to a frightened and violent person 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.940
 Because when you lie, you make yourself an ally of the forces that are trying to destroy it immediately 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.320
 This panic makes the patient more alert as if under the influence of drug (amphetamines - a kind of prohibited drugs) 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 In fact it can make people terrified when you give them (amphetamines) 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.040
 And can be made more panic by giving them a stronger dose of the drug (amphetamine) 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.600
 Well, they are more alert, 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.720
 Because they feel everything about them is against them 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.620
 And they watch you in a way that they believe in much more than they do 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.340
 And when you mess with a lie when you talk to them, you're done for them 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 If one thing is mocked it is when you are in a very bad situation and you do not know what to do 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.460
 You have to tell the truth always, but with very little. Do not say much because this is another lie. 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.100
 Just say the least cautiously possible truth and hopefully he can get out of the situation. 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.920
 Maybe you get out of the situation .. Maybe you get out of it 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.480
 But when you visit the facts 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.780
 be careful 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.420
 The truth is a defense mechanism to get out of the predicament and dangerous situations 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.940
 If someone is trying to scare you and you think he can turn into a violent person. 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.080
 And they ask you are you afraid. Then tell them that you are very terrified and wish that things will end well 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.220
 Or say 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.540
 I will give you an example 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.160
 One time I was at the airport 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.060
 We were in the queue of the plane leaving for Canada and this is the international flight queue 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.620
 The queue was very long, almost 50 people 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.160
 There were 3 people in front of me, and about 40 rear 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 The person in charge decided to close the track and told us to go all the way to the other line, which had about 300 people 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.100
 I suggested that he do not. Because we had been in the queue for about an hour 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.380
 And he can finish our column with the remaining 20 people 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.300
 And take the idea, 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.280
 But he called the police immediately 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.420
 This was in Florida and after 9/11 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.580
 The police came heavily armed 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.040
 And he told them that he was making trouble 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.500
 But I did not do anything but I did not .. 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.900
 I did not make ... 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.160
 How can I say it? 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.880
 I did not do anything except that I did not make the ignorant bureaucratic bugger take advantage of me and this is not like making problems 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.500
 Well anyway, once the police arrived I told them to look 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.680
 I will do what they ask me immediately 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.480
 I am not a source of problems 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.060
 But I want you to hear what exactly happened to me 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.880
 This is a good example of what you should do in such situations 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.740
 If there are those who have been able to 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.340
 Do not boast, this is a very bad idea 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.780
 And I am ready to do whatever they ask of me, for as you know 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.360
 They did not know who I was. I also do not know what they were told about me 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.420
 In any case 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.000
 The problem with lying is that it is like multiple visions 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.180
 And children know this since childhood. 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.200
 Because when you say lies, you have consequences that you might get away with 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.480
 Maybe it has 3 or 4 consequences you did not realize and did not expect 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.100
 It is relatively large in complexity 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.760
 And then you have to link his lie to another smaller 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.960
 And you have to track them and they also grow 3 other complications and quickly 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.280
 This little lie grows into a big ball of lies, and it becomes perfectly clear to all 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.280
 And then .. you see that when politicians lie. Such as a politician who was sending sexual messages 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.640
 Student: Anthony Weiner (Political Name) 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.800
 Anthony Weiner True! A perfect name for that person. That's funny... 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.660
 I do not have to say this comment because it is obvious and clear, yet it is funny. 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.700
 But as you know exactly what happened to him 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.880
 Not the event itself 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.840
 But people are stupid and they make mistakes 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.900
 In fact, they forgive forgery, if you say 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:30.700
 "Well I'm a fool how I did it but I did it, because I repeat it in the future" 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.020
 But what happens with politicians 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.360
 I do not talk about politicians in particular, but when they do, it immediately appears 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.940
 They lie 3 other lies to cover the matter 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.320
 This happened with President Nixon, for example 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.960
 And then it turned into a scandal 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.040
 And maybe they got out of the mess right from the start if they told the truth 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.980
 They admitted, "Yes, I'm an idiot and I will not repeat it again" 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.160
 Well, that's not what happened with Pinocchio 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:09.140
 He repeated his lies so much that the Blue Fairy came and was gracious with him, because he was attractive and a puppet 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.580
 She forgave him this time only and said to him: Do not repeat this again 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.620
 And it will not be there to help him in the future.
