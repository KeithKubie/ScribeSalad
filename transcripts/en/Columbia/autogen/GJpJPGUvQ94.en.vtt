prevention purposes I'll say a little
 

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:55.529
prevention purposes I'll say a little
bit more about that one trial in

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539
bit more about that one trial in
 

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.510
bit more about that one trial in
particular a clinical trial that's known

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520
particular a clinical trial that's known
 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.170
particular a clinical trial that's known
as HPT and 052 which is the HIV

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
as HPT and 052 which is the HIV

prevention trials Network 052 sealed the
 

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:07.350
prevention trials Network 052 sealed the
deal on this whole approach and I think

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360
deal on this whole approach and I think
 

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.570
deal on this whole approach and I think
really made it possible for people to be

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:09.580
really made it possible for people to be
 

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.490
really made it possible for people to be
so optimistic about treatment as

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:11.500
so optimistic about treatment as
 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.170
so optimistic about treatment as
prevention so I'll say a little bit

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.180
prevention so I'll say a little bit
 

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.899
prevention so I'll say a little bit
about that study and it sort of became

heretical for anybody to cast any doubt
 

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.730

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.000
and the hypothesis is it's because women
had very low rates of adherence that is

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.010
had very low rates of adherence that is
 

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.500
had very low rates of adherence that is
they didn't take the drugs as they were

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:24.510
they didn't take the drugs as they were
 

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.200
they didn't take the drugs as they were
supposed to that's a whole other story

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.210
supposed to that's a whole other story
 

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.190
supposed to that's a whole other story
so we have these randomized clinical

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200
so we have these randomized clinical
 

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.040

community viral load so that's looking
 

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.140
community viral load so that's looking
at the amount of virus in a community

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.150
at the amount of virus in a community
 

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.329

what happens when you put that kind of

real world that's when we're really
 

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:56.689
real world that's when we're really
interested in what we're really

00:13:56.689 --> 00:13:56.699
interested in what we're really
 

00:13:56.699 --> 00:14:00.079
interested in what we're really
interested in is what happens do we see

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:00.089
interested in is what happens do we see
 

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:01.629
interested in is what happens do we see
the same level of effect we have

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639
the same level of effect we have
 

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:03.410
the same level of effect we have
effectiveness so there's a difference

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420
effectiveness so there's a difference
 

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.050
effectiveness so there's a difference
between efficacy and effectiveness

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:05.060
between efficacy and effectiveness
 

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.370
between efficacy and effectiveness
effectiveness is really about the impact

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380
effectiveness is really about the impact
 

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.740
effectiveness is really about the impact
of these interventions or technologies

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:09.750
of these interventions or technologies
 

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.810
of these interventions or technologies

effectiveness also relates to

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.010
effectiveness also relates to
 

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.379
effectiveness also relates to
generalizability so if you do a study or

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:21.389
generalizability so if you do a study or
 

00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:23.780
generalizability so if you do a study or
you assess the efficacy of an

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:23.790
you assess the efficacy of an
 

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.699
you assess the efficacy of an
intervention or a product in this case

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:25.709
intervention or a product in this case
 

00:14:25.709 --> 00:14:28.370
intervention or a product in this case
antiretrovirals in one community or one

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380
antiretrovirals in one community or one
 

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.889
antiretrovirals in one community or one
subpopulation might you expect the same

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899
subpopulation might you expect the same
 

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:33.230
subpopulation might you expect the same
effect in another community population

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240
effect in another community population
 

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.970
effect in another community population
so that we'd argue we should scale it up

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980
so that we'd argue we should scale it up
 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.009
so that we'd argue we should scale it up
all over the place so that difference

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019
all over the place so that difference
 

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.500
all over the place so that difference
between efficacy and effectiveness is

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:39.510
between efficacy and effectiveness is
 

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.120
between efficacy and effectiveness is
one that social scientists raise all the

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.130
one that social scientists raise all the
 

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.410
one that social scientists raise all the
time and say that you know what really

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420
time and say that you know what really
 

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.449
time and say that you know what really
matters in life is effectiveness and

00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459
matters in life is effectiveness and
 

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:47.150
matters in life is effectiveness and
these clinical trials don't exactly show

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160
these clinical trials don't exactly show
 

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.569
these clinical trials don't exactly show
that generalizability is the other so

00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579
that generalizability is the other so
 

00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.819
that generalizability is the other so
speaking of that one way to think about

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:52.829
speaking of that one way to think about
 

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:55.460
speaking of that one way to think about
it and when we start to say can we

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:55.470
it and when we start to say can we
 

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.110
it and when we start to say can we
translate the efficacy data into

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120
translate the efficacy data into
 

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.189
translate the efficacy data into
effectiveness is to say well HPT and it

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199
effectiveness is to say well HPT and it
 

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:02.600

as I mentioned a number of African

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440
as I mentioned a number of African
 

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.889
as I mentioned a number of African
countries also Thailand and the US and

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899
countries also Thailand and the US and
 

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:16.069
countries also Thailand and the US and
Brazil I believe most of the countries

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079
Brazil I believe most of the countries
 

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.960
Brazil I believe most of the countries
have what are called generalized

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:17.970
have what are called generalized
 

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.720
have what are called generalized
epidemics where there's HIV about among

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:20.730
epidemics where there's HIV about among
 

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.910

two percent of the total population of

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920
two percent of the total population of
 

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.009
two percent of the total population of
the country or more there are a lot of

00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019
the country or more there are a lot of
 

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:26.780
the country or more there are a lot of
places in the world the u.s. included

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:26.790
places in the world the u.s. included
 

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.510
places in the world the u.s. included
that have concentrated epidemic

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:28.520
that have concentrated epidemic
 

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.910
that have concentrated epidemic
so we have HIV infection rates across

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920
so we have HIV infection rates across
 

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.830
so we have HIV infection rates across
the whole population of much less than

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:32.840
the whole population of much less than
 

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.190
the whole population of much less than
1% but in certain population groups like

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.200
1% but in certain population groups like
 

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.200
1% but in certain population groups like
gay men we have a much higher percentage

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.210
gay men we have a much higher percentage
 

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.690
gay men we have a much higher percentage
certainly well beyond two percent so

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:40.700
certainly well beyond two percent so
 

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.790
certainly well beyond two percent so
that's true in a number of other places

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800
that's true in a number of other places
 

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.220
that's true in a number of other places
so david holt grave and his colleagues

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.230
so david holt grave and his colleagues
 

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.040
so david holt grave and his colleagues
looked at the question of for whom would

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.050
looked at the question of for whom would
 

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.960
looked at the question of for whom would
test be appropriate in the united states

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:49.970
test be appropriate in the united states
 

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.190
test be appropriate in the united states
and this would be true for other

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.200

have these aspects biomedical behavioral
and social and structural we can

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:37.220
and social and structural we can
 

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.740
and social and structural we can
identify what the drivers or

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:38.750
identify what the drivers or
 

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.870
identify what the drivers or
determinants are at each of those and

to recognize that the distinction

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:02.690
to recognize that the distinction
 

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.510
to recognize that the distinction
between the biomedical and the social

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520

behavioral is not particularly useful
 

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.500
behavioral is not particularly useful
but it's so resilient people keep

we get funding so it's very hard to
break out of it there are a lot of

think you just give people pills and

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.080
think you just give people pills and
 

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.690
think you just give people pills and
that's you know that's really going to

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:31.700
that's you know that's really going to
 

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.780
that's you know that's really going to
do the trick so it's but pills have to

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:34.790
do the trick so it's but pills have to
 

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.610
do the trick so it's but pills have to
be taken by people people live in social

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:36.620
be taken by people people live in social

contexts that make that a desirable or
 

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.390
contexts that make that a desirable or
undesirable thing to do and so on so

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400
undesirable thing to do and so on so
 

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.430

that distinction is not particularly

that distinction is not particularly
 

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.400
that distinction is not particularly
meaningful even though it's resilient we

obviously need a lot of social science

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:47.270

the effectiveness of that but it can
also mean you have some science over

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660
also mean you have some science over
 

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:37.940
also mean you have some science over
here but you also have program and you

by the science but are not waiting for
scientific results necessarily so we

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060
scientific results necessarily so we
 

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.060
scientific results necessarily so we
need a much more comprehensive approach

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.070
need a much more comprehensive approach
 

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.590
need a much more comprehensive approach
which some people have referred to as

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:48.600
which some people have referred to as
 

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.650
which some people have referred to as
social Public Health and of course

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660
social Public Health and of course

social and structural change is

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:53.310
social and structural change is

change you're not going to have one
 

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.850
change you're not going to have one
without the other so we need systems to

00:43:58.850 --> 00:43:58.860
without the other so we need systems to
 

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.680
without the other so we need systems to
deliver technologies effectively and

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:00.690
deliver technologies effectively and
 

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.650
deliver technologies effectively and
equitably we need demand by persons to

use the technologies you may build it
but they may not come if they're not

but they may not come if they're not
 

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.530
but they may not come if they're not
interested in and we need supportive

interested in and we need supportive
 

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.820

elimination and decriminalization and we
as you probably know there's a lot of

as you probably know there's a lot of
 

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.020
as you probably know there's a lot of

is not really the missing link between
 

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:46.460
is not really the missing link between

efficacy and effectiveness or biomedical
and social structural it's an important

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:48.570
and social structural it's an important
 

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.690
and social structural it's an important
part but it's not a substitute for the

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700
part but it's not a substitute for the
 

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.600
part but it's not a substitute for the
kind of social research we really need

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:53.610
kind of social research we really need
 

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.310
kind of social research we really need

had a number of observations over time
 

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.530
had a number of observations over time
that in countries with low with high

rates of male circumcision that were

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:07.490
rates of male circumcision that were
 

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.890
rates of male circumcision that were
done typically for cultural reasons

religious or tribal or whatever there
 

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.870
religious or tribal or whatever there
were lower rates of HIV infection than

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880
were lower rates of HIV infection than
 

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.240
were lower rates of HIV infection than
in other parts of the world so at an

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:16.250
in other parts of the world so at an
 

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.950
in other parts of the world so at an
observational level there were people

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960
observational level there were people
 

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.140
observational level there were people
pretty early on in the epidemics Angie

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:20.150

it looks like circumcision is protective

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:22.370
it looks like circumcision is protective
 

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:25.300
it looks like circumcision is protective
for HIV acquisition at least acquiring

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:25.310
for HIV acquisition at least acquiring
 

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.910
for HIV acquisition at least acquiring
infection but that wasn't good enough

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920
infection but that wasn't good enough
 

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.760
infection but that wasn't good enough
and so over time you know there was all

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:30.770
and so over time you know there was all
 

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:32.680

reduces trans acquisition or

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:38.660
reduces trans acquisition or
 

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.990
reduces trans acquisition or
transmission risk and so that occurred

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000
transmission risk and so that occurred
 

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.490
transmission risk and so that occurred
and in the early mid 2000s 2005 I think

a cultural norm it was not a traditional
 

00:52:11.049 --> 00:52:13.349
a cultural norm it was not a traditional
or typical behavior but they had heard

or typical behavior but they had heard
 

00:52:13.359 --> 00:52:15.779
or typical behavior but they had heard
and they had internalized that this

and they had internalized that this
 

00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:17.849

procedure might reduce their risk of
 

00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:20.759
procedure might reduce their risk of
acquiring HIV infection so they were

00:52:20.759 --> 00:52:20.769
acquiring HIV infection so they were
 

00:52:20.769 --> 00:52:22.200
acquiring HIV infection so they were
quite happy to have the procedure done

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.210
quite happy to have the procedure done
 

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:24.539
quite happy to have the procedure done
so it's a very interesting case the

that's not happening so much but there's
 

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.849
that's not happening so much but there's
been an interest in looking at simpler

it's a very long complicated story but

it's a very long complicated story but
 

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.190
it's a very long complicated story but
that's a very important pillar now of

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:25.950
how does that translate to infant
circumcision so the guys people who

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960
circumcision so the guys people who
 

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.769

still don't like Britta's and the other

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:28.779
still don't like Britta's and the other

cultural practices of circumcised and

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:30.910
cultural practices of circumcised and
 

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:33.870
cultural practices of circumcised and
infants said you know this how do we

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880
infants said you know this how do we
 

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:35.130
infants said you know this how do we
know that these data really apply to

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.140
know that these data really apply to
 

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.410
know that these data really apply to
infant circumcision and then there was a

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:37.420
infant circumcision and then there was a
 

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.059
infant circumcision and then there was a
sensor are we going to now feel like all

00:53:39.059 --> 00:53:39.069
sensor are we going to now feel like all
 

00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:52.770
sensor are we going to now feel like all
men have to be circumcised

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:52.780
 

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.810
by then there's a second part of the way

by then there's a second part of the way

and we're looking at couples so I'm not

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:44.210
and we're looking at couples so I'm not
 

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:45.460
and we're looking at couples so I'm not
sure how they would have worked that in

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:45.470
sure how they would have worked that in
 

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:52.840

significant policy issues that you're

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:54.770
significant policy issues that you're
 

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.140
significant policy issues that you're
experiencing with

00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:57.150
experiencing with
 

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.420
experiencing with
the use of implementation

00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.430
the use of implementation
 

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:03.430
the use of implementation
and how that impacts

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440
 

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.720
Wow first my head was going what are the

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:08.730
Wow first my head was going what are the
 

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.609
Wow first my head was going what are the
big policy issues then you threw in the

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619
big policy issues then you threw in the
 

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:15.400
big policy issues then you threw in the
implementation science and well there's

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.410
implementation science and well there's
 

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.170
implementation science and well there's
policy with a big P and then there's

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180
policy with a big P and then there's
 

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.030
policy with a big P and then there's
kind of science policy so I think I was

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040
kind of science policy so I think I was
 

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.530
kind of science policy so I think I was
reacting to a great extent of the

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540
reacting to a great extent of the
 

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.510
reacting to a great extent of the
science policy part of it whereas where

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520
science policy part of it whereas where
 

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.210
science policy part of it whereas where
in the scientific community lands on

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220
in the scientific community lands on
 

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.120
in the scientific community lands on
some new construct and decides this is

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:29.130
some new construct and decides this is
 

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.829
some new construct and decides this is
the end-all and that's where I think the

00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839
the end-all and that's where I think the
 

00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:33.559
the end-all and that's where I think the
implementation science approach has the

00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:33.569
implementation science approach has the
 

00:55:33.569 --> 00:55:34.760
implementation science approach has the
possibilities but it's also highly

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:34.770
possibilities but it's also highly
 

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.680
possibilities but it's also highly
problematic particularly from the view

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:36.690
problematic particularly from the view
 

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:38.329
problematic particularly from the view
of a social scientist who thinks it's

00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339
of a social scientist who thinks it's
 

00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:40.730
of a social scientist who thinks it's
supplanting any attention to two real

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740
supplanting any attention to two real
 

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:45.740
supplanting any attention to two real

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:45.750
social science it's very mechanical it's
 

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.599
social science it's very mechanical it's
about the operations of systems so you

00:55:47.599 --> 00:55:47.609
about the operations of systems so you
 

00:55:47.609 --> 00:55:49.400
about the operations of systems so you
know there's some value to that so I'm

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:49.410
know there's some value to that so I'm
 

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:50.839
know there's some value to that so I'm
not sure if I can answer the question

00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:50.849
not sure if I can answer the question
 

00:55:50.849 --> 00:55:53.480
not sure if I can answer the question
the way you phrase it what I think

all questions come back to yours I'm
afraid I can give this talk to a really

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480
afraid I can give this talk to a really
 

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.049
afraid I can give this talk to a really
friendly audience like this one I can

01:07:46.049 --> 01:07:46.059
friendly audience like this one I can
 

01:07:46.059 --> 01:07:47.730
friendly audience like this one I can
wait for somebody to invite me to give

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:47.740
wait for somebody to invite me to give
 

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.410

this talk to a less friendly audience
 

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.349
this talk to a less friendly audience
but that doesn't happen too much and I

01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359
but that doesn't happen too much and I
 

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.390

summer that is considered the real
science conference because a lot of the

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520
science conference because a lot of the
 

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.189
science conference because a lot of the
scientists got fed up with the huge

implementation sites and what typically

01:08:59.729 --> 01:08:59.739
implementation sites and what typically
 

01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:02.099
implementation sites and what typically
happens is if there are plenty talk so

01:09:02.099 --> 01:09:02.109
happens is if there are plenty talk so
 

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:03.629
happens is if there are plenty talk so
it talks to the whole audience in the

it talks to the whole audience in the
 

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:04.590
it talks to the whole audience in the
morning at the beginning these

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600
morning at the beginning these
 

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.349
morning at the beginning these
conferences and you have a basic science

01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359
conferences and you have a basic science
 

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.329
conferences and you have a basic science
talk basic biomedical science talk on

01:09:09.329 --> 01:09:09.339
talk basic biomedical science talk on
 

01:09:09.339 --> 01:09:11.360

vaccine and the place is packed and

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:11.370
vaccine and the place is packed and
 

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:13.590
vaccine and the place is packed and
social scientists like me are sitting in

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600
social scientists like me are sitting in
 

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.820
social scientists like me are sitting in
their learning you know I'm

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:14.830
their learning you know I'm
 

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:17.130
their learning you know I'm
by osmosis all understand vectors and

01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:17.140
by osmosis all understand vectors and
 

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.860
by osmosis all understand vectors and
all this stuff they're talking about and

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:18.870
all this stuff they're talking about and
 

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.450
all this stuff they're talking about and
then a social scientist if they're

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:21.460
then a social scientist if they're
 

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.220
then a social scientist if they're
invited which happened in Rome gets up

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:23.230
invited which happened in Rome gets up
 

01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:25.760
invited which happened in Rome gets up
to give the talk half the room walks out

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:25.770
to give the talk half the room walks out
 

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:28.680
to give the talk half the room walks out
so it's really an audience issue I think

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:28.690
so it's really an audience issue I think
 

01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:30.120
so it's really an audience issue I think
it's a little bit to my point earlier

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:30.130
it's a little bit to my point earlier
 

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.590
it's a little bit to my point earlier
that a lot of the biomedical and

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600
that a lot of the biomedical and
 

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.120
that a lot of the biomedical and
clinical science community just doesn't

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.130
clinical science community just doesn't
 

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:34.320
clinical science community just doesn't
think it needs to hear it they're just

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:34.330
think it needs to hear it they're just
 

01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:36.240
think it needs to hear it they're just
so interested in the science they do and

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:36.250
so interested in the science they do and
 

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.250
so interested in the science they do and
think that's all I need to hear we're

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:38.260
think that's all I need to hear we're
 

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.750
think that's all I need to hear we're
probably guilty of the same thing to

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:39.760
probably guilty of the same thing to
 

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.520
probably guilty of the same thing to
some extent and say well I understand or

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:41.530
some extent and say well I understand or
 

01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:43.110
some extent and say well I understand or
don't understand this talk I'm not going

01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120
don't understand this talk I'm not going
 

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.270
don't understand this talk I'm not going
to it but I can't think we tend to sit

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:45.280
to it but I can't think we tend to sit
 

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.090
to it but I can't think we tend to sit
through more of that so there's still a

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:48.100
through more of that so there's still a
 

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.920
through more of that so there's still a
little bit of hold out and having the

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:49.930
little bit of hold out and having the
 

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:51.840
little bit of hold out and having the
right venues because i think the

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:51.850
right venues because i think the
 

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:53.730
right venues because i think the
scientific community is as much my

01:09:53.730 --> 01:09:53.740
scientific community is as much my
 

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.590
scientific community is as much my
audience as any in fact it is my primary

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600
audience as any in fact it is my primary
 

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.560
audience as any in fact it is my primary
audience policymakers certainly but it's

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:58.570
audience policymakers certainly but it's
 

01:09:58.570 --> 01:09:59.940
audience policymakers certainly but it's
the biomedical in clinical science

01:09:59.940 --> 01:09:59.950
