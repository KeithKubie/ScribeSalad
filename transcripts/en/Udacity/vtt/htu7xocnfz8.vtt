00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.660
luckily, I grew up in a very educated community. You know,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.570
30 minutes away from MIT, Harvard, you know, all of the Ivy Leagues in Boston.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.820
and I think that's, that speaks a lot to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.450
kids and their value, not value system, but their manners and so forth.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.600
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.937
&gt;&gt; So, I don't remember

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:30.140
getting teased too much. I'm sure I did and how much of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.479
that I have sort of put under the surface and forgotten about.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.970
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.520
&gt;&gt; but I, I don't, I have a tougher

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.310
time even today when I'm in an inner city environment

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.340
where my, the people surrounding me don't have the same

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.230
etiquette and don't have the same education, the same exposure.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.041
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.050
&gt;&gt; And that's really where I struggle more

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.570
than where I grew up, in a suburb of Boston.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.810
&gt;&gt; well to get a bit more of that sort of educated thought and idea I want you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.640
to tell us you know, as a medical condition of, of dwarfism what is,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.180
what do you know is the cause of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.820
shorter stature and in particular, in your case,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.490
what is the what is the cause of, of this? Well, remember, there are over 200

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.910
different types of dwarfism, achondroplasia being the most common. So,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.670
if you were to meet another little person in your

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.630
life, most likely they'll have achondroplasia. So I can only

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.970
really speak to achondroplasia. it is a dominant gene. It is

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.720
also a mutation. So, what that means is, an individual

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.150
can have achondroplasia for two reasons. One would be their

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.560
parents have it and it's been inherited as it was

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.650
with my children. The other would be it's a genetic mutation

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.390
which is a complete unexplained event which is what

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.680
it was for me. I, I am the only

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.830
little person in my family. My little brother is

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210
six three. and my parents, my grandfather was a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.954
genealogist. So, you can imagine he spent a lot

00:01:56.954 --> 00:02:00.114
of time looking into this. and I am the

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:04.210
only dwarf in my family origin. But, I then

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.950
went on to meet my husband who also has achondroplasia,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.880
we got married, and we have three children. I gave birth to two of them and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.200
I flew to Moscow for the third one,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.480
to adopt from an orphanage. who also has achondroplasia

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.230
but clearly not from me or my husband. she, from all we know, which is really

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.540
not much is a mutation as well, her

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.960
parents were average height. And I suspect, in Russia

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.780
it, it's a lot harder to be a little person. I have

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.350
two children that I gave birth to, one in August of 1992, the other in November

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.104
of 1997. The gene was discovered in 1994 or five. So, that

00:02:48.104 --> 00:02:53.093
meant that my pregnancies were very, very different. In 1992,

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:58.013
the only diagnostic tool that they could use was ultrasound and again,

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:03.015
they were looking at the femur in the fetus and they could not measure that

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:09.640
accurately until I was 24 weeks pregnant. So, at that time, they told me, and I

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.190
was actually being seen by the gentleman that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.430
wrote the birth, the growth charts for fetuses

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.390
at UCSF and he was the one reading

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.541
my film, my, my measurements from the ultrasound.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.950
&gt;&gt; And he said, Jenny, this is a tough one. He said, that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.950
femur is in the 7th percentile. And

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.820
typically if we're looking at a hetero-zygote.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.100
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.750
&gt;&gt; Meaning that the embryo, fetus, has gotten

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.390
the gene from one of you, that femur's going to

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.710
be over the 10th percentile. Right around between

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.630
the 10th and the 20th or 30th or something.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.910
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.260
&gt;&gt; and you're coming in at the 7th and that makes us very

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.773
concerned that perhaps you're carrying a homo-zygote. And

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:53.851
a homo-zygote, what that means on, in, in

00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.281
lay terms is a double dominant and in

00:03:56.281 --> 00:04:00.480
achondroplasia they have found that to be lethal. The

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.930
baby is born and lives no more than a week. Typically, more a matter of hours

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.700
without life support. So, it was a really

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.648
tough call. So, we went ahead and, and went

00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:16.880
with what we thought was right and Alex

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.140
was born and obviously he's still with us, he's

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.040
20 years old. So, he must be a hetero-zygote

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.010
although he has had a lot of medical issues.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.670
&gt;&gt; hm.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.590
&gt;&gt; jump ahead five years later and in between that, by

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.660
the way, I'd flew to Moscow to adopt a second child.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.650
&gt;&gt; hm.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.316
&gt;&gt; I'm pregnant again with our now 15 year

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:39.660
old and I have an amniocentesis at ten weeks.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.550
And within a week, I get a phone call

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.889
from a genetic counselor at Bailey University in Texas telling

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.040
me, you have a hetero-zygote, 100% certainty. So, you can

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.630
imagine the difference in the stress involved around both pregnancies.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.130
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.670
&gt;&gt; I knew what my odds were when I was

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.150
ten years old and babysitting and knew that I wanted

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.300
to have children and I wanted to be a teacher.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.740
I, did that influence my selection of mates? Did I

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.750
say to myself oh, I'd better not find

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.405
a, I'd better not fall in love with another

00:05:08.405 --> 00:05:12.190
achondroplastic because we have a 25% chance of having

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.867
a homo-zygote? Absolutely not. Do I ache for my

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:20.431
boys, who will most likely by mere fact

00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:25.615
of numbers, will wind up with achondroplastic women and

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:28.309
this will be on the table? Do I ache

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.813
for them, before they're are even, you know, really

00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:30.110
dating?

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.610
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.420
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I ache for them.
