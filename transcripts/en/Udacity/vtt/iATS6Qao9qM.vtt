00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.790
The overall course is broken
into three mini courses.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; The first one is
Manipulating Financial Data in Python.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.710
&gt;&gt; In this first mini course, we show
you how to read historical financial

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.120
data into Python and manipulate it
using powerful statistical algorithms.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.830
&gt;&gt; The second one is
Computational Investing.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt; In the second mini course,
we show you the algorithms, methods and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.330
models used by hedge funds and
investment banks to manipulate and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.610
work with financial data.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.720
&gt;&gt; And the last one is
Learning Algorithms for Trading.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.700
&gt;&gt; In this last mini course,
we pull everything together.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.730
We take what you learned in the first
two mini courses, show you how to take

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.360
that data and use it with machine
learning algorithms like Q learning and

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.130
random forests to build
trading algorithms.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.970
Now, our goal is that after you complete
this course you'll be equipped to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.820
join a trading system development team.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.190
Say a hedge fund or an investment bank.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.872
But I want to emphasize that you
shouldn't immediately begin automatic

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:57.000
trading.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.820
This course is just a starting point to
teach you some of the things that you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.250
need to do that well.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.730
But, again, it's just a starting point.
