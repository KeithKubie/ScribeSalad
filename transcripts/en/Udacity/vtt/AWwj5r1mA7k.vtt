00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.469
And even if we don't go to these extreme examples, I'm

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.380
sure that you have all experienced

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.540
software problems, typically manifested in what

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.630
we call a crash. And that crash might happen while you're

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
finishing your homework or that three-page long email that you were preparing

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.900
for the last two hours. But why's it so difficult to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.220
build software, or better, why's it so difficult to build good software?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.200
And how can we do it? This is exactly the topic

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.190
of this class. And the reason why software engineering is a fundamental

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.330
discipline in computer science. To motivate that, in this class, we

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.259
will study a set of methodologies, techniques, and tools, that will help

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.150
us build high quality software that does what it's supposed to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.540
do. And therefore, makes our customers happy. And that does it within

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.375
the given time and money constraints. So within the budget that

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.300
is allocated for the software. Before

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.222
jumping into today's software engineering techniques

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:48.010
though, let me take a step back and look at how

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.240
we got here, as I believe it is very important to have

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.690
some historical perspective on how this discipline was

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.840
born and how it was developed over the years.
