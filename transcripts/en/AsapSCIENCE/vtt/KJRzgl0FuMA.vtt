00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Whether you're watching an entire Netflix series in one sitting,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.620
or playing the newest Zelda from start to finish,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.840
most of us spend a significant time in front of screens.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.060
But is binge watching bad for your brain and body?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.340
In the past, it may have actually been deadly.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.180
In 1967, an error in manufacturing led to the selling of TVs which emitted harmful X-Rays

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.460
with radiation levels 100,000 times higher than what is considered safe today.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.420
But even modern televisions cause a strain on your eyes.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.260
Under normal circumstances, humans blink around 18 times per minute,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.460
but when staring at a screen, this rate decreases drastically

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.540
causing sore and tired eyes.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.340
Fortunately, these symptoms are generally short-term.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.360
In children, however,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.660
simply spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.500
A condition called Myopia, where the eyes cannot focus properly,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.380
is seen much more frequently in children who spend more time inside.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.820
Not only are you constantly forced to focus on nearby objects as opposed to far off landscapes and distances,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.120
but scientists believe that the sun itself may actually play a role in healthy eye regulation.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.500
And while TV may feel like a nice way to relax your body and brain,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.720
that may not always be a good thing.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.340
Not only is a sedentary lifestyle a major contributor to obesity,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.160
but studies have shown that people who watch less TV tend to burn more calories,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.760
even if they aren't doing more physical activity.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.660
Simply doing more mentally rigorous tasks like reading, playing a board game, or simple household activities,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.400
requires more energy and burns more calories.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.220
And if you want to truly relax,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.940
TV before bed may also be hurting you.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.520
Studies have shown that it may actually reduce the hours of quality sleep,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.400
contributing to chronic sleep debt.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120
It may also affect other bedtime activities.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.780
Researchers have found that those who watch more than 20 hours of TV a week

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.500
have, on average, a 44% reduction in sperm.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.720
But perhaps the most significant findings relate directly to your life span.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.620
Not only is there a documented correlation between TV viewing time and risk for diabetes and heart disease,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.520
but as shocking as it may be,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.040
multiple studies have found a correlation between TV viewing time and ALL causes of death.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.300
One study concluded that every hour spent in front of the TV

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180
may cut as much as 22 minutes off your life.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960
Of course, correlation does not equal causation,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.520
and you can have a healthy relationship with TV if consumed in moderation like anything else.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.900
At the root of many of these claims is the physical inactivity associated with prolonged TV watching.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.840
Ultimately, the more you move, the more you live.
