00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.680
STEPHANIE: Introduce
our panel.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.390
Don Dodge, Kevin Rose, Stacy

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.310
Brown-Philpot, and Chris Messina.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.070
Can we get--

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.430
do you guys want to do just
a quick shout out for

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.830
introduction?

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.440
I'll pass it down the line.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.690
Oh.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.100
DON DODGE: Hello.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.770
I'm Don Dodge from Google,
Microsoft, Alta Vista,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.970
Napster, Groove Networks.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.417
All kinds of companies, mostly
startups, except

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.530
for those first two.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.510
So great to be here, and looking
forward to hear what

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.900
you have to tell us.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.860
KEVIN ROSE: Hey, everybody.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.910
I'm Kevin Rose from Google
Ventures, and I did Digg and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.110
Milk and Pownce, and lots
of crazy things.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.210
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Hi, Stacy
Brown-Philpot, Entrepreneur in

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.490
Residence at Google Ventures,
and ran a bunch of teams at

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.060
Google to help launch products
that support a billion users.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.300
CHRIS MESSINA: Howdy.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.550
I'm Chris Messina.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.510
I am a UX designer on Google+.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.760
I did hashtags.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.110
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.460
Without further ado, I'm going
to have Mark Cuban 2013.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.320
MARK CUBAN: All right,
thank you.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.160
America, we have a problem.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.260
No one in this country knows
how to take ownership of

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.910
anything at all whatsoever.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.690
So we, the gaming team here
tonight, went ahead and built

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.490
Cuban 2013, a real game where
you get to learn how to be an

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030
NBA franchise owner and really
take ownership of something

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.090
that matters.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.070
Being an NBA franchise
owner isn't easy.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.160
You got billions of dollars,
multiple ex-spouses, deep,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.380
complicated player
cap negotiations.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.620
It's tough.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.960
It's one of the hardest things
you could possibly do.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.590
So we want to help teach
everybody how to Cubanize

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.230
themselves and really take
charge of their lives and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.790
really learn how to manipulate
their friends and everyone

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.590
else into doing what
they want.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700
So in Cuban 2013, we use real
Google+ features to sort of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.039
create an immersive strategy
game for everybody.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.370
So, for instance, you can use
Google+ Hangouts to negotiate

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.720
under-handed trades, or cover
up players' scandals, like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.330
when one of your players runs an
illegal dog fighting ring,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.880
for instance.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.100
Comes up, people.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.580
Comes up.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.900
This is real world stuff.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.940
Or you can use Google Maps to go
and plan out your strategy

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.060
for having a local municipality
use taxpayer

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.370
dollars to fund your stadium,
while you simultaneously plan

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.780
to move to a city with a bigger

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.590
market at the same time.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.420
These are real things
that come up.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.920
And how are we going
to monetize?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.200
A luxury tax, just like
the real NBA.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.540
So we're Cuban 2013, and we're
here to Cubanize America for

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.430
the better.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.330
Thank you very much.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
Peace.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:59.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.830
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.760
Fashion Roulette is up next,
but the judges, what do you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.590
think of it?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.055
DON DODGE: Major points
for humor.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.660
Mark Cuban is quite the guy,
but I don't see much of a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.780
business here, so no thanks.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.540
KEVIN ROSE: I'm sold.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.980
I'm totally going to invest.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.156
It's amazing.

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:22.406
Thank you.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.780
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I don't play games.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.615
CHRIS MESSINA: Probably as
big as Farmville, so.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.830
MALE SPEAKER: Mark Cuban
2013, nice job.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.160
All right, Shopping Roulette.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.750
MALE SPEAKER: All right, guys,
how's everybody doing tonight?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.182
Who wants a deal?

00:03:55.182 --> 00:03:56.010
All right.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.750
So we are Shopping Roulette, a
chance for a deal risk free.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.230
So what we are, we're a website
that liquidates

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.860
products for retailers.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.370
So you come to our site, and you
pre-purchase, you purchase

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.210
and check out a brown bag.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.350
You don't know what's
in this brown bag.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.550
You start at different
price points.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.840
So let's do a demo here.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.990
We're going to start at
a $50 price point.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.610
So I'm going to log
into my website.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.170
I'm going to Google Checkout
or Wallet, and I'm going to

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.800
purchase a $50 brown bag.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.120
I do not know what's in it.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.850
So let's go.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.520
All right.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.360
What's my first choice?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.540
I already have these.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.650
I do not want these.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.900
Next!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.650
New products.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.650
Oh, wow.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.370
A camera, a better camera,
and a Chromebox.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.245
I only spent $50.

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:44.050
This is a deal, but I
already have these.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.300
Next.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.840
Holy crap.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.690
A TARDIS.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.730
I want a TARDIS.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.730
But I already have that, too.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.900
Everybody has a TARDIS, right?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.590
All right, next.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.080
So that was my last choice.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.020
So again, I spent $50.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.710
So now I'm ready to cash out.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.670
I didn't like my choices, so I'm
going to cash out with a

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.540
gift card from Starbucks,
Southwest Airlines, or Amazon.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.020
My brother needs to fly
out here in San

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.560
Francisco in a month.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.770
So I'm going to buy this
Southwest Airlines for $50.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.580
Thank you very much,
Shop Roulette.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.910
I just spent $50.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.750
I had a choice of awesome
products.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.930
I didn't like my choices.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.510
I hit Next.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.540
I didn't like those.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.940
I ended up with the same value
of what I started with.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.770
Shopping Roulette, a chance
for great deals risk free.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.665
Thank you.

00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:29.615
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:29.615 --> 00:05:30.605
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:05:30.605 --> 00:05:33.747
Up next, the health team, Last
Form, and then we've got the

00:05:33.747 --> 00:05:35.540
education team Better Lecture.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.510
Judges, take it away.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.650
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I like it.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.970
Creating a browsing experience
for shopping online.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.040
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah,
I love it, but I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.830
wish it wasn't a website.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.580
I wish it was an app.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.540
KEVIN ROSE: It is pretty cool.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.380
I like that it makes money.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.810
I don't know that I would just
randomly bet $50 on something

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.210
and not know if I'm
going to get--

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.850
KEVIN ROSE: $1,000, I'm in.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.380
Done deal.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.740
DON DODGE: I like it a lot.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.120
Make shopping fun, a little
gaming, a little gambling, a

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.770
little fun.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.020
I like it a lot.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.400
MALE SPEAKER: All right, the
health team, Last Form.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.650
Take it away.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.680
MARK: We're not getting--

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.900
OK.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.970
My name is Mark, and
I'm not pregnant.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.230
But I can't tell you
how many times--

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.910
that sounds like somebody who
wants to get me pregnant--

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.570
I can't tell you how many times
I've had to fill out a

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.950
form where I had to
tell somebody

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.140
that I'm not pregnant.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.350
What I am is a patient.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.890
I have four chronic diseases.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.840
Those diseases are
private to me.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.880
I want to keep it that way.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.300
Security is a very big
deal in my life.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.130
But every time I go to a doctor,
a specialist, or even

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.090
if I go to a massage therapist,
I still have to

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.990
fill out a form and tell them
about my health, about the

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.790
medications that I'm taking, and
all of the reasons why I'm

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.600
taking them.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.470
I want to fill out
one last form.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.370
And I'm going to introduce you
to Andrew, who works with

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.740
thousands of providers that are
actually already handing

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.870
these forms to patients like
you and me every day all

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.000
across the world.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.650
He's got the ability, he's got
the skill, and he's got the

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.810
vision to drive this product
to be the next solution for

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.730
the medical industry.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.750
Let me introduce Andrew.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.230
ANDREW: Thanks a lot.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.810
So here at Last Form, we are
here to disrupt stupidity.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.090
You are still you, no matter
how many times you fill out

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.840
the same form.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.560
You are still you.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.510
A little background
about myself.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.320
I've been in the health care
industry for the last 10

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.260
years, and this place is
ripe for disruption.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.130
Everywhere you turn,
lots of problems.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.860
Not only that, it's
a huge industry.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.050
So at Last Form, what we are
really trying to do is connect

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.480
your information to whoever
you want to send it to.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.860
We can use technologies like
Google's Virtual Machines,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.650
NFC, Cloud Print, and take that
technology, give your

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.330
information to somebody else.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.960
So we start small.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.080
We're dreaming big.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.940
And I have my first 1,000
customers already lined up.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.786
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you, Last Form.

00:08:25.786 --> 00:08:32.809
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:33.220
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.179
So up next, we have education
team, Better Lecture, and then

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.039
we've got the government
team Marco Polo.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.610
Judges, take it away
for Last Form.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.010
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.450
Good pain point.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.130
It's a problem, a
huge problem.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.710
I just don't like anything to do
with medical because all of

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.200
the regulations and insurance
and other crap.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.401
But I like the idea but
it's a big pain point.

00:08:57.401 --> 00:09:00.850
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, on the web I
use 1Password and other types

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.570
of auto-fill services out there
to do a lot of this

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.470
heavy lifting or medium
lifting for me.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.410
It's definitely a pain point.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.170
I get it.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.820
It makes sense.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.660
I just don't know how you're
actually going to--

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.127
there's obviously a lot of devil
in the details, so I

00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:17.190
don't know how you're
going to do it.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.933
It sounds great up there.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:19.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.090
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, I get it.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.830
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So
agree, big pain point.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.190
I think people are still afraid
to put their medical

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.440
information online.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.670
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah, I mean,
I agree with these guys.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.460
It's a huge problem, and I'm
wondering if you start with

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.440
young people or people that are
not so worried about it,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.200
because this is something people
have been talking about

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.820
for a long time.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.160
I want it real bad.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.685
I don't know how you're
going to get there.

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:49.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.330
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:50.830
Last Form.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.080
Now we got Better Lecture.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.490
MALE SPEAKER: Our company,
Better Lecture, is developing

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.250
a mobile app to help college
professors offer better

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.850
education by providing them with
an encouraging real time

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.610
student feedback.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.180
In a large classroom setting,
oftentimes the students fall

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.210
behind and have questions.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.090
The professors don't
even know about it.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.685
Simply not practical for them to
stop every five seconds and

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:19.845
go, does everybody get it?

00:10:19.845 --> 00:10:21.940
And even if they did, a lot of
the students would be too

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.500
intimidated to speak up.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.170
So we're going to solve that
with a simple mobile app.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.230
It allows the students to
provide the professor with

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.000
real time feedback using
this slider.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.980
Green is I get it, move on.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.890
Gray is I'm following along.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.540
Red is I'm lost.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.080
Please go back.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.670
When they have questions, they
simply start typing it in.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.730
We will aggregate the questions
the same way sites

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.650
like [INAUDIBLE] and Stack
Overflow do, and then submit

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.780
them to the teacher.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.070
At that point, the professor
sets up his own alert system.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.670
If 50% of the class is
lost, let me know.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.090
If 12 people ask the same
question, let me know.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.610
So that he knows
where to stop.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.490
We like this idea because it'll
help students, prevent

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.650
students from falling behind,
and will help professors

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.030
improve their lectures
and their class.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.780
And for administrators, who
are probably going to be

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.150
paying the bill here, we'll
help them evaluate teacher

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
performance.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:17.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.710
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Really
like this, having gone to

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.720
school with lots of people in
the room and big classes.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.730
Who pays for it?

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.870
That's what I wonder.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:29.910
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.140
I think this is great.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.280
I think having this kind of
immediate feedback would be

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.920
really awesome.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.730
And I think the more that you
do to help teachers to

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.020
actually make use of this
information, as opposed to

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.120
just leaving it up to them to
figure it out, would make this

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.370
really valuable.

00:11:43.592 --> 00:11:45.280
KEVIN ROSE: Yep, I agree.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.430
I love the problem, and it
sounds like you have a good

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.140
solution for it.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.480
I just don't know how
big the business is.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.240
With all the schools in, say,
you take the United States, is

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.910
that a billion dollar company?

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.432
Probably not, but it's
a great idea.

00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:02.030
DON DODGE: Yep, I
like it a lot.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.170
A good pain point.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.280
Problem is, there are two things
that I refuse to invest

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.600
in, education and health care.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.055
[BOOING]

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:14.970
DON DODGE: I know.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.460
The reason is because--

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.760
it's the same reason.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.160
It's education and health
care are too structured.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.640
They don't respond to natural
market forces.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.780
They're dominated by regulation,
government

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.000
regulation and unions.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.580
So it's so difficult to make
money in that space.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.730
But I agree.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.520
It's a problem, and I
like the idea a lot.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.280
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.390
All right.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.650
Up next, we got Marco Polo.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.410
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.660
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:56.160
MALE SPEAKER: Better?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.900
There we go.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.580
All right.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.144
So the first time I went
overseas, I wanted to study

00:13:00.144 --> 00:13:01.180
abroad in Barcelona.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.060
And one of the first individuals
that I met was

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.480
this nice Italian kid.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.710
And then we got to talking.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.590
He spoke a little bit
of broken Spanish.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.770
I spoke a little bit
of broken Italian.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.990
And we got to mingling.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.610
And like any other American,
at the end of the

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.090
conversation, I went for a high
five, and I stuck my hand

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.110
up like this.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.270
He looked at me, stuck
his hand up, and

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.510
then petted my face.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.790
It was very awkward,
to say the least.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.080
But as a person that's traveled
a lot since, I've

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.930
realized that as Americans, we
have a lot to learn about

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.120
going overseas in terms of
nuances, cultural things, and

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.290
how to interact with the
local population.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.200
So at Marco Polo, we aim to make
travelling less awkward

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.020
by offering you information
from real people in real

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.370
countries that teach you how to
interact, how to cooperate,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.470
and how to learn from
those around you.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.130
So that's what we aim to do.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.850
We aim to make you travel
like a native.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.670
And so you're probably asking
yourself, how do you monetize?

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.100
How do you turn this
thing around?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.290
And our plan is by offering
different sorts of content.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.850
Level one, you're
going to China.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.100
So what do you have?

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.220
You have a travel list,
and that's about it.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.520
A different level, now you have
more specific information

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.590
on the region that you're
traveling to.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.240
And our target market, of
course, is the new traveler

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.530
because there's people going
everywhere nowadays, and the

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.640
world's becoming smaller.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.140
So what we aim to do is to
make it easier and more

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.820
streamlined by making it less
awkward so you don't get

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.590
patted by nice Italian
gentlemen.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.230
Thank you.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.890
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.140
Marco Polo.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:39.110
Up next, we have Venuize
and then Smart Diction.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.560
All right.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.220
Judges, take it away.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.570
DON DODGE: Travel is a
huge market, so lots

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.390
of money spent there.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.560
So that's great.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.370
It's an interesting problem.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.660
I'd like to see it be mobile,
and maybe you could do the web

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.150
as free, but mobile as paid.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.330
So when they're traveling, they
want the mobile version.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.050
When they're planning the
travel, they do it

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.310
for free on the web.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.070
I like the idea.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.230
It's good.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.730
KEVIN ROSE: I also like
the idea a lot.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.540
I think the name's great.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.210
I think that any time there is
intent around something,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.790
especially wanting to travel,
there's ways to monetize it,

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:15.880
so I wouldn't be too concerned
about that.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.750
Yeah, it makes sense to me.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.290
Anytime you go to someplace new,
you don't want to stick

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.080
out like a sore thumb.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.880
And I would use your service.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.480
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I like it.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.610
I worry it becomes a blog.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.930
So I would try to get something

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.280
where it's real time.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.080
So if I'm in the moment, and I
put my hand up, tell me don't

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.370
ever put your hand up
when you're in Rome.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.780
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean,
I don't see anything

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.810
wrong with being petted.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:49.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.930
CHRIS MESSINA: So I like it.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.150
I think if you figure out some
way of helping out the folks

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.470
who are actually providing the
information, giving them a

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.170
reason to get together to talk
to share this stuff, that

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.960
might also be an interesting
way of adding

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.880
value for them as well.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.825
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:16:05.825 --> 00:16:08.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.350
MALE SPEAKER: Where
is Venuize?

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.840
MALE SPEAKER: Can everyone
hear me?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.732
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:21.732 --> 00:16:23.178
MALE SPEAKER: How about now?

00:16:23.178 --> 00:16:24.630
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:25.310
MALE SPEAKER: Is it on?

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.880
Oh, sick.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.122
All right, cool.

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:27.994
All right.

00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:29.570
I'm here to talk
about Venuize.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.370
It's Google Analytics for
professional event organizers.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.320
So professional event organizers
worldwide spend

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.050
marketing money, effort, time,
and resources to push out

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.510
their event and try to get
attendees to come to their

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.740
event, but they have no way
of measuring the success.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.070
So for example, I come
to this event today.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.780
Great event.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.600
Great job by the organizer.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.110
I look at the table.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.360
There's a bunch of name
tags left over.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.120
As the organizer, I
want to know, who

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.110
referred those people?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.840
Which affiliate referred
those people?

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.540
Maybe they signed up on a
specific page on a social

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.930
network, and I want to take that
information and optimize

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.630
for my future events.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.579
Now, imagine that
scenario today.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:16.089
Times it by 1.8 million
professional events across the

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:17.650
US during one year.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.920
This is a billion
dollar industry.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.530
And our solution lets them track
the conversion rate of

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.330
each medium from which guests
register, track which guests

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.620
have the highest attendance
rate, have the highest

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.880
loyalty, spend the most amount
of money, which affiliates are

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.780
most useful.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.880
And the technology we'll use
will obviously be integrated

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.290
with Google+ events, and
check-ins will be done on

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.600
Android tablets and phones.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.560
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.540
Venuize.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.875
MALE SPEAKER: Up next, we
have Smart Diction,

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.370
and then Shop TV.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.820
Judges, take it away.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.760
CHRIS MESSINA: It's good.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.860
I mean, you've got some heavy
competition coming from

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.890
Eventbrite and other guys like
that, but I work on Google+,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.860
so I'm happy to see the first
events integration.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.110
So right on.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.000
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: OK.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.610
So I, too, like the events
integration.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.420
I worry that this isn't
a big enough problem.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.330
I think the bigger problem is
organizing how people enter,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.930
sign up, check in to events
when they get there,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.700
especially when it's a lot
of people at them.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.520
And I would think about how to
build that into your idea.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.970
KEVIN ROSE: I like consumer
internet stuff, so this is a

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.680
little boring for me.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.370
I think it's a good idea.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.970
It's just not in my personal
wheelhouse, but I think that

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.970
most of the events that I've
gone to, there's absolutely no

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.455
tracking around the different
problems that

00:18:55.455 --> 00:18:56.140
you outlined here.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.040
So to have some tracking and
some visibility into really

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.680
what's going on makes complete
sense to me.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.100
I think it would work.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.540
DON DODGE: It's a big market.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.280
A lot of companies have tried
to solve this problem of

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.720
building a community that lasts
beyond the event, and

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720
that kind of thing.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.400
I haven't seen a single one
succeed yet, but somebody's

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.180
going to do it.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.780
And I like what you're doing.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.930
MALE SPEAKER: Why do you
think they haven't

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.950
been able to succeed?

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.540
DON DODGE: I don't know.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.830
There's been a lot of companies
try, and a lot of

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.260
money spent trying to do it.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.340
I don't know why they failed,
but I haven't seen a single

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.870
one succeed yet.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.766
So hopefully you'll do it.

00:19:32.766 --> 00:19:33.732
MALE SPEAKER: Good feedback.

00:19:33.732 --> 00:19:34.698
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:19:34.698 --> 00:19:38.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.210
MALE SPEAKER: Smart Diction,
where are you guys?

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.180
All right.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.460
Somebody want to drive
the slides?

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.800
Yep, right there.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.260
NICK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.284
Hi, my name is Nick, and
I'm with Smart Diction.

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:13.000
Have you ever gone to a
location, maybe an event, like

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.430
Google I/O, and tried to type
something to your friend and

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.770
let them know you're at Google
I/O. What your phone does is

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.670
fight against you.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.570
Maybe you're in--

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.020
AUDIENCE: Louder!

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.090
Can't hear!

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.340
NICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:32.145
Hello?

00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:33.395
Hello?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.000
Hi, my name is Nick, and
I'm with Smart Diction.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.590
Have you guys ever been to a
location, and you're trying to

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.120
tell somebody that you
know where you're at?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.290
Maybe you're at Disneyland, and
you're trying to tell your

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.900
kids to come meet you.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.160
But no, you get something
else.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.110
Have you ever gone to an event,
and you're trying to

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.880
type into your phone something
about the event you're at?

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.250
Maybe a hashtag, or maybe the
restaurant you're going to.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.210
Or you want to be at Google I/O.
But the dictionary says

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.810
that's not a word.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.100
Well, Smart Diction
can fix that.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.370
What we do is we take geographic
data about where

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.170
you're located, as well as the
people you're with, through

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.810
your social graph and your
social networks, you're

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.450
tweeting, your Four
Squares, your

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.150
Twitters, your Google Places.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.700
And we take this information,
and we combine it into your

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.580
dictionary in an intelligent
manner.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.720
So what we can do is say
you're trying to add a

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.410
hashtag, and you don't really
know exactly how

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.390
to spell that hashtag.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.020
Well, what we can do is we can
actually realize other people

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.140
in the area that are tweeting,
and we can include that in

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.770
your dictionary for you.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.320
Now, this is something that a
lot of different people are

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.280
trying to solve in many
different ways.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.520
We've seen companies like Swype
and SlideIT and Siri

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.490
that have all tried to
enter this space.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.260
And they're doing it
in different ways.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.770
We do it in a unique
way through

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.040
geography and social context.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.690
This is something that people
like carriers, OEMs, and even

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.850
large companies like Google and
Apple are interested in.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.132
Thank you.

00:22:06.132 --> 00:22:17.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.690
MALE SPEAKER: Shop TV and
Connect In on deck, please.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.370
Judges, take it away.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.110
DON DODGE: I like this.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.562
Hello hello?

00:22:30.402 --> 00:22:31.370
Hello?

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.400
Ah, yes.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.070
All right.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.390
I like this idea a lot.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.040
I was the first investor in
Swype, and I made a lot of

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.990
money on that.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.480
So I like this idea.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.080
And Swype and all the others are
not approaching it the way

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.240
that you're doing it.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.410
So I think this is a feature,
and it's a feature that would

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.970
be acquired by one of
these big companies,

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.290
but I like it a lot.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.760
KEVIN ROSE: Yeah, I agree.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.010
It sounds like a feature.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.480
It's not really a business.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.720
I mean, I'm not going to pay
to have Smart Diction on my

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.500
phone, obviously.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.020
And someone will just
buy this up for--

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.020
I don't know that it's going to
be a $100 or $200 million

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.300
exit for you, but it
could be something.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.750
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Love it.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.420
I've been wanting a good
dictionary on my phone, and so

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.290
please go and build this.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.090
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean, if you
can help people be smarter

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.660
about hashtags, then
hell yeah.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.020
Like, maybe tell them
not to use them if

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.270
they're over doing it.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.060
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.980
Now we got Shop TV.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.020
JEFF DANIELY: All right, I'm
Jeff Daniely with Shop TV, and

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.492
some related question, how many
people in here watch TV?

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:46.270
Yeah?

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.880
One or two of you, a few.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.020
So guess what?

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:54.320
So the TV business model has
not changed in 60 years.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.470
It's freaking lame.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.960
So what we're doing is we're
going to work with

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.760
internet-connected TVs, such as
TVs that are enabled with

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.670
Google TV, and we're also going
to launch a companion

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.070
application that lets people
interact with those TVs while

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.840
they are watching TV.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.990
So what kind of TV are
they watching?

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.350
It's VOD.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.940
It's something they DVRed.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.510
It's live TV.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.020
It's Hulu.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.745
It's Netflix.

00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:20.370
It doesn't really
matter to us.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.380
What we're going to do is we're
going to use existing

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:25.480
technologies, just like what you
see on TV today when you

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.180
see a commercial that has
a Shazam tag, right?

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.560
And the Shazam example
sucks, right?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.300
Because you get out your phone
and go through all this

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.330
process, right?

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.870
And tag the commercial.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.020
What we're going to do is have
an application running in the

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.740
background on your Google TV
device that then identifies

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.800
what you're watching, where
you're at in the program, and

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.360
what's on the screen at
that time, right?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.240
And then what-- yes,
bless you.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.600
And what you can do at
that time is purchase

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.980
what you see on TV.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.940
So let's say my wife is watching
Desperate Housewives,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.000
and Eva Longoria walks across
the beach, and she's got these

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.660
great sandals.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.950
And my wife's like, oh my god,
I want those sandals.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.110
So she can take out her phone
or use a remote control and

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:14.652
tag what she sees on TV at
that time, and buy it.

00:25:14.652 --> 00:25:16.110
Thank you.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.420
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.220
We got Connect In.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.367
ALEX: Actually, it's
Connect-on.

00:25:25.367 --> 00:25:25.854
MALE SPEAKER: Hold on.

00:25:25.854 --> 00:25:26.341
Hold on.

00:25:26.341 --> 00:25:26.830
Hold on.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.160
We still have judges.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.408
Where'd you go?

00:25:29.408 --> 00:25:30.578
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah,
whatever questions

00:25:30.578 --> 00:25:32.216
you have, fire away.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.880
CHRIS MESSINA: So I think it's
an interesting opportunity.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.835
I wonder if there's
actually intent.

00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:45.030
If someone's actually watching
something, I think the last

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.870
thing they want to do is
think about losing

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.100
money, spending on things.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.010
So I'm wondering how you
actually bridge the gap

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.410
between being entertained
versus

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.090
actually paying for something.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.740
JEFF DANIELY: So we did take
the time tonight to talk to

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.090
several members of the audience
to talk about the

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.823
need and desire to see something
on TV and say, oh,

00:26:01.823 --> 00:26:02.190
you know what?

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.960
That's great.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.960
That's a red carpet dress that I
want, or the shoes on TV, or

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.310
whatever it might be.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.170
But people see that, and they
just kind of file that away,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.320
and say, well, yeah that's
interesting.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.020
And if they're prompted sometime
in the future, then

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.920
they might engage in that.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.050
But if we can present an
opportunity on the screen and

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.450
let the user tag it--

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.780
and this can be totally
unobtrusive, right?

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.240
So this can be as simple as
like adding it to your

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.460
shopping cart.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.940
Bam.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.960
Oh, yeah, I want that.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.230
And I'll come back
to it later.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.540
Or maybe my wife missed it, and
she wants to come back to

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.690
it later and say, I really
like those shoes.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.450
But I want to buy those.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.750
So she can come back to it
later in time, and scroll

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.515
through and see, those are the
shoes that I want, and I want

00:26:47.515 --> 00:26:47.830
to buy that.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:51.150
CHRIS MESSINA: So like a Read
It Later for TV ads.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.050
JEFF DANIELY: Exactly.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.310
Because hey, guess what?

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.970
When people watch TV today,
what happens when

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.270
they see the ads?

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.960
Fast forward.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.410
They don't watch
the ads, right?

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.710
So it's all about product
placement.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.870
And there are companies today
that specialize in placing

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:11.090
products in television shows,
but they have no way to

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:15.250
measure what happens when they
put that Lotus, a car, in the

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.930
television show.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.130
CHRIS MESSINA: So that seems
like that's actually your

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.860
better opportunity, is to figure
out how to buy the

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.110
things in the show as
you're watching it.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.800
JEFF DANIELY: That's part of the
business model, is to work

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.370
with the product placement--

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.980
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
thank you.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.730
We've gone way over.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.025
JEFF DANIELY: I'm
here all night.

00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:29.360
All right.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.610
MALE SPEAKER: We
got Connect-on.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.000
KEVIN ROSE: I just want
to say real quick--

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.670
MALE SPEAKER: You've
got good questions.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.266
KEVIN ROSE: I skipped
you, but--

00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:38.400
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I like it.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.680
What he just said was a real
opportunity is the real

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.280
opportunity.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.945
You've got to create the
wish list that people

00:27:42.945 --> 00:27:44.580
can buy right there.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.330
JEFF DANIELY: And that's
what it is.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.180
It's the wish list.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.860
It's the add to your
cart, [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.790
KEVIN ROSE: All right,
let's keep going.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.530
So I love this idea.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:51.230
I think it's awesome.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.170
I think like one click checkout

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.810
for the TV is amazing.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.290
I've wanted several of the
swords in Game of Thrones, so

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.830
if you can make that
happen, done deal.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.670
DON DODGE: Great idea.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.010
JEFF DANIELY: Note to self.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.730
DON DODGE: Go for it.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.860
JEFF DANIELY: Shop TV, people.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.110
Thank you.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.000
ALEX: So hi.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.840
My name is Alex.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.275
I'm 22.

00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:18.310
I'm a young, French
entrepreneur.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.730
So when I arrive here, I
heard about this guy.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.380
I think it's Kevin, Kevin
Rose or something.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.910
Someone told me he was famous.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.120
So basically I thought
you might be

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.240
interested in my idea.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.900
So I started looking for
connections, and--

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.100
KEVIN ROSE: Stalking.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.870
ALEX: And just a way
to get introduced.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.190
And so I went on Facebook, and
we had no common friends.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.140
I went on Google+, and we had
no common connections.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.530
And then also LinkedIn.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.980
But actually, there
was a connection.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.290
I just didn't know
it was there.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.750
And Connect-on helped
me find it.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.470
So basically, the connection
was that this guy, Ken, is

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.690
actually connected to
Kevin on Google+.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.390
And we are friends
on Facebook.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.780
So there is a link.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.200
But I just didn't know
it was there.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:20.120
So basically, Connect-on is
about finding and discovering

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.826
the missing connection.

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.076
That's it.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.910
MALE SPEAKER: So we have
Music Bacon, and then

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.356
Teen Lock on deck.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:36.706
Go ahead, judges.

00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:38.075
DON DODGE: Yeah, interesting
idea.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:45.380
The problem is putting these
social networks together.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.100
There were some barriers
there that some of

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.790
them don't want breached.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.058
But I think it's an
interesting idea.

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:53.970
Good luck.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.250
ALEX: Thank you.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.240
KEVIN ROSE: How's it going?

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.840
ALEX: Good.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.280
KEVIN ROSE: It's a little
awkward now.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.650
ALEX: I know, but at least there
is a connection, right?

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.180
KEVIN ROSE: So we could just go
have a beer afterwards or

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.770
something, and you don't
have to build the app.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:11.020
You can just--

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.600
ALEX: It's just a pre-text.

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.400
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: How do you
break down the barriers?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.920
There's a lot of contacts in
email that go beyond just your

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.000
social connections.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.300
How do you do that?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.580
ALEX: Yeah.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.780
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: If you
can't do that, there's no idea

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.050
here to me.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:34.820
ALEX: So here's the
interesting part.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.890
We haven't really figured out.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.520
But actually, this guy does.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.010
MALE SPEAKER: So part of what
we'd want to do is, there's

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.860
the connections that are the
private connections you have

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.580
to authenticate with, where you
have to go in and sign in

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.170
with your Twitter, Facebook,
whatever.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:53.690
But there's also the connections
that you can get

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.710
from the public social graph.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:57.790
So if someone's not logged in,
we can start with there.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.320
So if someone's tweeting at
Kevin Rose or whatever, we can

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.550
start to pull that in to bring
the connections together to

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.810
figure out how these
people are related.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.000
And that's cross barriers.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.440
You can go and you could search
the public timeline for

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.130
Twitter, for Facebook,
for Google+.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.550
You can start there, and then
once people connect their

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.190
accounts, you have that more
powerful information.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.290
So that's how we can start
to reach through that.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.430
And I think there's
some way to bring

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.652
hashtags into that, too.

00:31:20.652 --> 00:31:22.035
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:22.035 --> 00:31:23.880
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.260
ALEX: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.320
CHRIS MESSINA: No bonus
points for that one.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.230
MALE SPEAKER: Worh a shot.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.140
Worth a shot.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.210
CHRIS MESSINA: So
I like the idea.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.730
I think there's been some other
folks who have tried to

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.370
do this recently.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.270
There's like Banjo, and
Highlight, and Sonar, and a

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.330
bunch of those folks.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.310
I think the real problem is
actually getting the high

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.220
quality suggestions and
recommendations.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.190
I also think the other problem
is actually coming up with the

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.150
right context to make
those introductions.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.420
So you're just as well starting
a bar as creating

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.640
this app, and you might
find you make more

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.400
connections that way.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.410
So you can try that too.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.900
ALEX: Of course.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.440
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.110
Thanks, guys.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.360
ALEX: Thank you.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:58.860
MALE SPEAKER: We
got some Bacon.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.545
DAVID: Test.

00:32:36.545 --> 00:32:37.020
OK.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.230
My name is David, and my
idea is Music Bacon.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:44.510
Music Bacon is a ticketing
system that rewards fans with

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:46.940
free tickets for inviting
their friends to

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.080
also come to a concert.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.660
So this is a huge market, $15
billion are done annually in

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.160
ticketing sales in the United
States, and this

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.880
is a growing market.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.420
So the problem is that 40% of
tickets go unsold in the

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.670
United States.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.490
And most people want to
go to more shows.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.790
They just don't know about it.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.990
So how does this work?

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.490
So I buy a ticket online,
or let's say Chris

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.680
buys a ticket online.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.340
So he shares that.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.590
He gets a referral code.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.950
Shares that to his friends.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:27.640
When each of his friends buys
a ticket, they get 20% off.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.000
So if you invite five
friends, you get a

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.580
completely free ticket.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.220
So why would venues ever
jump for this thing?

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.530
Well, 40% of tickets
go unsold, right?

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:42.220
And most of their revenue comes
from beer, not actually

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.430
from tickets.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.950
It's in their interest to sell
out every single show.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.820
So you can't talk about this
without competitors, right?

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.900
There's tons of ticketing
competitors, the largest

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.730
being, obviously,
Ticketmaster.

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.320
Everyone hates Ticketmaster.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.920
In the industry, they are
called Ticketbastards.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.710
And they're one of the top five
e-commerce websites on

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.970
the internet, and probably
one of the

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.360
worst e-commerce websites.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.360
So for instance--

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:10.880
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.722
Thank you.

00:34:13.722 --> 00:34:22.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.949
MALE SPEAKER: So we have Teen
Lock and then Ability and that

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:26.550
wraps us up.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.730
Judges, go ahead.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.719
CHRIS MESSINA: So I think this
is an interesting idea.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:34.940
It's a sort of play on the
Groupon, Living Social thing

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.980
that's happening now.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.909
I think obviously getting your
friends to go to a concert

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:41.260
with you makes a lot of sense.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.000
And that's interesting.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.370
I think the biggest challenge,
actually, is probably breaking

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:48.030
into this, driving awareness,
building relationships, like

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.650
all that stuff.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:52.110
So I didn't hear you talk too
much about technology.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.100
I heard sort of like referral
code thing going on.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.550
So like, what is it that
you're really building?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.715
DAVID: So web site first,
mobile second.

00:34:58.715 --> 00:35:02.250
But I'm a mobile developer,
killer mobile app.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.460
CHRIS MESSINA: OK.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.060
OK.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.920
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT:
I'm not sure.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.560
I don't know how you get
people to switch.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.780
We all, for various reasons,
don't like Ticketmaster, but

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.710
what else do you do besides go
into Times Square, and put the

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.960
little ticket booth up that
you can go to and get

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.980
discounted tickets?

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:21.970
DAVID: First customer
is venues.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.230
Venues have to buy in
for the tickets.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.290
DAVID: It sounds complicated.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.175
KEVIN ROSE: So you get bonus
points for the best logo of

00:35:31.175 --> 00:35:32.180
the night, I think.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.400
The bacon was pretty awesome.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.300
You might want to have a soy
option for the vegetarian

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.610
people out there.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.720
I'm curious though if--

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.492
60% of shows go unsold,
or 40%?

00:35:42.492 --> 00:35:43.276
DAVID: 40% go unsold.

00:35:43.276 --> 00:35:44.450
KEVIN ROSE: 40% go unsold.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.610
So how does--

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.580
let's say there's the White
Stripes or some kind of crazy

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.230
band playing.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.390
It's going to sell
out immediately.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:50.910
Like, do you get
them on board?

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.027
Or does that just--

00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:54.889
DAVID: So we would have other
tickets, too, non-Bacon

00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:57.274
tickets, they're called
vegan tickets.

00:35:57.274 --> 00:35:59.190
KEVIN ROSE: Gotcha.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.430
I was just wondering because it
seems to me that the reason

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.400
that 40% of shows go unsold
is because those

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.390
bands are not really--

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.427
they kind of suck.

00:36:07.427 --> 00:36:08.770
DAVID: Awareness for the 60%.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.730
KEVIN ROSE: It would just be
hard to get five of my friends

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:11.980
to go see a really
crappy band.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.410
DON DODGE: I think you want to
focus on the non-Ticketmaster,

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:20.715
non-A list things.

00:36:20.715 --> 00:36:21.070
DAVID: Start at the bottom.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.400
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.370
Ticketmaster has a stranglehold
on these things

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.650
because they have contracts
that can't be broken.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:31.670
But I think there is a big
opportunity for the other 50%

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.410
of the music market that is not
controlled by Ticketmaster

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.380
and is not controlled by the big
venues, and this could be

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.830
a pretty interesting idea.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.190
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.606
Nice work.

00:36:43.606 --> 00:36:45.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.100
MALE SPEAKER: We
got Teen Lock.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.294
MALE SPEAKER: Is this on?

00:36:51.294 --> 00:36:52.544
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.220
MALE SPEAKER: Texting and
driving is killing teens.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:06.390
In 2010, 416,000 people were
injured in a distracted driver

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.960
related crash.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.540
48% of teens say that they've
been in a car where the driver

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.690
was texting.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.820
Parents need a way to know that
their teen cannot drive

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.350
while they're texting.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.330
Our company will manufacture
Teen Lock, a system that

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.800
prevents teens texting
and driving.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.390
The system is made of a hardware
ignition lock, an

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.250
app, and an NFC tag.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.780
The teen must touch their phone
to the NFC tag before

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.360
their car can start.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.600
The phone is switched by the
Teen Lock into guardian mode,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.890
and will not leave that mode
until the car is shut off.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.470
The system will work
in any car.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.670
The system works on Android
NFC-enabled devices.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.580
The phone is still available
for the driver to use or

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.330
anybody to use in
an emergency.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.230
We sell the parents and the
guardians of teen drivers.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.310
We sell Teen Lock through the
standard retail outlets for

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:07.050
cell phones, such as car stereo
installers, Best Buy,

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:10.384
Amazon, Verizon,
Sprint stores.

00:38:10.384 --> 00:38:11.170
And that's it.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.986
Thank you.

00:38:11.986 --> 00:38:20.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.400
MALE SPEAKER: Last team,
Ability, please get on deck.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.840
Judges, take it away.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.150
DON DODGE: This is
a great idea.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.670
I have a friend, a personal
friend, who's doing something

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.630
similar called ZoomSafer.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.870
It's a terrific idea.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:37.210
He's using GPS, and that
kind of thing.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.150
So this might be a
better approach.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.430
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.220
We're trying to find a way
that's not circumventable.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:44.990
KEVIN ROSE: I like the idea.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.530
It could save lives.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.810
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.400
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Agree.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.200
Selling to parents is good.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.810
I also think that rallying local
police departments is

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.005
another way to get the
awareness out.

00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:00.500
KEVIN ROSE: Sorry.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.490
I think you could definitely
get a discount on car

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.700
insurance for the people
to install it.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:05.070
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:05.845
Excellent.

00:39:05.845 --> 00:39:06.100
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: Yeah.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.620
Insurance companies,
lots of partnership

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.820
opportunities there.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.425
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:39:10.425 --> 00:39:11.160
I think this is great.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.900
I think also finding possible
car manufacturers that are

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.910
interested in this kind of
thing, more forward-looking

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.870
car manufacturers that are
interested in providing these

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:19.870
kind of controls.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.830
Even like for anti-theft
or things like that

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.430
could be very useful.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.750
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:27.940
OEMs, especially automotive
OEMs, are a tough mountain to

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.245
climb, so we'd want
to start in the

00:39:29.245 --> 00:39:31.010
aftermarket and then go there.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:35.020
And there's already ignition
interlock devices for

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.400
different purposes
like billing,

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.420
car billing and stuff.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.320
So the technology is hardened.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.410
And as a matter of fact, my
wife and I had a contract

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.100
manufacturing company,
and we actually built

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.350
devices like that.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.930
So this is there.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:46.250
CHRIS MESSINA: Cool.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.650
Great.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:49.130
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.945
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:39:51.945 --> 00:39:53.660
So we got Ability now.

00:40:10.816 --> 00:40:13.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did you
understand that?

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.220
MALE SPEAKER: Well, this is a
problem with 18 million people

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.430
worldwide who use sign
language and

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.080
still can not go--

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.670
able to say as clear words and
their own feelings to the

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.800
people, even to their family.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.520
Because we take it for granted
they do texting.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.535
They learn the communicating
with the world.

00:40:31.535 --> 00:40:33.480
But it's not a problem.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.290
I learned the sign language,
but I didn't use

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.290
it for three months.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.800
And when I went to the school,
to the people who were doing

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.420
sign language, I couldn't
do it perfectly well.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.260
So it was very troublesome.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:48.380
The problem we're trying to
solve here is communication.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.360
The idea is, when you do the
sign language, when the people

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.180
do the sign language, mobile
will capture the sign

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.740
language real time.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.670
Google Glass can be one
of the example.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.640
And convert into
text and voice.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.640
We have already used voice to
text sign language, which is

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.970
working perfectly.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.640
One way to communicate with them
to tell them what we are

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.890
trying to say to them.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's a gestural
interface for

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.220
communicating with mobile
devices, like Google Glasses,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.770
using Leap Motion.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.310
It teaches you American Sign
Language, which is a language

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.220
that 80 million people already
speak, enabling you to

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.250
communicate with these people.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.890
And it's as simple as
learning a new touch

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.730
gesture for your phone.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.000
This language already has an
established lexicon of

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.050
intuitive gestures like take
a picture, or [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.900
It's that easy.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.130
And it's sort of like a sneaky
Rosetta Stone for American

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.450
Sign Language.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.910
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:45.680
Thank you.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:53.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.525
CHRIS MESSINA: I mean, it seems
like an amazing idea if

00:41:55.525 --> 00:41:58.920
you can bridge the sign language
verbal, spoken

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.960
communication divide.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.460
I think getting it to work
really well and making it

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.520
available to lots and lots
of people I think is

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.460
probably the challenge.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.820
But if you can make it
work sufficiently

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.180
well, that's great.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:11.710
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.190
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So I
have an 11 month-old.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.190
We're trying to teach her
baby sign language.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.780
So if this can help
me, I'm in.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.350
MALE SPEAKER: Here you go.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.810
KEVIN ROSE: I think this is a
great play in with Google

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.760
Glass, so I'm excited to
see you take it there.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.030
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you very
much for the encouragement.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.070
DON DODGE: This is a huge
problem for a small number of

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:36.690
people who would probably pay
a lot of money to solve it.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:39.340
And it's a noble cause,
a great idea.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.490
Go for it.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.088
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:42.088 --> 00:42:47.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.390
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.400
So you guys all did
an amazing job.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.980
I'm going to take the judges
back to deliberate.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.660
Frank from Startup Weekend, can
you come up here and talk

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.790
a little bit about
entrepreneurship?

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.810
You guys all deserve a
round of applause.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.870
You guys are awesome.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.476
Keep them entertained, Frank.

00:43:03.476 --> 00:43:11.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.005
MALE SPEAKER: Remember,
Shopping Roulette is a

00:43:13.005 --> 00:43:14.490
trillion-dollar industry.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:18.810
FRANK: Hey guys.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.820
STEPHANIE: Oh wait, Frank.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.704
Real quick.

00:43:20.704 --> 00:43:21.590
Sorry.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.530
So I just found out
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:23.170
video releases.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.920
So I've been giving them to some
of the speakers, but a

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.130
couple of first people
who went missed it.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.540
So if you didn't get a video
release, please come see me.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.430
Thank you.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.780
FRANK: All right.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.770
Hey guys, my name is Frank.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.300
I'm French.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.230
So first of all, I'm just going
to test if you guys can

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.740
understand me.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.990
So if you understand me, can
you clap your hands?

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.960
One time.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.780
Or two times, three times.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.500
That's good.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:43.580
Real quick.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.980
I don't want to take too
much of your time.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.010
Everybody here must
be exhausted.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.560
This was an experiment for us.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.530
I know it wasn't easy
for everybody.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.640
I hope you guys had
a good time.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.060
Did you guys have a good
time, by the way?

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:55.036 --> 00:43:57.480
FRANK: OK.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.300
Just to keep in mind maybe why
we do that at Startup Weekend,

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.780
and just give you a little
bit of background

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.270
about what's our mission.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.830
So Startup Weekend, you guys
are here in San Francisco.

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.610
So you're kind of spoiled.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.290
You're surrounded by
entrepreneurs, by people who

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.060
wake up in the morning doing
all these things, but we've

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.700
got Startup Weekend now,
I think, running in 105

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.950
countries, and in more
than 300 cities.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.760
Some of them being in
Mongolia or Egypt.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.980
We had people running Startup
Weekend during the

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.390
revolution in Egypt.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.360
So you know you're spoiled.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.690
You know it's not
easy [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.120
right?

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.410
Entrepreneurship is something
we try to understand.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.720
And I'd like to just give you
an example, which I think

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.870
gives you some perspective
on entrepreneurship.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.720
Everybody knows the game
of chess, right?

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.400
And when you play chess, you've
got two players, an

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.810
eight-by-eight grid,
a couple of moves.

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.070
But the number of combinations
you've got is 10 to

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.660
the power of 123.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.600
That's how complex you can get
with something as easy as a

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.190
board and two players.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.420
So when you guys play the game
of entrepreneurship, you're

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.460
playing against seven billion
people with a lot of rules,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.730
most of them being unknown.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.920
This is like volunteering
for the Hunger Games.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.890
So congratulations
for you guys.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:07.850
You guys are crazy.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.190
I hope you have a good time.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.310
I'm going to put some music.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.630
We're going to scream
whenever the judges

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.280
are going to be back.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.820
Stephanie, do you want
to say a few words?

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.060
Stephanie from Google, if you
can give her a big round of

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.700
applause because the girl right
here is the one who put

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.540
everything together.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.480
Ahmed too is going to be back.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.240
[INAUDIBLE] applause for you.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.280
I love to talk during hours,
but as we said, [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.220
collection.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.360
I'm learning more from you guys
than you can learn from

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:33.860
me speaking.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.460
So congratulations.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.250
By the way, who learned
something here today?

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:39.590
That's good.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.680
Thank you very much.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.970
STEPHANIE: Actually, I want
to throw it back to Frank.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.530
And actually, Ahmed and Connor
did a lot of this planning.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.040
So I'm really happy and
thrilled to see

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.240
all you guys here.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.040
I like to say, every time, every
event, no matter how

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.780
many events I do, I'm just
like a high school girl.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.860
I'm afraid either oh my god, no
one's going to come to my

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.900
party, or oh my god, too many
people are going to come, and

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.090
they're going to trash
my parents' house.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.470
So you guys are right
in the middle.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.800
So you guys are perfect.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.050
Thank you so much.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.090
Also wanted to--

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:09.490
wait.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.030
Where--

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.750
I guess, oh he's with
the judges.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:12.250
That's right.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:12.620
OK.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.660
But actually, I just want to
do a little straw poll.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.800
Where did you guys come from?

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.530
How many people came
through the--

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.770
how many people are
going to I/O?

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:21.730
Yes.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.740
Ah.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.310
Nice.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.660
How many people are
in the local

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.550
Startup Weekend community?

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.620
Yeah.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.530
Right on.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.900
How many people are the local
Google developer group?

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:32.660
All right.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.630
OK, OK, good job.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.810
Awesome.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.390
So I'm really happy to see a
good mix of people here.

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:40.780
And I hope that you guys take
this experience back to your

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:46.230
home cities or if you're
local and spread this

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.210
entrepreneurial spirit.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.930
That's really great.

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.390
How many people think you're
going to actually try to

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.070
pursue this idea?

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.490
OK.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.700
OK, very nice.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:56.375
Very exciting.

00:46:56.375 --> 00:46:57.480
All right.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.680
OK, so we have, I think, some
more-- so who's hungry?

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.490
Is anyone still hungry?

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:03.520
Anyone got the munchies?

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.480
A little bit?

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.110
OK.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:06.720
All right.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.560
So let's mingle amongst
ourselves for a few minutes.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.982
I'll grab some pizza and see
if anybody wants some.

00:47:11.982 --> 00:47:12.364
All right?

00:47:12.364 --> 00:47:13.130
Cool.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.380
I'll be right back.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.490
Oh, one quick update.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:58.340
I didn't mention this earlier,
but Kevin hadn't responded to

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.730
my request for one-on-one mentor
time for the winners,

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.900
but he just agreed to do it.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.950
So not only do you get Chris
Messina, Don Dodge, and Stacy

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:07.650
for mentor time.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.260
You get one-on-one time
with Kevin Rose.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.915
So just FYI, keep
that in mind.

00:49:11.915 --> 00:49:13.165
It'll be part of the
prize package.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:22.190
MALE SPEAKER: OK, everybody.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.090
If we can have a seat
really quick.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.830
We have some announcements.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.080
The moment of truth.

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:35.860
So I hope you guys
had a good time.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.080
I know it's already
11 o'clock.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.920
Again, this isn't about
winning or losing.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.640
It's about having a good
time, learning

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.530
through actually doing.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.970
And I hope you guys enjoyed
this experience.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:53.480
I know that for the full Startup
Weekend experience,

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.690
it's an awesome experience.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.960
And the next event that we're
actually going to be having is

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.690
in July in San Francisco.

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:03.250
And I'm sure a lot of you guys
are not from here, so just be

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.060
sure to check your
city's sites.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.020
We've got events all
over the world.

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.040
So make sure to join one, if
you enjoyed this, and tell

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:10.790
your friends.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.230
But the judges have a verdict.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:16.780
And take it away, Kevin.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.240
Oh, thanks to the judges.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.776
You guys are awesome.

00:51:20.776 --> 00:51:24.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.090
KEVIN ROSE: So thanks for
having us here tonight.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.060
Done just whispered in my ear
that just for a few hours of

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.710
work, this is some pretty
impressive stuff.

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:34.090
And so we're all really
impressed.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.950
The highest score we could give
you was a 15, and I had

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.560
several companies in
double digits.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.340
So lots of good stuff here.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.890
The winner of the competition.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:54.690
Cuban 2013 was not the winner,
but a great startup.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.770
The winner is Teen Lock.

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.144
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:01.144 --> 00:52:02.394
KEVIN ROSE: Congrats.

00:52:06.004 --> 00:52:07.948
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:52:07.948 --> 00:52:10.135
MALE SPEAKER: You know what?
we came up with this

00:52:10.135 --> 00:52:11.385
idea two hours ago.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.410
KEVIN ROSE: And I think we're
going to announce our

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:24.120
favorite runner up.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.850
Every judge has their favorite
that was not the winner.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:32.330
So as far as runners up.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.740
STACY BROWN-PHILPOT: So my
runners up, Shopping Roulette.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.685
I really like the
browsing online.

00:52:41.685 --> 00:52:43.490
I really like that experience.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.740
Fun, interactive.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.000
Good, good.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.070
And then Better Lecture, really
redefining the way

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:53.395
feedback happens in
the classroom.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.010
CHRIS MESSINA: Yeah, so I also
had Better Lecture on there.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.240
I thought you guys had a good
idea, and I think education is

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.390
ripe for disruption.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.100
I really also like Smarter
Diction, or

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.860
Smart Diction, I guess.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.630
Again, anything that can help
people do better at hashtags

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.140
makes me happy.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.790
And I also liked Ability, which
I'm also expecting will

00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:19.710
have air hashtags supported
in its first release.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.620
So I like that.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.340
KEVIN ROSE: So I thought that
in-ad and product placement on

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.960
televisions, Apple is going
to do it with Apple TV, so

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.730
someone should do
for Google TV.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.770
And I think Shop TV, I think
it's a great idea.

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:40.625
And my next one was
Better Lecture.

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:48.220
DON DODGE: Mark Cuban is a
personal friend of mine, and

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:53.150
if you got serious about this,
he would probably fund you.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:54.770
That was funny, but
it wasn't serious.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:57.340
So reconsider.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.150
My number one was Teen Lock.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:01.300
I have a friend who's doing
something like this.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.560
It's a great business.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.820
I think you'll be successful.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.020
My number two was Smart Diction,
but I'm probably

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.630
biased because of
the Swype thing.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.110
I think it's a great feature,
and I think you could have a

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.240
quick exit and make
some money there.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.690
My third one was Shopping
Roulette.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:19.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:21.720
DON DODGE: I love the idea.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.150
Shopping, making shopping fun
and a game and a little bit of

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:27.270
gambling, and all good things.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:32.940
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:33.950
That's it, folks.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:35.690
Thanks again for coming.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:36.610
You guys are awesome.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.020
Give it up for yourselves.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.850
And a big thanks to all the
volunteers that put this on.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.290
Google, you guys are awesome.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.120
Thanks, everybody.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.700
And there's a bunch of parties
still going on, so make sure

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.600
to party it up.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.780
We'll see you at I/O if you are
at I/O, and thanks again.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.030
Drive safe.
