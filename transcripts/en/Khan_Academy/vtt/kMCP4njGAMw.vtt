00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.936
Sal: Here are some questions that I got

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:04.803
from Malibu Magazine, so I
thought I would answer them.

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:08.024
Question number 1: Your
videos began as a means

00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:10.410
of tutoring your cousins
and now exist as a resource

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.801
to educate the world, which
must be hugely inspiring.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.472
Yes, it is, and a bit surreal.

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:19.839
Your model is hyper-scalable
because any one lecture

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.870
can be viewed an infinite
number of times anywhere,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.179
but it's also very dependent
on your personal input.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.540
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the idea

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.269
of having to record one more,
or based on expectations

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.536
hundreds of more videos, or
ever questioned the notion

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:36.071
you should be the Khan
Academy's only lecturer?

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:38.005
On the first part, do I
ever feel overwhelmed?

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:43.262
Not in the way that I guess it
sounds like this is phrasing.

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.207
Actually this is what is
really exciting about me

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.206
and almost from my own
selfish point of view,

00:00:47.206 --> 00:00:49.603
this is one of the reasons
why I love doing this

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:52.113
is that I get to spend the rest of my life

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:55.524
doing what I really
enjoy, which is teaching,

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:57.860
and many times learning and teaching,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.594
or teaching myself a new
way of looking at something

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:04.671
or getting to make
connections between things

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.801
that I've never been
able to have the luxury

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.795
to explore before, so
I view it as a luxury

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:11.195
more than something
that would overwhelm me.

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:14.054
I really love this aspect of getting

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:15.191
to do more and more videos,

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:19.762
and I hope that as long as I live I'm able

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:21.337
to continue making videos,

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:25.943
and at least hundreds more per year.

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.733
Even though there is a
lot of responsibility

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.427
of the organization and
being one of the people

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:32.859
who help manage what is
now this organization

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.346
that's beyond me, the
Khan Academy, I always

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:37.059
want to be spending a
significant amount of my time

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:41.163
making videos because
that's really what I love.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:42.858
The second part of it,
do you ever question

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:46.930
the notion that you should be
the Academy's only lecturer?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.123
That's a big yes.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:53.177
But the answer to that has
never been completely obvious.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:56.012
I think one of the
reasons why we've gotten

00:01:56.012 --> 00:01:58.719
a lot of traction is the
consistency and the trust.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.855
When you learn from
someone, it actually takes

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:03.321
a lot of trust to invest your
own mental cycles in them.

00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:08.306
I think people have learned
to trust the Khan Academy.

00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:11.719
We never thought that it
should be this kind of thing

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.596
that everyone can throw videos on.

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:16.282
In fact, there are already
things and its called YouTube

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:19.168
or other things like it.

00:02:19.168 --> 00:02:21.346
It's jarring when you
have different quality

00:02:21.346 --> 00:02:23.792
and you have different
teachers, even if they are good.

00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:26.184
That's what we struggled with.

00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:28.794
We also think that there's
kind of an understanding,

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.525
an agreement with the student that content

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.107
on the Khan Academy will focus on

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:35.682
conceptual development over
mechanical understanding,

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:38.589
it will be conversational, it
won't talk down to the student,

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.857
it will talk to everyone
as if they are smart,

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:45.122
but not talk in a way
that assumes that someone

00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:49.689
knows all of the terminology
or not talk past people.

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.465
It's been very important that we bring ...

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:53.491
Nothing sounds scripted.

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.488
Everything sounds authentic.

00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:56.145
Everything is directly
coming from a person;

00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:57.908
that it's a person-to-person
communication,

00:02:57.908 --> 00:02:59.994
not a corporation-to-person communication.

00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:03.799
These are surprisingly
hard things to find.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.912
We've been searching.

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:06.277
What you'll see in the next few months

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:08.444
is we actually are bringing
on some other lecturers,

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.511
in particular the humanities,

00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.347
who will be lecturers in the humanities.

00:03:14.347 --> 00:03:15.329
I love them.

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.694
The videos that I've watched
of theirs made me wish

00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:19.663
that I had them as teachers
when I was growing up.

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:23.973
I hope other people
have that same reaction.

00:03:23.973 --> 00:03:26.465
The other thing that
people have begun to notice

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:28.059
is the last few weeks
we've been experimenting

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:31.529
with bringing contributors
in who I kind of interview.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.297
We're experimenting with that forum factor

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.220
to see if it's something that makes sense

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.913
or maybe something that just compliments

00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:38.384
the broader library.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.059
I'll always be doing the
independent, traditional,

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:42.059
Sal teaching type of thing.

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.800
I've really been enjoying
getting these experts in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.488
and being able to kind
of play the student role.

00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:50.630
So the simple answer is,
yes, we have questioned it

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.884
and over the next few
months you're going to see,

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:54.997
actually, the faculty of the Khan Academy

00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:57.327
expand in a pretty substantial way.

00:03:57.327 --> 00:04:01.462
Question number 2: One of
the most difficult things

00:04:01.462 --> 00:04:03.137
for people to wrap their
heads around is the idea

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:05.317
that you're not interested
in monetizing the Academy.

00:04:05.317 --> 00:04:08.659
Cold hard cash pales next
to the intrinsic value

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.796
of the tools you've create
and their attendant legacy,

00:04:10.796 --> 00:04:13.387
but if the Academy will
never be a source of wealth,

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:14.997
do you think you'll
eventually turn your attention

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:16.995
to another, for-profit driven venture?

00:04:16.995 --> 00:04:22.124
The simple answer is no, no.

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:27.706
I've gone through the mental
simulation multiple times.

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:30.857
If someone were to give
me a billion dollars,

00:04:30.857 --> 00:04:33.330
this is exactly what I would want to do.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.127
So I get a chance to do it now.

00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:36.858
Regardless of whatever happens,

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:40.415
if for whatever reason you see Sal saying,

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:41.524
"Hey, I'm done with the Khan Academy,

00:04:41.524 --> 00:04:43.448
"I now want to go start
managing money again,"

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:45.326
or if I want to go start doing X or Y,

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:48.921
people should wonder
whether I've been abducted

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.082
and replaced by someone else.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:53.325
I consider myself the
luckiest person on the planet

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:55.406
that I get to do what I'm doing now,

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:56.998
and hopefully for the rest of my life,

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:59.924
and hopefully it's a decent,
respectably long life,

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.615
but you never know.

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:08.232
Yes, and you've articulated
in the question exactly.

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:11.114
I'm not someone who doesn't mind

00:05:11.114 --> 00:05:12.472
a little bit of cold, hard cash,

00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:15.640
but at the same time the
satisfaction of people

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.552
really enjoying the stuff,
we're genuine about it.

00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:18.280
We really love it.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.671
I think it's not just me,
it's most of our team.

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:22.203
If you look at the people
on the Khan Academy team,

00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:25.887
some of them are actually very well known

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:27.202
in their respective domains.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:28.068
Even the ones that aren't well known,

00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:29.734
they really are all rock stars.

00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:30.932
We are really bringing on ...

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:33.219
This is really the most amazing team

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.072
that I've ever worked with
and I've worked with a lot

00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:36.638
of very, very smart people in the past.

00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:40.136
They've all turned away
higher paying jobs,

00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:44.265
jobs at pre-IPO companies where they could

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.893
make millions of dollars,
to work on this project.

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:49.472
It's not just me, I am
actually surrounded by people

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:52.799
who are similarly
inspired by this mission.

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.003
I hope that they continue
to want to do this

00:05:56.003 --> 00:05:58.245
for a long time.

00:05:58.245 --> 00:06:02.936
Question number 3: When you
say that you'd like to make

00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:05.264
the Academy self-sustaining
in 5 years, what do you mean?

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.990
If you don't charge for the videos,

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.358
what will be the source of funding?

00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:12.326
This not charging for the videos,

00:06:12.326 --> 00:06:13.721
this is kind of core to our religion

00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:14.656
of the Khan Academy,

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:15.790
not that Khan Academy's a religion,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.089
but core of what we hold dear.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.872
That's true also for our software.

00:06:22.872 --> 00:06:24.463
As far as what the source
of funding will be,

00:06:24.463 --> 00:06:25.732
it's an open question.

00:06:25.732 --> 00:06:33.702
There's ideas on the table.

00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:35.614
I don't know what all of the ideas are.

00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:39.049
We are building, hopefully,
a trusted brand here.

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:44.720
Maybe the way Sesame does
it, they license Elmo out!

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.456
(laughs) I say that half jokingly,

00:06:47.456 --> 00:06:50.318
but that's one way that Sesame Street

00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:53.246
has supported themselves.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.982
We think we're kind of like Sesame Street

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:58.318
but for older kids and adults

00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:01.184
in terms that we're making
learning approachable for them.

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:04.474
Maybe that type of model might work.

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:06.136
We do hope that foundations continue

00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:08.343
to support us forever, to some degree.

00:07:08.343 --> 00:07:10.265
We don't want to be 100% reliant on that,

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:14.176
but we do think relative
to the impact it's having,

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:19.796
our budget is still smaller
than most individual schools,

00:07:19.796 --> 00:07:20.677
even elementary schools.

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:22.462
We're able to reach
millions of students now,

00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:24.267
and that same content
that's already produced

00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:26.864
can reach tens of millions
for a long, long time.

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:30.132
We also hope that our
user base supports us.

00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:32.196
We definitely don't mind if people say,

00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:33.532
"Wow, that really helped me.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:34.595
"Let me go to PayPal"

00:07:34.595 --> 00:07:36.869
or "Let's send Khan Academy $20"

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:40.400
or "Let me give them $5 from
my paycheck every month,"

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.819
if they can afford it.

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:44.826
We hope that people
are already doing that,

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:46.090
and as our user base grows,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.831
we think that could also help us.

00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.664
So, the simple answer is
we always want to have

00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:52.388
no barrier to accessing the knowledge,

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.333
but we do think that there will be ways

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.455
over the next 5-10 years
so that we can at least

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:59.121
support our base salaries
and our operating expenses

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.335
so that this resource never goes away.

00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:04.105
We don't want to be complacent about that,

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:06.658
so I do encourage people to donate.

00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:12.270
Question number 4: What influence have

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.400
the Gates Foundation
and other donors had on

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.730
the scope or evolution of the Academy?

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.134
Example: Is it now a
collaborative effort, and if so,

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:22.334
what are their objectives

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:23.801
and how might they differ from yours?

00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:27.504
At a first level, our supporters,

00:08:27.504 --> 00:08:29.663
Gates Foundation is a large supporter,

00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:31.797
Google is another major supporter,

00:08:31.797 --> 00:08:34.597
we've had several major
individual supporters.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:39.337
They've treated us in a great way.

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:43.424
They're obviously people
whose opinion we really want

00:08:43.424 --> 00:08:45.546
and want to take into
account, but they have said,

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:47.298
"Look, what's made Khan Academy work

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:49.304
"is it's kind of grassroots.

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.434
"You all have tried stuff
and you all saw what works,

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:53.458
"and based on what works
you keep doing more of it,

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:55.065
"and you keep iterating on the process."

00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:56.859
So they've given us a lot of freedom

00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:58.256
to explore the space

00:08:58.256 --> 00:08:59.861
and make decisions on our own

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:02.100
and pursue the things that we found

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.455
or are compelling for our students.

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:08.794
With that said, they have
a bunch of good ideas,

00:09:08.794 --> 00:09:11.267
so we are taking those great
ideas into consideration.

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.743
I think the one thing that especially

00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:15.389
the Gates Foundation
has brought to the table

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.726
is that they've really
plugged us in to a lot

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:20.788
of the other stuff that's
going on in education

00:09:20.788 --> 00:09:24.202
and education research and
helping to make those connections.

00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:28.320
It's helping us, from
Khan Academy from being

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.322
this kind of quirky
thing that one guy did,

00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:31.663
and we want to keep it a quirky thing,

00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:34.056
but it also helps us
interface with the more

00:09:34.056 --> 00:09:37.255
authoritative side of the education world.

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:40.952
Question number 5: Your
videos are now being

00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:43.324
leveraged to drive more
intense classroom learning

00:09:43.324 --> 00:09:44.999
by flipping the classroom, as I've said,

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:46.058
and as I've said in many videos,

00:09:46.058 --> 00:09:47.590
we view the flip as halfway.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.622
The ideal is kids using
the software and the videos

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:50.872
to work at their own pace anytime,

00:09:50.872 --> 00:09:53.123
and then that they use
class time for the real

00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:55.452
interventions and
interactions with their peers.

00:09:55.452 --> 00:09:57.393
And you have had some very clear opinions

00:09:57.393 --> 00:09:58.940
about how to improve the
educational experience.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.058
I just gave one of them.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:02.122
Do you have any aspirations
around a larger role

00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:03.464
in educational reform?

00:10:03.464 --> 00:10:06.602
I've learned, "reform"
seems like a good word,

00:10:06.602 --> 00:10:08.867
but I've learned that
it can be a loaded word.

00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:12.330
If this question is do
I want a role as like

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.409
a State Superintendent of Education, NO!

00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:18.329
The answer is a very clear no.

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:19.828
I don't want to get involved at all

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:20.935
in the political debate.

00:10:20.935 --> 00:10:25.660
I think we are valuable,
or we can be valuable,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.642
or let me put it this way,

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:28.514
we strive to be valuable to everyone.

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:31.459
So we don't want anyone
to have a predisposition

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:36.055
against us just because Sal
says he feels X, Y and Z

00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:38.100
about some hot button issue there.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.005
If that's the question, we say no.

00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:43.312
If it's do we want to be a catalyst

00:10:43.312 --> 00:10:45.787
in maybe the reform conversation

00:10:45.787 --> 00:10:48.307
being a clear-thinking
conversation, maybe.

00:10:48.307 --> 00:10:50.597
Maybe we can provide common ground.

00:10:50.597 --> 00:10:51.862
Maybe everyone in the debate agrees

00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:54.133
that class time is better
spent when it's interactive;

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:56.740
everyone agrees that
ideally students should

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.943
be allowed to work at their own pace;

00:10:58.943 --> 00:11:02.799
everyone agrees that teachers
are adding more value,

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.130
are going up the value chain,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.275
when they are mentors,

00:11:05.275 --> 00:11:06.660
when they are diagnosing students,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.963
when they are providing things that videos

00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.941
and on-demand exercises can't;

00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:15.100
when everyone agrees
that it's really valuable

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.731
for teachers to get real time data

00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:17.923
so that they can make those interventions

00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:18.891
in a valuable way.

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.482
We hope that we're a catalyst

00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:22.857
or that we have aspirations
about serving those functions

00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:25.649
about maybe clarifying or
finding a common ground,

00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:29.067
but I have no aspirations at
all about becoming some type

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:35.652
of a pundit on the political
debates around this.

00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:38.989
Question number 6: What's
the most important thing

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.588
you've learned through the
process of establishing

00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:42.239
and growing the Academy,
and have there been

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:44.972
any unintended consequences?

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:48.639
I think the most important
thing is I've learned

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.781
the power, and it's
something that I always

00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:52.052
suspected, kind of, with
an engineering background,

00:11:52.052 --> 00:11:59.925
but you need to be close to the consumer

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:03.250
or the end user to really
understand the problems,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.325
and then you should try
to put something out

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.653
that's even very simple and
basic, and see if it works,

00:12:07.653 --> 00:12:12.050
and not make any assumptions
that more technology's good

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.450
or fancier is better,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.785
but just try to solve the need at hand,

00:12:15.785 --> 00:12:17.202
but try to solve it quickly.

00:12:17.202 --> 00:12:19.258
Don't try to plan and
talk about it for years

00:12:19.258 --> 00:12:22.037
and get funding and do
all this stuff before

00:12:22.037 --> 00:12:24.117
you've tried stuff out.

00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:27.381
The big takeaway I've
had, it's kind of my way

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:28.958
I would have operated
beforehand but it's really

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.454
made me feel even strongly about this,

00:12:30.454 --> 00:12:33.855
is build, test and iterate things,

00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:37.918
and don't get into weeks-long debates

00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:40.029
that focus on meanings of words

00:12:40.029 --> 00:12:42.855
and whether one research
study is saying one thing

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.791
or the other research
study is saying the other.

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:49.255
Just build stuff, put it out
there, and see if it works.

00:12:49.255 --> 00:12:52.388
The unintended consequences
is that this idea

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:54.540
of a lot of what Khan Academy is doing is,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.721
I think, obvious and
people have been talking

00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:59.293
about this for a long, long time,

00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:01.373
but I think that attitude of just, look,

00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:03.588
let's not talk about it,
let's do something about it

00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:06.055
has allowed us to get traction

00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:08.988
in a space where there really
hasn't been a lot of traction

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.457
from things like what we're doing.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.169
Question number 7: You are super-numerate

00:13:15.169 --> 00:13:16.717
and offer lots of performance data

00:13:16.717 --> 00:13:17.947
to leverage teachers' efforts.

00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:19.783
Are teachers, many of whom may not be as

00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:21.448
naturally data-centric,
embracing these tools,

00:13:21.448 --> 00:13:23.024
or are you finding resistance?

00:13:23.024 --> 00:13:24.584
What other criticisms are you hearing

00:13:24.584 --> 00:13:26.582
from professional educators
or administrators?

00:13:26.582 --> 00:13:28.784
The first part of it, are
we finding resistance?

00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:30.115
No, not at all.

00:13:30.115 --> 00:13:32.724
The teachers who we've
been working closely with

00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:34.923
who've actually been helping
to define some of these tools,

00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:36.396
they love it.

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:38.323
If anything, their main feedback is,

00:13:38.323 --> 00:13:39.660
some of the 5th grade teachers,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.234
they teach all the subjects,

00:13:41.234 --> 00:13:44.456
so now they feel unarmed with data

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:45.593
when they're teaching other subjects,

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.065
so they want us to go
into those other subjects

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:49.196
as quickly as possible so they
can start to have that data.

00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:53.241
The teachers, we found,
really do love the data.

00:13:53.241 --> 00:13:54.470
In terms of what other criticisms

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.370
are you hearing from
professional educators,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.134
I think some criticism
is, what is new here?

00:14:00.134 --> 00:14:02.932
Hey, isn't this just lecture?

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:05.534
Look, even those lectures
aren't using anything fancy.

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:07.738
They're just literally a
guy chatting about something

00:14:07.738 --> 00:14:10.459
and kind of writing on a board.

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:12.466
They're right!

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:13.782
There isn't anything new here.

00:14:13.782 --> 00:14:16.171
I think what they're missing, the point is

00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:18.255
it's not always about the idea.

00:14:18.255 --> 00:14:19.835
A lot is about the craftsmanship

00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:21.744
or what happens on the ground.

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:24.526
I think a lot, especially
the publishing companies,

00:14:24.526 --> 00:14:27.334
I think they miss the
point that human-to-human

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:30.027
interaction, it's
important with real humans,

00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:31.328
but it's also important when it's human

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:32.535
interacting with a product.

00:14:32.535 --> 00:14:34.460
They don't want to feel like
something is overproduced.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.287
They want to feel like they're
talking to someone who cares.

00:14:38.287 --> 00:14:42.207
It's also more important to
focus on deep understanding

00:14:42.207 --> 00:14:43.752
and conceptual understanding

00:14:43.752 --> 00:14:45.503
and why a subject is beautiful.

00:14:45.503 --> 00:14:47.264
It's more important to focus on that

00:14:47.264 --> 00:14:51.002
than on fancy graphics
and on fancy whatever.

00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:52.261
I try to improve my penmanship

00:14:52.261 --> 00:14:56.297
and I try to draw nice diagrams
so people understand things,

00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:58.406
but we never are going to be that place

00:14:58.406 --> 00:15:01.333
that says we have the fanciest graphic.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.468
Maybe if a really fancy
graphic is compelling

00:15:03.468 --> 00:15:04.468
we'd want to integrate it,

00:15:04.468 --> 00:15:06.881
but we don't want to do it
just for the sake of it,

00:15:06.881 --> 00:15:09.876
just to impress other people
in the computer graphics space

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.071
that we have the best one.

00:15:11.071 --> 00:15:13.249
That's one kind of knee-jerk reaction

00:15:13.249 --> 00:15:14.801
of like wait, this is pretty basic.

00:15:14.801 --> 00:15:16.735
Why is this interesting?

00:15:16.735 --> 00:15:19.047
The answer is it is pretty basic,

00:15:19.047 --> 00:15:20.965
but maybe to some degree
that is why it's interesting,

00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:24.268
that is why it's why people
are finding it compelling.

00:15:24.268 --> 00:15:29.800
The other reaction we get
is when some people learn

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.203
about look, kids learning
at their own pace,

00:15:32.203 --> 00:15:35.675
using software, people
using videos to learn,

00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:40.072
they believe that this is somehow trying

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.550
to replace the classroom,

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.406
or trying to replace the
interaction with the teacher.

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:48.075
For us, we just think
that's a misconception.

00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:51.293
We think we're the exact
180 degrees opposite.

00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:53.266
We are a catalyst for enhancing

00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:54.599
the interaction with the teacher.

00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:57.384
The teacher will no longer
be lecturing at the students,

00:15:57.384 --> 00:15:58.967
they will now be discussing with students.

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:01.471
They will now be having those small group

00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:03.739
discussions that everyone,
I think, recognizes

00:16:03.739 --> 00:16:05.632
is the best way to learn.

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:06.794
They'll now be leading projects,

00:16:06.794 --> 00:16:08.136
that I think everyone agrees

00:16:08.136 --> 00:16:09.800
is a really great way to learn,

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.536
especially if it's augmented with kids

00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:12.675
getting a lot of practice

00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:14.468
and being able to get a
lot of their core skills,

00:16:14.468 --> 00:16:19.677
to some degree, at their own pace.

00:16:19.677 --> 00:16:24.096
I think those are the two areas.

00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:26.404
There's some resistance about the idea

00:16:26.404 --> 00:16:29.663
of more voices on the Khan Academy,

00:16:29.663 --> 00:16:31.268
and I already talked about it earlier.

00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:33.127
We are bringing more voices to the table

00:16:33.127 --> 00:16:35.397
and we do want to make
tools so that teachers

00:16:35.397 --> 00:16:38.086
themselves can also
contribute to the platform.

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:40.193
All of that's coming and
we're going to have the crowd,

00:16:40.193 --> 00:16:41.750
hopefully, if we can think of a good way,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.864
curate what makes sense to add in.

00:16:43.864 --> 00:16:45.521
But we want to do all that without losing

00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:47.330
a lot of the consistency
and even the quirkiness

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.319
that we think makes Khan
Adademy work right now.

00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:53.516
Number 8: The content is heavily weighted

00:16:53.516 --> 00:16:54.783
towards math and science.

00:16:54.783 --> 00:16:56.316
What's your plan for
building more humanities

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.193
content, and how do you choose what to add

00:16:58.193 --> 00:16:59.447
to the site and when?

00:16:59.447 --> 00:17:01.115
For example, what drove
the decision to add

00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:03.116
a playlist about he
Paulson financial bailout

00:17:03.116 --> 00:17:04.990
versus another series of history lessons?

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.604
Our plan on the humanities,
the answer is yes,

00:17:08.604 --> 00:17:11.002
we actually are, actually
I think they accepted today

00:17:11.002 --> 00:17:12.210
and we're going to make the announcement

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.342
once we integrate some of their work

00:17:14.342 --> 00:17:16.011
more deeply with the
site, but we've brought on

00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:18.087
two professors in the humanities

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:20.129
and I love what they've already done.

00:17:20.129 --> 00:17:22.481
I hope everyone can start
getting excited about it

00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:23.536
because I think they'll be pretty happy

00:17:23.536 --> 00:17:24.302
with what they've done.

00:17:24.302 --> 00:17:25.298
I think they've tackled the humanities

00:17:25.298 --> 00:17:26.577
in a very interesting way.

00:17:26.577 --> 00:17:28.514
In fact, this new technique of me doing

00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:30.984
conversations with people,
this was inspired by them

00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:35.128
because many of the humanities
are very subjective.

00:17:35.128 --> 00:17:37.325
They've kind of got this really neat way

00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:38.992
of having a conversation
about subjective things

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:41.459
that bring more than one way to think

00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:42.523
about something to light,

00:17:42.523 --> 00:17:43.992
and I think it also encourages students

00:17:43.992 --> 00:17:45.728
to think of what their own opinions

00:17:45.728 --> 00:17:47.298
about something are, not just to take

00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:51.422
the professor's opinion as gospel.

00:17:51.422 --> 00:17:53.248
Then, for example, what drove the decision

00:17:53.248 --> 00:17:55.121
to add a playlist about the
Paulson financial bailout

00:17:55.121 --> 00:17:57.759
versus another series of history lessons?

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.581
That one in particular was the midst

00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:01.781
of the financial crisis
and I just saw stuff on TV

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:02.999
that I thought was wrong.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.851
I was still working at a hedge fund then

00:18:04.851 --> 00:18:07.006
and I was spending most of my time reading

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:09.379
the Federal Reserve Act
and I was reading all

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.725
of the details of a lot of these bailouts.

00:18:10.725 --> 00:18:12.549
It just felt like there was huge gap

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:14.720
between what the public understanding was

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.721
and what the real reality was.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.586
I also thought that it was a very

00:18:18.586 --> 00:18:20.388
unbalanced conversation in the public,

00:18:20.388 --> 00:18:23.388
that essentially this thing was being

00:18:23.388 --> 00:18:28.051
steamrolled forward, the
take from the interested

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.988
parties was, "Trust us
on this; bail us out.

00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:33.471
"If you even think about
it for another day,

00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:35.058
"we have a gun to the economy,

00:18:35.058 --> 00:18:36.921
"or a bomb is about to
blow up in the economy

00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:38.392
"and we're all going to," you know,

00:18:38.392 --> 00:18:40.098
everything's going to go
to hell in a hand basket

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:43.652
if we don't address those issues.

00:18:43.652 --> 00:18:45.604
I though another more,
hopefully, rational voice

00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:47.803
was needed because there were some very

00:18:47.803 --> 00:18:48.939
irrational things happening.

00:18:48.939 --> 00:18:50.939
People were asking me a lot of questions

00:18:50.939 --> 00:18:52.845
at parties and things, so I was like, hey,

00:18:52.845 --> 00:18:54.402
let me scale up my answer.

00:18:54.402 --> 00:18:56.935
The general idea is
there's a constant tension

00:18:56.935 --> 00:19:01.871
between what is a useful,
hey, look, we still

00:19:01.871 --> 00:19:03.809
haven't done those type of algebra videos,

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.593
let's do those, and
there's just this stuff

00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:08.839
that's current events that need answering,

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:10.751
and then there's just some quirky things

00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:12.935
that I just happen to run
into that I find interesting

00:19:12.935 --> 00:19:15.069
and I'm just dying to make
a video and I'll do those.

00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:17.535
It's a constant balance
between all of those things.

00:19:17.535 --> 00:19:21.542
Question number 9: Your
FAQ answer on your website

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:23.103
about your religion is very eloquent,

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:25.336
but why did you feel compelled
to put it on the site at all?

00:19:25.336 --> 00:19:27.529
Did people, in fact, frequently ask

00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:29.898
about your religious beliefs?

00:19:29.898 --> 00:19:31.728
Yes.

00:19:31.728 --> 00:19:35.732
Many people did ask about
my religious beliefs.

00:19:35.732 --> 00:19:37.851
They wanted confirmation
one way or the other

00:19:37.851 --> 00:19:39.145
about my religion.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:42.924
I thought that that FAQ answer
was actually the best way

00:19:42.924 --> 00:19:44.653
to address that question
because that is actually

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:46.389
how I feel about my religion.

00:19:46.389 --> 00:19:52.852
Question number 10: The
American educational system

00:19:52.852 --> 00:19:55.586
is broken in many ways,
but we also have a problem

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:57.654
of misallocation of
resources in that highly

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.929
educated minds gravitate
towards hedge funds,

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:01.814
investment banks and other
lucrative professions

00:20:01.814 --> 00:20:03.788
and away from teaching
and other professions

00:20:03.788 --> 00:20:05.736
that are more productive
for society as a whole.

00:20:05.736 --> 00:20:08.388
Given your highly relevant
personal career shift,

00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:09.502
do you have any ideas

00:20:09.502 --> 00:20:12.229
about how to change that misallocation?

00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:17.503
I think people go into a
career for multiple reasons.

00:20:17.503 --> 00:20:21.000
I think one is intellectual stimulation.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.205
Teaching is as, or more,
intellectually stimulating

00:20:24.205 --> 00:20:26.416
than many of those other
higher paid careers.

00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:28.535
They go into something for compensation,

00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:30.076
and that's something where,

00:20:30.076 --> 00:20:32.003
at least definitely at
the K through 12 level,

00:20:32.003 --> 00:20:34.668
there isn't that compensation.

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:37.203
They also go into it for respect.

00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:39.935
The one example I give here is professors.

00:20:39.935 --> 00:20:43.337
There isn't any crisis about great minds

00:20:43.337 --> 00:20:46.666
going into academia, even though academia

00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:50.465
really has, the compensation academia

00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:52.534
even though it's just
as competitive to become

00:20:52.534 --> 00:20:53.989
a tenured professor at a great university,

00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:55.357
or actually more competitive to become

00:20:55.357 --> 00:20:56.589
a tenured professor at a university

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.810
than make partner at a prestigious bank

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.201
or hedge fund or private equity firm,

00:21:00.201 --> 00:21:02.667
you still have a lot of
people going into academia

00:21:02.667 --> 00:21:04.873
despite the lack of compensation.

00:21:04.873 --> 00:21:06.334
They make more than K through 12 teachers,

00:21:06.334 --> 00:21:09.670
but nowhere near what those
same people would make

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.071
if they went into industry.

00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.338
I think the reason why
really, really, really

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:14.906
smart people, and not
say that really, really

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.405
smart people aren't going to K through 12,

00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.471
but it's just their threshold of passion

00:21:18.471 --> 00:21:20.568
has to be so high that it
overcomes these other things;

00:21:20.568 --> 00:21:23.733
but the reason why you
have less of a problem

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:26.655
in the higher education
is I think you have

00:21:26.655 --> 00:21:29.783
a high degree of respect,
and actually I'll add

00:21:29.783 --> 00:21:34.018
independence at the
higher education level;

00:21:34.018 --> 00:21:35.193
that to some degree the reason why you

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.996
become a professor at
university is that obviously

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:39.465
you get a lot of intellectual stimulation,

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:41.059
but you get a ton of respect,

00:21:41.059 --> 00:21:42.726
and you get a lot of independence,

00:21:42.726 --> 00:21:45.257
especially once you get tenure.

00:21:45.257 --> 00:21:50.115
I think the solution
here is get compensation,

00:21:50.115 --> 00:21:51.315
compensation is important.

00:21:51.315 --> 00:21:53.054
Compensation has to go up.

00:21:53.054 --> 00:21:54.950
I think it has to at least get comparable

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.448
to university professors.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:22:01.209
This day and age, that's
definitely a lot higher

00:22:01.209 --> 00:22:02.918
than where teachers are paid right now,

00:22:02.918 --> 00:22:05.051
but they don't have to get to
investment banking salaries.

00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:07.118
I think even more importantly,
they have to be fields

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:09.610
where teachers can
express their creativity

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.671
and they're given much
more power and respect

00:22:14.671 --> 00:22:17.872
than, in a lot of cases,
they're given right now.

00:22:17.872 --> 00:22:19.345
Definitely even independence.

00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:21.203
I think this is a role that we have.

00:22:21.203 --> 00:22:23.946
Every iteration, every
time government officials

00:22:23.946 --> 00:22:25.445
panic about the education system,

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:26.733
they just micromanage it more.

00:22:26.733 --> 00:22:28.946
That might, in their minds,

00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.607
de-risk the worst that's going on,

00:22:30.607 --> 00:22:32.667
but it also handicaps
the best that's going on.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:37.693
It forces teachers to
lose their independence.

00:22:37.693 --> 00:22:41.006
We hope what we're advocating
is that it makes the teachers,

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:42.704
it gives them more independence to do

00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:44.047
what they want with class time

00:22:44.047 --> 00:22:49.253
because so much of the core stuff

00:22:49.253 --> 00:22:52.524
students can do through the Khan Academy.

00:22:52.524 --> 00:22:55.226
Then the last question, extra credit:

00:22:55.226 --> 00:22:58.329
What is the next big step for the Academy?

00:22:58.329 --> 00:22:59.392
I hinted at this several times.

00:22:59.392 --> 00:23:03.925
We are expanding the faculty,
so that is a really big thing.

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.383
Outside of that, we are just continuing

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:06.781
to layer on more features.

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:10.353
We're adding a lot more
content on the exercise side.

00:23:10.353 --> 00:23:13.483
I think you'll start to see,
in the next 6 months to a year,

00:23:13.483 --> 00:23:16.395
exercises that go beyond
our core math core.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.522
Our videos, obviously,
already go well beyond math,

00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:22.149
but you'll start seeing
exercises that go beyond that.

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:24.993
I think the next really big
one that's going to make waves

00:23:24.993 --> 00:23:29.310
is the faculty members that are not me.
