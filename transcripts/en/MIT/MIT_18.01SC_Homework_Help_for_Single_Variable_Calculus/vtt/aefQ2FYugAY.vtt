00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.350
Hi.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.940
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.980
In lecture you introduced
the idea of differentials

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.990
and learned how to compute them.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.530
So I have a couple examples
here for you to do.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.220
So compute the
differential d of 7

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.050
u to the ninth plus 34 minus
5 u to the minus third.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.480
And d of sine
theta cosine theta.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.862
So why don't you take a
minute, work those out

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.070
and we'll come back and
we'll work them out together.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.290
All right, welcome back.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.200
So hopefully you had
some luck with these.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.130
Let's go through them.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.737
So right, so a
differential is really,

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:52.180
it's just another
notation for something

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.310
you already know how to do.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.100
So it's another way of
keeping track of a derivative.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
The thing we don't write is
we don't write the over the d,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.220
the variable we're
differentiating

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.620
with respect to.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.210
So we pick that
up from what we're

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550
taking the differential of.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.700
So in this case, we
look at this expression.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.040
Let's do the first one first.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.063
So we look at d 7 u to the
ninth plus 34 minus 5 u

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:18.970
to the minus third.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.070
And we just can distribute
that d through in the same way

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.080
that we can with
ordinary derivatives.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.415
So OK, so this is
equal to 7 d of u

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:43.910
to the ninth plus d of 34 minus
5 d of u to the minus third.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.870
And now we just
do the chain rule.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.660
So here d of u to the ninth
is 9 u to the eighth du.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.840
So that du comes out of that
chain rule that we're doing.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.380
So this is equal to-- so
well, 7 and we drop the 9

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.380
down-- so that's 63 u
to the eighth du plus--

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.922
well OK, d of 34,
34 is a constant.

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:08.630
It just kills it.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.200
That's 0.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.530
Minus 5 d of u to
the minus third.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.070
So again, u to the minus third.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.750
That's just a power of u.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.450
We apply our usual rule for it.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.840
So it's minus 3 u
to the minus 4 du.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.240
du from the chain rule.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.500
Again, and so we have minus
5 times minus 3 is plus 15.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.570
Good, so I get to
keep my plus sign.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.430
Plus 15.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.577
What did I say? u
to the minus 4 du.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.980
And so that's all
there is to that.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.950
Now let's do the
second example here.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.960
We have sine theta cosine theta.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.380
So same exact idea.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.521
Here we have a product
rule as our first step.

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:55.145
So OK, so we take the derivative
of the first times the second.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.280
So the derivative-- the
differential of the first,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.170
I should say.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.140
Right?

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.814
So the product rule
for differentials

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:02.980
is just the same as the
product rule for derivatives

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.480
except instead of
taking derivatives

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.470
you take differentials.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:14.590
So the differential of sine
theta is cosine theta d theta.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.660
And then times the second.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.570
Plus the first, sine theta,
times the differential

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.970
of the second, which is
minus sine theta d theta.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.490
OK.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.340
And now if we like, we can, you
know, put this all together,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.840
factor out the d
theta to the end.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.830
And we can rewrite this
as cosine squared theta

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.744
minus sine squared
theta d theta.

00:03:45.744 --> 00:03:48.160
And of course you could rewrite
this a bunch of other ways

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.490
using your trig identities.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.430
Just like you could have started
by writing sine theta cosine

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.280
theta as 1/2 sine of 2*theta
before taking the differential.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.950
All right, so that's really
all there is to that.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.850
So there you go.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.940
Differentials.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.144
I'll end there.
