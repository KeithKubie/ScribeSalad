00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, I enabled reports.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.790
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.945
&gt;&gt; I just want to make one of these

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.300
charts though, make my Gauge, my Gauge Monitor.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
&gt;&gt;

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.964
[LAUGH]

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:09.440
Well, we're almost there.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, New Report. Now I'll search for attendees again.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.310
&gt;&gt; And there it is.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.190
&gt;&gt; Festivals with Attendees.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, Create. Alright, and this is again?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.560
&gt;&gt; It's a lot to look at, at first.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.700
So, think of a report at it's lowest common denominator.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.331
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.340
&gt;&gt; It's just like a spreadsheet.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.700
&gt;&gt; So down here in the little preview area.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.140
&gt;&gt; This is going to show you some of the records. Not all

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.100
of them. Like, right now it's showing festival

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740
name, attending names. It's not showing you all

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.420
of them. It's just doing a little preview

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.280
of what the report would look like now.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.690
&gt;&gt; So, on the left side bar, you

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.370
can drag all of those different fields, which are

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.670
fields on festival and attendee into your report, so

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.480
we can see summarized data about those two objects.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.870
&gt;&gt; So, what would dragging a field be? If I dragged in.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.880
&gt;&gt; Well, what's something we care about in our Gauge report?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.760
&gt;&gt; Money.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.570
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.710
&gt;&gt; Total Spent.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.640
&gt;&gt; So, grab that off of the Attendee object.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, and there's just a few places where I could drag it, does it matter?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.220
&gt;&gt; you could put it anywhere. And you could

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.580
keep dragging and dropping, reordering this as you go.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.920
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, I get it. So this is basically

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
a spreadsheet and I'm just choosing which columns to show.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.530
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So let's pick a couple other

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.470
fields like. What are a couple of other

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.650
fields that you might want to show in this

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.690
report? Like maybe they wouldn't necessarily come up

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.040
on the Dashboard or the graph that we're trying to show, but if you were to hand

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.780
off this report to an executive or a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.670
manager, what are things they would care about seeing?
