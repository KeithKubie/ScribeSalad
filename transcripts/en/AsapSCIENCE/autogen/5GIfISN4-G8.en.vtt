00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.170
 You put between 1 and 1.5 liters of urine a day, but most of us do not care 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.360
 For our liquid waste. So what can Polk say about you? 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.089
 Is it possible to be a general indicator of the health of the body? 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.320
 Before you urinate, the kidneys filter the dissolved waste into the water by absorbing it for the nutrients it needs 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 Keep sugar on the body, for example, and get rid of things that your body does not need as toxins. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.880
 Then the liquid flows to your place where it is stored until it finally runs 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.920
 Operation put forward 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.980
 If your urine is brown, this may mean that you are eating a lot of Rwandan herbs or beans or aloe plant 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.320
 And also possible to be a side effect of some drugs such as laxatives, muscle relaxants and antibiotics 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.840
 Or more seriously may indicate a defect in the liver or kidney disease. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.739
 If you see violet, it is likely to suffer from a rare genetic disease called porphyria. 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.110
 Porphyria causes a decrease in the enzymes that secrete hemat in your blood, 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.820
 Which is an essential part of red blood cells 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 Green Paul? It is possible to refer to a new drug or vitamin. Some pigments are green foods 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.640
 It can not be absorbed by your body so it is put in the urine, so green does not always mean 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 Be especially careful after St. Patrick's Day. 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 If your urine is blue, you may have hypercalcemia, a genetic disease 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.210
 Children get high blood calcium, also known as blue diaper syndrome. 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.950
 Some medications contain methyl blue, which can change urine color to blue or green 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.250
 If your urine is pink or red, it is possible to have blood in your urine. This is possible to return 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 For many cases such as enlarged prostate or bladder cancer and even chronic lead poisoning. 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.000
 But the red color can also be the result of different types of medicines or eat greasy colored foods 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.020
 Such as beetroot and blackberries. In fact Bituria is the term used 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 To indicate the pink urine after eating the beets 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.250
 If your urine is orange, this may indicate a large intake of foods 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 Which contain vitamin C or carotene as the islands. It is also possible to produce drugs 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.830
 Such as the pyridium, which is given to patients with urinary tract infections 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.530
 Which makes urine orange color 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.770
 Normally, the color of the urine should be yellow and the color of the urine is urubin 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 Which results from the disintegration of the hem "the main part of your blood" 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.280
 Depending on the amount of water in your body, it may be light or concentrated in the urublin. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.090
 Hazel color, this means that your blood re-absorbed a large amount of water 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.989
 To keep you moist, so now there is a high concentration of urublane in your urine 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.310
 Making polk acquire the honey color. You have to drink water now. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.849
 Dark yellow, this is normal but there is plenty of uruboline so you should drink water immediately. 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.650
 No color means you drank a large amount of water. It can also mean that you consumed the caffeine 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.750
 Or alcohol in your body, which leads to inhibition of the body's ability to re-absorb the fluid in the kidney 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 Which means you urinate a lot of water 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:54.099
 Transparent yellow means you are natural and hygienically wet.
