00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.010
- One important way that
teachers can enhance

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.720
a growth mindset is to
really help students

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.700
self-reflect on their own learning.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.150
So in the LearnStorm
activities we try to be

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.170
really intentional about
creating a lot of room

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.730
for students to engage in self-reflection.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.610
And one of our goals in doing that was to

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.010
really kind of help teachers create that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.350
really self-reflective environment

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.140
and really get the school
year started that way.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.790
And hopefully that's
something that can then be

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.700
carried forward for the
rest of the school year.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.840
It can be really easy to
learn a bunch of stuff

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.440
and not realize that you're learning it

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.946
in the absence of self-reflection.

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:37.300
And self-reflection can
really help us recognize

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.370
what we're doing, can help us connect it

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.750
to why we're doing it.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.560
It can really help us internalize
more deeply certain ideas.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.920
When teachers help students
reflect on their own learning,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.753
they can think about

00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:50.770
well, what are the goals
they have for their learning?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.172
And then as they're going through

00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:55.230
and accomplishing those goals,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.250
if students are self-reflecting on that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.400
and they're seeing
those goals as a part of

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.920
being on a growth trajectory,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.640
it'll help them get to
whether it's a good grade

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.090
or becoming a better writer,
or a better mathematician.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.180
That's ultimately more
motivating for students

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.490
and it really helps them
see, really see that they're

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.490
making progress on that trajectory,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.590
which is a lot more motivating

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.260
then just kind of taking
off things that don't

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.100
really seem to be that
related to each other.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.020
I think one particularly important kind of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.470
self-reflection is when
students hear teachers,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.110
or hear themselves, or hear their peers

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.410
self-reflect on the ways that

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.640
struggles have helped them improve.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.360
It can be a really good
reminder that struggles

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.879
aren't kind of the endpoint of something.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.820
A struggle doesn't mean
that you should give up

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760
and that you're not cut
out to do something,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.940
but to the contrary, if
we use the right kinds

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.773
of strategies and we persist

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.770
and maybe if we get help from others,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.990
we can overcome strategies

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.340
and become better learners
or better mathematicians

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.270
or better at whatever,
better skateboarders,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.073
better at whatever the task might be.
