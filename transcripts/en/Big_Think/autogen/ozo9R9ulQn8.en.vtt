00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.110
 
well it's this is certainly the worst

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
well it's this is certainly the worst
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.560
well it's this is certainly the worst
crisis since the Great Depression so far

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
crisis since the Great Depression so far
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.650
crisis since the Great Depression so far
now in everyone I in some sense wonders

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
now in everyone I in some sense wonders
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269
now in everyone I in some sense wonders
whether we are headed towards another

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
whether we are headed towards another
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.650
whether we are headed towards another
Great Depression and no one can answer

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
Great Depression and no one can answer
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.160
Great Depression and no one can answer
that question with certainty it is my

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170
that question with certainty it is my
 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.650
that question with certainty it is my
sense that we will that this this crisis

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
sense that we will that this this crisis
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259
sense that we will that this this crisis
will bottom out before we reach true

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
will bottom out before we reach true
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.500
will bottom out before we reach true
1930s level conditions because

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
1930s level conditions because
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.139
1930s level conditions because
governments are more sensitive to the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
governments are more sensitive to the
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.970
governments are more sensitive to the
risk of a Great Depression today than

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
risk of a Great Depression today than
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.700
risk of a Great Depression today than
they were in 1929 1930 and governments

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
they were in 1929 1930 and governments
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.080
they were in 1929 1930 and governments
are cooperating more effectively

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
are cooperating more effectively
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.479
are cooperating more effectively
effectively today than they did in the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
effectively today than they did in the
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.270
effectively today than they did in the
1920s and 1930s so I think that that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280
1920s and 1930s so I think that that
 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.880
1920s and 1930s so I think that that
this is we are unlikely to see or a Pete

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
this is we are unlikely to see or a Pete
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.130
this is we are unlikely to see or a Pete
of the Great Depression of the 1930s

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
of the Great Depression of the 1930s
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.930
of the Great Depression of the 1930s
nonetheless this is unquestionably the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
nonetheless this is unquestionably the
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.110
nonetheless this is unquestionably the
most serious economic downturn economic

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
most serious economic downturn economic
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.580
most serious economic downturn economic

happens in the longer run cannot with

any certainty before cast however I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
any certainty before cast however I
 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760
any certainty before cast however I
think that we can say with the great

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
think that we can say with the great
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950
think that we can say with the great
degree of certainty that this crisis

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
degree of certainty that this crisis
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.340
degree of certainty that this crisis
will last for fairly long time at least

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
will last for fairly long time at least
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.280
will last for fairly long time at least
a couple of years that it will

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
a couple of years that it will
 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.420
a couple of years that it will
inevitably involve a substantial series

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430
inevitably involve a substantial series
 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.160
inevitably involve a substantial series
of austerity measures on the part of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
of austerity measures on the part of
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560
of austerity measures on the part of
major governments that it will lead to a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
major governments that it will lead to a
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240
major governments that it will lead to a
reduction in the real living standards

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
reduction in the real living standards
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760
reduction in the real living standards
of many many millions and hundreds of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
of many many millions and hundreds of
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170
of many many millions and hundreds of
millions and billions of people around

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
millions and billions of people around
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.039
millions and billions of people around
the world that it will slow or even halt

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
the world that it will slow or even halt
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.200
the world that it will slow or even halt
and perhaps even reverse many of the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
and perhaps even reverse many of the
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730
and perhaps even reverse many of the
economic advantages that we have

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
economic advantages that we have
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800
economic advantages that we have
advances that we have seen over the past

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
advances that we have seen over the past
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.530
advances that we have seen over the past
15 or 20 years so this is a serious

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
15 or 20 years so this is a serious
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389
15 or 20 years so this is a serious
crisis this is going to set the world

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
crisis this is going to set the world
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.719
crisis this is going to set the world
back a decade or so and perhaps set the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
back a decade or so and perhaps set the
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370
back a decade or so and perhaps set the
United States back a decade or so as

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
United States back a decade or so as
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289
United States back a decade or so as
well we had made some very substantial

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
well we had made some very substantial
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.310
well we had made some very substantial
improvements in our macroeconomic

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
improvements in our macroeconomic
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.690
improvements in our macroeconomic
position in alleviating some of the the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
position in alleviating some of the the
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.130
position in alleviating some of the the
problems that we had had in the United

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
problems that we had had in the United
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080
problems that we had had in the United
States with income distribution in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
States with income distribution in
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840
States with income distribution in
reducing poverty in the US and much of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
reducing poverty in the US and much of
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.950
reducing poverty in the US and much of
that is going to be much of those

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960
that is going to be much of those
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.540
that is going to be much of those
advances are going to be called into

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
advances are going to be called into
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.479
advances are going to be called into
question by the current crisis and the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
question by the current crisis and the
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.190
question by the current crisis and the
attempts to deal with it in effect
