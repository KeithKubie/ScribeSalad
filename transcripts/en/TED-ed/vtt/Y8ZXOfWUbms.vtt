00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:11.477
In 1962, a cave explorer 
named Michel Siffre

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:17.266
started a series of experiments where
he isolated himself underground for months

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.405
without light or clocks.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:24.296
He attached himself to electrodes
that monitored his vital signs

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:28.225
and kept track of when he slept and ate.

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:30.165
When Siffre finally emerged,

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.645
the results of his pioneering experiments

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:37.575
revealed that his body had kept
to a regular sleeping-waking cycle.

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:40.654
Despite having no external cues,

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:42.035
he fell asleep,

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:42.975
woke up,

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:46.246
and ate at fixed intervals.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:52.385
This became known as a circadian rhythm
from the Latin for "about a day."

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:56.676
Scientists later found these rhythms
affect our hormone secretion,

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:58.563
how our bodies process food,

00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:01.807
and even the effects 
of drugs on our bodies.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:07.666
The field of sciences studying
these changes is called chronobiology.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:12.277
Being able to sense time helps us do
everything from waking and sleeping

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:17.906
to knowing precisely when to catch a ball
that's hurtling towards us.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:22.107
We owe all these abilities to 
an interconnected system of timekeepers

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:23.627
in our brains.

00:01:23.627 --> 00:01:28.117
It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch
telling us how many seconds elapsed,

00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:30.776
a clock counting the hours of the day,

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:34.148
and a calendar notifying us 
of the seasons.

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:37.457
Each one is located in 
a different brain region.

00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:41.917
Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied
on the most primitive clock

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:47.587
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN
of the hypothalamus.

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:52.875
Here's the basics of how we think it works
based on fruitfly and mouse studies.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:58.873
Proteins known as CLK, or clock,
accumulate in the SCN throughout the day.

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.657
In addition to activating genes
that tell us to stay awake,

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:05.294
they make another protein called PER.

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:07.174
When enough PER accumulates,

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:09.718
it deactivates the gene that makes CLK,

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:11.977
eventually making us fall asleep.

00:02:11.977 --> 00:02:17.256
Then, clock falls low, so PER 
concentrations also drop again,

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:19.158
allowing CLK to rise,

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:21.551
starting the cycle over.

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:23.335
There are other proteins involved,

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:28.318
but our day and night cycle may be driven
in part by this seesaw effect

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:32.169
between CLK by day and PER by night.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.561
For more precision,

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.697
our SCNs also rely 
on external cues

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:37.427
like light,

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:38.137
food,

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:38.861
noise,

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.027
and temperature.

00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:41.659
We called these zeitgebers,

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.268
German for "givers of time."

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:46.827
Siffre lacked many 
of these cues underground,

00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:50.848
but in normal life, they fine tune
our daily behavior.

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.378
For instance, as natural morning light
filters into our eyes,

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:56.209
it helps wake us up.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.083
Traveling through the optic nerve
to the SCN,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:02.398
it communicates what's happening
in the outside world.

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.668
The hypothalamus then halts
the production of melatonin,

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:07.859
a hormone that triggers sleep.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:08.978
At the same time,

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:11.639
it increases the production
of vasopressin

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.110
and noradrenaline throughout the brain,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.649
which help control our sleep cycles.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:17.989
At about 10 am,

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.060
the body's rising temperature drives up
our energy and alertness,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.620
and later in the afternoon,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.448
it also improves our muscle activity
and coordination.

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:30.799
Bright screens at night can confuse
these signals,

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.829
which is why binging on TV before bed
makes it harder to sleep.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.550
But sometimes we need to be
even more precise when telling the time,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.000
which is where the brain's internal 
stopwatch chimes in.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.087
One theory for how this works 
involves the fact

00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:49.069
that communication between a given
pair of neurons

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.581
always takes roughly the same
amount of time.

00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.080
So neurons in our cortex 
and other brain areas

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.469
may communicate in scheduled,
predictable loops

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:04.670
that the cortex uses to judge
with precision how much time has passed.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.321
That creates our perception of time.

00:04:07.321 --> 00:04:11.882
In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating
additional discovery about this.

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:16.312
Every day, he challenged himself 
to count up to 120

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:19.511
at the rate of one digit per second.

00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:25.439
Over time, instead of taking two minutes,
it began taking him as long as five.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:30.658
Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped
Siffre's own perception of time

00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:34.421
despite his brain's best efforts
to keep him on track.

00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.332
This makes us wonder what else influences
our sense of time.

00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:41.482
And if time isn't objective, 
what does that mean?

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:44.421
Could each of us 
be experiencing it differently?

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:46.551
Only time will tell.
