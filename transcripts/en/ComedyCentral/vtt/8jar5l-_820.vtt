00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.466
When I was a kid, my mother
had a bar near the city.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.868
I was a little kid,
and I'd see cops come in

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:24.070
to take their weekly bribes.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.972
It was a patrol guy--
a beat guy

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.540
in a suit that would
always come in.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.541
Chino, nice guy.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.809
I would always talk to him,

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.377
always get a drink
and be very polite.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:33.579
My mother would just slip
him an envelop on the bar.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.748
Then there was a detective that
would come in once a week.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.817
He'd have a drink,
bust my mother's balls

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.084
about Cuban food, you know.

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.619
But they--
nice guys, you know?

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.088
And I asked my mom one day,

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.956
"Well, what do you pay these
fucking humps for?"

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:45.825
And she said, "Because when they
break my window,

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.626
we have a stabbing here, they
come here first

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:49.128
and they cover it up."

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.963
That's how--it's the
cost of doing business,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.164
so I, you know--
I didn't know--

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.666
They weren't dirty cops.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.669
These guys were family guys.
They were great guys.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.071
This went on--when I was
about 12, I went into the bar

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:01.173
one afternoon after school
and there was this fucking

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:03.409
long-haired, dirty
looking motherfucker,

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.144
you know,
yelling at my mother.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:09.148
And he was an undercover
cop and he was a Cuban guy.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.150
And I cold hear him talking
to my mom in Spanish

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.185
with another Cuban guy, like,
"We want fucking money

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:15.188
every week," you know, "We'll
come back in the week.

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:16.589
"We better get
our fucking money.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.824
We're gonna put all you
fucking Cubans in jail."

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:20.526
And about a week later,
I was there again

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.162
and this douche bag comes in
again, he's talking to my mom.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.297
But my mom, the whole time,
is smiling.

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:27.033
Let me tell you
motherfuckers something.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:30.469
Pre-revolution Cuba,
before 1959--

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:31.871
those motherfuckers
are tough.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.372
Tough!

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.975
Man, Batista made Fidel
look like a daycare center.

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:38.444
Batista didn't
fuck around.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.381
Those Cubans are fucking tough.
My mother was tough.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.716
And my mother would go off
on you, but this day,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.717
she was just smiling.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.486
[soft laughter]

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.054
But I could tell
it bothered my mom.

00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:50.556
These Cubans in Union City,
they have--

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.658
that was the second-biggest
Cuban community,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:53.859
so we had a bunch of bars.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.062
We had a [speaking Spanish].

00:04:56.062 --> 00:04:57.396
We had Club 38.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.232
This is--listen to this,
this is straight up.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:01.166
Club 38,
his name was Willy Vandi.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.236
This guy was the grandson to the
guy in "Godfather II"

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:06.172
that they took the senator
to see in Cuba.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.907
They had the chick
tied up and the guy

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:08.975
had a big dick, remember?

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.643
With a mask and a top hat?

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:14.013
This was his grandson and
he had a big dick, too.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:15.581
I swear to God.
I was, like, 12.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.650
I went over there with my dad
one night, I saw his dick,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.586
I got all dizzy and shit.
It was fucking huge.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.189
He had this immigrant chick
tied up, and he would just

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.024
smack her with
the dick and shit.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.926
A little black Cuban
dude with a top hat,

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.428
fucking playing the conga.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:30.029
It was fucking
tremendous, right?

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.664
I'm like, "Holy shit!"

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.933
That guy's dick was fucking
big and he was white.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:35.735
It was to the fucking floor,
this guy.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.002
It looked like a
fucking tail.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:41.607
This was amazing.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.242
[laughs]

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.777
So.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.246
These fucking Cubans--one day,
I get to my mother's bar

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:48.948
and all these Cubans
are in there talking.

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.749
Like, this fucking
Cuban guy got to go.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:52.451
This guy's got to go, right?

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.620
And I'm making believe like
I don't hear shit, you know.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.289
These Cubans were
selling a little bit of

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.623
drugs, they were booking.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.424
So this guy wanted
their action, you know.

00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:01.794
They already paid a vig and
these guys wanted their action.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.295
So one night, my mom--

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:05.264
There was this Puerto Rican
family on 26th Street

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.632
that I used to
shoot hoops with.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:07.900
Their mom was a little

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.435
straight-laced
Puerto Rican chick.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.304
Didn't drink, did do--
didn't even curse.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.406
But once a month,
she passed this fucking spirit.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.808
Like, a dead African fucking
maid or something, right?

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.476
Oh, it was tremendous.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:20.046
It was like the "Walking Dead,"
and she'd fucking drink a

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.948
bottle of 151 and spit
it out and blow it on

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:25.417
candles and shit and
fires and shit.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.153
When you're a kid,
that shit's tremendous.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.955
You're giggling and shit.

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:30.389
"This bitch ain't
dead, right?"

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.825
So...

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.227
So this chick's in her fucking
trance, and I'm giggling

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:37.830
with her kids, and she looks at
my mom and she comes over

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.500
to my mom and she goes,
"What's going on with you?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.169
Somebody's giving
you a hard time."

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.970
And she turns around,
she gets a white dish,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.307
and she gets a fucking candle,
and she goes like this

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.143
under the fucking dish.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.177
Then she throws the candle,
that blows up like a

00:06:52.177 --> 00:06:54.279
fucking magic trick and shit.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.082
She turns the dish around...

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.816
It was like an image,
like the ones that are

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.118
on tortilla, you know?

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:01.320
When fucking Jesus
shows up in Mexico.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.955
But it was on a plate,
and it was like an image.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:05.191
And she goes, "Is this the guy
that's bothering you?"

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.026
Out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere!

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:10.362
I shit my fucking pants.
I'm like...

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:13.265
She takes the fucking
dish and breaks it.

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.202
And says, "Seven days."
[speaking Spanish]

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.203
On the way home, I'm like,
"That bitch got a

00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:20.773
big spread to cover."

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.808
[laughs]

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:25.277
Holy shit!

00:07:25.277 --> 00:07:26.845
I don't say nothing.
I don't say nothing.

00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:28.547
I wasn't allowed to
talk about that shit

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.117
with my little fucking
Italian friends or nothing.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.718
So about a week later,
I go to grammar school.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.053
I get in there and--I was going
to school in North Bergen,

00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:36.722
which is a complete
different jurisdiction.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:38.357
And I see the teachers
talking about--

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:39.725
I hear them talking
about bullets.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.493
But, you know,
somebody's body language?

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:43.062
You knew something happened.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.231
I go to class, I get out of
class, I get on my bicycle,

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.665
I ride up to my mom's bar.

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:48.534
The fucking Cubans are
in there doing blasts.

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:51.236
These are when Cubans did real
coke out of aluminum foil.

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:52.871
Fuck the grinder.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:56.242
They would just put fucking
rocks in their nose and shit.

00:07:56.242 --> 00:08:00.546
I'd have to tell my mom,
"Ma, wipe your nose!"

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.517
They're all up there,
fucking celebrating,

00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:07.220
clinking glass--
I go, "What happened?"

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.354
They go, "That fucking cop
got killed last night."

00:08:09.354 --> 00:08:11.356
It was this taxicab company.
They sold coke.

00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:13.492
Rapido Taxi.
They were Cubans.

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.695
<i> Rápido</i>means "quick,"
you know what I'm saying?

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.229
And they never had
no customers,

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:19.765
they just flew around
the fucking town.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:22.201
So he went down there to make a
collection, like, midnight,

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:23.502
and they got him
and his partner.

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.237
He shot the fuck out of
that motherfucker.

00:08:25.237 --> 00:08:26.772
Shot him!

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.940
And the partner's still alive.
He got stuck in the car.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.610
He says he couldn't get out,
but they got him with buckshot.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.113
So the fucking guy, they chopped
him in half with the bullets.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:35.848
I fucking got on my bicycle,
I went up--

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.215
this was before "CSI."

00:08:37.215 --> 00:08:38.951
There was a brick
wall just fucking

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.286
blown apart with bullets.

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:42.054
The shell casings
were everywhere.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:43.622
They fucked this
motherfucker up.

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:45.457
And I was like,
"I got to pay attention to that

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:47.959
"motherfucking
lady more often.

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:51.631
'Cause that bitch got
magic powers, jack."

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.300
I forget about this story,
I move on with my life.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.535
A thousand things happen.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:57.970
I go to jail,
I come out.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.305
I got to apply for a fucking job
with a Honda dealership

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:02.474
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.410
They go, "A couple of people
got to interview you,

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.978
but one of them is Cuban."

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.146
And, you know, "He's gonna come
in a little while."

00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:09.649
He comes in,
we start talking.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.483
I go, "So where you from,
Miami or Union City?"

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:13.652
He goes, "We used to be from
Union City, but my dad was a cop

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.888
and he got shot
there 20 years ago."

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:17.556
And all of a sudden I
got dizzy, like I saw

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:19.625
Willy's dick all over again.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.227
[laughs]

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.628
Well, I got the
fuck out of there.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.296
I ain't working with
this kiss of death.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:25.498
And that's the story.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.832
Thank you very much, guys.
