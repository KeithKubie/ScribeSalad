00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.245
- [Voiceover] Calculate the pH

00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:04.370
at the half-equivalence point.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.868
So, let's just remind ourselves

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:09.246
what the half-equivalence point even is.

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:12.845
The equivalence point is when the titrant,

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.079
in this case the hydrochloric acid,

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.302
completely reacts with
the potassium sorbate,

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:20.213
the thing that we are titrating.

00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:22.315
Now the half-equivalence
point is the point

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.463
at which half of the potassium sorbate

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:27.284
has been converted to the sorbic acid.

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:28.867
Or another way of thinking about it is,

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.278
the concentrations of
the potassium sorbate

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.797
and the sorbic acid are equivalent.

00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:36.119
Well, how do we relate that to pH,

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.721
and what other information
have they given us

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:39.498
to actually solve this?

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:42.180
And a good thing to do whenever you are,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.648
if you feel a little bit stuck here, say,

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:46.266
"Well, what other information
have they given us?"

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.923
Well, they gave us the K-a of sorbic acid

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:52.884
is being 1.7 times ten
to the negative fifth.

00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:56.771
So somehow, can we connect
the K-a of sorbic acid

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:00.187
to the pH at the half-equivalence point?

00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:01.185
Well the other thing that they give you,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:03.008
is they give you a whole
series of formulas.

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:04.912
In fact, they give you all the formulas

00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:07.559
that I'm using here in
the first couple of pages

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:09.753
of the free-response section,

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:11.518
and even a whole bunch of formulas

00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:15.814
on equilibria and all of these
different notations they use.

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:19.239
And the one that might show
up that looks interesting

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.572
is this one right over here
that you might recognize

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:24.881
as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.530
And it's actually not hard to prove it.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.667
It comes straight out of the definition

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.140
of K-a, and then rearranging things,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.265
and then taking the negative log

00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:33.786
of both sides and doing things like that.

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:34.947
I encourage you to watch those videos

00:01:34.947 --> 00:01:37.071
on Khan Academy if you are curious,

00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:40.392
but what's neat here is it connects pH,

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:45.318
it connects pH, it connects pH, to p-K-a,

00:01:45.318 --> 00:01:49.827
and the concentrations of an acid

00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:52.536
and its conjugate base.

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:55.520
So how do we make a relationship here?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.353
Well, at the half-equivalence point,

00:01:58.353 --> 00:01:59.978
the acid in the conjugate base are gonna,

00:01:59.978 --> 00:02:02.671
their concentrations are
going to be equivalent.

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.538
So this, and this are going to cancel out.

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:07.942
You're just gonna get one.

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:10.926
And log of one is just going to be zero.

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:14.429
So, at the half-equivalence
point, the pH is going

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.240
to be equal to the p-K-a.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.516
And so what is the p-K-a here?

00:02:20.516 --> 00:02:22.559
Well, they told us that the K-a,

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.507
the K-a is equal to,

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:29.885
and this is the K-a of sorbic acid,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:32.428
K-a of sorbic acid is 1.7 times ten

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:34.854
to the negative fifth.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.430
1.7 times ten to the negative fifth.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.970
1.7 times ten to the negative fifth.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.386
And once again, when
we're thinking about K-a

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:47.091
we're thinking about the
dissociation constant

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.689
for the acid, and so that's
why we used sorbic acid there.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.570
And, either way, these two
concentrations are going

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.626
to be the same.

00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:56.337
And if I want to find the p-K-a,

00:02:56.337 --> 00:02:59.351
I take the negative log of...

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.988
I take the negative log of this.

00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:04.887
So, p-K-a, which is equal

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:08.349
to the negative log, base ten, of the K-a.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:09.475
And they actually give
you all these formulas

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.449
on the first page.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.746
This is going to be equal
to the negative log,

00:03:14.746 --> 00:03:18.864
base ten, of 1.7 times ten

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.834
to the negative fifth power.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.628
And what is that going to be?

00:03:23.628 --> 00:03:25.319
Let me get a calculator out.

00:03:26.374 --> 00:03:27.669
So...

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:33.473
So let's see, I'll write 1.7...

00:03:33.473 --> 00:03:37.235
These two capital Es,
that's times ten to the...

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:40.787
So, times ten to the, not the fifth,

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.471
the negative fifth power.

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:44.294
Now I want to take log, base ten,

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:45.153
that's this button here.

00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:47.526
If you're calculator just has a log button

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.193
that defaults to base ten.

00:03:49.193 --> 00:03:51.027
So I take log, base ten, of that.

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:53.489
And then I want to take
the negative of that.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.471
And so this is going to
be, approximately, 4.77.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.736
So, this is approximately,

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:06.346
approximately, 4.77

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.776
So, the pH is equal to the p-K-a

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:14.083
which is equal to that, right over there.
