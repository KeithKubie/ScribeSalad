00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.310
PROFESSOR: For these
heritage learners--

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.600
I'd say 99% of
them, the students,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.950
the heritage learners in this
course-- they started unevenly.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.230
So it's really hard to
assess how much progress.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.590
I can only say progress,
because I have a goal in my mind

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.250
what do they need to reach
at the end of the course.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.940
But how do I assess their
progress is a problem,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.090
because some will start really
higher level than others.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.890
So easier for me to see the
progress in the lower level

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.390
students.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.090
Harder for me to see
the higher level.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.210
So for me, the way I assess
is-- because I do have

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.840
a lot of writing assignments.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.500
So I would see how much--
within an assignment,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.260
how many new vocabulary
they're willing to use.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.940
Because as I said, they like
to stay in their comfort zone.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.740
They like to use
simple language.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.320
They know it's correct.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.220
They don't want to venture
out, because they're

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.040
afraid to make mistakes.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.580
So my assessment usually
is how sophisticated

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.890
they can be when they're
doing the writing.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.970
Because we have a set of
vocabulary for each lesson,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.240
and they're supposed to use it.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.450
And for me, because
they're assumed at a stage

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.760
they're still trying to
memorize all the characters,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.010
trying to write
a basic sentence.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.850
So the composition, I don't
ask too much of the structure.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.230
As long as they can
write a sentence down,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.750
the basic grammar's
correct, that's fine.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.230
But the vocabulary they can use.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.200
So and these vocabulary
sometimes in the course,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.100
I would spend some
time to explain.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.730
I don't teach them how
to read this vocabulary,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.900
but I do correct
their pronunciation.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
I do tell them how to
use this vocabulary.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.110
Because some vocabulary,
they give you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.470
the English definition,
but actually it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.540
doesn't use that way
in Chinese at all.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.450
Yes, this is what it means, but
you don't use the same context

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.670
in Chinese.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.740
I would teach them
the differences.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.040
That's what I talk about.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.020
And I will some
students really want

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.430
to expand their vocabulary.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.390
Then I will know he's trying.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.110
That's how I assess
the progress.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.350
We do have a lot of quizzes.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.870
We do have a lot of tests.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.140
We do have a lot of speaking.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.410
We do a lot of individual
reports and group

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.780
projects in the classroom.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.530
So all these I look
at holistically.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.880
Yeah, yeah, I'm still thinking
about a more effective way

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.890
to assess them.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.810
Especially I want the student
to do the self-assessment.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.270
That's important.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.260
They called it-- what's
that word-- anyway,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.960
making a portfolio for
yourself, what you can do,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.270
what you cannot do.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.260
That kind of thing.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.590
I started giving
them questionnaires,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.770
but I want to develop more.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.040
And to the last time
I did it, what can

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100
I do now, what I know now.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.550
Those are good, but
that's still very vague.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.010
You have to ask the
right questions.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.000
Sometimes it's all about
asking the right question.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.490
Because some questions, they
can answer really vaguely.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.240
Yes, I know, but how much
you really know, right?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.390
So that's a big topic.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.160
I'm still working on that.
