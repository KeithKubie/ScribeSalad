00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.950
 Every day, the human race produces about 70 billion fart - it means almost 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.000
 10 of these decrees were issued from you! But why do not the gases from you look so bad? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.790
 Why do we feel the smell of our feet? 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.100
 As it seems funny, scientists have proved this information. In tests of blind smell, 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 We really smell the aroma of our fart more than others. Simply, 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.060
 Whenever something is familiar to you, as you associate with a song, a picture or even an odor, 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.550
 The more likely you prefer it. And because the bacteria that live in your body are released 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.079
 These odors are unique and vary according to individuals. Our fart is really a unique sign 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.769
 Our enemies can separate them. 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:41.969
 But from an evolutionary perspective, we reacted to the imperatives of others 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.600
 Is probably the way our brain protects us from causing harm to our bodies ... precisely 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.760
 Dealing with disease sources. When you think about it, most things are 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.859
 Do not like her smell, not good for you. The higher the risk of disease, the stronger our reaction 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.059
 Towards the smell. 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.449
 It is as surprising as it seems, the ram is spreading diseases. In fact, there are several reports states that 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.789
 Dirt helps in the diffusion of nodal lump, a pathogen that causes inflammation of the tonsils, scarlet fever, 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.130
 Heart disease and even diseases that eat the skin. Realistically, this nurse comes out 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.030
 Stools or particles of stool in the air. Of course, this was a troubling reason 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.229
 Our ancestors who were running naked. But for us, who wear underwear, do not dart 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.570
 Causing real damage. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.960
 It is important to us that we adapt ourselves to our smells so that we can take care of ourselves 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.530
 Clean up. In the same way, mothers see that their children's feces are less 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.520
 So that they can take care of their children without disgust. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.320
 Some of you are probably thinking: "I do not dislike the dart at all" - and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.829
 you are not alone. To depict the disgusting mixture of variables such as age, sex, 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.329
 Culture and even personality. Socially anxious and socially motivated individuals 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.689
 More sensitive than the pungent smells of their adventure-loving colleagues. 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.520
 The front fascial cortex, responsible for the snap process, also has a significant role. When we bend 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.249
 We know that and expect the accompanying odor. A tune when someone whispers a silent fart 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.060
 With a deadly smell in a room full of imaginations, the minds of the truth shatter because of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.840
 The negative stimulus, causing all this to seem more hateful. So, next time you will be hurt by a silent fart, 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.330
 Tell everyone in advance. Unless you are 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.260
 Lonely; to enjoy your hurdles alone. 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.690

 We discuss the benefits of raising or shaving the beard completely. To raise beards 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.450
 or not? They went there with the help of the link in the details, and told us which 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.390
 This is the winner!
