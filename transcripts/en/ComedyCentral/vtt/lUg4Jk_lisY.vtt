00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.505
- Here we go, Gary, I'm
sending you over sides

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.107
for an audition,
it's a big role.

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:11.444
It's a Sundance type Indie
film, shooting in four weeks.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.013
- Oh my God, yes,
yes, this is it!

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.115
- Okay the only thing is you
have to do a British accent,

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.717
can you do that or?

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:23.122
- I think I can bloody do it!

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.191
- Okay great, sending
you over the sides now.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.392
Talk to you later.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:27.226
- Amazing, I love
you so much Amy!

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:28.695
This is it, this is it!

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.531
Oh my God, where's the
Julie, where's the Julie?

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:36.202
(heavy bass, hip hop music)

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:47.047
You sit here, after mum
died in front of you.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:53.920
You sit here like a piece of
shit from the fucking gutter.

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:59.292 align:start size:88% position:13%
Mum loved you, she
treated you like a son,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
which you most
certainly were not.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:08.101
So I'll say this to you
once, and only once,

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.136
before you rot in prison.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.074
You go to bloody fucking hell!

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:19.145
How was it?

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.081 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wow, that's the 47th
time I've seen it,

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.583
it keeps getting better.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.519
Dude, Daniel Day Lewis
could suck your dick.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.455
- Yeah, man, I really feel
like this is my Oscar moment.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:30.957
You know what I mean?

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.292
If I get nominated, I'm
going to thank you first,

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.927
obviously, Amy, then
everybody in Iowa,

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:37.630
then Leo and Streep,
you know what I mean?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.865 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're gonna be
like who is this guy,

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:39.799
we gotta work with him
and Spielberg's like,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.500
I got it, I'll direct it.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.772
- The Academy Awards, I'm
gonna be so high on Molly.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.941
I'm gonna make out
with Morgan Freeman.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.443
- He will not like that.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.947
- Ah, then Michael Kane, yeah.

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.119
(hip hop music)

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.859
- I just want to
say thanks, man.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start size:94% position:6%
You were there from day
one, part of this journey,

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.898
into a realm where I don't
know where I'm even going.

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.734
- Okay don't go full
Gandalph on me yet,

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:15.735
save it for the room.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.570
- You're a true Julie.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.673 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Got a lot of
competition in here.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:24.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
- These guys are a
bunch of dirty lollies.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:29.582
Ah, Gregorn, man, knack it out,

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.687
what time was your flight?

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.055
- What's that?

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.857
- From London, I just
flew in, I'm so tired.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.926
Had a couple pints on the
plane but I'll be alright.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:43.662
- Oh, welcome, I'm from LA.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.198
- Man this project,
right, you read it?

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.533
Fire, pure fire!

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.869
Everyone's prattlin about
in the museums in London,

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:52.238 align:start size:84% position:16%
just prattling away
on the streets.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:55.108
You know it was at the
pub's prattling away,

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.208
it's gonna be good.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.444
- Really, such a small movie?

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:02.615 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Small movie, small
attitude, that's what that is.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.424
- So this is Gary
Scalzo, Hi Gary.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.925
- Hey.

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.561
- We got so lucky today, we
have our director here so.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.231 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What, I didn't know
he was going to be here.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:21.534 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Just came from a Tarantino
set this morning so.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.537 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Tarantino, yeah
that guy's sick man.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.140 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, we're old
friends, collaborators.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.210 align:start size:94% position:6%
He'll definitely see this
so it's good for you.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.879
- He's gonna see it?

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:35.248
Great.

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.585
- So do you have any questions?

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:39.886
- About what?

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.087
Questions?

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.423
- About the script?

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:44.924
- No, should I have?

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.292
I didn't prepare questions,
I didn't know you'd be here

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.993
so it's like, you
know, I didn't,

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.262
questions for Tarantino?

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.963
- No just wanted to know
if you had any thoughts

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.231
about the character, you know.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.232
- You don't have to.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.768
- Quentin punched the script up.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:59.171
- I thought the script was
funny, it made me laugh.

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:01.674
- Which part made you laugh?

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:05.778 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The part with the cat
when he jumps on the table.

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:08.514
- The cat jumps out the window.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.649
- The cat commits suicide.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.150
- Yeah the cat dies.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah and then the son
finds the mother's dead body.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.755
- Yeah the cat jumps over
the mother's dead body

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.691
and I just thought it was funny.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.660
I grew up with cats.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.095
- Well let's get started.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.696
- Yeah, yeah.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.298
- Whenever you're ready.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.366
- Okay, cool.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.338
What are you doing
here mate at the pub?

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:34.473
Why are you here?

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.276
You know, mom's dead.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:39.545
- You know, let's do
the British accent.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.315
- Oh yeah, right,
yeah of course.

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.152
- Hello!

00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.791
Was that too big?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.693
Let me do it again, let me try,
let me try it one more time.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.361
Let me try it again.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.331
(clears throat)

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.365
Hello poppet!

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:05.538 align:start size:94% position:6%
Are you nervous about
going down to the barbie?

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:06.839
- Okay, we're good.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.673
- Yes.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:08.574
- Yeah.

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.010
- No you go to bloody hell.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.845
You go to bloody hell.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.882
- Very interesting take, Gary,
very interesting, thank you.

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:17.850
- Thank you.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.017
- You go to bloody hell.

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.586
- I thought we had our last one.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.354
- Hey, how'd it go mate?

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:23.555
- Did you sign in?

00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.023
- Oh no, I'm just with Gary.

00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:26.558
- Well you have the accent down,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:28.861
there's nobody left, wanna try?

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.031
- Uh, no, I'm good, I think
actors are fucking stupid.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.332
Oh, except for Gary.

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I do like that
attitude, come on in.

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.370
You have a good look.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.371
- I thought we were
gonna get cereal.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:41.574
- Oh yeah, after, after.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.076
She's hot.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.712
(hip hop beat)

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.784
- Ello, ello.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.522
Fuck.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.058
Bloody shit.

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:05.865 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hahahaha y'all a
bunch of bloody wankers,

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:09.201 align:start size:94% position:6%
the whole lot of ya, fuck
you this movie sucks.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.737
- Fuck Eric, that was great,
we're gonna follow up with Amy.

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:13.239
- Ciao, muah muah.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.277
- Dude, Amy's not your manager.

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:22.582
- Whatever dude, who cares,
let's go get some cereal.

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.251
(hip hop music)

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:33.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So they said you were a
tad green and a little tight

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.726
and a bit loud.

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:36.161
- But he was nailing it at home.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.331
- Yeah, Rick saw it, I
had it down dude, right?

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.165 align:start size:88% position:13%
Yeah, but the only
thing that threw me was,

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.900 align:start size:94% position:6%
I didn't know the director
was gonna be there,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.269 align:start size:84% position:16%
he just surprised
me, you know, I mean,

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.738 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's not cool, I
mean, I was thrown off.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.106
- Okay, well you're gonna
have to get used to that

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:48.474
if you want to book a job.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.410
- But Rick, they were
very intrigued by you.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.111
Okay, I know you don't
want to be an actor,

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:54.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I've gotten
such great feedback.

00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:57.616
Everyone, the casting,
producers, director,

00:06:57.616 --> 00:06:59.618
the photographer Todd.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.820
I'd like to submit
you for auditions.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.157 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay, as long as it works
around my video game schedule.

00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:06.158
And weed.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:07.460
- We can do that.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.428
- And coke, let's
not leave that out.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.863
- Sometimes.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And Molly and meth, I mean,
there's a myriad of drugs

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.801
that Rick does.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:17.302 align:start size:94% position:6%
But also do you think
that there's room for him

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:19.204 align:start size:94% position:6%
on our client list because
we're all going out,

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.340
you know, we're doing our
thing kind of in a groove.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.676 align:start size:94% position:6%
Does Rick, I hope he
does, but does he fit in?

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:25.478
- No, it's fine,
I can make space.

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.513 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And you're not gonna go
in for the same stuff, okay?

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.449
He'll be the leading man.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.384 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Right and I'm like a
second leading man, right?

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:34.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Weird friend,
awkward guy at the bar.

00:07:34.886 --> 00:07:37.656
- Oh, hey if I book something
I can pay for my own cereal.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:38.857
- Oh that's true.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:41.060
- Oh, dude let me
post this shit.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.894
- What?

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.796
(camera click)

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.700
(heavy bass music)
