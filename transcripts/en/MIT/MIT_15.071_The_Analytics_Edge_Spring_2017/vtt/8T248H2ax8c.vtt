00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.630
In the previous video, we saw
that the mandible, or jawbone,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.880
received the highest dose out of
all of the critical structures.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.690
The mean mandible
dose was 11.3 gray.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.040
So how can we reduce this?

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.970
One approach is to modify
our objective function.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.760
Our current objective
is to minimize

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.730
the sum of the total dose
to each critical structure.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.430
So we're minimizing the sum of
the total dose to the brain,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.990
plus the total dose
to the brain stem,

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.040
plus a total dose
to the spinal cord,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.740
plus the total dose
to the parotid glands,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.570
plus the total dose
to the mandible.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.000
We could instead
change our objective

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.650
to make the total dose to
the mandible more important.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.610
This can be done by weighting
the term for the mandible.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.720
By giving the mandible
dose a weight of 10,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.570
the total dose to the mandible
becomes 10 times more important

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.970
in our objective
than the total dose

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.640
to the other
critical structures.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.740
If we solve our problem
with this new objective,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.650
we get the solution
shown in this figure.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.730
The dose to the tumor, shown as
the red line, does not change.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.410
It still stays within the
constraints we've defined.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.630
For each of the
critical structures,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.760
the solution with the
previous objective

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.860
is shown as a dotted
line, and the new solution

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.330
with the weighted objective
is shown as a solid line.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.940
We can see that the dose to
the mandible, shown in blue,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.220
has significantly
decreased by adding

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130
a weight in the objective.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.890
However, the dose to
other critical structures

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.920
has increased, especially to the
parotid glands, shown in black,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.660
and to the spinal
cord, shown in green.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.820
This shows how you can
modify the objective

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.120
to capture different trade-offs
that might be desirable

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.240
to different decision-makers
or for different patients.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.290
Another way to
explore trade-offs

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.530
is to modify the constraints.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.090
For example, by relaxing
the mandible maximum dose

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.970
constraint or by allowing the
maximum dose to the mandible

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.760
to be higher, we may improve
our total healthy tissue dose.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.750
We would like to know how
much the objective changes

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.640
for different constraints.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.930
This can be answered by
looking at the shadow

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.320
prices of the constraints.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.310
Recall that we have a constraint
limiting the total dose

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.990
for each voxel in each
critical structure.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.730
This table shows the highest
shadow price for any one voxel

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.150
in each critical structure.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.940
The parotid glands and the brain
stem have shadow prices of 0.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.010
This means that we're not
even giving the maximum amount

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.650
of radiation allowed
to these structures,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.450
so modifying the constraints
is not beneficial.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.020
The spinal cord has a
shadow price of 96.911.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.140
This means that by
increasing the radiation

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.470
to one voxel of the
spinal cord by one unit,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.710
we can decrease
the total radiation

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.410
to other critical
structures by 96.9 units.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.400
The mandible has the highest
shadow price of 7,399.72.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.520
So if a slight increase in the
mandible dose to a single voxel

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.210
is acceptable, the total healthy
tissue dose can be reduced.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.640
Keep in mind that this
is the total reduction

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.180
across all voxels
in the objective.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.620
We've seen in this video that by
modifying the formulation, both

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.610
the objective and
the constraints,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.690
we can explore different
trade-offs in our problem.
