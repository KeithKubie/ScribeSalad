MANDY WAITE: How popular is
Google App Engine for Java?

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.958
Most examples seem
to be written for

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.366
Google App Engine Python.

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.620
FRED SAUER: I hope that's
not the case as far

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.020
as the sample mismatch.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.320
It is true that we launched
App Engine Python a year

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.480
before the Java runtime.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.820
So in 2008, it was Python, and
then in 2009, we added the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.730
Java runtime, and later,
we added Go.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.700
So there may be just a little
bit of bias still left in the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.740
system because we originally set
out to just have a Python.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.210
But I think things are
fairly evened out.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
If you go to the Google Cloud
Platform User on GitHub,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.900
there's many samples there.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.390
There's Java and Python samples,
documentation.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.890
There should be samples
in both languages.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.740
I don't recall the exact
popularity, but I thought it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.830
was fairly even.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.790
It may be a 60/40 split or
something like that, with some

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.280
percentage going to Go.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.910
You shouldn't feel like Java
is an under-appreciated

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.030
language on App Engine.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.720
It's definitely not the case.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.870
And if you look at the talks
at I/O, you'll then see our

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.100
focus on Java users and making
sure they have just as good an

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.217
experience as Python.

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:19.410
MANDY WAITE: OK, that's
excellent.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.550
FRED SAUER: So pick the language
that's good for you.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.150
MANDY WAITE: Yeah, definitely.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.400
Yeah, absolutely.
