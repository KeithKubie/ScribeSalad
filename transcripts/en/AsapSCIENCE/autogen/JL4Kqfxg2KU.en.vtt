00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.800
 70 years ago, nuclear bombs exploded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.420
 Therefore, it has become the only nuclear weapon used to actual combat. 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.830
 But there are 15,000 nuclear warheads in the world. 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:19.350
 What happens if a nuclear war occurs? The influence of a nuclear bomb is determined by many factors, such as: weather, weapon design. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.800
 The geographical environment in which the nuclear bomb hits, and the nuclear bomb is in the air, on the surface or underground. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760
 About 35% of the energy comes from heat radiation or heat 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 Thermal radiation will advance at the speed of matt 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.580
 Within a few seconds before the explosion, light and heat will appear, and anyone who watches the explosion at this time 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 There will be flash blindness (flash Blindness), a temporary blindness of up to a few minutes. A million-ton nuclear bomb (80 times that of Hiroshima Atomic Bomb) 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.169
 But this is much smaller than most modern nuclear bombs. It can cause blindness to people 21 kilometers away on a clear day. 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 It can even reach 85 kilometers on a clear night. 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.809
 Heat radiation burns can cause burns on the first level within 11 km. 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.769
 Secondary burns are caused within 10 km. The third-grade burns that can damage the skin tissue of the body surface are within 8 km. 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.449
 [24%] Grade 3 burns can be fatal without medical emergency. The extent of it will depend on the weather of the day and the clothes you wear. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:23.220
 For example, white clothes can reflect most energy, and black clothes absorb it. 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.368
 At the center of the Hiroshima explosion, the temperature will reach [300,000] Â°C. 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 This is equivalent to 300 times the temperature of the incineration of the body. 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.939
 Such intense heat will restore the person into a basic element, and the radiation explosion will behave like the sun. 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.629
 So [object] will leave a projection where the radiation does not directly hit. 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.509
 But most of the energy released by the nuclear explosion is the explosion of the air that dispels the scene. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 This causes the air pressure to change rapidly. 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.930
 That will smash or knock down the object. [And if] we take [a] millions of tons of bombs as an example, objects within a radius of six kilometers 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.920
 Will receive the equivalent of 180 tons of power 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 A wind speed of 255 km per hour hits a two-story building 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.208
 The maximum pressure reached within 1 km radius is four times the wind speed 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.119
 It also has an instant speed of 756 kilometers, although the human body can withstand such pressure. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.870
 But the wind can cause fatal collisions with nearby objects. 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.549
 Therefore, the cause of death mainly comes from the collapse of the building. And the largest tonnage nuclear bomb that has been detonated in the past compared to millions of tons. 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.429
 The 50 million-ton Tsar nuclear bomb is on an island in Russia. 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.450
 What you see at this point is the sum of 3333 Hiroshima atomic bombs. If you happen to survive here, now you have to worry about radiation 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.209
 But not all radiation is harmful, we are exposed to different forms of radiation every day, such as our mobile phones. 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.059
 But the ionizing radiation at the center of the nuclear bomb has enough energy to pull electrons out of the atom. 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.469
 But the amount of radiation you encounter is very much affected by your people outdoors or 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.070
 It is in the interior of a wooden structure or a cement structure, and so on, 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.399
 Exposure to 600 rem of radiation will have a [percent] [90] chance of causing a fatal disease, 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.630
 It is estimated that 450 rem is half the estimated fatal death. But those who healed will still suffer long-term damage. 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.909
 DNA molecular bonds and molecular chains are destroyed, although most can be repaired, 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.930
 It will not lead to an increase in the probability of future genetic mutations and cancer. 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.550
 Followed by [Fallout]. 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.329
 When a bomb explodes on the surface or near the ground, the explosion creates a crater and vaporizes the sediment there and brings it into the air. 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.190
 It forms a mushroom cloud that you and I are familiar with, and these particles will be radioactive. 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.460
 And return to the surface as a sediment after condensation 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.540
 According to wind conditions, 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.159
 Radiation dust can fly up to 100 kilometers, although it can appear in the form of black rain. 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.070
 But most of the time you can't detect these radiations yourself. Fortunately 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.089
 The radiation decay of the radiation dust is quite rapid, it will drop to 1% of the initial radiation within two weeks. 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.080
 But you will have to stay in the shelter until it is over. 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.809
 So what if a nuclear war breaks out? Recent research hypothesis 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.190
 If you detonate 100 warheads of similar size to the Hiroshima atomic bomb, this would be like the war between India and Pakistan. 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.279
 Relative to the United States, Russia, China and other countries, 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.739
 Both have lower arms reserves, but this still causes huge losses. 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.909
 After experiencing a nuclear attack, 5 million tons of "Black Rock" will immediately enter the atmosphere. 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.890
 Will cause global temperatures to drop and reduce annual rainfall by 9%. [in spite of] 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.149
 Although this change is small, it is enough to trigger crop failure and famine. 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.809
 An independent study estimates that 2 billion people will fall into famine overnight in the war of 100 nuclear bombs 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.219
 So what should you do? We made a film called "How to Survive in a Nuclear War." 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.269
