00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:01.862
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:03.865
I want to talk about personal pronouns.

00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:06.234
But before I get too specific with that,

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:09.138
I just want to write out
some sentences for you.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.690
Now, all of these words
that I'm about to circle,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.100
"I," "we," "you," "you," and, "they,"

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.378
are personal pronouns.

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:34.838
We decide which personal pronouns

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:37.140
are appropriate for a given sentence

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.345
depending on whom we're talking about.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.505
I'll explain.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.014
In English, we divide personal pronouns

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:45.122
into three basic types.

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.798
There are pronouns that are about me.

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.958
There are pronouns that are about you.

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.653
And there are pronouns that are

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:55.382
people or things that
are neither me nor you.

00:00:55.382 --> 00:00:56.690
Another way of saying this is

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.242
that this is the first person,

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.788
the second person,

00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:02.494
and the third person.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.418
Another way to divide up these pronouns

00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:08.576
is to divide it into

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:12.897
the singular and the plural.

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:16.655
The one,

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.414
and the more than one.

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:19.528
So in English,

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.671
if we're only talking about
one person that includes me,

00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:25.227
well, then we'd be talking
about pronouns like,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:29.702
"I," "me," "my," and, "mine."

00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:32.864
But if I am in a group
of two or more people,

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:34.468
we don't refer to ourselves as, "I."

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:36.145
We refer to ourselves as,

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:40.825
"we," or, "us," or, "our," or, "ours."

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:43.613
And if I were talking about you

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.519
or something that belonged to you,

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.254
whether it was singular or plural

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:50.225
I would say, "you," "your," and, "yours."

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.444
So when I said, "You
are a capable person,"

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:54.442
and I said, "You are capable people,"

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:55.830
I was trying to demonstrate that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.388
"you" is the same,

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.195
whether it's singular or plural.

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:02.971
Whether there is one person in "you",

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:04.631
or more than one person.

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:05.882
In standard American English,

00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:07.593
there is no difference between

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.262
just one person and multiple people

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.082
when you're addressing them directly,

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:13.888
in what we call, "the second person."

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:15.798
So if we're talking about people or things

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:17.300
that are neither me nor you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.186
when there's only one of
those people or things,

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:22.410
we would refer to that person or thing as,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.492
"she," "her," "hers," "he,"

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:29.362
"him," or, "his," or, "it," and, "its."

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:31.434
Now if we're talking about more than one

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.746
person or thing that
is neither me nor you,

00:02:34.746 --> 00:02:35.862
then we would say,

00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:39.995
"they," "them," "their," or, "theirs."

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.212
Now there is most certainly
a way to distinguish

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:45.038
between, "I," and, "me,"
and, "my," and, "mine."

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:46.944
For the meantime, just
take a look at this chart.

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:48.606
Pause the screen if you have to.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:50.109
Maybe practice saying them out loud

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.056
and figuring out which one
corresponds to which box.

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:55.876
If I say, "it," is that in the first,

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.096
second, or third person?

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:58.552
Am I talking about me, you,

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:01.212
or a person or thing that
is neither me nor you?

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:04.444
If I talk about "them", am
I talking about me or you

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:07.409
or people that are neither you nor me?

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.128
Give it a try,

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.599
check out the exercise,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.448
we'll go deeper in the next video.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:12.820
You can learn anything.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.858
David out.
