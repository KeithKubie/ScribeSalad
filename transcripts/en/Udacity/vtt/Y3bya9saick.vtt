00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.740
Okay, so now we're really ready to begin.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.140
Our ABO gene is unzipped, it's unwound, the DNA

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.330
strands are separated. We know that base pairing is

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.610
going to be really important in creating our RNA copy.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.900
So now we're ready to start transcribing. Our

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.100
DNA and RNA, our RNA letters are going to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.950
come in one by one and match in sequence until we get to the end of the gene.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.670
Therefore, during transcription, I want you to tell

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.080
me which base pairing scenario is most likely

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.734
to be occurring. Are we seeing DNA:DNA base

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:40.775
pairing, RNA:RNA base pairing, or DNA:RNA base pairing?
