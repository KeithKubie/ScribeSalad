[Music]

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.100
It's pig heart week on the king of random

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.540
Hey what up guys in this video we're carrying on with the heart theme

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.040
Now in a previous video I took a pig heart

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.340
cast it in silicon and turned it into an edible chocolate heart for valentine's day

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.280
And I was going to take the original pig heart that came out of the silicon mold

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.200
and freeze it in liquid nitrogen, so we could chip away at it.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.160
but a lot of you in the comments have been asking to put the pig heart in a vacuum chamber first.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.800
So for this video we're going to try just that.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500
We're going to answer what does a heart do in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.700
See from this direction it actually does look a little more like a heart.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.340
Like you get the actual heart shape there

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.400
very peculiar (said in creepy voice)

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.180
At first I thought this was going to be a kind of lame experiment, because a heart is just a giant muscle.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.880
Putting this in a vacuum chamber I wouldn't really expect much to happen at all

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.200
So now's the time that we can make our predictions

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.040
about what you think is going to happen

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.160
is anything going to happen at all? Or is this heart just going to sit there and do absolutely nothing?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.220
I can stick my finger down inside there

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.780
Whatever this flappy thing on top is got cut apparently

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.480
and its got little tubes in there

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.520
Actually a lot of little tubes.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.140
I guess that's the question is the tissue airtight?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.200
or will the air just suck right out of it?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.320
there's only one way to find out exactly what's going to happen and that's to plop this thing in

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.380
and start drawing a vacuum

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm going to buff this thing up a little bit so that we get a nice clear view down inside

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
And I'm using the glass jar so that we can see inside from every different angle as well

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.260
Beautiful

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.940
It's looking good

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.540
(Blowing noises)

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.100
So we've got our jar of heart

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.280
(song) collecting your jar of hearts

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.880
What's going to happen?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.920
There's only one way to find out (song ends)

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.800
gauges are set, valves are closed

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.000
here we go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.080
Mechanical whirring

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
K we're all ready at 25 inches of mercury

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.880
that sucked up really fast

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.760
and its hard to tell, but I can't really notice any visible change

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.400
in the heart, I can't even see if it got bigger or not

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.940
looks completely the same to me

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.440
from every angle

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.560
26.5 inches of mercury that's as much as this vacuum chamber can pull

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.820
hmm
