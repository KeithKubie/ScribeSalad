extreme temperatures and the world is
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.810
extreme temperatures and the world is
changing and we need all to get together

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820
changing and we need all to get together
 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.570

biggest challenge at this point is for

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019
biggest challenge at this point is for
 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.049
biggest challenge at this point is for
people to realize that the next

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059
people to realize that the next
 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000
people to realize that the next
generation is going to be living in a

generation is going to be living in a
 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.340
generation is going to be living in a
very different world and if we don't get

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350
very different world and if we don't get
 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.289

together and do something about it are

have to put the pieces together

have to put the pieces together
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.650
have to put the pieces together
differently that means we don't have to

happen but we can get started and go

very far with today's technology so

very far with today's technology so

there seems now finally to be a

there seems now finally to be a

there seems now finally to be a
recognition that this is a time to

recognition that this is a time to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 
it's a big question one whether we will

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450
it's a big question one whether we will
 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630
it's a big question one whether we will
declare business as usual and if we did

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640
declare business as usual and if we did
 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.690
declare business as usual and if we did
we would say it's time to spend the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700
we would say it's time to spend the
 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.080
we would say it's time to spend the
money to make this transition as rapidly

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090
money to make this transition as rapidly

as possible some people have estimated
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.860
as possible some people have estimated
it would cost six hundred billion

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
it would cost six hundred billion
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.180
it would cost six hundred billion
dollars to rapidly accelerate the growth

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190
dollars to rapidly accelerate the growth

dollars to rapidly accelerate the growth
of the electrification of transportation

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519
of the electrification of transportation
 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.580
of the electrification of transportation
that happens to be the same amount of

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
that happens to be the same amount of
 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.039
that happens to be the same amount of
money we send overseas every year for

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049
money we send overseas every year for
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.369
money we send overseas every year for
imported oil so it sounds like a lot of

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379
imported oil so it sounds like a lot of
 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.140
imported oil so it sounds like a lot of
money but will be way ahead of the game

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
money but will be way ahead of the game
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.809
money but will be way ahead of the game
if we do it and if it involves spending

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819
if we do it and if it involves spending
 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.770
if we do it and if it involves spending
a little more on electricity and if it

a little more on electricity and if it

a little more on electricity and if it
