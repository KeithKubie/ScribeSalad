00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.783
- [Instructor] The scatterplot
below displays a set of

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:07.292
bivariate data along with its
least-squares regression line.

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:10.844
Consider removing the
outlier 95 comma one.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:14.249
So 95 comma one, we're
talking about that outlier

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.082
right over there.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:19.182
And calculating a new
least-squares regression line.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:22.376
What effects would
removing the outlier have?

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.899
Choose all answers that apply.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.326
Like always, pause this video

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.168
and see if you could figure it out.

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:32.091
Well let's see, even
with this outlier here,

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:35.591
we have an upward sloping regression line.

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:40.599
And so, it looks like our r already

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:43.736
is going to be greater than zero.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:46.240
And of course, it's going
to be less than one.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.810
So our r is going to be greater
than zero and less than one.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.725
We know it's not going to
be equal one because then

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.494
we would go perfectly
through all of the dots

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:59.444
and it's clear that this
point right over here

00:00:59.444 --> 00:01:01.449
is indeed an outlier.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.405
The residual between this point
and the line is quite high.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:08.373
We have a pretty big
distance right over here.

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:10.866
It would be a negative residual and so,

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.789
this point is definitely
bringing down the r

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.132
and it's definitely
bringing down the slope

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:19.504
of the regression line.

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:22.274
If we were to remove this
point, we're more likely

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:26.297
to have a line that looks
something like this,

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:29.399
in which case, it looks
like we would get a much,

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.694
a much much much better fit.

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:33.347
The only reason why the
line isn't doing that

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.853
is it's trying to get close
to this point right over here.

00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:41.116
So if we remove this outlier,
our r would increase.

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:45.181
So, r would increase

00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.110
and also the slope of
our line would increase.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.425
And slope would increase.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:54.750
We'd have a better fit to this
positively correlated data

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.443
and we would no longer
have this point dragging

00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:59.602
the slope down anymore.

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.650
So let's see which choices apply.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.496
The coefficient of determination
r squared would increase.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.465
Well if r would increase,
then squaring that value

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:09.669
would increase as well.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.833
So I will circle that.

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.686
The coefficient, the
correlation coefficient r

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:16.532
would get close to zero.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:18.811
No, in fact, it would get closer to one

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.008
because we would have a better fit here.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.303
And so, I will rule that out.

00:02:24.303 --> 00:02:26.613
The slope of the
least-squares regression line

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.937
would increase.

00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:28.966
Yes, indeed.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.661
This point, this
outlier's pulling it down.

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.603
If you take it out, it'll
allow the slope to increase.

00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:36.941
So I will circle that as well.

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.752
Let's do another example.

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:41.586
The scatterplot below displays
a set of bivariate data

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:44.131
along with its least-squares
regression line.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.275
Same idea.

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:48.886
Consider removing the outlier
ten comma negative 18,

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:50.518
so we're talking about that point there,

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:53.636
and calculating a new
least-squares regression line.

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:55.328
So what would happen this time?

00:02:55.328 --> 00:02:58.210
So as is without removing this outlier,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.590
we have a negative slope
for the regression line,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.946
so we're dealing with a negative r.

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:08.573
So we already know that
negative one is less than r

00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:12.777
which is less than zero without
even removing the outlier.

00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:14.149
We know it's not going to be negative one.

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:16.944
If it was negative, if r
was exactly negative one,

00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:18.667
then it would be in downward-sloping line

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.763
that went exactly through
all of the points.

00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:25.020
But if we remove this point,
what's going to happen?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.658
Well, this least-squares
regression is being

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:30.096
pulled down here by this outlier.

00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:32.006
So if you remove this point,

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.660
the least-squares regression
line could move up

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.088
on the left-hand side
and so you'll probably

00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:40.027
have a line that looks more like that.

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.032
And I'm just hand drawing it.

00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:44.927
But even what I hand drew
looks like a better fit

00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:47.491
for the leftover points.

00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:50.776
And so, clearly the new line
that I drew after removing

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:54.647
the outlier, this has
a more negative slope.

00:03:54.647 --> 00:03:59.293
So removing the outlier would decrease r,

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:01.832
r would get closer to
negative one, it would be

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:05.519
closer to being a perfect
negative correlation.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.429
And also, it would decrease the slope.

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.525
Decrease the slope.

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:13.196
Which choices match that?

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:18.085
The coefficient of determination
r squared would decrease.

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:19.492
So let's be very careful.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.851
R was already negative.

00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.561
If we decrease it, it's going
to become more negative.

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.523
If you square something
that is more negative,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.161
it's not going to become smaller.

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.880
Let's say before you
remove the data point,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.558
r was, I'm just gonna make up a value,

00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:40.445
let's say it was negative
0.4, and then after

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:43.689
removing the outlier,
r becomes more negative

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.146
and it's going to be
equal to negative 0.5.

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:49.513
We'll if you square this, this would be

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:52.205
positive 0.16 while this would be

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.844
positive 0.25.

00:04:54.844 --> 00:04:56.422
So if r is already negative and if you

00:04:56.422 --> 00:05:00.072
make it more negative, it
would not decrease r squared,

00:05:00.072 --> 00:05:02.366
it actually would increase r squared.

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:04.843
So I will rule this one out.

00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:07.025
The slope of the
least-squares regression line

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:07.913
would increase.

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:09.907
No, it's going to decrease.

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:12.436
It's going to be a stronger
negative correlation.

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.819
Rule that one out.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.415
The y-intercept of the
least-squares regression line

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:17.623
would increase.

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:20.355
Yes, by getting rid of this outlier,

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.698
you could think of it as
the left side of this line

00:05:22.698 --> 00:05:24.211
is going to increase.

00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:25.759
Or another way to think about it,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.160
the slope of this line
is going to decrease,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.685
it's going to become more negative.

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:32.409
We know that the
least-squares regression line

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.995
will always go through the
mean of both variables.

00:05:35.995 --> 00:05:38.602
So we're just gonna pivot around
the mean of both variables

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:41.841
which would mean that the
y-intercept will go higher.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.758
So I will fill that in.
