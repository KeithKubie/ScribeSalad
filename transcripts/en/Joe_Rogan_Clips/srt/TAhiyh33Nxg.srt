1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,220
The Joe Rogan experience. Do you
watch a lot of standup? Me? Yeah.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,840
I watch it at the clubs. I very rarely
sit down and watch a special. Yeah,

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,270
it's true. Do you watch the
special ever? Occasionally.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,390
If like right now I'm working on it
and trying to put together new hours,

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,480
so I'm trying to go back and watch stuff.
But for years I didn't watch anything.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,920
Um,
uh,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,950
but like it's funny like the three comics
that I watch are you deleah and I'm

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,100
Sebastian because I follow
you guys at the store.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,550
So it's like I'm in the room sitting there
and like you're the only three that I

10
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,610
watch.
Like I could like,

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,770
I could like reset your act word for
word and I don't watch anyone else.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,010
It's so funny to me. Well,
I think it's great to be,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
again at a place like the store where you
can see all these different styles and

14
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,160
all these different people doing it.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,280
And you also see how we kind of influence
each other in the slightest bit.

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,330
And you know that we're all working in
these really hot rooms where it's all

17
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,110
packed. And, but I think it's good
to sit down and watch, you know,

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,420
John Malaney when he did his, where
was that? Where was his radio city?

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,990
A city or you know, Dave
Chappelle, wherever he did his,

20
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,070
he did his in DC I think. Right? The
big one, wasn't it in DC? I last one,

21
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,840
I think it was in la,
the last one.

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,560
Well he did the store with the
belly room with the little one,

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,990
the room he did the other one where he's
wearing like the military shirts with

24
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:19,560
the scene,

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,670
the Oj thing we talked about Oj that was
in la and then there was one in Austin.

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,370
They may have been one more in DC.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,700
I thought the most recent
bigger one was in DC.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,500
But either way the um, maybe you're right
where, what, well Jamie, we'll find it,

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,210
but it's, I think it's, uh,
it's good to see, you know,

30
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,620
it's good to see how
different people do it.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
I always enjoy watching Katt Williams,

32
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:47,910
particularly in the beginning because
you know like a lot of times he'll just

33
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,140
run out on stage and like he's running
around on stage for like five or 10

34
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,620
minutes before the fucking first Joe
comes out and he's pointing at people in

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,850
the audience and sweating and going
crazy and it's so different than the way

36
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:03,390
anybody that I know does it. It's
good to see that too. Yeah. He,

37
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:08,391
I think the most discussed a
standup special of the past year.

38
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:12,570
It was not in a net. It was Kat
Williams, his spouse. Did you see it?

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:13,681
Yes.

40
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,830
The one he did from Florida where he
opens up a 10 minutes of Florida material,

41
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,500
15 minutes of Jacksonville material.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,190
That is like apparently
destroying that we did. I just,

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,380
I couldn't get enough of it. We watched
watched it a hundred times. Yeah.

44
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,620
But it tapered off pretty
hard. Oh yeah. Yeah.

45
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:31,800
I tapered off real hard when he was
doing the Trump stuff. It's like,

46
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,690
well this stuff is like half baked.
Yeah.

47
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,560
It looked like it looked like he had
a bit to, that they like made him cut.

48
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,080
And so we had to just
like do the hour anyway.

49
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,800
That's what I assumed from having watched
it. I thought out they do that though.

50
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,920
They don't tell you to do shit.
They don't tell me to do shit.

51
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,050
I don't think they're going to tell him
to do shit. They may have been like,

52
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:52,350
this is someone, this is already a bit, do
you know what I mean? As simple as that.

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,790
I don't know. Seemed to me that it was
almost like he had some shit to say,

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,080
but maybe hadn't been doing
a lot of stand, you know, I,

55
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,510
I don't know how much that guy works
out. I don't see him anywhere. No.

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,200
I always wonder about those guys. Like
the guys who you don't see in the clubs,

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,390
you know, like bill, you know, Bill
Bird saw a special one day, um,

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,460
and, uh, we were doing a set
together at the Ice House and, uh,

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,920
he came into the green room, like frothing
at the mouth and it, he's like, he goes,

60
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,610
the, the fucking guy, I forget, I know who
he's talking about, I'll tell you later.

61
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,350
But he was like, the fucking guy
doesn't do the clubs anymore.

62
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,790
He doesn't do the clubs.
He goes, is watching this
cringey bullshit. And he was,

63
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,850
he was like angry. And I was like,
you've got to do the fucking clubs.
