MALE SPEAKER: This is
David Gelles, joining us

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.920
from "The New York Times,"
where he's a business reporter.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.560
He's also an author
of "Mindful Work."

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.500
And he's written
about his experiences

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.520
with meditation, both
personally and in the workplace

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.769
and many businesses
around the world.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.310
So without further
ado, here's David.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.860
DAVID GELLES: Thank you.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.097
Thanks, all, so much for
being here, really happy--

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:30.930
you're all my guinea
pigs because I've never

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.030
given this talk before.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.000
So bear with me, please.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.430
So before I rattle on about
mindless and meditation,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.950
I thought it would
be appropriate

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.230
if we just stopped for
just a second here.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.159
So if you would, you're
all being so diligent.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.700
You don't have your
smart phones out.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.535
You don't have
your laptops open.

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:49.160
But if they are, if
you're hiding them,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.720
just put them away
for just a sec.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.710
And when I ring this bell, just
close your eyes if you would

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.300
and focus on the sensation
of your breath, just

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.200
the actual feeling of air moving
in and out of your nostril,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.750
wherever you feel it.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.720
Maybe it's your lungs
moving up and down,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.089
your chest inflating,
your diaphragm rising.

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:09.380
And then here's the whole game.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.660
When you notice
your mind wander,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.440
just try to bring
your attention back

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440
to that physical
sensation of the breath.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.246
We'll just do it for
very short minute here.

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:19.242
[BELL RINGING]

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.580
If you find yourself wondering
when this is going to be over,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.000
just gently bring your
attention back to the breath.

00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:01.365
[BELL RINGING]

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.320
OK, not so painful, I
hope, and like it or not,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.026
you're all now meditators.

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:10.400
But before we get
started, I just

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.400
want a quick show
of hands-- 0 to 10.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.490
Zero means you think
this is all hokum

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.170
and you don't even
know why I'm up here.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.740
And meditation and business have
absolutely no place together.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.550
10 is you're already leading
the search inside yourself.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.000
I expect to see a 10 from
Don in the back, there.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.004
So 0 to 10, just give me your
initial impressions-- 0s, 10s.

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.170
OK, let me see what we have.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.330
We have sixes, sevens.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.800
I know I'm at Google.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.670
We have a five.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.190
OK, any twos or threes?

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.010
No, you guys are so
welcome and receptive.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.620
OK, that's good.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.910
Those that are on the lower
end of the scale, I hear you.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.260
I was a skeptic at once, too.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.070
In fact, I'm a "New
York Times" journalist,

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.530
so I'm paid to be cynical.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.280
But I hope what we'll find is
that that simple practice we

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.420
just did is catching on in the
business world for good reason.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.180
At Goldman Sachs, a company
I cover pretty closely

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.780
for "The New York Times," a
board member, Bill George,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.960
is actually espousing the
virtues of meditation.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.090
And traders and
investment bankers

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.510
are practicing mindfulness,
trying to get an edge.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.610
At Facebook-- a cross-town
rival of your guys'-- they have

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.017
actually retooled some of
their algorithms to try to make

00:03:17.017 --> 00:03:18.600
the social network
more compassionate.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.210
They have compassion
research days.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.890
You guys might want
to catch up there.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.952
At General Mills,
there's a meditation room

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:28.660
in every building on
the corporate campus

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.880
in the middle of the Midwest,
in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.850
And it's not just business.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.500
In health care, doctors,
nurses, and patients

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.720
are all finding value in
mindfulness and meditation

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.909
for one reason or another.

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.450
Doctors and nurses
find it makes them

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.820
more resilient for these
long 12 hour shifts.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.320
And patients are discovering
that mindfulness and meditation

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.360
might not make the
pain go away, but it

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.060
can help them manage
their suffering.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.980
Students as well,
teachers also-- teachers

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.910
find that mindfulness
can help them

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.570
deal with rambunctious
little children.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.466
And students, younger and
even college students,

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.840
are actually-- there are
studies that show this-- finding

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.510
that mindfulness and meditation
can actually improve their test

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.030
scores, help them be
more focused at work.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.358
The US military, both Marines
and soldiers in the army,

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:17.899
are using mindfulness
and meditation,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.980
not to become better snipers,
but to become more resilient

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.070
when they're back home and
also on the battlefield.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.550
And even the Seattle Seahawks--
this is Russell Wilson.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.160
He's playing in the
Super Bowl on Sunday.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.690
They've made mindfulness
a core part of training

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.669
at the Seattle
Seahawks training camp.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.210
And some would say
that that's helped

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.310
them appear in two
consecutive Super Bowls.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.210
At the World Economic Forum,
I was just in Davos last week,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.170
every day started with an hour
of mindfulness meditation led

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.720
by Jon Kabat-Zinn, who's
one of the guys that really

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.660
got this movement
going many years ago

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.940
and has sustained it for
the last several decades.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.040
And I wrote a story
about it for the times--

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.470
"Amid the Chattering of
the Global Elite, a Silent

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.169
Interlude."

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.960
There was a panel about
mindful leadership,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.540
and there was another one
later in the week about mindful

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.870
neuroscience.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.160
Of all the things we wrote
about, from central bankers

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.850
to oil prices, this
was the one that

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.152
was the most read of
all our Davos coverage.

00:05:13.152 --> 00:05:15.110
And there's even a
magazine. "Mindful Magazine"

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.880
is on the newsstands,
documenting

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.730
this whole range of
professionals that

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.570
are embracing mindfulness
for one reason

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.600
or another-- doctors,
lawyers, policeman, and more.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.910
So what is mindfulness?

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.270
For those who
haven't taken gPause,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.500
who haven't taken
Search Inside Yourself,

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.800
it's paying attention
in the present moment,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.960
on purpose, in a particular
way, and nonjudgmentally.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.751
And I know that's a mouthful.

00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:40.250
But if you boil it
down, it's really

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.170
about being right
here, right now.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.830
It's doing what we did for
just a minute earlier on.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.594
It's not letting
ourselves get caught up

00:05:48.594 --> 00:05:50.010
on the hamster
wheel of our minds,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.280
not letting ourselves
be always preoccupied

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.930
about the future,
dwelling on the past.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.260
It's being right here
right now and noticing

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.160
what's going on in our
thoughts, emotions, and bodies.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.180
Who coined this term?

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.542
Jon Kabat-Zinn-- he's
a molecular biologist

00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:07.500
from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.340
So he's not just
hippie vagabond who

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.060
came back and tried to
repurpose some ancient wisdom.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.590
He's a very serious guy, and
he's done more than anyone

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.840
over the last several decades.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.880
He developed this thing called
mindfulness-based stress

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.379
reduction.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.680
It's an eight week course.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.950
It's taught here in London.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.920
I highly recommend it.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.260
I've done it, and it really has
helped secularize mindfulness.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.250
It's made it so
accessible to people

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.467
in all those professions.

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:32.050
And I think I wouldn't
be on the stage

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.990
if it wasn't for
the work he'd do.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.790
So how does Jon Kabat-Zinn
suggest we actually

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.710
cultivate mindfulness?

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.480
Well, meditation--
it's not the only way,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.340
but it's unfortunately the
main way-- and more meditation.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.200
And let's just think
back to what we did.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.250
It's sitting upright,
comfortably--

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.180
it's what we just did-- finding
the sensation of your breath.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.330
And the whole game, this
is the whole thing, when

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.910
your mind wanders, just
bring your attention

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.940
back to the breath.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.270
Let's just do it one more time,
this time for only 30 seconds.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.836
Find a position that's upright,
dignified, comfortable.

00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:10.540
And when I ring the bell,
just focus on your breath.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.510
I won't interrupt this time.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.380
When the mind wanders,
back to the breath.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.766
[BELL RINGING]

00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:39.502
[BELL RINGING]

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.009
OK, not so painful, I hope--
that was just 30 seconds.

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:47.550
I don't know.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.210
How long do you guys
sit for at gPause, Don?

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.350
20 minutes, OK,
that's 40 of those.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.420
I think we could do it.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.045
We're not going to
do it today, though.

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:59.850
But sitting meditation can
be a lot for some people,

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.000
so it's not the only way.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.280
There's sitting meditation,
but there's also

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.160
walking meditation.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.076
There's the body scan.

00:08:05.076 --> 00:08:07.087
And I'll talk about a
few other techniques

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.420
over the course of this talk
that are ways just to pause

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.020
and be mindful in the midst
of our busy work days.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.010
And what happens
when we actually

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.200
start embodying
this mindfulness?

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.660
Well, a common
way it's described

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.840
is a move from
reaction to response.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.110
So something happens, and
typically we just automatically

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.160
respond.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.212
We react.

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:27.670
And oftentimes, we
don't even think

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.320
about what it is we're going to
do, how we're going to respond,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.360
where we're going to come
from, the quality of presence

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.080
we're going to bring
to that interaction.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.140
Mindfulness--
cultivating the ability

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.710
to just pause for
these brief seconds--

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.370
allows us to inject
mindfulness after that stimulus

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.490
and respond.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.490
And often the result is more
equanimity, more harmonious

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.320
interactions.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.720
It can be good, especially in
a busy, big place like Google.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.760
Mindfulness is an
innate human quality.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.080
This is nothing specific.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.460
This is nothing that
Jon Kabat-Zinn invented.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.730
You all just found mindfulness
right here, in Google,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.450
in London, for just a
minute, for just 30 seconds.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.190
It's something that we all
possess, and yet it is true,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.220
it is most closely associated
with the Buddhist tradition.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.380
The term mindfulness is
sprinkled across the Buddhist

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.530
text like stars
across the night.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.740
And Buddhist meditation
is often aimed

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.370
at actually cultivating
the quality of mindfulness.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.720
But today, thanks
largely to Jon Kabat-Zinn

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.480
and some of his
colleagues, mindfulness

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.200
is really a secular pursuit.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.930
It's been divorced
from that tradition.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.350
They've taken it out of
that religious context

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.160
and really made it
accessible to everyone.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.670
And I think that's why
we're seeing Google, Goldman

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.830
Sachs, General Mills,
and more embrace this.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.600
And also, a company
called Aetna.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.780
This is Mark Bertolini.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.310
He's the CEO of Aetna.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.750
It's a $40 billion, Fortune
100 company, big health care

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.365
provider in the United States.

00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:54.340
And I'm just going to tell
you his story for a minute.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.020
Several years ago,
Mark almost died.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.120
He was in a skiing accident
with his family on vacation.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.780
He broke his collar bone.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.810
His shoulder was dislocated,
and he tore a ton of the nerves

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.990
in his arm.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.980
And when he got back,
he could barely work.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.090
The pain was so severe
that he almost quit.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.620
He almost absolutely
didn't even return to work.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.544
He tried drugs.

00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:19.460
The drugs didn't work.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.930
He tried all of them.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.090
He tried physical therapy.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.760
Physical therapy didn't work,
and he was really suffering.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.205
He was considering ending his
career, and he was a real up

00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:29.660
and comer.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.440
Then finally someone
suggested, you try yoga.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.790
And he said, no way, no how.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.760
Yoga is for sissies, not for me.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.320
He was a very serious,
type A kind of guy.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.520
And they said,
just try it, Mark.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.310
So he went to his
first yoga class,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.980
and he did his Sun Salutations.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.590
And he got through it.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.820
And the next day, he
was so sore he almost

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.010
wanted those drugs again.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.800
And he realized that not only
was yoga not for sissies,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.120
it was a very serious practice
that he ought to investigate.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.500
He became a devoted
yogi, and that

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.350
led to an experience
of mindfulness.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.910
He started practicing
mindfulness meditation.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.260
Fast forward several months.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.430
He's off the drugs.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.911
He still feels pain, absolutely.

00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:10.660
But like the patients
I mentioned earlier,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.900
he's not suffering as much.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.070
He's able to manage his
pain more effectively.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.760
And he goes.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.926
He wasn't CEO at that point.

00:11:15.926 --> 00:11:19.520
He becomes CEO, and Aetna is
frankly doing better than ever.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.970
So then he says, well,
if it works for me,

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.340
why don't we bring
it to our employees?

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.690
So he goes to his chief
medical officer at Aetna

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.970
and he says, I want to teach
mindfulness to Aetna employees.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.300
And Lonnie, this guy,
he says, you're crazy.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.080
Just because everyone
else is meditating,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.565
it doesn't mean your
employees have to as well.

00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:39.440
And he said, we're an
evidence-based company.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.656
Let's just try it.

00:11:41.656 --> 00:11:43.780
And Lonnie says, fine,
small pilot-- couple hundred

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.014
employees on both coasts.

00:11:45.014 --> 00:11:46.430
Mark says, I'll
do you one better.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.230
Let's get Duke University
in to measure the results.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.340
So they start it-- small
pilot program, run it

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.090
for a few months.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.090
What do they find?

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.460
Those few hundred
employees-- a., they love it,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.060
say the quality of life,
their experience of work,

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.780
has gone up.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.680
But not only that, they
seem to be healthier.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.060
They seem to be less stressed.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.210
They were reporting their
self-reported stress symptoms

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.730
way down.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.780
Their engagement
with work, way up.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.160
So Lonnie, the chief medical
officer, he says, OK,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.530
let's expand it.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.270
They roll it out
then to thousands

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.510
of Aetna employees
around the country.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.300
And, again, it's a hit.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.970
After a year of this,
they look at all the data.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.790
They look at all the results,
and it's made a difference.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.980
Not only are all the
self-reported scores

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.480
off the charts-- people love
it, they're feeling better--

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.990
but in fact, health
care costs at Aetna

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.920
for that first full year
came down dramatically.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.130
They came down 9%, which
for Aetna was $7 million.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.409
And I asked Mark.

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:44.450
I said, is that all
directly-- are you telling me

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.910
meditation saved you $7 million?

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.900
He said, I can't make
that direct corollary.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.500
I'm not going to overstep here.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.570
But he has to believe it made
a difference on the margins.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.077
If his employees
are less stressed,

00:12:54.077 --> 00:12:55.910
feeling better, going
to the infirmary less,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.080
taking fewer sick
days, maybe that's

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.430
going to help the bottom line.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.950
So what did they do?

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.825
They did mindfulness.

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:02.960
They did yoga, but
they also rolled out

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.530
other forms of
mindfulness training.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.650
And there's one I want to
mention as another tip.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.260
And it involves the sandwich--
actually just eating, eating

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.750
anything.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.440
Aetna rolled out a program
called Metabolic Bytes.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.980
And he actually
got his employees

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.580
to focus on what
they were eating,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.707
how much they were eating.

00:13:21.707 --> 00:13:23.790
And what did they do when
they started to do that?

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.836
They started to eat less.

00:13:25.836 --> 00:13:27.710
And through this whole
program, they actually

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.330
engaged a bunch of the
overweight and obese Aetna

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.202
employees.

00:13:31.202 --> 00:13:33.410
And they were actually able
to help them lose weight,

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.380
just through
mindfulness of eating.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.550
And it's bringing that
same quality of attention

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.424
that we practiced
earlier to our attention.

00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:41.340
And what do we notice?

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.549
So often we're just shovelling
food and maybe surfing

00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:45.714
our smartphone, looking at
the web at the same time,

00:13:45.714 --> 00:13:46.680
eating at our desk.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.450
When we stop doing
that, we can actually

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.074
eat just what we need
instead of automatically

00:13:53.074 --> 00:13:54.490
finishing everything
on the table.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.860
And that was an
amazing, amazing thing

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.193
that I've tried to take with me.

00:13:57.193 --> 00:14:00.111
I try to eat at my desk
less than I need to.

00:14:00.111 --> 00:14:02.360
But at "The New York Times"
it's not always an option.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.910
But when I actually
find the time,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.320
a good mindful meal can help.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.115
So Aetna brought it to
thousands of people.

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:10.740
He saved millions in
health care costs,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.860
then he started offering it to
other companies as a service.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.430
So Aetna now offers yoga
and meditation classes

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.320
to many of its employees.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.570
So if that all weren't enough,
I was totally impressed

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.760
with Aetna.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.424
And then Mark, just
this month, did

00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:24.590
something really incredible.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.210
He came back from
Christmas vacation,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.400
and he had read this book--
"Capital in the Twenty-First

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.830
Century" by Thomas Piketty.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.850
And he was so moved by
the stories of inequality

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.950
and the data that showed that
big corporations, like the one

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.680
he runs, and big CEOs, like
him-- he's paid millions

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.070
of dollars a year--
were exacerbating this

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.750
that he felt compelled
to do something.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.825
So he went to his board.

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.820
He gave everyone in the
board a copy of this book.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.480
And then he made a
public announcement.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.230
Out of the blue he
said, all of our lowest

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.807
paid workers are
getting a 33% raise

00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:57.640
because I have an
obligation to do something

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.570
about this problem.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.050
And I saw Mark in Davos.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.430
And I said, Mark, did
your meditation practice,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.130
did your mindfulness, have
anything to do with this?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.713
And he said, I'm not
going to tell you

00:15:07.713 --> 00:15:10.420
just because I meditated
I made this decision.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.090
But meditation and
mindfulness have

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.150
made me more attuned to
other people's emotions.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.020
I'm more compassionate.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.130
I'm more in touch with
the needs of others.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.620
And I recognize
the interdependence

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.450
and the interconnectedness
of the work we do

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.820
and the broader
function of society.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.460
And, ultimately, he made
this very radical decision.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.720
So why am I the guy up
here telling you this,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.640
you might wonder?

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.640
I grew up here in
the San Francisco

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.960
Bay, beautiful
Northern California.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.530
And I was a confused kid.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.996
I was a confused teenager.

00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:44.370
I was a confused
college student.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.140
I asked lots of questions
about the big things in life.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.570
And I found no answers
in psychedelics.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.500
I found no answers in books.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.581
I tried everywhere, but
I couldn't find them.

00:15:54.581 --> 00:15:56.830
Then finally one night, it's
my first year of college.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.810
I'm home visiting my mom.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.170
I open a book on the
bookshelf, and it's

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.094
an introduction to basic
Buddhist meditation.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.510
And for the first time, I read
something that makes sense.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.390
It says getting off the hamster
wheel of our mind is possible.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.590
Stopping obsessing about
the future and the past

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.746
is actually attainable.

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:14.120
And there's an
easy way to do it,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.960
and it's called
mindfulness and meditation.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.850
So I did what anyone would do.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.690
I got on a plane and went
as far away from my parents

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.220
as I could to India.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.360
And I moved to Bodh Gaya, which
is a small, impoverished town

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.290
in Northern India.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.890
And it's where the Buddha, they
say, was actually enlightened.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.710
I moved into a
Burmese monastery,

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.180
where saffron-robed monks
woke me up every morning.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.470
There were peacocks
roaming the courtyard,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.469
and I studied with
different meditation masters

00:16:40.469 --> 00:16:41.260
for several months.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.950
I studied with Zen masters.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.300
I studied with supposedly
reincarnated Tibetan rinpoches,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.500
and I studied with
this guy, Munindraji.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.190
Anagarika Munindraji was
one of the most influential

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.320
mindfulness teachers
of the 20th century.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.100
The students he taught
are still so responsible

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.140
for the proliferation
of mindfulness

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.310
that we're seeing today.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.601
And I was really fortunate
to spend quite a lot of time

00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:04.589
with him in the last
years of his life.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:08.210
And he emphasized more than
anything else, more than all

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.710
the different
meditation techniques,

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.839
he said something that
just resonated with me.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.990
He said, moment to moment,
everything you do, be mindful.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.550
If you're walking, be mindful.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.359
If you're eating be mindful.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.190
If you're just sitting
there, be mindful.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.220
Don't let your
mind just race off.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.730
Just actually practice
being here now.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.370
So there I am, sitting with
Munindraji under the Bodhi

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:30.370
tree.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.750
I was younger then.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.130
There I am with another Tibetan
teacher, under the Bodhi tree

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.760
again.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.852
And if I had stayed in India,
as I was tempted to do--

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:42.310
I called my mom and I threatened
I was going to stay there,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.656
and she freaked out.

00:17:44.656 --> 00:17:46.030
If I had stayed
in India, I think

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.990
I would look like this guy.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.200
That's Yogi Mike, and he's been
in India for a very long time.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.560
I didn't stay in India, though.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.610
I came back.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.565
I became a business journalist.

00:17:56.565 --> 00:17:58.460
I'm currently with
"The New York Times."

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.960
Before that, I was with "The
Financial Times" for five years

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.060
here in London, covering
media, marketing acquisitions.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.410
And I continue to meditate.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.070
I go to places like this,
Spirit Rock, north of Northern

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.250
California, just
above San Francisco.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.050
But for the most
part, this has been

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:18.440
my temple-- the
newsroom of newspapers,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.779
full of screaming
editors, fast deadlines.

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:22.570
And I can assure you
after much experience,

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.340
it's about the least
mindful place I can imagine.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.450
But it's where I earn my keep.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.870
It was while I was at the
FT that I wrote a magazine

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.120
article that actually led
me to this stage right here.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.960
It was called "The
Mind Business."

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.600
It was published in 2012.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.380
And I wrote it when I was
kind of at an impasse.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.130
I had done a bunch
of big stories.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.170
I had interviewed
Bernie Madoff in prison.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.260
I had profiled
Zuckerberg in 2011,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.780
right as the company was
gearing up for that big push

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.181
to go public.

00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:52.180
But I was at an impasse.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.971
I didn't have a big
story I was working on,

00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:56.900
which for a journalist is about
the most frustrating thing.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.590
And then I heard about this
company, General Mills.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.560
I heard General
Mills in Minneapolis,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:05.607
Minnesota was actually teaching
their employees to meditate.

00:19:05.607 --> 00:19:06.690
And a light bulb went off.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.939
I said, I have to figure this.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:09.890
This is finally the
moment where I can join up

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.431
these two disparate
parts of my life.

00:19:11.431 --> 00:19:14.340
So I got on a plane,
flew out there,

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.460
eager to see what the
makers of Haagen-Dazs ice

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.270
cream and Cheerios had to
tell me about meditation.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.660
And when I got there,
this is what I found.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.250
It looked so similar to
actually the very things

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.800
we had been doing in India.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.430
I walked into this
conference room.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.330
It was 3 o'clock on
a Tuesday, and people

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.450
were meditating
in total silence.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.660
And not only that, but the
phrases they were using,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.710
the very words, were echoes
of what I had heard in India.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.970
And the woman who was leading
all this was Janice Marturano.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.330
Janice had a story
not unlike Mark's.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.640
She had hit rock bottom.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.230
She was the deputy general
counsel at General Mills.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.880
And for a year, she worked to
push through the $10 billion

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.190
merger of Pillsbury
and General Mills.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.580
It was absolutely draining.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.100
She had to fight the
SEC, fight the FTC.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.880
It was grueling.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.020
And in the midst of
this professional toil,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.182
both of her parents
died, a personal blow

00:20:08.182 --> 00:20:09.390
that absolutely levelled her.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.110
She finally got the
deal passed, but when

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.330
she got back to
work she was spent.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.740
She had nothing
left in the tank.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.620
She was emotionally,
intellectually

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.920
just depleted-- felt like
she almost couldn't go on.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.600
A friend suggested
she try meditation.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.430
She said, no way, no
how, not new age for me.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.530
I'm a solid Midwestern
girl, not going to happen.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.910
Finally, she circled
back a few weeks later,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.740
said, tell me a bit
more about that.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.200
Soon she was on a
plane to Arizona,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.783
where she studied
with Jon Kabat-Zinn,

00:20:33.783 --> 00:20:37.390
the molecular
biologist from MIT.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.460
After a day with
Jon Kabat-Zinn, she

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.360
was ready to get back on
the plane to Minneapolis.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.650
After five days, she
didn't want to leave.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.230
It took a while, but
meditation started

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.606
to change the way
she saw herself

00:20:50.606 --> 00:20:51.980
and the way she
was able to work.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.370
She got back to Minneapolis, and
people noticed she had changed.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:57.510
There was a bounce
back in her step.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.050
In very stressful meetings,
she was able to keep her cool,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.140
even as people around
her were blowing up.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.940
And finally people started
asking her, what's changed?

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.440
Are you OK?

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.640
What's different?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.490
And she started telling
them, well, I've

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.580
been practicing meditation.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.460
I've been practicing
mindfulness.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.000
If you're interested,
let me know.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.860
Before long she had a quorum.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.450
She had a dozen
people, and so she

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.890
started sitting-- much as
sitting groups have started

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.490
in companies all around
the globe right now.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.590
And soon, that 12
turned into 20.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.970
20 turned into 100.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.410
General Mills heard about this.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.710
The higher ups, they said,
OK, let's sanction it.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.050
Let's build a program around it.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.759
They gave her the
autonomy and the budget

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.341
to start a mindful
leadership program.

00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:34.710
They started doing the research.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.610
And now, there's
a meditation room

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.410
in every building on General
Mills' corporate campus.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.960
It's just an extraordinary
testament to their commitment

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.820
to this.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.930
And Janice, she teaches
sitting meditation.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.180
She teaches walking meditation,
which we unfortunately

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.440
don't have time for today.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.010
But she also talks about
the purposeful pause.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:55.780
And that's that interjection
of mindfulness between stimulus

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.330
and our response
or our reaction.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.621
Previously, she would just
grab the phone when it rang.

00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:01.280
It's certainly what
I am trained to do.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.750
As a mergers and
acquisitions reporter,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.583
it could always be a
source giving me a tip.

00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:06.100
And I have to stop myself.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.210
So what I try to do is
when the phone rings,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.955
I just let it ring
once, maybe even twice.

00:22:11.955 --> 00:22:12.580
And guess what?

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.163
The people are still
on the other line

00:22:14.163 --> 00:22:15.360
waiting to talk to me.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.750
But just interjecting that brief
pause to check in with myself,

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.100
to check in with how
my body is feeling,

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.220
it allows me to come from
a place of equanimity

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.676
when I pick up that phone.

00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:28.550
And it's amazing how
much can be accomplished

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.580
with even a few seconds.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.760
Here, more General
Mills employees

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.735
trying a different kind
of purposeful pause.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.450
Now, the mind business
went viral, in as much

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.770
as an article for the
Financial Times can.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.750
People wanted to know
who else was doing this,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.680
where could they find
it, what was the data.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.530
And I didn't have
any of those answers.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.160
It was more than two
years ago at this point.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.700
I wanted to know more, and
so I set out on this journey

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.940
into the contemplative
heart of the business world.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.650
I found all these companies and
more are practicing mindfulness

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.830
and meditation in
one way or another.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.100
And it's really picking up
steam-- small businesses,

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.037
large businesses, and
companies like Green Mountain.

00:23:13.037 --> 00:23:14.620
Green Mountain
Coffee-- I think you're

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.700
spared their K-Cups here, but
many businesses across the US

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.230
are subjected to them.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.150
They make prepackaged coffee.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.370
And the CEO, Bob
Stiller, that's him

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.310
as pictured in "Fortune
Magazine" some years ago.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.150
He, unlike maybe Mark
Bertolini and Janice Marturano,

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.850
he was kind of a hippy.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.760
He traveled through Asia.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.607
Before he took
over Green Mountain

00:23:37.607 --> 00:23:39.440
and made it a
multi-billion-dollar business,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.510
he started EZ Wider
Rolling Paper Company.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:46.790
So you get the sense of
the kind of guy he was.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.186
But at a certain point, he
said, heck, I'm a billionaire.

00:23:49.186 --> 00:23:50.310
I've made this big company.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.830
I'm going to do want,
started teaching mindfulness

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.430
to his inner sanctum
of employees, his just

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.660
core executive team.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.460
They loved it, same story.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.330
They rolled it out
to more employees,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.200
to middle management--
to graphic designers,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.210
to supply chain managers in the
corporate office in Vermont.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.189
Everyone loved it.

00:24:06.189 --> 00:24:08.480
And then, finally, they did
something really wonderful,

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:08.980
I think.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.810
They said, this is great,
but we have tens of thousands

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.760
of employees in factories
around the country.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.200
These are the guys on the
floor, driving trucks,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.954
who every day work
12 hour shifts

00:24:19.954 --> 00:24:22.120
putting our coffee in boxes,
getting them on trucks,

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.150
and delivering it.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.040
They're probably more
stressed than we are.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.873
And they were right.

00:24:25.873 --> 00:24:28.160
So they started working
with a yoga teacher,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.060
and they developed mindful
yoga, mindful stretching,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.640
that now Green Mountain
employees do before they start

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.060
every shift, just 10
minutes of mindful

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.900
stretching in the locker rooms
as they're getting ready.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.310
And the locker room, the
environment in the locker room,

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.530
has actually changed.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:46.220
It's quite extraordinary.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.700
And this is another
tip I want to suggest.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.930
Some people-- for Green
Mountain employees on the floor,

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.450
it's their locker room.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.250
They just find a
mindfulness zone,

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.880
somewhere in the
building, in the office,

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.340
where it's your
cue to just pause,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.590
to put away your smartphone, to
stop the incessant chattering

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.351
of the mind and
actually just check in.

00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:07.350
And you can practice the
same kind of meditation

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.560
we did even if you're
just standing up.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.019
For me, it sometimes
the elevator.

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:13.560
When I take the elevator up to
the cafeteria in "The New York

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.470
Times" building, I just
try to put my phone away.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.410
And it's just 30 seconds or so.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.580
But when I get off that
elevator, I'm somewhat renewed.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.360
I'm refreshed.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.490
It's a purposeful
pause that's allowed

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.640
me to just recenter
myself and carry on.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.960
So what is all this doing?

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.907
Well, one thing is it's
making us less stressed.

00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:35.240
Mindfulness, it's been proven
through study after study,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.840
can actually reduce
our stress levels.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.550
We've heard it from the
different companies,

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.860
but there's a lot of academic
and scientific research

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.882
that proves as much.

00:25:41.882 --> 00:25:44.090
It's one of the reasons that
Jon Kabat-Zinn zeroed in

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.120
on mindfulness-based
stress reduction.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.460
Mindfulness is a universal
sort of suffering.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.960
It's something we
all can relate to.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.140
We'd all love to be
less stressed, right?

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.160
And so he didn't say that
mindfulness is about making us,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.900
you know, enlightened
or anything.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.560
He said, just make us
a little less stressed.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.326
That would be a
good thing, indeed.

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:02.700
And the World
Health Organization

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.617
estimates that stress costs
businesses $300 billion a year.

00:26:06.617 --> 00:26:09.200
Now, that's, like, one of those
abstract numbers from studies.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.450
I don't actually know what it
means, but I take the point.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.050
If we're all a
little less stressed,

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.350
I got to believe that businesses
would be a bit more functional,

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.700
maybe even a bit
more profitable.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.550
Mindfulness also seems
to improve our focus.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.190
Just think about the exercise
we did, bringing our attention

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.060
back to the breath
over and over.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.130
Just as going to the gym
builds the muscles in our arms,

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.430
so, too, mindfulness can build
up those attentional muscles,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:39.110
our capacity to sustain our
focus, to stay concentrated.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.030
And there's a great study that
shows that meditation actually

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.000
reduces task switching.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.120
So that is they gave office
workers a series of tasks,

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.800
then they measured
how they did them.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.550
And no surprise, they were
kind of balking back and forth.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.800
They did email for 30 minutes.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.700
They did a little PowerPoint.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.130
They balked to their calendar.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.550
They wrote a report.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.850
They made an itinerary.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.970
Then they trained them
all in mindfulness,

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.576
waited awhile, and
tried it again.

00:27:04.576 --> 00:27:05.450
And what did they do?

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.380
The office workers, this
time, stayed on task

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.100
for almost double
the amount of time.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.444
So they weren't super employees.

00:27:12.444 --> 00:27:14.360
They didn't get everything
done twice as fast,

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.130
but they were actually
able to sustain their focus

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.230
on basic tasks in
the office and not

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.530
have this perpetual constant
ADD from which so many of us

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.660
suffer.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.790
This focus, this kind
of being in the zone,

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.960
is, I think, why
a lot of athletes

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.689
are finding meditation to
be so effective as well.

00:27:31.689 --> 00:27:33.230
This is Russell
Okung, also appearing

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.659
in the Super Bowl on Sunday.

00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:35.950
You'd think I'm a Seahawks fan.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.270
I'm actually a Patriots
fan, but the Seahwaks

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.720
have really embraced this.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.560
And he talks about
meditation as being

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.220
just as important
as lifting weights.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.630
It's about quieting your mind.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.990
And from a 6 foot 6, 300
pound guy with a $48 million

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.040
contract, I'm not going
to argue with him.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.550
Also this focus is one of
the reasons why meditation

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.260
seems to improve test scores.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.680
They've done a series
of tests and studies

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.990
that show that compared to
control groups that haven't had

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.370
mindfulness training,
the students that

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.420
have had mindfulness training
seem to perform better

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.550
on standardized test
scores in the US.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.196
This is a good time to mention
that this isn't all just coming

00:28:14.196 --> 00:28:14.820
out of nowhere.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.630
For the last several
decades, neuroscientists

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.220
have been studying the
minds of meditators,

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.010
trying to understand what's
going on in their heads.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.610
And this study of
meditation has coincided

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.630
with a shift in the
world of neuroscience

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.460
where they actually
have re-thought

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.110
about the way we
understand our brains.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.290
For a long time, much
of the 20th century,

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.090
it was assumed that the
brain kind of matured,

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.740
it degraded, and that was it.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.756
Now we know that
there's actually

00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:45.130
something called
neuroplasticity.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.360
Our brains respond to whatever
stimulus we put in them.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.780
That's why in the
brains of violinists

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.020
the part of the brain
responsible for acute motor

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.450
function is much more highly
developed than in my brain,

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.010
for example.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.260
And in the minds of meditators,
certain areas of the brain

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.834
also appear to
become more robust.

00:29:05.834 --> 00:29:07.750
The prefrontal cortex,
which is evolutionarily

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.090
the newest part of our brain, it
actually shows more gray matter

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.870
in the brains of
mindfulness meditators.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.500
This is the part of the brain
responsible for higher order

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.590
processing, our reason,
our executive functioning.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.710
And then the amygdala, which is
a little seahorse shaped region

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.710
in the center of our brain that
releases stress hormones when

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.090
we get anxious, when we
have that fight or flight

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.130
reaction-- in the minds of
meditators, it's less reactive.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.430
It releases fewer hormones
when we do have a stimulus.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.140
And again, there's that pause
between stimulus and response.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.680
Mindfulness seems to give us
a bit more room right there.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.739
So here's scans of the minds
of a non-meditator on the left.

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:49.530
This is your brain.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:50.905
This is your brain
on meditation.

00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:53.070
That's more gray matter
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:56.080
I also had my brain scanned at
Yale by a great neuroscientist

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.692
named Jud Brewer, and
this is what they found.

00:30:00.692 --> 00:30:03.150
And mindfulness, of course,
doesn't just change our brains.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.400
It changes our bodies, too.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.820
We heard it from others earlier.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.660
It can help the immune system.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.810
There's an amazing study
that Jon Kabat-Zinn did.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:13.393
It was one of the seminal ones
that really put him on the map.

00:30:13.393 --> 00:30:19.580
He gave the flu vaccine
to a large group.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.840
Then they gave them mindfulness
meditation to half the group.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.640
And compared to
the control group,

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.920
those with the
mindfulness meditation,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.020
their immune systems responded
so much more strongly.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.520
And another amazing study
about patients with psoriasis,

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.680
the skin defect--
they gave mindfulness

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.840
meditation to
psoriasis patients who

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.700
were getting standard
light box treatment.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.520
This is where they put them
in a kind of UV light box.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.710
It helps with the
skin irritation.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.940
And the patients that had
mindfulness meditation

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.320
at the same time as the UV
responded and healed much,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.750
much faster than those who
were only getting the light box

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.420
therapy.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.220
So less stressed, more
focused, maybe even

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.520
healthier-- what about
more compassionate,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.230
maybe even kinder, too?

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:12.160
That's the message from
this guy, Tim Ryan.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.680
He's a congressman
on Capitol Hill, part

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.070
of the House of
Representatives, which

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.140
is about the least
mindful place in America

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.600
after "The New York
Times" newsroom.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.280
And he, for a long time,
was not a meditator.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.760
He's a 6 foot 4
college quarterback

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.506
from Ohio, red-blooded
Catholic guy.

00:31:34.506 --> 00:31:35.880
After his second
term, though, he

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.380
was preparing to get sworn
in for his third term,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.980
and the bickering, the
partisan fighting in Congress,

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.447
was just too much for him.

00:31:43.447 --> 00:31:44.280
He needed something.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.530
He heard about Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.840
He went on a short retreat
with Jon Kabat-Zinn,

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.970
and he came back renewed.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.120
He said, this is it.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.520
He wrote a book called
"A Mindful Nation."

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.520
He's become the most
unlikely meditation advocate

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.280
in the country.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.860
He has quiet time caucus.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.350
They meditate before
sessions on Capitol Hill.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.220
There he is in his office.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.890
And he is just doing
amazing things,

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.390
even if the rest of
Congress can't get onboard.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.930
But I said, Tim, what has
actually been the difference?

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.590
I mean, how has it changed
the way you do your job?

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.130
And he said so often
before his calculations,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.630
the bills he was
going to introduce,

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.310
the legislation he
was going to support,

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.160
was based on his own
impression of what

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.700
he was supposed to be doing.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.840
What was going to advance
his political career?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.440
What was the right
move for the party?

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.940
Instead, he says now, he's
really much more in touch

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.160
with his constituents.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.326
He's gotten out of his own
head, and he has the time

00:32:37.326 --> 00:32:41.380
to really listen to people
from Columbus and Cincinnati,

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.930
the cities he represents.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.780
And he says, you
actually slow down enough

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.030
to pay attention to someone
other than yourself-- more

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.000
sympathetic, empathetic,
or compassionate.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.600
And it's an
extraordinary testament,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.240
and he's doing very good
work allocating resources

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.780
to veterans, to schools
in his home district,

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.450
trying to bring mindfulness
into schools and VA centers.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.960
So maybe a bit more
compassionate on the margins,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.856
socially responsible,
perhaps, as well-- this guy

00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:09.480
would argue so.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.490
This is Yvon Chouinard.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.590
He's the founder of Patagonia,
the apparel company,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.840
a long-time Zen Buddhist, even
before he founded Patagonia.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.800
And he created a
very unusual company.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.160
They don't necessarily teach
meditation at the Patagonia

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.590
campus, even though it's
a very idyllic place.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.590
Instead, he's really
empowered his top executives

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.440
to bring the attitude
of mindfulness-- mindful

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.030
consumption, an awareness
of the company's impact

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.310
on the planet-- into all
their business decisions.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.640
So once a year, they
run this ad that says

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.430
don't buy this jacket.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.650
And it's a really
subversive thing.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.430
They're saying, you
may want this jacket.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.210
But guess what?

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.660
You probably don't need it.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.370
So it's asking us just
to question ourselves.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.550
And it plays into
this broader movement

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.140
called mindful
consumption, where

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.440
the principles of
mindfulness are trying

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.920
to be put in and adopted by
retailers, who are asking us

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.330
not to consume more and more
and more, as we're want to do,

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.100
but actually to
take what we need.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.469
And Yvon, I asked him.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.310
I said, this can't be
good for your business.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.699
And he said, I think we
can reach more people

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:21.639
but sell less to
each one of them.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:22.400
That's his goal.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.460
He would like you to not buy
five Patagonia products a year.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.340
He'd rather you buy one
Patagonia product every five

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.190
years but have a much broader
audience around the world.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.480
And that's their mission.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.710
Another example
is Eileen Fisher.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.469
She, on the other hand, was
not a long-time meditator.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:42.840
She developed a very successful
company-- her own brand,

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.522
Eileen Fisher women's clothing.

00:34:44.522 --> 00:34:45.230
And it was great.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.360
It was a success.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.909
But she got well
into her career,

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.989
and she was feeling
somewhat empty.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.280
So she started practicing yoga.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.346
She started
practicing meditation,

00:34:54.346 --> 00:34:55.929
and all of a sudden,
the world kind of

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:58.080
opened up to her as it
did with Mark Bertolini.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.240
And she realized she
had a responsibility

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.400
not only to her
employees, but also

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.810
to her customers and
the environment as well.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.530
And so she started by
changing just the way

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.810
things worked at the company.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.460
She did away with square tables.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.920
Everyone has meetings
in a circle now.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.690
She offered meditation
and mindfulness,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.810
did away with some of
the corporate hierarchy.

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.570
And guess what?

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.420
Her employees, no
surprise, loved it.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.217
But then she made that step
that Green Mountain coffee did.

00:35:26.217 --> 00:35:27.800
She said, well, what
about the workers

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.230
at the very end of
my supply chain?

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.320
A lot of her clothes were made
in China, and so she said,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.700
I have a responsibility
to these people as well.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.950
She started offering education,
better health care, and then

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.020
women's entrepreneurship
programs,

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.522
trying to get her factory
workers actually out

00:35:48.522 --> 00:35:49.230
of her factories.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.500
She wants them to start
their own businesses--

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.940
and just another extraordinary
example of something

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.030
Eileen says she has
done, motivated largely

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.600
by her mindfulness and
meditation practice.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.960
So in some of these
examples, mindfulness

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:10.290
has come from the top down--
Mark Bertolini, Eileen Fisher.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.599
Executives decided they
were into it, pushed it down

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:13.390
to their employees.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:16.100
Other examples, like Janice
Marturano, bottom up.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.530
So mindfulness is happening
in all sorts of ways,

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.390
and it's still
pretty early days.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.730
And what are some ways we
can be mindful at work?

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.900
Well, we did our
sitting meditation.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.720
And bringing that same
quality of attention

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.140
to eating a sandwich,
picking up the phone,

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.840
or just riding the elevator
can all be effective techniques

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.540
to just slow down in the middle
of our very, very busy work

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.224
days.

00:36:37.224 --> 00:36:38.640
And now, if we
just have a minute,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.540
I'd love to hear some ways
that you all are mindful.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.650
And if we could, I'll
just turn to the audience.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.420
And I think a mic's
going around, just

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.200
for a couple people.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.730
And I'm going to
put Don on the spot

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.200
here because he's actually
my host, generous host,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.440
but also has done Search
Inside Yourself and gPlus.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.170
So what are some
ways that you've

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.450
found to be able to
be mindful at work?

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:08.490
DON: So I mean aside from
our daily sits, obviously,

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.380
just taking a little bit
of extra time to consider

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.480
replies that I'm
sending, especially

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.060
in emails since we're a
very email driven company.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.340
As many people are
aware, email is actually

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.610
a really terrible
communications medium.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.560
So taking a few extra
seconds after you've

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.830
written an email, if it's a
particularly sensitive topic

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.890
especially, maybe step
away from the computer.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.460
Go make myself a tea, have a
few minutes or a few seconds

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.840
of really thinking, getting
focused, getting together,

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.120
and not taking that instinctive
reaction of, you know,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.240
sort of irritation or
grumpiness that you often get

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.420
and using that opportunity
to tone things down,

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.700
that's actually made
people a lot more receptive

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.700
to what I'm asking them to do.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.930
And I think it's made
people-- it's made it easier

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.434
for me to communicate
with teammates in London,

00:38:00.434 --> 00:38:01.850
teammates in
California, teammates

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.710
in other parts of the world.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.095
And that for me has been a
big improvement, definitely.

00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:08.220
DAVID GELLES: That's great.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.178
I mean, that sounds like
that purposeful pause,

00:38:10.178 --> 00:38:13.420
just stopping, being a bit more
mindful before we automatically

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:13.920
react.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.570
Is there anyone else?

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.170
Can we get one or two more
people maybe who have practiced

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.820
or who have found ways to
just be a little bit more

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.084
mindful at work?

00:38:22.084 --> 00:38:23.000
I'm going pick on you.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.541
Yeah, please.

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.940
AUDIENCE: I'm trying not
to eat my lunch at my desk.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.810
And even if you're
really busy, just

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.300
trying to get up and step away.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.585
And even if it's just sitting by
yourself and having your lunch,

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:40.385
you know, just away from all
the chatter with your teammates

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:41.340
and things like that.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.464
DAVID GELLES: That's great.

00:38:42.464 --> 00:38:43.590
Is there one more maybe?

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.210
Yeah, please.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.780
DAVID GELLES: Say it one
more time to the mic.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.750
AUDIENCE: When I am challenged
to [INAUDIBLE] my password

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.860
for OTP, I normally
just pause for a moment.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.370
DAVID GELLES: That's great.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.540
AUDIENCE: And my
specific variety of pause

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.152
is typically a prayer.

00:39:02.152 --> 00:39:05.040
So it's a Christian
variant of this,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.290
but I find this same value.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.150
DAVID GELLES:
Absolutely, that's great.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.710
OK, well, we just heard
a bunch of great ideas.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.850
So I just need your
feedback one more time.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.830
You are all a overly sympathetic
audience to begin with.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.340
But let's just see again.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.820
After hearing the
stories of executives

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.650
around the world
who are practicing

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.920
this and the studies that have
been done, quick show of hands.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.430
Zero is it's hokum.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.530
10 is you're all signing
up for sitting tomorrow.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.460
Where are we?

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.490
Let's see.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.230
All right, I see more
fingers than I did before.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.120
That's good news.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.200
Unfortunately,
mindfulness is no panacea.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.740
It's not going to make
your boss behave better.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.130
It's not going to make
the workday any shorter.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.606
It's not going to automatically
give you that raise.

00:39:45.606 --> 00:39:47.480
But I hope I've demonstrated
that mindfulness

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.000
can in fact help
make us a little less

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.530
stressed, a little healthier,
more focused, maybe even

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.760
kinder and compassionate,
maybe even a bit more socially

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.120
responsible.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.570
And since I started writing this
book, it's just gotten going.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.390
We're still early days, but
the momentum is extraordinary.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.840
"60 Minutes," Anderson Cooper
just did a big segment on.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.190
And it appeared on the
cover of "Time" magazine.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.330
Other tech companies,
like Intel and Adobe,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.930
are adopting this
at breakneck speed.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.090
And when I hear the good
work you're all doing here

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.170
and the tips that everyone
just naturally knows,

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.570
I really believe that
mindfulness and meditation

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.420
are on the verge of, in
a very good way, changing

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.550
the way we work.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.670
Thank you all very much.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.860
I'm happy to take any
questions if there are any.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.120
Yeah, please, do you want
to get the mic first?

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.880
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.780
It was great.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.150
I'm just wondering, since
we're a technology company,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.660
whether you think
that mindfulness

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.920
and some sort of,
like, inner serenity

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.300
is compatible with where
technology is going.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.370
Because it looks like the
trend is developing technology

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.450
to grab more and more
of our attention.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:11.130
So I was wondering if you
think it's totally compatible

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.100
or if there's a way to
actually build technology

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.605
for people to also
be able to detach.

00:41:17.605 --> 00:41:18.980
DAVID GELLES: The
answer is both.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.640
It's an incredible
tension right now.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.400
And I think it's
one of the ironies

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.740
that Silicon Valley
is really the heart

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.029
of this mindfulness movement
in the United States.

00:41:29.029 --> 00:41:30.570
I mean, there are
more tech companies

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.830
than in any other sector
that are adopting this.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.270
So on the one hand,
yeah, having that screen

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.160
and that instant
impulse, I'm not always

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.400
mindful when I'm looking at
my iPhone and I-- or Android--

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.840
and I look at my Android
far too many times a day.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.920
So on the one hand, it's
absolutely distracting us.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.130
On the other hand,
there are apps

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.240
that are actually helping
us be much more mindful.

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.340
Headspace, I think, is
a company that Google's

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.565
worked with, founded by a
Brit named Andy Puddicombe.

00:41:57.565 --> 00:42:00.190
It's fantastic,
and it actually is

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.980
kind of subverting technology
and using it to give us

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.660
cues and techniques
and tools and exercises

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.940
to become more mindful.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.881
Another thing that's
happened is they are just

00:42:08.881 --> 00:42:11.130
starting to develop these
neurofeedback devices, where

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.460
you can actually look at
how your brain waves are

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.110
performing.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.260
And I did this.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.960
When I had my head rigged
up to that EEG machine,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.720
I was actually watching
my brain waves.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.820
And when I meditated,
I could actually

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.090
see certain parts of
the electro activity

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.490
in my brain become more subdued.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.720
And it was then that
I was being mindful.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.480
And so there are, perhaps,
technologies on the horizon

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.020
that are going to actually
help us train our attention.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.820
On balance, though, I
got to give it to you.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.270
I mean, technology is
distracting us more and more,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:45.840
which I would argue is why
it's more important than ever

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.060
that we find these moments,
that we find ways to be mindful

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.312
amidst all the technology.

00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:54.650
Yeah, any other questions?

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.250
Yeah, please.

00:42:58.712 --> 00:43:00.920
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about kind of uptake or buy

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.210
in from people based on age.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.150
So we had-- I joined
from LinkedIn,

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.910
and we had Fred Kofman,
who's the coach of our--

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.044
Jeff Weiner and also
Sheryl Sandberg.

00:43:11.044 --> 00:43:12.710
So I don't know if
you know Fred Kofman.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.610
He's pretty Buddhist, I think.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.940
But he went in front
of a mass audience

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.100
of thousands of employees.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.540
And we found that a lot
of the younger employees,

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.892
it may not sink in as much.

00:43:22.892 --> 00:43:25.350
And also a lot of the examples
that you gave people, people

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.184
were, say, older, middle
aged or however you

00:43:27.184 --> 00:43:28.016
want to definite it.

00:43:28.016 --> 00:43:30.030
So I was wondering if
you've looked at that.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.320
DAVID GELLES: I haven't, but I
think my initial impression is

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.010
that it's pretty
inter-generational.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.380
And I think it largely depends
on the corporate culture.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.720
And it's something I
didn't mention in the talk,

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.505
but there's no one
way to do this.

00:43:42.505 --> 00:43:45.090
I mean, Google has
SIYLI, and it's

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.680
got the Search Inside Yourself
leadership Institute, which

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.460
is trying to offer the Search
Inside Yourself curriculum

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.327
to other companies.

00:43:51.327 --> 00:43:52.910
And they're doing
some very good work,

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:56.360
but I think they're are also
finding that what works here

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.962
isn't going to necessarily
work at every company.

00:43:58.962 --> 00:44:00.920
That's because this is
very sensitive material.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.760
And so what I just demonstrated,
there's a whole range of ways

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.080
that this is showing up.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.466
And I think in a company
like General Mills,

00:44:08.466 --> 00:44:10.090
for example, where
the average employee

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.530
age is a bit older, they really
went in through the leadership

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:14.030
angle.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.660
They said, this is
going to help you,

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.580
and these are
techniques and tools

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.730
that are going up help you
excel in a management role.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.190
At a company like Medium,
Evan Williams' new company,

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.120
it's really for these
young engineers,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.250
an amazing group of very
young, talented guys

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.710
is San Francisco-- guys
and girls, excuse me.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.000
They are really using it to
be more focused and on the job

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.950
and more productive.

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.452
Because that's a
fast-moving startup up.

00:44:39.452 --> 00:44:41.910
I didn't mention them, but they
have an amazing mindfulness

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.680
curriculum, working
with actually the son

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.430
of Jon Kabat-Zinn, who comes
in twice a week now, to Medium.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.710
So I'm going to try
to resist being ageist

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:53.650
and be optimistic that it's
really accessible to people

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.840
on all ends of the spectrum.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.930
Another question?

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.565
Yeah, Sam, is it?

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.259
AUDIENCE: Sam.

00:45:02.259 --> 00:45:03.050
DAVID GELLES: Yeah.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.510
I, like quite a
lot of people here,

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.680
do commute quite long distances.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.810
And whilst I'm committed to
trying to introduce moments

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.620
to pause whilst at work, do you
have any top tips for people

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.960
who want to make the
most of that, what

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.570
can be at times
quite stressful time,

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.460
and transform it into one that
can be a bit more mentally

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.100
nourishing?

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.100
DAVID GELLES:
Absolutely, I also try

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.479
to be mindful on the subway
of New York City, which

00:45:36.479 --> 00:45:38.770
at rush hour, going through
Times Square where "The New

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:43.410
York Times" is located is
about all but impossible.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.600
And so the one that
I've been working on

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.470
is actually mindful walking,
and not just focusing

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.980
on the subtle
sensations of my body,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.480
but actually just being
more spatially aware.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.180
And in a very
crowded environment,

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.590
I find that if I'm much
more attuned to my own body

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.360
and its relation to
other people around me,

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.940
I have less time to
just be caught up

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.040
and be anxious and
be kind of frustrated

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.800
with someone next to me and
someone pushing against me.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.220
But I actually then
move a bit more

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.850
deliberately through
those crowds.

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:19.150
And so it seems ironic to
try to be actually more

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:22.220
aware of perhaps the last
place you'd like to be,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.186
a crowded subway, but actually
bringing my attention to it

00:46:25.186 --> 00:46:26.560
rather than just
trying to resist

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.800
it is actually
counter intuitively

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.790
the thing that I
find helps most.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:31.550
So I don't know.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:32.175
Give it a shot.

00:46:32.175 --> 00:46:35.960
If it doesn't work,
try Headspace, an app.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.012
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:37.012 --> 00:46:39.674
DAVID GELLES: Yeah, please.

00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:41.840
AUDIENCE: It kind of links
to the previous question,

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.390
actually, but a lot of the
examples in that were kind of I

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.150
guess people reaching
a stage in life,

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:52.610
having a catastrophic event
or a bit of an epiphany

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.360
or a life-changing moment
and kind of finding something

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.230
within themselves and having
that sort of realization.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.220
With that in mind,
and sort of that

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.690
being an obvious way in which
lots of people come to this--

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.670
you can kind of
understand why-- how

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.880
do you best share this
with people who are maybe

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.430
slightly more on the
skeptic sort of scale?

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.930
DAVID GELLES: It's
a great question,

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:18.230
and I wish I had the
most easy answer.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.650
But I guess I'd say,
even if we don't

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.700
have a life-changing,
catastrophic event,

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.210
we're all stressed.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.930
And I think that's
why Jon Kabat-Zinn has

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:27.930
been so successful with
mindfulness-based stress

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.020
reduction-- tens of thousands of
people he's trained personally.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:33.800
And if you just go in
through that door-- like,

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.550
are you stressed?

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:35.820
Yes, we're all stressed.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.840
Would you like to be just
a little bit less stressed?

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.310
Yeah, OK.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:44.160
And so even though we might
not have a catastrophe,

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.970
I think we're all suffering
in these little ways that

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.820
really do add up.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:53.210
So I don't feel like that's
entirely satisfactory answer

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.600
myself, but I think
it's where we're at.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.560
And a lot of people
do respond to even

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.559
those small, small changes.

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:03.100
Yeah, please.

00:48:06.524 --> 00:48:07.940
AUDIENCE: I just
have a quick one.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.040
Thanks for the talk.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.620
So we shared a lot of tips
for informal practice.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.657
I was wondering what is
your formal practice?

00:48:15.657 --> 00:48:17.990
DAVID GELLES: My formal
practice over the last 10 months

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:21.640
has been disrupted by a little
girl who's now 10 months old,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.020
which is amazing.

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:27.600
And, really, she's my
greatest teacher now.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.000
How many people in
the room are parents?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.920
As you know, these little people
demand your entire presence

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.160
all the time.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.480
They will not let you slip.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.810
And I catch myself
when it's 5:00 AM.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:43.450
She's up.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:46.720
She wants to party, and I'm
still fast asleep in my head.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.570
And it's so easy just
to glance at my iPhone.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.810
And so it's just every time
I find myself doing that,

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:54.220
it's this queue to put
it down and actually just

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.530
be present, be
attentive with her.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.240
So all of which is to
say, my formal practice,

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:03.100
until 10 months ago,
involved usually

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.850
in the morning--
that's when I sit best.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.770
At the end of the day,
I find I'm so wound up

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.910
and I've got so many
things in my head

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:09.020
it's a little bit harder.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.910
So for me, it tends
to be in the morning,

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.850
and I would sit anywhere
from 5 to 15 minutes,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.440
during the weekday, to 50
minutes on the weekends.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.650
Now, I'd say I get to
do that kind of formal

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:23.050
sitting practice less regularly,
a few times throughout the week

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:23.670
maybe.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.100
But then I also have a group
of friends and professionals--

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.990
bankers, TV producers,
executives in New York City.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.410
We meet a couple times
a month in the evening,

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:34.320
and we'll sit together
and have a discussion

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.460
about how things are going.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.390
And then I also go
to evening workshops

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:42.540
at local meditation
centers in New York.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.630
And I do feel like that's
less formal practice than I

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:47.550
might like.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:51.960
But having had a roughly
formal practice for 15 years,

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.610
it's given me kind of
some momentum where

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.660
those little moments
throughout the day

00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:02.210
are able to help maintain
some measure of equanimity.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:05.070
Would I like to have
kind of my daily hour

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.200
where no one bothered me?

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.900
Absolutely, but as a mergers
and acquisitions reporter

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.110
with a 10-month-old,
not always so easy.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.310
And that's true for everyone
in this room, I'm sure.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.720
We all have very busy schedules,
so finding those little moments

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.200
throughout the day, throughout
the week, are crucial.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.090
But they're possible.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.540
Any other questions?

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.582
OK, oh, yeah, please.

00:50:28.582 --> 00:50:30.082
AUDIENCE: The cover
is yellow there.

00:50:30.082 --> 00:50:31.460
You changed it to blue.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.100
Is there any reason for that?

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:32.930
DAVID GELLES: My publisher
changed it to blue.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.970
So yellow is the US edition.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.467
Blue is international.

00:50:37.467 --> 00:50:38.550
AUDIENCE: Do you know why?

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:39.270
DAVID GELLES: I don't.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.811
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:39.811 --> 00:50:42.640
DAVID GELLES: Yeah, the
mysteries of the universe.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.820
Thank you all so much.
