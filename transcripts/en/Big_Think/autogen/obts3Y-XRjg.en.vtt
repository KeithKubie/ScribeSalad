necessary patch or Cluj or as we say
safety net wealthy societies have to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880
safety net wealthy societies have to
 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.650
safety net wealthy societies have to
provide what the market by design cannot

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660
provide what the market by design cannot
 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.900
provide what the market by design cannot
