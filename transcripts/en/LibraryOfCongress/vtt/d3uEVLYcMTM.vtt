00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.080
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.140 position:56%
I'm Ron Charles, Editor of the
Washington Post Book Section and I'm

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.820 position:56%
so delighted that you're here today.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.210
First, a word of thanks for our
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.940
David Rubinstein, and many
other sponsors who've made this

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.240
event possible.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.020 position:56%
And if you'd like to make a
financial donation to this festival,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.170
there's information in your
program to make that happen.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.260
We will have some time for
questions when I'm done.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.050
There's a microphone
there and there.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440 position:56%
If you come to the microphone to
ask a question, you will be recorded

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950
and become part of the
Library's permanent collection.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.880
So if that's not something you
want to do, stay in your seat.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.030
Okay. My guest this afternoon is
Lauren Groff, the author of two

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
of my favorite novels,
"Arcadia" and "Fates and Furies."

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.140
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.680
But she has much bigger
fans than me.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.140
Her first book, "Monsters of
Templeton," got a rave review

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.490
from Stephen King, who
was just here a few hours.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.790
&gt;&gt; I know, yeah.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.090
&gt;&gt; Probably looking
for your autograph.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.390
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.490
&gt;&gt; And her most recent, listen
to this, her most recent novel,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.630
"Fates and Furies," was
President Obama's favorite book.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.850
Thank you so much for
being here today.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you for doing this with me.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.610
Thank you for being here.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.910
This is really lovely.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.210
&gt;&gt; It is. Now let's start.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.440
Since we're in Washington, what
is it like to have the leader

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.980
of the free world recommend
your book?

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.230
&gt;&gt; So I passed out.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.530
I really did.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.830
I really did.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.130
I was like, what just happened?

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760
Came to, called my husband and
was like, get home, right now.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.810
And he came home, and I said
you don't have champagne, go.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.250
And he went out and got
champagne, and came back.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.120
So the thing is, I
was really astonished

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.750
that he has time for fiction.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.060
&gt;&gt; But not surprised, because
he's a good human being, right?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.360
Yes.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.020
&gt;&gt; How did you hear, though?

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.940
What was the actual moment
when you heard the news?

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay, believe it or not, Twitter.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.360
I was on Twitter, and
someone tweeted it at me.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.660
And I said, that's not true.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.270
And I went and then I saw it
in People Magazine, which,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.790
again, it was very surreal.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.880
And I'm just astonished.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.180
But you know what?

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.970
He's such a kind and
gracious human being

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.410
that he actually sent
a note to my house.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.710
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.830
&gt;&gt; Which I framed, and it's the
thing after the kids and the dog

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
that I will save if it ever comes
to that, because I love the man.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.950
&gt;&gt; The dogs and the kids,
they will leave you.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; They will run away, but I will go

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.470
and get the framed note
from Barack Obama, yeah.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.770
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.920
I should also note that "Fates
and Furies" was shortlisted

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.500
for the National Book Award,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.660
the National Book Critics
Circle Award, the Kirkus Award.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.380
It was on dozens of best-seller
lists, including ours.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.980
&gt;&gt; And recommended lists,
end-of-the-year lists.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.340
It was just a tremendous,
tremendous novel.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.610
People who don't know, "Fates
and Furies" is about a long

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.240
and passionate marriage between
a very successful playwright

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.540
and his wife.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.780
The first half of the novel
focuses on the husband,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.010
and the second half
focuses on the wife.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.760
And they turn out to have very
different lives, and very,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.290
very different perspectives,
both of them fascinating.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.590
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.020
&gt;&gt; Now, Lotto is brilliant and
vain and self-aggrandizing,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.720
but he's really sort of
charming, too, and wonderful.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.040
And Mathilde is quiet
and supportive and meek,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.800 position:56%
but also kind of sneaky and furious.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.640 position:56%
Yes. Now, you haven't really written
enough novels to have a type,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.700
but I was completely
surprised by this novel.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If it's not a departure, it seems
like a really daring novel to write

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.700
in so many ways, and did
you start thinking about it

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.660
as a novel in two distinct halves?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.910 position:56%
How did that whole structure evolve?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.160
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, I actually
thought four or five years,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.400
I was writing two separate novels,
because I wanted to do Mr. Bridge

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.010
and Mrs. Bridge, but like redux.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.800
And it didn't work out at
all, at all, in any way.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.570
And, so I gave it to my agent,
who's a great, great mega agent,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.540
and we were sitting at
this sort of dive vegan,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.850
I don't even know what it was, cafÃ©
in New York City, and I was picking

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.690
up this piece of [inaudible] cake.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.630 position:56%
And he goes, "Lauren," and he sits
forward, and he pushes the two parts

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.770
of the book, which I thought were
two books, together, and he goes,

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.840
"You have made a marriage, two
autonomous parts within a whole."

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.230
And I was like, "Oh,
you're a genius!

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.530
Thank you!"

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.830
So, yeah, it is.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.420
Then I had to do a lot of work
after that, but he helped a lot.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.720
&gt;&gt; You weren't resistant.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.020
You realized instantly that's --

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.340
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, I cried.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.790
I always cry whenever he talks
to me, but after a good --

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.490
after about two hours, I
ended up being okay with it,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.680
and realizing he's right.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.010
I mean it's a marriage
in a lot of ways.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.610
He's always right,
and I'm always wrong.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.170
&gt;&gt; It's tempting to think that
Lotto is the wholly deluded one,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.400
and then we find out the
truth in the second half,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.510
but it's really not so
simple at all, is it?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.680
&gt;&gt; No. No, I tried hard not to do
that, but of course, if you believe

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.720 position:56%
that this book is actually Mathilde,
that's kind of okay with me,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.640
because one of my inspirations
was Vera Nabokov,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.450
and she was this mega
genius herself,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.950
but she completely effaced herself.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.450
And Stacy Schiff is here.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.310
She wrote this beautiful,
beautiful book about Vera.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.520
And that was actually the
inspiration behind a part

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520
of -- that part of the book.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.510
And if, so if you do believe that
the book is actually Mathilde's,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.420
it's almost revenge for all

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.510
of the wives who've had
to hide in the corner.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.010
But in truth, I actually
really wanted it to be a story

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.270
that could be truthful in
multiple different ways, right.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.330 position:56%
I wanted to have it sort of resound,
depending on where you, the reader,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.650
are in your life, in any particular
way that you respond to it.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.950
There's no single truth.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.850
&gt;&gt; It is very unstable.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.450
&gt;&gt; In a fascinating way.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.750
It seems very traditional
in some sense.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.690
You've got this outgoing,
successful man,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.660
and then the power
behind the throne,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.510
this woman who's pulling
all the strings.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.010 position:56%
But in the second half, we find out
that's so much more complex, that --

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.960
I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing
her name.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.260
Mathilde?

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.780
&gt;&gt; That's how I say it, but you
can say it however you like.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.080
You're [inaudible].

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.380
It's good.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No. So I'm thinking Lady Macbeth.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.280
&gt;&gt; Livia.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.880
&gt;&gt; The Emperor's wife.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.180
As you thought about
her personality,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.590
did she take on that sort of
maniacal character for you?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.330
Or did she remain a
really human person?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.620
&gt;&gt; For me, she was
always very, very human,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.190
which means that like every other
human in my life, I may love her,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.740
but I don't necessarily
like her, right?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.690
I say this -- I'm the mother of two
small children, and you love them

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.280
so desperately, but they're hard to
like sometimes, and it's very true.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.960
So throughout, I saw her as
this person that, in many ways,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.560
I would actually like to be
like Mathilde in certain ways.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.470
She is so clear-sighted.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; She's so able to sort of know how
a small change right now will affect

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.450
everybody else in the future.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.370
So she's almost like a mathematical
genius in a certain way,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.760
but she's so reserved, right?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.060
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.470
&gt;&gt; And she's self-effacing,
but in a self-willed way

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.310
that makes her somewhat
difficult to cling to.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.600
And she's really, really angry.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.960
She's furious.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.390
And that part of her I
really liked, actually.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.280
I love her rage.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.160
I think it's the animating
feature of her.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
&gt;&gt; I want to talk about
rage for a minute.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.760
&gt;&gt; Because it's such a --

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.060
we use that as such a way to
denigrate women, don't we?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.270 position:56%
They cannot ever be bitter or angry.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.640
Strong, yes, maybe, but
not angry or bitter.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.670
And I think the way you bring
that out is so powerful.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.640
There's a lot of mythology
in your earlier works.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.200
It's, I think, very evident.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.180
But there's mythology in
this book, too, isn't there?

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.480
Isn't there?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, I thought at
first you said --

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.810
I thought at first you said
pathology, and I thought --

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.110
&gt;&gt; I lost my voice --

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.410
&gt;&gt; Probably.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.710
&gt;&gt; At the party last night.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.010
I talked way too long.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.310
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.610
&gt;&gt; Mythology.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:11.910
&gt;&gt; There is, there's
a lot of mythology.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.210
Yeah, there's mythology everywhere,
because I can't get away from it,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.510
but I love it so much, right?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.810
Yeah.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's talk
about the mythology.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In your first book, for instance.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.310
&gt;&gt; What -- did you
study those myths?

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.610
Did you love those myths
when you were a child?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.910
What is it about mythology
that you like?

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, in the first book, the
myths were mostly about Cooperstown,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.170
New York, where I'm from.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.690
&gt;&gt; That's a classic America place.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.460
&gt;&gt; It's very Americana, yeah.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.760
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And James Fenimore Cooper is from
there, his father started the town,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.820
but also baseball is, itself,
very much a myth, right?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.120
&gt;&gt; It is mythological, yes.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.420
&gt;&gt; Mythological.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.720
Like the foundation of it.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.650
It actually didn't
start in Cooperstown.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.260
Everybody knows this, and yet they
all go there to the Hall of Fame.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.830 position:56%
My house, when I was growing up, was
a block and half away from the Hall

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.730
of Fame, and so when
Phillies, in particular,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.330
came to celebrate the induction
of Phillies, they would,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.710
like camp out on my yard.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:09.100
But -- so I'm deeply in love
with this idea that we all live

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.660
within this net of stories, right?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.270
&gt;&gt; We were caught in
this net of stories.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.670
And the stories we can
use to tell the story

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.230
of ourselves, in a certain way.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.700
And I think that we can't get away
from the narrative that we spin

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.510
for ourselves, and for our
towns, and for our places.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.560
So in that book, in particular,
is a very local set of myths.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.960
In this book, it's a much
different set of myths.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.270
I think it's much more dependent
on Greek mythology, but also --

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.870
&gt;&gt; The myths of narrative.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.490
A lot of different prototypes
of narrative are happening.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.270
&gt;&gt; You're thinking of Medea?

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.570
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, I am.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.870
Antigone, right?

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.970
Because I actually wrote
an opera about Antigone.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.270
&gt;&gt; You wrote an opera?

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.140
&gt;&gt; Well, in the book
there's an opera.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.040
&gt;&gt; I have read the book.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.490
&gt;&gt; But I tried to write
it as an actual opera,

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:08.170
and no musician wanted
to do it with me.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.730
I was really depressed.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.610
I think it would be amazing, right?

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.490
&gt;&gt; Maybe there'd be a
puppet in the middle of it?

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.410
Dancers? I can see razzmatazz.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:23.220
But I think in this particular
case, what I was so fascinated

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:29.380
by is the idea that Greek mythology
exists within a separate kind

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.020
of plane of storytelling.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.970
I mean, the stories that we tell
now feel very terrestrial, right?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.630
You're walking on the earth,
you're going from one place

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.250
to another in a lot of them.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.200
But Greek mythology exists within
sometimes even competing stories

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.930
of the same characters, right?

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.230
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.840
&gt;&gt; And the gods are these large
overweening characters that sort

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.630
of exist up here, and they're so --

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.390
they're involved in
everything, right?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.930
They're responsible
for everything, but --

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.600
and the mortals are these
little, like, people down here

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.190
that are easily crushed, and -- so
what I like is that there are --

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.730
there's a multiplicity of time
happening with the Greek myths.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.850
&gt;&gt; Because there's this larger
elemental time happening up here,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:19.930
and this small mortal almost
granular time happening down here.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.390
And then you, the consumer
of the myth,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.410
are somewhere in here,
in the middle.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.010
&gt;&gt; And it's almost like
you're in an aquarium, right?

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.310
And these are the sharks and
those are the hermit crabs,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.880
and you can see them
coming in and out.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.020
&gt;&gt; So what I love so much about
it is this idea of flexibility

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.690 position:56%
and layers in terms of storytelling.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.750
I find it so fascinating
and wonderful.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.050
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.510
&gt;&gt; And that's what I
wanted for this book.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.160
That's why I structured
it the way that I did.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.320
&gt;&gt; Aren't you surprised when
you read the myths, like Medea

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.700
and Antigone, how contemporary
and powerful they are?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.000
&gt;&gt; Oh, God, yes.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.300
&gt;&gt; Even though they're --

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.600
I mean, you read some stories
that are 300 years old,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.080
and they're already so dated
you can barely understand them,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.380
they don't speak to you at all.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.760
&gt;&gt; Then you read these plays,
and they seem so immediate.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.730
&gt;&gt; I think part of it is that
they're boiled down to the bones,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.730
in a way that almost the
fairytales are sort of --

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.030
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.330
&gt;&gt; They're just the story.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.540
&gt;&gt; And we put onto the characters
all the flesh as readers.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.860
And the same thing with
the Greek mythology.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.770
But all of the -- what
the Greeks are talking

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.120
about are these elemental emotions.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.420
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.720
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.020
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.320
&gt;&gt; And I don't think, I mean,
human technology has changed,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.100
but humanity has not
changed all that much

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.210
in the past few thousand years.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.940
&gt;&gt; Deeply, I mean, in
terms of emotional.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.540
&gt;&gt; Things.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.380
&gt;&gt; Right. And in "Arcadia,"
it is about mythology

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.790
or the mythologies we create
about our past and our childhood.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.080
Long after Bit realizes what
that commune's really like,

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.060
he still is haunted by what
he imagines it was like.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.180
And those two things compete
for the rest of his life.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.920
&gt;&gt; And what he imagines
it could've been, too.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.220
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.520
&gt;&gt; I mean, he's actually --

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.820
that's the thing that haunts
him the most, I think.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.120
&gt;&gt; And it, of course, it can't be.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.420
&gt;&gt; It could never be, right?

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.120
Because we humans are flawed.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.420
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.720
&gt;&gt; Firmly.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.020
&gt;&gt; All those utopian communities
end in essentially the same --

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.620
&gt;&gt; Way.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.920
&gt;&gt; Except for, I think,
religious communities, which are,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.250
in a way, utopian, right?

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.550
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.850
&gt;&gt; I mean, they could
be seen as utopian.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.180
&gt;&gt; People are devoted to a more
perfect union, so -- and the Amish.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.480
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.780
&gt;&gt; Very successful.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.080
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.380 position:56%
That's still going on, you're right.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.680
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.980
&gt;&gt; And "Fates and Furies" is about
the mythology of marriage in a way.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.950
The stories we tell, the
stories we want to be true,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.610
the stories we cling to even
after we realize it's not true.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.210
&gt;&gt; You're married.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.510
&gt;&gt; I'm very married, yes.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.840
&gt;&gt; I imagine.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.140
&gt;&gt; Where are we going?

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.600
Yes?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.690
&gt;&gt; I imagine a story about two
beautiful people who are married,

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.230
and then you write a
novel about [inaudible].

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.990
I imagine people are
always pestering you

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.500
about the autobiographical roots
of this novel, aren't they?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.800
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.100
&gt;&gt; And it must drive you crazy.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.490
&gt;&gt; No, because I played
with it intentionally.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.790
&gt;&gt; Really.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because I knew as a
female writer, I'm always going

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.630
to be asked these questions.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.540
Men are almost never
asked these questions.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.670
Women are almost always
asked these questions.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.970
&gt;&gt; You sniveling women.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.130
&gt;&gt; We scribbling lady
novelists, that's right.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.490
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.890
&gt;&gt; And, you know, I've been
annoyed by this question

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:25.100
since I've been writing books,
but in the last few books,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.070
in fact the books that have been
published, I have been playing

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.370
with this question a lot.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.970
&gt;&gt; And I've been playing
intentionally

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.370
with the readers' response to it,
because if you can't combat it,

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.670
why not play with it, right?

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.970
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:40.720
&gt;&gt; So I put certain elements
of me into the story,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.740 position:56%
and if you know me really well,
you'll see my husband, particularly,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.780
in Lotto, in a way that
it's a joke, right?

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.060
I mean, he's not Lotto
at all in any way.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.060
&gt;&gt; But I put, I mean, my husband
is 6' 6" and so is Lotto, right?

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.360
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.660
&gt;&gt; We met rowing, right?

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.960
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.610
&gt;&gt; So a lot of things
are in the book,

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.370
seated in the book
intentionally to play

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.350
with this idea of autobiography.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.570
&gt;&gt; And how can the reader
participate in that play?

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.130
&gt;&gt; Oh, because they're
always asking the question

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.430
when they're reading, right?

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.610
&gt;&gt; And what do you tell them?

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.690
&gt;&gt; I tell them everything is
autobiographical, but not.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.500
&gt;&gt; So they think, oh, it's really
about her and her husband, yes.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's okay.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.100
You can think whatever you want.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.400
&gt;&gt; Does it kind of
freak your husband

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.710
out to read the book
and see these elements?

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.010
These echoes?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.720
&gt;&gt; He's the phlegmatic,
so the answer is no.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.030
He's totally fine with
what I write, and it's --

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.420
so, okay, he hasn't always
been fine with what I write.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.720
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.400
&gt;&gt; The very first short story
I ever showed him, and this is,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.510
you know, years into my writing.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.620
We were just dating, and I gave
it to him, and he saw himself

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.110
in the character, and
he wrote "bleh"

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.080
on the paper, and then
threw it at me.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.190
So he's gotten much better.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.000
&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.620
&gt;&gt; And now he's really
great about it.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.280
Now he writes me these
single-spaced,

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.600
you know, 12-page letters.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.900
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.200
He writes you letters?

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.500
&gt;&gt; No, I can't take it verbally.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.800
&gt;&gt; So you're sitting
there in the same room,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.100
and he's writing you a letter?

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.400
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.700
&gt;&gt; And then you read it while
he's sitting next to you?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.000
&gt;&gt; No. I go into another room.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.220
But I know that if he responds to
the text at hand through text --

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.520
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; He's able to see it almost
intellectually as a different thing,

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.920
as not reflective of
our lives together.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.220
&gt;&gt; That's got to be hard.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.600
&gt;&gt; To live with me, absolutely.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.280
It is not easy.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.940
He is not a saint,
but he's pretty close.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.920
&gt;&gt; Is his criticism helpful?

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.220
&gt;&gt; Every time.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.520
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.820
&gt;&gt; Yes, because he's a really
smart general reader, right?

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.120
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.960
&gt;&gt; And I think a lot of times
we rely on other writers

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.470 position:56%
who know the same tricks that we do.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.770
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And so there's almost a shorthand
that I think we take for granted.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.410
But the really smart general
reader will ask questions

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.870
that a writer won't.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.470
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.710
&gt;&gt; Now, Lotto is married longer
than you've been married.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.310
&gt;&gt; How did you project yourself

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.480
into that undiscovered
country of a long marriage?

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.320
&gt;&gt; Well, they're only married
for 26 years, which is, I mean,

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.070
I've been with my husband for 19,
so it's only seven more years.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.370
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you're getting close.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.670
&gt;&gt; We're getting close, yeah.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.970
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.570
&gt;&gt; But how did you think how
a long marriage would evolve?

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:21.870
They're also older than you.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.290
&gt;&gt; They're, yes, they're
older than, yeah.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.460
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I have
eyes and friends, so.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.390
&gt;&gt; You mean you used
your imagination?

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.690
&gt;&gt; I did, also.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.640
But, you know, you sort of watch
the way that your parents --

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.800
my parents are still together
very happily, and I watch the way

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.340
that their relationship
has unrolled.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.320
And my friends, I've got friends
who've been together for, you know,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.790
30 years, and so you just ask
a lot of questions a little bit

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.480
on the side so they don't quite
know what you're getting at.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.780
&gt;&gt; Until they read your book.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.270
&gt;&gt; Until they read your book
and see themselves in it, yeah.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.570
Yeah.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.870
&gt;&gt; In almost every
interview I've read with you

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.690
at some point you say I'm a
private person, a shy person.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.990
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.290
&gt;&gt; Here we are.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:10.000
Is there something about the
way we've constructed the modern

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.830
publishing world that we make
people like you leave your rooms,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.420
and your offices, and your
homes, and go out on tour

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.910
and talk and meet with readers.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.140
Are we making it hard for a certain
kind of author, do you think,

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.640
to read and publish nowadays
that we didn't in the past?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.080
&gt;&gt; I do think so.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.430
Yeah, but then again,
there's Elena Ferrante,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.920
who does the exact opposite.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.220
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.520
&gt;&gt; Which is she became a cipher.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.820
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.120
&gt;&gt; I mean, she's just
words on the page.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.670
And, actually, she's
playing with that, too.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.970
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.970
&gt;&gt; I really think that her game
is one of tempting the reader

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.150
to see the autobiography in the
text in every one of her books.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.990 position:56%
I think she's really playing a game.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:55.370
But I do think in our publishing
community, it's really, really,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.030
really hard to be a
hermit and a writer.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:59.330
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.880
&gt;&gt; So, what you do is you
develop a personae, right?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.370
&gt;&gt; It's like a Scooby suit that
you unzip at the end of the night,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.690
and it falls to the floor,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.910
and the tender little writer
gets out and like cringes.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.550
&gt;&gt; Was it hard for you
to do this kind of stuff?

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.850
&gt;&gt; Well, at first it was.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.240
I really, really hated it
for the first two books.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.540
But now I love it.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.840
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.140
That's good.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.440
Well, we're glad you're here.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.740
This will sound weird, but
you already know what I think

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.920
of your book, but I didn't realize
how good it was until I started

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.740
to talk to people who hate it.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, good.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.010
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because what -- hang on.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:38.410
No, because the really great
books generate strong opinions

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.710
on all sides.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.310
&gt;&gt; No? No.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.950
And it led to great discussions.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.500
It means it's a great
book for a book club.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.800
It means it's something to say.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.100
It means the book is
really touching people.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.740
That's what really
impressed me about it.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.930
Have you talked to people who
have wildly different views?

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.670
Or are people too shy
around you to tell you?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.280
&gt;&gt; No, people definitely
tell me, yeah.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.580
I get lots of emails.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.020
&gt;&gt; And how do you react to that?

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.200
&gt;&gt; Oh, erase.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.360
No, I mean -- you know,
I'm actually pretty tough.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.550
I can take a lot of
critique, but not at the time

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.850
that a book is published.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.150
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.450
&gt;&gt; I am really, really,
really, really tender.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.750
I can't actually read my reviews.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.790
I can't exist in the
world in which I feel

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.840
like people are judging
me, which is really hard.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.140
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.930
&gt;&gt; So I take a step back, and
I let my husband do all that,

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.230
and he really does.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.790
He collects all the critiques.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.090
&gt;&gt; The useful critiques.

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.390
&gt;&gt; The useful critiques.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.140
He puts them on a Word document,
and then two or three years

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.180
down the line, I say, all right,
give it to me, and I take it.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.750
But, you know, I care.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.050
I really, really care.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.600
I really want to be a much better
writer than I am now, so I really,

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.750
I need to take this, the
things that people are saying.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.050
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.940
&gt;&gt; But I need to choose who
I'm hearing from, right?

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.240
&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely, yes.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.820
&gt;&gt; And you can't take just
anybody's point of view.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.120
&gt;&gt; No. Of course not.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.720
&gt;&gt; I agree with that.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.320
&gt;&gt; Right. I heard you wanted
to be a poet for a while?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.920
Yeah.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.220
&gt;&gt; Which makes sense.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.520
Your writing is gorgeous.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.120
Yeah.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.420
&gt;&gt; So no collections of
poetry published by you?

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.720
&gt;&gt; Oh, God, no.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.020
If I did, it would
be under a pseudonym.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So you may have published poetry?

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.620
&gt;&gt; Possibly.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.920
[ Laughter ]

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.710
The thing is, what I love

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.580
about poetry is not what makes
one a good poet, I think.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.960
I really love the form.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.580
I love the formal poetry,
just desperately,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.790
because I love the ideas that
come out of being constrained

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.090
to a very small amount of space.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.520
&gt;&gt; The way the discipline
shapes the language?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.050
&gt;&gt; The way the discipline
shapes the language.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:39.070
I think that's really fun, but I --

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.420
and I know there are lots of
really good formal poets out there.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.210
&gt;&gt; But I am not -- I'm just not
one of them, which is unfortunate.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:49.230
&gt;&gt; Well, no, I mean, you
bring that poetic [inaudible]

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.660
to your writing, I think.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.840
I also heard that you
write in longhand still?

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.140
&gt;&gt; I do. Yes.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.900
&gt;&gt; Well, that seems really
surprising, because you're

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.560
of a generation, you grew
up, I suppose, on a computer.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.870
&gt;&gt; What made you begin to do that?

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:07.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So I -- it's very -- it much more
sensual, actually, in a way, right?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.550
So if you're writing with paper,

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.860
the paper has pores in
it, like human skin.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.210
It smells like paper, and the ink
on the paper smells different, too.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.240
And your body is sort of engaged
in a way that if you're writing

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.760
on a computer, you're sort of
almost pushing your work away,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.060
in a certain way.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.660
But also at the same
time, I think I'm afraid

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.870
of setting things in
stone too early.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.170
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.990
&gt;&gt; And on the computer screen,
it almost looks as though --

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.720
the text almost looks as though
it is printed text, right?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.020
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.320
&gt;&gt; So it's actually much,
much harder to change

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.130
than when you're just writing
along on a madcap [inaudible].

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:53.590
&gt;&gt; And it's on paper, and you can
go in and you can put in other ink

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.060
and you can just throw things away.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.270
I throw tons of things away.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.570
&gt;&gt; Do you really?

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, I write a
really fast first few drafts,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.000
and I throw them out in
between, and then a --

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.730
and for this book, it
was about 12 drafts.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:12.050
So what happens is the first
draft was about a month.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:15.440
Well, actually the first draft was
these huge pieces of butcher paper

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.050
on the walls that I
was writing Mathilde

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.350 position:56%
and Lotto back and forth like chess.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.140
&gt;&gt; What was on those
pieces of paper?

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, just like little
stories that I would write.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.610
I would write a Mathilde story,
and then turn around and write it

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.910
from Lotto's point of view.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.210
&gt;&gt; Oh, so you keep
track of these things?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, yeah, well,
and then I threw them out.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.060
And then, yeah, but then I
moved them to actual paper,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.460
and wrote what I thought was
the story in about a month,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.540 position:56%
and then the stories in a month, and
then threw that out, and kept going,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.350
and kept going, and kept going.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:46.000
What this does for me,
and I love it so much,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.640
is that it doesn't
set anything in stone.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.780
And because I love the sentence
so much, I can spend all

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.660
of my time just fixing one
single sentence, when in reality,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.800
the foundational issues are
what I need to address, right?

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.370
The character needs to
become bigger, and stranger,

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.290 position:56%
and all of the peripheral characters
need to have their own back stories.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:12.110
And so the first few, usually about
five or six drafts of anything

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.070
that I write is just junk, and I
let it be junk, because I think

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.500
that that's the way, as in
this Leonard Cohen song,

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.670
the cracks are the way
the light gets in, right?

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.720
And so you intentionally build
into the process a lot of cracks.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.020
That's what I do, at least.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.920
&gt;&gt; The style of that
first half of the book

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.190
in that lush, romantic tone --

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.790
&gt;&gt; That you begin to realize is
Lotto's reflection of himself.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.390
&gt;&gt; Or at least that's
what I thought.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.690
&gt;&gt; Right, yes.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.990
&gt;&gt; It's just gorgeous.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, thanks.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.590
&gt;&gt; Just so gorgeous.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.890
And the harsh, bitter tone
of that second half is just

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.190
as perfect in a different way.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, thanks.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.790
&gt;&gt; It is really a triumph.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, the first half I'm building

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.800
out of other narrative
techniques, right?

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.620
So like the courtly
romance is in there.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.920
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.220
&gt;&gt; And the opera is in there.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.520
&gt;&gt; You hear Fitzgerald in there.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Fitzgeralds,

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.680
and the men who are
entranced with themselves --

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.950
&gt;&gt; Are in there, right?

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.250
&gt;&gt; Or just men.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.550
&gt;&gt; Or just men.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.850
The male creator is
in the first part.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.120
The [inaudible] is in there,
the [inaudible] is in there.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.420
I mean all different kinds

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.980
of narrative techniques I
intentionally threw into that.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.200
&gt;&gt; On purpose in order to have fun.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.070
This book was so much fun to write.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.370
&gt;&gt; Was it?

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.670
&gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, my God.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:25.970
&gt;&gt; That's good to hear.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.270
&gt;&gt; It was great.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.570
It was lovely.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:29.870
I enjoyed the heck out of it.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.170
But, and the second half, I
was really relying on a lot

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.680
of the mid-century French
writers, like [foreign name]

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.280
and [foreign name] and a lot of
the writers of the [foreign word],

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.980
because I really, I
think that the way

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.360
that they write is very
feminine in a lot of ways.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.660
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.220
&gt;&gt; With a lot of leaps and a lot
of fragments, and different ways

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.600
of writing than what
we've seen in the past,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.600
with the very romantic sort of
long sentences and lushness.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.900
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.500
&gt;&gt; That's fascinating.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.800
How do you know when you're done?

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.100
[inaudible]

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, you don't.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.700
Yeah, no, you never
know if you're done.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.000
&gt;&gt; Until the deadline comes?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.300
&gt;&gt; You just get really tired.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.920
Yeah. I got to the point where, you
know, I think it was I had to pay

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.900
for health insurance, and I was
like, what am I going to do?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.510
I guess I better give
my agent these books.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.040
[ Laughter ]

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.410 position:56%
So yeah, that's what happens, right?

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:27.300
The pressures of the
capitalism on creativity.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.860
&gt;&gt; But you must have a
sense, this chapter --

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.490
I was just talking
to Joyce Carol Oates,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.800
and she does not revise the whole
novel, she revises each chapter

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.100
until it's perfect,
and then she moves

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.620
to the next chapter,
and the next chapter.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, different people have
different ways of working, right?

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:45.790 position:56%
And my friend, Kevin Brockmeier
will only fix a sentence for as long

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.330
as it takes, and then move
onto the next sentence, right?

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.630
&gt;&gt; Very incremental.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.620
&gt;&gt; It's super incremental, and what
that means, though, is at the end,

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.500
when he gives it to his editor,
the editor has one or two things

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.580
to say, because it's perfect.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:03.470
Whereas my poor editor, she
wrote me 30 single-spaced pages.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a --

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, she's good.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:09.650
And it was after I had, I had
probably five or six other readers

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:13.090 position:56%
in between, too, including my agent,
who is also a very good editor, so,

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.870
I mean, I'm not as perfect
as Kevin Brockmeier.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.650
&gt;&gt; And do you accept all
30 single-spaced pages?

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:21.950
&gt;&gt; Oh, God, no.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.270
No, no, no, because a
lot of it is, you know,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.380 position:56%
tracing what would happen if, right?

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.850
So she's like well, in the
first chapter this happens,

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.150
what would happen if?

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.450
And she would go through the rest

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.130
of the book saying then these
things would be changed, too.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.430
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.180
&gt;&gt; So I don't always.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.400
I take maybe 50%, yeah.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.330
And I thought as I was reading
it, had you written plays before?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.630
&gt;&gt; Well, I tried.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.930
I'm not very good at it.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.410
So, yeah, I really, I love plays.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.870
And I especially love operas.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.320
I just love operas, because they're
so colorful, and it's [inaudible],

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.250
you know, it's the
synthesis of many,

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.530
many different kinds of artwork.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.760
It's the -- it's music, and
it's singing, and it's acting,

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.640
and it's costume, and it's light.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.020
I mean, every kind of art on the
stage happening in the moment

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.360
as the audience is reacting
to it, and I love that.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.660
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.060
&gt;&gt; That sort of -- the
feeling of just temporality,

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.730
and the idea that the story is
passing by, and all you have

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.640
to do is just reach
out and grab it, right?

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.940
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.240
&gt;&gt; And I love plays, too,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.050
and particularly my favorite
recently has been Annie Baker,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.580
whom I think is just
a mega, mega genius.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.910
She's so good.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:38.490
But I've tried to write them, but
my sensibility's really novelistic.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.780 position:56%
So I end up putting in way too much.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.080
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.380
&gt;&gt; It's very sad.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.680
&gt;&gt; Well, it's interesting,
because you've read novels

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.170
about great poets, but you never
read any poetry in the novel.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.160
The novel always just sort
of points to the poetry

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.830 position:56%
that is somehow, we have to imagine.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.130
&gt;&gt; Well, [inaudible] did.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.430
She did a really good job.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.730
Yeah.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.510
&gt;&gt; It was bold of you to
include actual pages of dialogue

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.930
from the plays that we
are told are classics.

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.530
&gt;&gt; Bold or stupid.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.010
&gt;&gt; I thought it was bold.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.230
It was a fantastic novel.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.620
I know people want to
ask you questions, too.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.920
So, would you take some
questions from the audience?

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.220
&gt;&gt; I will take any questions.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.820
&gt;&gt; About anything.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.120
&gt;&gt; There's a microphone
here and here.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.420
Come to the mic and ask away.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you in advance for
being whoever is the first person

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.290
to ask a question.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.650
&gt;&gt; Here comes -- there are
people coming toward the mics.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.950
&gt;&gt; There are.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.250
Thank you.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.550
Yes.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.850
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.150
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.500
&gt;&gt; A couple of thoughts
and questions.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.940
Did you set out to write a
book about their marriage?

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.230
I think one of things that
resonates, everybody I know

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.030
who read it, somewhere
lurking in that story is a bit

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:52.420
about your own marriage, and
we read it for our book club.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.030
And when, you know, word got

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.550
out that it was the
President's favorite book,

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.160
one of my friends would
say, "Oh, my God.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.810
I cannot believe that that
was his favorite book!

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:03.790
What is it telling us
about their marriage?"

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.960
&gt;&gt; We all had that thought.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.770
&gt;&gt; So I was sort of wondering
about that, because, you know,

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.210
you never know anyone's marriage,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.320
but I thought it was a wonderful
book and one of the books that,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.810
as soon as I read it, I put it
on my husband's side of the bed

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.690
and said, you must read this book.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.090
&gt;&gt; And the other thing I thought
that was interesting about it was

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:30.470
that it was a modern, you know,
it was placed in modern times.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:36.410
It wasn't really set in any
specific time, so in that sense,

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.820
it made me -- it felt
like it was evergreen.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; In a way that, like, I don't
know if you've read "A Little Life,"

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.390
but "A Little Life," I don't know,
was it set in post-9/11 New York,

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.690
or was it set in somewhere else?

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:52.130 position:56%
Because it's just very internal, and
I think that that is also the secret

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.160
of its success, because, you
know, you could be in your 70s

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.490
and have been married
for ages and read it,

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.320
but it's not set in a time outside.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.580
So did you intentionally
want to make it so internal?

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.740
&gt;&gt; Well, the first
question about the marriage,

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.060
the way that I was envisioning
this book, the books,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:17.080
when I was writing them, is I
wanted to write a book that was

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.300
about marriage the way
that a bomb casing is

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.940
about the bomb inside, right?

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.520
So it's not about the casing,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.100
it's about the explosion
in a certain way.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.980
And I think the book is set
in a particular specific time,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.620
but if you didn't think
that, that's totally fine,

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.960
and your reading is
superior to mine.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.240
I would say any reader out there.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.300
&gt;&gt; Well, I think in a sense that --
it was so internal in that it was

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.460
so about them that if some
catastrophic something happened

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.850
in the world that they live in,
whether they live in 2005 or,

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.380
you know, 1995 or whatever,

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.450
that I didn't think it
would have a dramatic --

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.750
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.100
&gt;&gt; It wasn't reliant on what was
happening in the world outside.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.700
They're very ingrown.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.000
&gt;&gt; That's what I mean by --

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.600
Thank you.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.900
&gt;&gt; Being timeless.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They're deeply
in love, yes.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.500
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And when you are, you look at the
person, and their face is in front

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.100
of you no matter where
you are in the world,

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.400
so, yeah, yeah, thank you.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.700
&gt;&gt; It was a great book.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you for reading it.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.300
I appreciate it.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.600
&gt;&gt; Well done.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.900
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.200
&gt;&gt; Hi. So this is just a kind
of generic author question,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.670
but what's one book you've
read recently and loved?

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, darn!

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.270
You're doing this one!

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:30.570
I always forget.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.700
Okay, okay, okay.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.960
I can do it.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.440
I can do this.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.840
Okay, "The Marriage of
Cadmus and Harmony."

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.980
I think that's right.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.640
Yes, "The Marriage of
Cadmus," by Roberto Calasso.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.760 position:56%
It's an extraordinary, extraordinary
book that says it's a novel,

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.060
but it's not really, it's

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.560
about Greek mythology,
but it's not really.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.300
I mean, it's like amazing.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.090
It's a classic, classic,
classic, yeah.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.480
Yeah. I don't know if it's recent.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.880
I don't think so, but
it's really good.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.180
Thank you.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.480
Yeah.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.780
&gt;&gt; You speak so passionately --

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.940
you speak so passionately about
your characters and, like,

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.310
you spend so much time with them.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:14.110
When the book is done, someone
else tells you it's done,

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:15.750
do you still think about them?

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.440
Do you think about
what they're doing?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.260 position:56%
What comes next for them, and how do
you deal with that if they're still

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.780
in your brain, and you're
trying to write something else?

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.080
&gt;&gt; So it's really hard.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.630
So there's an expanse between when
you finish a book and when it comes

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.470
out in the world, and for
me that's always a period

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.810
of just tremendous
grieving, actually.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.120
So, and then when it
comes out in the world,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.890
it becomes other people's book, and
it's not mine to grieve anymore,

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.360
which is really healthy, right?

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.960
But in those few months, I actually
get pretty depressed about it.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.720
I mean, especially with
"Arcadia," because it was

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.280
so deeply personal, that book.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.090
I was so sad that I was never
going to see Bit again in my life.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.520
And this book, you know,
I know Mathilde is tough,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.820
she'll be fine without me.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.510
She doesn't need me.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.810
But Bit does.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.310
I just want to go back and
protect him, because, you know,

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.430
I based him on what I
projected my son to be like.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:19.060
And he's not at all like him, but
that character is almost his ghost,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.480
is a different person, so,
yeah, it's really hard.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.440
&gt;&gt; Hi. I have a really
random question.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.740
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.280
&gt;&gt; I'm from Gainesville,
Florida, actually.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.210
I'm sure we know a lot
of the same people.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.950
And I was reading The New Yorker,
and I came across your story

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.650
that was published like a
year ago, I think it was.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.130
But I didn't look at the
-- your name or the title,

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.440
I just saw the photo
that was with the story,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.260
and I recognized the
street actually.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.840
And I was wondering if
you could just tell me

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.080
where that photo was
taken, because I knew --

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.880
I said, oh, this is
Gainesville when I saw the photo,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.090
and then I read the story
and it was clearly about,

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.390
like, the duck pond, and --

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:00.990
&gt;&gt; And neighborhoods I used to
live in, so I was just wondering

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.290
if you could tell me if you knew.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:03.890
Did you choose that photo?

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:08.500
&gt;&gt; No, we have no decision
making abilities at all in terms

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.280
of the artwork with our
stories in The New Yorker.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.670
In fact, you don't even see
them until it gets published

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.970 position:56%
and you're like, oh, that's perfect.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.600
So I have no idea, no.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.570
But it really is about
the duck pond.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:24.480
And the funny thing about this
is that I put the story out kind

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.670
of cringingly, because I'm
talking not incredibly positively

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.710
about the duck pond and the way

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.300
that we treat homeless
people in particular.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.390
And my mailman rang my doorbell,
and I always get The New Yorker

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.830
about a week later
than everyone else,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.420
I think you might be reading it.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.380
But he did read the story, and
he goes, "I read your story.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.290
I didn't like it."

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.860
And I was like, okay, like
every fear I've ever had

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.160
like crashing down on my head.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.040
And he goes, "I didn't like
it, because I wasn't in it."

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.060
[ Laughter ]

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.360
&gt;&gt; That's Gainesville.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.880
&gt;&gt; That's Gainesville, I know.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.150
Yes. Go Gators.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.590
&gt;&gt; I really loved your book.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.030
It was one of the first books to
really consume me in my adulthood,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:17.410
and there were a few moments that
I truly found myself resetting

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.010
and absorbing the book, and
those were the moments of text

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.930
in between the brackets, as well

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.700
as the characters'
interactions with their dog.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.440
And I was wondering if you
could share a little bit

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.220
about how you utilized the
brackets, and the character of God.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.080
&gt;&gt; Sure. The dog, his name is God.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.790
So I thought it was funny.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.900
It wasn't funny, but.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.200
The brackets.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.970
They came out of my obsessive
re-reading of "To the Lighthouse,"

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:49.070
by Virginia Woolf, which is one
of the best books of all times,

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.800
and if you haven't
read it, run to get it.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.710
But "To the Lighthouse"
is so extraordinary,

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.090
because it's three
parts, and the first

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.840
and the third part are this
stream of consciousness in

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.140
and out of people's minds.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.610
The first part, in
particular, sort of centered

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.440
around the figure of
the mother, right?

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.980
Mrs. Ramsey.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.680
So beautiful, so loving.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.670
And the second part is this part
called Time Passes, and in itself,

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.670
it's just, basically a short
story, and what happens

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.340
with this is it's one of the most
extraordinary literary feats I've

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.640
ever read.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.410
The human is leeched
out, and what comes

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:26.400
in in its place is
sort of elemental time.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.680
The time of wind, and
the time of the sea,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.830
and the time of the house
that's slowly disintegrating

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.130
without the people in it.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.700
And then when the people come
into it, it's in the brackets.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.000
And it's devastating.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.840
It's like a nail in your heart,
because the best death of all times

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.920
in literature, is the
death of Mrs. Ramsey.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.390
And it's really short.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.510
It's in brackets, and it's
something like, and I'm not going

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.960
to get it right, because I
can never quote things right.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.660
It's something like "Mr.
Ramsey coming into the hall

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.530
in the morning reached out his
arms for Mrs. Ramsey, but she,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.490
having died in the
night, is not there."

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:00.350
And it's like the worst thing ever.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.420
But it's so wonderful.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.910
So what I wanted to do is, I read
it and I read it, and I read it,

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.540
and what I loved about
it, is that it's a way

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.930
to bring what I was talking about
earlier, the Greek sort of sense

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.850
of larger time and smaller time at
the same time into the same book.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:19.780
And so I have this granular human
time with Lotto and Mathilde,

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.850
and then this larger, almost
elemental time in the voices

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.230
of whatever you read it to be.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:29.350
I am, it's very specific to me what
the voice is, but coming in almost

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:33.570
like a hawk, and then swooping up
the rabbit and going away, right?

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:34.990
So that's the way I
saw this voice as.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.400
Also, it serves to stitch
the two books into one.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.700
Yeah.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.000
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.830
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your question.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.130
Hi.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.340
&gt;&gt; May I ask a question
about "Arcadia?"

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.350
&gt;&gt; First of all, it's
such a lovely book.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.350
It's -- the language in it,
your writing is so beautiful.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.940
I had to hand it over to
friends to read whole passages.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:03.510
One of things I wanted to know was
how you captured the communal life

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.600
so vividly, and your
descriptions of it were so --

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.650
what I imagined are true to life,

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.990
and I was wondering what
your process was in capturing

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.570
that whole lifestyle and
everything like that.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.460
&gt;&gt; Sure. So I have never been
in a community like that.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.910
I've lived in one for three
days, or a week or something.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.070
It was a very short amount of time.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:32.950
But when I write, I try to write
out of longing, and at the time

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.250
that I was writing that book,

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.870
I was really isolated
in Gainesville, Florida.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:43.490
I was pregnant and I
had my son in a place

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.320
where I didn't really know
anybody but my mother-in-law

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.530
and my husband, and
I work alone, right?

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.510
I am a hermit, basically,
and I go outside to exercise,

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:54.770
but that involves no people.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.770
So I was super, super disassociated
from the rest of the world,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.650
and I longed to have
a community of people

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.170
who could take care of me, right?

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.540
And could take care of my
kid when I needed a break.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.800
And so out of that longing, I
guess, and out of my research --

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.950
I did a great deal of research for
that book, particularly in terms

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.100
of the farm, which is
this commune in Tennessee

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.690
that was amazingly
successful for a long time.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.120
And Oneida, which was this
other utopian-esque community

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.020
in Upstate New York, super nuts.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.290
If you want to read about
a really crazy commune,

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.500
you, I mean, it's awesome.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.340 position:56%
They did everything right and wrong.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.690 position:56%
The right things they did were women
were equal to men in the, you know,

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.800
mid to late 19th century.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:47.510
The wrong things they did
were eugenics, and, you know.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:51.980
And spiritual elders, men,
having sex with 12-year-olds.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.280
So all of that.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.580
That's really wrong.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.870
So it collapsed under
its own weight.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.170
I'm sorry.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.470
I went off course.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.950
But it's really fascinating.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:04.350
So I did a ton of research, and
I imagined through longing my way

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.680
into a community, which, in a way,
is what I did with "Monsters," too,

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.330
because I wanted to be home,
I wanted to be in Cooperstown,

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.770
and all I wanted to do was
spend hours a day there.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.730
So, yeah, imagination, basically.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.030
Yeah, thank you.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.330
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.010
&gt;&gt; Hi. I feel so privileged.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.410
So what I really loved
about "The Fates

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:26.810
and the Furies" was how you read
it, and then you read it again,

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.570
and there's just this
total shift in perspective.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.670
And obviously every character
is a facet of oneself.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:36.680
But how did you manage to make
such distinguished characters

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.090
with such different personalities,

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:43.730
and how are you able
to tap into that?

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.330 position:56%
I wish I knew, if it were true, too.

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.690
But I think it might have something
to do with the way I write,

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:54.110
because through writing layer
after layer after layer,

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:58.670
what I feel like I'm doing is
actually creating this world that's

00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.970
almost three-dimensional.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:01.750
Almost like a 3D printer, right?

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:07.890 position:56%
So what happens then is that because
you have this three-dimensional

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.160
world, you can choose
your path through it.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.050
And the path usually
doesn't involve a lot

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:20.130
of the side stories
that I threw out, right?

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:25.810
But those side stories are really
important for the side characters

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.620
in a lot of ways, and they're
really important to sort

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.010
of give information to
the main characters, too.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.850
And eventually, if you do that
enough, if you write enough layers,

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.620
you believe these people
are actually human beings.

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:41.430
I mean, I remember once, I was
in the middle of both "Arcadia"

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.420
and "Fates and Furies," because I
was writing them at the same time,

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:50.170
and I was at the dinner table with
my family, and I started laughing.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.470
My husband was like, what?

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.870
And I was like, something
that Lotto said today.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.970
And then I was like, wait a minute.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:58.150
He doesn't exist, this is crazy.

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.970
But, like I said, it's
hard to be married to me.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:06.290
But I guess that's,
you know, I don't know,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.010
but I hope that that's why.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for coming.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:11.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.910
&gt;&gt; It's such a pleasure
to talk to you.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.510
Thank you.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.840

of The Library of Congress.
