- Hi, my name is Grace Hwang,

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:13.804
and I'm a School Programs
Educator here at MoMA.

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:16.499
This piece by Jackson Pollock is

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.403
one of my favorite pieces to teach,

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:21.515
just because of its sheer size and scale.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:22.420
And it just kind of takes up

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.231
the whole wall and the whole room,

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:26.484
and I love to think about it as a thought

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.990
that kind of takes up the
whole space of your mind.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.511
It's kind of subversive, the reason

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.368
why I like teaching from this object.

00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:35.992
because it really
confronts students' ideas

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:39.707
about skill and creating art.

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:41.123
Sometimes students will say,

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:42.934
when they look at this
painting for the first time,

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:46.023
that the artist must have
been angry or he's depressed,

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:49.854
and what's interesting is to
facilitate that idea of anger.

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:52.176
Well, what movements do
you make when you're angry?

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:54.474
These kind of violent movements,

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:57.493
these very strong movements
and quick movements,

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.952
and to compare that with
a very opposite emotion

00:01:00.952 --> 00:01:03.158
of like excitement, and
when you're really excited

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:06.850
about something, you're
just as moving very quickly.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.870
It's interesting to think of this painting

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.146
as the collection of lines of energy,

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:12.957
and you begin to follow
as you look at One,

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:15.836
maybe some moments that look
sort of like electricity

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.159
and kind of staticky,

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.224
and then some movements that
are moving very quickly,

00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:22.546
the very thin movements
moving very quickly,

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:24.775
and then some of these pools of paint,

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:28.026
kind of these pauses and these lulls.

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:29.907
A lot of times I have
students think about,

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.532
you know, well, give me your first word

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:33.855
guttural reaction to this piece,

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.758
and a lot of times
they'll say things like,

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:37.708
"Crazy, chaos, random!"

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:40.936
And sometimes, you know,
after a conversation

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:43.815
about things that are controlled chaos

00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:46.903
or things that are seemingly
random and out of control,

00:01:46.903 --> 00:01:48.250
it's really interesting that towards

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.988
the end of the conversation,
it might go more towards

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:53.590
thoughts about the universe being

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.865
controlled chaos, or the cosmos.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.816
A lot of times conversations can get

00:01:57.816 --> 00:01:59.906
really out there and very philosophical,

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:03.363
and I think it's kind of a
magic moment when that happens.
