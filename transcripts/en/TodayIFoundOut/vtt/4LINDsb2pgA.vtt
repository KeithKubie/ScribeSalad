00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:16.870
The 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.750
season five finale of HBO’s Emmy-award winning
comedy VEEP sure seemed like a Hollywood fantasy.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.860
Through a series of wacky situations, hilarious
gaffes and complicated procedures, an obscure

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.109
Vice-Presidential candidate was elected by
the incumbent Vice-President to be the President

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.730
of United States.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.120
Seems far-fetched, right?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.820
Well, no, not at all.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.460
Sure, a lot of details were added for dramatic
effect and comedy’s sake, but in terms of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.190
how congressional procedures and rules would
play out if presented with such a scenario,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.309
the show was quite accurate.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.069
There is, in fact, an actual chance that one
of the Vice-Presidential candidates in a given

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.979
election will be elected POTUS.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.550
Not only that, it is also possible that the
Speaker of House could become the President

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.840
of the United States instead.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.190
Here’s how.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.740
Of the 538 electoral votes up for grabs, a
candidate must get (or exceed) 270 electoral

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.650
votes in order to get the presidency.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.550
So, if split in half between two candidates,
that’s 269 per and one vote short of the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.550
magic number.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.930
Of course, it doesn’t necessarily work this
way.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
There could be a third party candidate or
even a fourth candidate that could siphon

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.140
votes from the two main ones.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.000
In the 1824 election, this is exactly what
happened.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.480
Andrew Jackson won the popular vote (the first
time it had ever been counted- initially certain

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.780
states didn’t even select their electors
based on their populace’ votes) but was

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.350
only able to get 99 electoral votes – which
was 32 short of the majority (there were 131

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.450
electoral votes up for grabs at that time).

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.950
However, there were four candidates running
for president (oddly, all of them considered

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.800
themselves from the same political party – the
Democratic-Republicans) that received electoral

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.750
votes that year: John Quincy Adams got 85,
William Crawford got 41 and Henry Clay had

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.750
37.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.650
There have been other elections where third-party
candidates have received electoral votes (for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.909
example, 1860, 1912 and 1968), but 1824 is
the only one to date that an electoral tie

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.999
was produced due to third and fourth candidates.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:32.620
Now, if no candidate gets an electoral majority
– be it with a 269 vote tie or other candidates

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.219
taking votes – the election gets sent to
the House of Representatives, where each state

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.019
delegation gets one vote.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.629
So, no matter if it’s California with their
53 representatives or Rhode Island with their

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.030
2 representatives, it is one vote per state.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.280
With 50 states, it is possible that the House
of Representatives could also tie in their

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.239
voting, assuming there are no abstentions
(or “faithless electors”) and the House

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.049
isn’t heavily weighted towards one party
or the other.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.349
In addition, in accordance with the 12th amendment,
only the top three vote-getters are considered

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.349
in the House.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.739
And, to make matters a bit more confusing,
it wouldn’t be the House that was in office

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.989
when the presidential election first started
in November, but the one that had been elected.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.340
Because the vote would not officially happen
until January when the new House is sworn

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.120
in, the dynamics of the House could change
– meaning there could be a swing in which

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.650
party controls it.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.129
When the 1824 election got sent to the House,
shadiness ensued.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.090
Since Henry Clay finished in fourth place
in the electoral vote race, he was disqualified

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.409
from the House vote.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.739
However, that didn’t stop him from having
a significant influence.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.719
Officially, Clay made it known that he agreed
with Adams’ nationalist agenda and hated

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.719
Jackson.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.519
So, he told his supporters in the House to
throw their weight behind electing Adams President.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.980
When the vote came down in February 1825,
Adams won the majority of the states with

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.730
13, while Jackson got 7 and Crawford got 4.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.409
This shocked Jackson and his supporters, considering
he had won the popular vote and the electoral

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.409
college.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.159
To make matters even more hard to stomach
for Jackson, Adams quickly named Clay his

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.479
Secretary of State, fanning the flames of
conspiracy that this was a corrupt bargain.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.509
Livid, Jackson responded with harsh words,

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.930
[T]he Judas of the West has closed the contract
and will receive the thirty pieces of silver

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.460
. . . Was there ever witnessed such a bare
faced corruption in any country before?

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.610
However, as previously stated, it is possible
for the House’s voting to end in the tie.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.310
If that is the case, then the Vice-President
would become President of the United States.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.190
But there’s a rub: It wouldn’t be the
incumbent VP, but the one that the Senate

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.400
has elected.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.330
In the 1800 election, Thomas Jefferson and
Aaron Burr tied in the electoral college for

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.310
the presidency (at the time the second-place
vote getter would be Vice President- there

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.780
was not a separate vote for that office),
even though the intention when campaigning

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.330
was for Jefferson to be president and Burr
to be his VP.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.300
A series of votes and threats of militia marching
on the capital resulted in Jefferson ultimately

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.710
getting elected president and Burr his VP.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.419
As a result of this mess, four years later,
the 12th amendment was passed and called for

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.990
separate voting designation for each position.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.180
It also gave the Senate the power to elect
the Vice-President in a separate election,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.880
which means that if the House does end up
electing a president, the Senate can elect

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.690
a vice-president that’s from a different
party.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.909
But, if the House is deadlocked in its selection
of President, the Senate’s choice for VP

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.700
would become President (of course, this is
highly contingent of what party controls the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.270
Senate after the election).

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.250
So, what happens if the Senate is also unable
to come to a majority vote?

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.610
Well, in theory, the incumbent VP is supposed
to have the tie-breaking event due to being

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.060
President of the Senate.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.490
With each state voting, that would be 26 to
25 in favor of whoever the VP picks.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.789
Now, a state (or several) could abstain from
voting, which would completely alter the outcome.

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.250
If an abstaining state prevents the VP vote
to be the deciding one, then the presidency

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.840
goes to the Speaker of the House.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.120
To attempt to make that jumble of a mess a
little more clear, here’s a potential scenario

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.919
for something like this happening with the
2016 election.

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.230
Let’s say Clinton and Trump are tied with
269 electoral votes each.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.360
Now the decision would go to the House of
Representatives in January to be determined

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.319
by the recently-elected Congress.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.090
If that ends up in a tie, the Senate would
choose between the VP candidates Tim Kaine

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.090
and Mike Pence.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.491
Now, if a state ends up abstaining and turns
incumbent VP Joe Biden’s vote into the tying

00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:50.150
one instead of the tie-breaker, it makes the
current Speaker of the House President of

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.150
the United of States.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.150
And that is Paul Ryan.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.900
It is also possible that both the House and
Senate elect their respective offices, but

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.430
they end up being from different parties.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:28.959
This means, for example, you could get a Clinton-Pence
or a Trump-Kaine White House.
