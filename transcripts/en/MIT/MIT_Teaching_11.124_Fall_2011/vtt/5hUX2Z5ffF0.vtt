00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.940
At one point, I realized that I was teaching
the course in a way that was sort of timeless.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.800
And it's really about, I really wanted to
think about it much more in a way that was

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.090
set in context - of today and the history
of education in the past.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.800
And I wanted to do that in a way that felt
like, again I was embodying the constructivist

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.660
principles that I really think are important
to learning.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.570
And so the first thing I brought in was Current
Events.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.570
I wanted students to bring in, to understand
what's going on in the world of education

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.760
today because it's changing very rapidly in
terms of what we know about teaching and learning,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.539
what technologies we're using for teaching
and learning, and the policies surrounding

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.980
all this, and people's attitudes towards it.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.000
So rather than sort of me... sort of telling
them about this, I wanted the students to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.130
take some ownership over that, and we brought
in Current Events.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.590
And so students... investigate current events,
choose things that are important and meaningful

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.899
to them, and bring it into the classroom for
discussion.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.080
And then, over time, we've sort of changed
the way that we do that, so that we think

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.910
about the ways that - can we use the online
components more effectively so that students

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.280
are doing some of the... thinking about the
issues before they get to class, and then

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.039
use the class time for something that's unique?

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.470
For the Current Events, we actually think
that there's enough that you can get out of

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.810
an article and some questions online and some
online forums so that actually some of that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.590
conversation can happen before they even get
to class.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.770
So, in those cases, there's a current events
article that goes up - usually relatively

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.440
short - and some questions that are posed
with it, and students need to read the article

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.560
and respond to those questions.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.700
And then what happens in class is a follow-up
to that.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.810
So sometimes there's themes that happened
in student responses.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.739
Sometimes there's an issue raised that was,
that maybe the people who were responsible

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.910
for the Current Events that week didn't think
of in advance.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.750
And that's a chance to kind of follow up on
some of that.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.560
And this year actually for the first time
we were actually saw, started seeing some

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.500
groups do some interesting activities that
were follow-ups to those as well.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.780
Not just pure discussion, but activities that
sort of brought out some of the big issues,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.790
or sort of pointed out some similar thinking
or dissimilar thinking that was happening

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.790
in the class.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.040
There was some that were sort of like voting
with your feet.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.170
So it was a matter of like looking at distributions
on... in terms of viewpoints on issues, where,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.060
you know, people who thought like "Yes" about
one issue and "No" about one issue went to

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.739
different sides of the room.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.760
And then there was some debate around the
issues around there.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.060
So it was a nice way to sort of call out,
"OK, there's distributions on issues.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.859
There's people that think different things
about this, but there's reasons for that,

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.799
and let's have some dialogue within people
that have common thoughts, and people who

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.030
have disparate thoughts as well."
