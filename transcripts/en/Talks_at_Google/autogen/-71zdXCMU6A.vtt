00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.774
MALE SPEAKER: really excited
to have such a full room.

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:07.190
And I know we have
a lot of people

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.960
on the live stream
and a lot more people

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.430
still who can't make
either and looking forward

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.470
to seeing this up on
YouTube which will be

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.390
the case in the next few days.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.230
I'm really excited to
introduce Professor Carol

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.330
Dweck from Stanford University.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.560
She's the Lewis and Virginia
Eaton professor of psychology.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.600
She is best known for
her work on mindsets

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.100
that people use to
guide their behavior.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.900
She earned a BA in psychology
from Columbia University

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.120
and then a Ph.D. In
psychology from Yale.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.920
She's the author of a
bestselling book, "Mindset:

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.690
The New Psychology of Success."

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.370
And despite traffic,
a bunch of books

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.414
arrived at the back
of the room, which

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.580
you can purchase afterwards.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.290
I certainly encourage
you to do so.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.820
There's my well-thumbed copy.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.924
It's sold over a
million copies, so there

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:57.340
are many of your
friends out there

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.000
who have enjoyed this work.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.550
She's a frequent speaker,
has spoken on the TED stage

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.019
multiple times, at the United
Nations, the White House,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.070
among other prestigious
organizations.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.380
Her work has won so many
awards that if I named them all

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.720
that would be the entire talk.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.210
So I'm not going to do that.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.650
And now that I've
incredibly boosted her ego,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.390
I'd like to bring
up Professor Dweck.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.306
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.400
All right, before we
get into mindsets,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.050
I want you to share what
we've learned from what is now

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.463
the widely-discredited theory of
self esteem and the self esteem

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:36.962
movement.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.140
CAROL DWECK: OK.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.240
In the 1990s the self esteem
movement took over the world.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.860
We were told to
tell everyone how

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.080
fabulous, brilliant, talented,
special they were all the time.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.790
This was going to motivate them
and boost their achievement.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
Instead, as you said, it
was a complete disaster.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.700
It led to the acceptance
of mediocrity.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.360
It didn't challenge people
to fulfill their potential.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.850
And our research showed
telling people they're smart

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.010
actually backfires.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.970
It makes them afraid
of challenges,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.050
it makes them fold in
the face of obstacles,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.070
because they're worried, oh,
does this not look smart?

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.100
Am I not smart?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.035
The whole currency is
built around smart.

00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:31.910
MALE SPEAKER: So what
triggered your interest

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.310
in going deeper and
researching how people

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.290
are motivated and learn,
and how did that lead

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.360
to your definition of mindsets?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.280
CAROL DWECK: I was
always interested

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.300
in why some people wilted
in the face of failure,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.230
shied away from
challenges, when people

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.910
who are no more talented or
able were embracing challenges

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.930
and thriving in the
face of failure.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.650
Ultimately this led to our
discovery of the mindsets.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.400
And what we found was that some
people believe their talents

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150
and abilities are just these
fixed traits-- you have

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.960
a certain amount and that's it.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.090
But other people believe
talents and abilities

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.450
can be developed through
hard work, good strategies,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.980
good mentoring from others.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.860
Through years of work, we found
that having a fixed mindset led

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.320
you to be afraid of
challenges that might unmask

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.230
your deficiencies,
made you withdraw

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.029
in the face of difficulty
because you felt stupid.

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.320
You didn't want to feel stupid.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.840
You didn't want other people
to think you're stupid.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.990
Whereas having this
growth mindset,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.780
the idea that your abilities
could be developed,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.480
made you think,
why waste my time

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.290
looking smart when I
could be getting smarter?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.350
And I do that through
taking on challenges.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.060
I do that through
seeing them through.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.010
Now granted, that
doesn't mean everyone's

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.130
the same, that they
don't different talents

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.230
and abilities.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.191
It just means everyone can grow.

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.440
MALE SPEAKER: And sort of
building on that, you really

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.950
can't watch a sports
broadcast or the TV

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.250
show America's Got Talent,
who has talent in the name,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.959
without hearing how
talented that player is.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.280
Or seeing someone
perform the ballet

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.310
and say she has
tremendous talent.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.030
What role, if any, does
innate talent play?

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.740
CAROL DWECK: Well, they
do have talent now,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.950
when we're watching
them, but I think

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.510
it's created a
nation that thinks

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.490
when they see someone
displaying talent

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.020
or incredible performance,
they were born that way.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.670
And they've had this inevitable
rise to great success.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.180
I teach a freshman seminar
at Stanford every year.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.860
And I have my students
do an assignment

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.290
where they do research
on their hero,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.040
and almost invariably
they think that hero just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.150
catapulted to success because
of this amazing inborn talent.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.500
But every single time
they find that the hero

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.460
put in inordinate amounts
of work, met with obstacles,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.860
and really powered through them.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.420
So I don't rule out
the idea of the fact

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.000
that some people are born
with passions and talents

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.460
and build those, but many people
who never achieve anything

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.970
are also born with
talents and passions

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.190
that they don't see through.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.810
And what's there,
what we come with,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.680
that's the raw material
that you've got to develop.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.870
Michael Jordan, it turns out,
wasn't particularly talented

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.660
until he went at it so
ferociously, more ferociously

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.600
than anyone else.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.090
MALE SPEAKER: Over lunch, we
had an interesting discussion

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.609
with part of the team here about
growth mindset, fixed mindset,

00:06:03.609 --> 00:06:05.400
it's a great simplified
way to think of it.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.733
Yet people can have both, and
it's more of the spectrum.

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:11.240
Talk a little bit more about
how you can have both mindset.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.620
CAROL DWECK: Yes,
we're all a mixture.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.640
And it's true that
you could have

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:24.100
a fixed mindset in one area and
a growth mindset another area.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.430
And it's true that it's a
spectrum, not a dichotomy.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.990
But it's a really dynamic.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.840
Even in a given area, sometimes
you're in a fixed mindset.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.310
You think, oh, my ability to
fix, I have to prove them,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.710
I have to look smart, I can't
show that I'm working too hard.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.850
People might not
think I'm so smart.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.390
And other times we could be
more in a growth mindset.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:53.490
So what we have to start doing
is looking for what triggers

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.600
the-- because the fixed
mindset holds us back,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.930
we have to start looking for
what triggers it in all of us,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.750
even me.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.040
And what happens when you're
facing a big challenge?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.990
Do you worry about, well, I'm
going to unmask deficiencies.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.280
What happens when
there's a setback?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.420
Do you think maybe
I'm not good at this?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.450
What happens when you're
receiving criticism?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.836
Do you get angry and defensive?

00:07:20.836 --> 00:07:22.210
What happens when
you see someone

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.460
who's better than you
in what you're good at?

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.540
Do you feel jealous
and resentful,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.770
or do you feel inspired?

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.080
Maybe I can learn
from that person.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.280
Maybe they can mentor me.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.340
So watch out at these
trigger moments.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.420
See how you're feeling.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.594
And see if you can get yourself
into more of a growth mindset.

00:07:44.594 --> 00:07:46.010
MALE SPEAKER: So
I actually I have

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.027
two children, two
daughters, college age

00:07:48.027 --> 00:07:48.860
and high school age.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.370
I read your book after
my older daughter

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.404
was approaching high school, but
my younger daughter benefited

00:07:55.404 --> 00:07:56.820
from it to the
point right where I

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.440
banned the two S-words in
our house-- smart and stupid.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.770
I never used the
latter, but I was very

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.100
guilty of using the former.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.354
Raise your hands if you
told a friend, or a child,

00:08:06.354 --> 00:08:07.770
or a loved one how
smart they are.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.960
Words are really powerful
is one thing I took away

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.620
from your book.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.600
Talk about trigger words
like that: smart, stupid,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.630
and how those can work
against your best intentions.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.220
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.600
When you call someone smart,
you put them in a box.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.450
Or, really, you are kind of
putting them on a pedestal.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.470
And their life becomes organized
around deserving the pedestal,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.340
staying on the pedestal.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.400
And you can only do that
by narrowing your life

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.620
to include only
things you sure you're

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.830
good at, only things you're
sure you can succeed at.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.850
When we tell someone, you
did that so quickly, I'm

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.400
so impressed, they hear
if I didn't do it quickly,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.780
you wouldn't be impressed.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.590
A lot of things
take a long time.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:09.940
Or you got an A without
working, then they think,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:15.820
oh, if I work you're not going
to think I'm smart at math,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.880
say.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.170
And so you're just very
subtly conveying these ideas

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.460
that smart people
don't make mistakes,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.910
smart people don't
have to work hard,

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.470
the most important
thing in the world

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.380
is to be smart and look
smart at all times.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.610
And then people start
narrowing their world

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.840
so they can succeed
within that fixed mindset.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.340
MALE SPEAKER: So
one thing at Google

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.514
that we're obsessed with this
is proving things through data.

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:44.305
And I think one of the
compelling arguments

00:09:44.305 --> 00:09:47.320
your book made was around the
research you did with children

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.282
in school environments.

00:09:48.282 --> 00:09:49.990
So talk about some of
that early research

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.710
and how it's evolved to
reinforce that there's

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.140
weight behind this concept.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.700
CAROL DWECK: Yes, we've
done research, now,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.680
with tens of
thousands of students.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.340
First, finding that those who
naturally have a growth mindset

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.450
do better.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.010
We've traced them over
challenging-- especially

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.120
in challenging courses, like
pre-Med organic chemistry;

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.370
or challenging transitions,
seventh grade, high school,

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.890
college transitions.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.760
We've studied all of those.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.830
Recently we studied all
of the 10th grade students

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.040
in the country of
Chile, 170,000.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.410
And we found that at every
level of family income,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.820
those who believe they could
develop their intelligence

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.920
perform substantially higher
on achievement tests than those

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.280
who thought they couldn't.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.690
And the most striking was
that among the poorest kids,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.200
those who had a
growth mindset were

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.680
performing at the level
of much wealthier kids.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.200
But importantly, because
those are correlations,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.200
we've done a number of
studies where we have taught

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.140
students a growth mindset.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.320
The ideas that every time
they do a really hard task

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.330
and stick to it, the
neurons in their brain

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.300
form new connections and
they can get smarter.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.360
And then we show them how
to put that into practice.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.860
We have found that
students who learn

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.230
this fare better
across challenging

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.600
courses and transitions.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:39.250
We just showed that in a
study of women in STEM classes

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.400
at universities
around the country.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.650
But we shown that
at the transition

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.550
to college, transition to
high school, and so forth.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.100
So teaching a
growth mindset leads

00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:00.267
kids to take on challenges,
stick to them, and improve.

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:02.350
MALE SPEAKER: So in our
current education culture,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.590
and then I want to switch
to in the work environment,

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.930
there's such an obsession
with standardized testing

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.400
and those tests
having a real material

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.800
impact on teachers'
advancement and even,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.360
in some cases, their income.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.440
How do school systems battle on
that front and at the same time

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.766
tackle growth mindset, which
is more about working hard

00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:25.320
in the process than
the actual end results.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.150
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.280
It's such an interesting story,
because standardized tests were

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.960
brought in for good reason.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.040
There are students in
certain parts of the country

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.540
and in certain schools who
were performing so poorly.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.330
And nobody knew
and nobody cared.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:48.110
And it was an attempt to
say let's not cheat kids out

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.240
of a good education.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.480
But we all know the
unintended consequences.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.340
School became about
standardized tests,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.760
and many teachers, feeling
that their jobs or their raises

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.290
were on the line, taught to
the test the entire year.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.055
How warning could that be
for teachers or for students?

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.060
And we did research to
show that a lot of students

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.170
think that those tests
measure how smart they are

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.720
and how smart they'll
be when they grow up.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.450
So they're nervous about
them, and the whole year

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.840
is spent on them.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.750
When, in fact, if
you just taught kids,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:43.990
and in a way that made them love
learning, to love challenges,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:50.300
know how to stick to them,
feel the thrill of improvement,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.400
then the test score would
come as a byproduct of that.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.760
Finland, the country
that does so well

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.940
on all these
international tests,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.130
they don't teach to the test.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.700
They teach.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.680
The teachers love teaching,
the kids love learning,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.440
and they do well on the test.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.450
Let's get back to that here.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.700
MALE SPEAKER: So going into
the corporate environment,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.750
can you actually think
of an organization

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.820
as a growth mindset
organization or a fixed mindset

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.490
organization?

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.910
You do talk about
Enron in your book

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.450
as an example of probably
not the positive side.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.030
So talk about how
you can look at it

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.140
from an organizational
level, and then

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.710
if you want your culture to
be a growth mindset culture,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.310
how do you start to tackle that?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.450
CAROL DWECK: Yes, yes.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:42.350
So in my book, I identify
organizations that value

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.040
talent, raw talent,
above all else,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:53.200
or they believed in everyone's
ability to improve and develop

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.270
and value that.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.600
In our recent work
we've actually gone in

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.510
and asked the people.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:08.270
We asked employees in different
Fortune 500 organizations,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.920
what mindset does
your company have?

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.910
Is it a company that believes
in fixed talent and worships it?

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.010
Or is it a company
that believes everyone

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:24.750
can develop their abilities
and really provides

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.880
these opportunities?

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.590
And what we found was there
was remarkable consensus

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:36.640
within organizations about which
mindset their organization has,

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.775
and more important, it
made a big difference.

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:42.650
MALE SPEAKER: So in
terms of that difference,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.920
you kind of compare
and contrast companies

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.420
that you view as leaders in
growth mindset versus those

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.790
that have struggled maybe
because of a fixed mindset

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.352
culture.

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:53.810
CAROL DWECK: Well,
in this research

00:15:53.810 --> 00:16:03.910
we found that employees in a
growth mindset organizations

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.870
said they felt more
empowered by the organization

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.810
and more committed to it.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.530
Whereas their counterparts
in the more fixed mindset

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.680
organizations kind
of had one foot out

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.520
the door waiting for
the next highest bidder.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.300
But to me what was
even more interesting

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.100
is that the people in
growth mindset organizations

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.140
said their companies valued
creativity, innovation,

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.390
and they really put their
money where their mouth was.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.660
So if you took it a reasonable
risk and it didn't work out,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.180
they said my
company has my back.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.850
My company really
values teamwork

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.080
was another thing they
said in the growth mindset

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.950
organization.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.950
In the more fixed
mindset organizations,

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.510
the employees said,
yeah, the company talks

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.760
innovation and creativity.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.290
But if things don't work
out, someone pays the price.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.770
And finally, the managers in
the growth mindset organizations

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:10.980
said that their employees
had tremendous potential

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:17.290
to rise within the organization,
become stars, join management.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.550
Whereas, and I love this finding
because in the fixed mindset

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.099
organization they're
worshipping the talent,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.010
and hiring the talent, and
paying to keep the talent,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.020
but a few years later,
they're not saying

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.090
there are a lot of
people who have potential

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.190
to rise in the organization.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.460
Either they've left or they
don't have the potential

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.850
anymore.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.600
MALE SPEAKER: So many
of us in the room

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.950
participate in interviewing
potential candidates

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.450
for Google.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.390
So let's assume for a
second that Google's

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.720
trying to have a growth
mindset-- that it is.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.080
What are strategies
that interviewers

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.540
can use to help identify
that train people,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.520
or identify that someone will
be open to going down that path?

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.170
CAROL DWECK: Great question.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.530
I worked with a major
league baseball team,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.390
so I'll talk about that
first, to devise questions

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.200
that they could ask to
potential draft choices.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.220
One was, how do you get
so good at baseball?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.870
And some of them
said, well, you know,

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.330
I was born with
this natural talent.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.046
And others said, well,
my father and I--

00:18:23.046 --> 00:18:24.170
we worked at it constantly.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.753
We had a batting
cage in the backyard.

00:18:25.753 --> 00:18:29.340
He filmed me, we watched
the tapes, and so forth.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.580
Another one was thinking
about on-field success

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.980
in the major leagues, what do
you think you'd have to change?

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.500
And some of them
said things like I'll

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.320
have to get used to the
cheering of larger crowds.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.970
And others said,
maybe everything.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.870
I'll have to take all my
skills to a new level.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.570
It's a whole new ball game.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.500
So this knowledge
that you might have

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:04.070
to really reorganize, redefine
yourself and build new skills

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.490
is really important.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.820
Taking that to the
corporate setting,

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:13.040
first I might ask people with
their greatest failures were,

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.090
see whether they
take responsibility,

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:19.560
and what they did
with that failure.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:26.660
Did they capitalize on it
to do something even better

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.770
than they could have imagined?

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:33.600
Did they use it to put value
added back into the company?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.380
Or on the other hand, did they
say well, I had this failure.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.790
I worked too hard.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:45.470
Or do they make it something
that really reflects well

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.320
on them, or was it
someone else's fault?

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.030
And then this kind of
readiness to learn,

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:57.390
readiness to share credit,
these kinds of questions.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.480
MALE SPEAKER: So I've debated
your theories of mindset

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.630
with colleagues over lunch,
particularly my last company.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.730
There was really this
resistance to accept

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:13.412
that talent and/or intelligence
were in any way malleable.

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:14.620
Talk about that for a minute.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.300
Is intelligence truly
something that's malleable?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.590
And maybe other physiological
differences between people

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.960
that you've researched that
are identified as growth

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.250
mindset or fixed mindset.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.620
CAROL DWECK: So
we absolutely know

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.330
that skills and
abilities are malleable,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.860
and that's kind of what counts.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.440
That's what turns
itself into performance.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.830
But there have been
fascinating studies.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:47.290
First of all, looking into
the brains of fixed and growth

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:53.630
mindset people as they work on
a hard task and make errors,

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:59.190
and you see that the people
who are in a growth mindset

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.870
are having the relevant
areas of the brain

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.760
really light up, catch fire
as they process the errors

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.410
and correct them.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.460
Whereas in the brains
of the people who

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.030
are in more of a fixed mindset,
very little is going on.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.250
They're seeing their errors,
and they're moving on

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.660
as quickly as possible.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.300
But my favorite study
along these lines

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:30.460
tracked teenagers from
the age of 14 to 18.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.210
The teenage brain-- our brains
are still very malleable,

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.550
but the teenage brain is
unbelievably malleable.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.620
It's a time of tremendous
potential growth.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.870
And what they found
over those four years

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:52.760
was that there were some kids
who gained a lot in IQ points

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.540
in math or verbal
areas, and there

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.720
were others that
lost a lot of points

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.130
and attract with the
density of their neurons

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.320
in the relevant parts
of their brains.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:13.190
So we believe that the
kids who really went at it,

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.180
and took on the
challenges, and worked

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.150
hard were creating
these denser neurons,

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.610
and the others who
didn't use it lost it.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.730
MALE SPEAKER: And I thought
another interesting aspect

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.190
of your research was, this could
apply in education, at home,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.710
or in business,
is the proclivity

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.970
to cheat based on the
mindset that a person is in.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.310
Talk a little bit about that.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.290
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.650
We have studied that directly.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.600
And we see that cheating is
more-- the desire to cheat

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.360
and the actual cheating-- is
more prevalent within a fixed

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.500
mindset.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.140
Within a fixed
mindset, if, say you

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.750
haven't done well
on a subject before,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.520
but you want a good
grade, you feel

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.050
like, oh, I have to find
some circuitous means.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.780
But if you feel that there
are many ways that you

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.470
can do better through
actual learning,

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.640
you're more likely to do that.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.040
So in one study
after a poor grade,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.970
students who held
more of a fixed

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.890
mindset of their
intelligence actually

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.990
said in advance they're
seriously considering

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.520
cheating on the next test.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.050
MALE SPEAKER: So in
your recent TED talk--

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.500
CAROL DWECK: Oh, I want
to say one more thing.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:39.970
In our business study, the
people in the fixed mindset

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.120
organization said
cheating and deception

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.490
were much more prevalent.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.220
And think about it.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.410
If I have to be
smarter than you,

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.040
if I have to be
the superstar, I'm

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.010
going to consider
all different ways

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:57.660
to look better than you look.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.020
And if I have to
keep secrets from you

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:05.120
or hoard my knowledge from other
people, I'm going to do that.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.970
But in the growth
mindset organization

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:12.410
where people are
collaborating, and learning,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.160
and tackling challenges
together, where's

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.590
the cheating going to come in?

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.510
It isn't.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.752
MALE SPEAKER: So if a company
observes that behavior,

00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:22.210
and it's a company
of scale-- let's

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.709
say it's not a
company of 10 people,

00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:26.330
but hundred or thousands--
and they recognize

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.350
we have a culture problem.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.552
How do you go about even
trying to tackle that?

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:32.260
What are some of the
strategies companies

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.470
can use if they decide, we
want to shift the culture.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.959
We know it's going to take time.

00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:37.500
It's not just a
switch that you flip.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.470
What are some of the
strategies a company could

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.330
employ to change the culture?

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.760
CAROL DWECK: So I think the
best thing is for the message

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.930
to come down from the top,
where they don't just announce

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.530
we're a growth mindset culture.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:59.220
They really explain what
the new value system is.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.580
The new value system on
taking on challenges,

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:10.820
on rewarding reasonable
risk, on teamwork,

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:17.760
on sharing information, giving
performance evaluations that

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.340
speak to people's
growth and contribution

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.720
to the company in
terms of learning,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:33.030
and salary increases
that take into account

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.900
did someone take on
challenges, improve,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.270
help other people improve,
were they are good team player.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.760
Bottom line counts, but
these things also count.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.850
So to just kind of
talk growth mindset

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.190
talk without backing
it up, I don't

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.150
think that's going to happen.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.380
If you have the
old reward system

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.330
that's rewarding
individual jockeying

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.420
for acclaim and power.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:10.280
But if you back it up
with evaluations, rewards,

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.760
and mentoring, and what a
growth mindset deeply means,

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.640
and how it can be
enacted within the job,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.637
I think that that's
a great start.

00:26:21.637 --> 00:26:23.220
MALE SPEAKER: In
your recent Ted talk,

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.480
you talked about
the power of yet,

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.050
which I thought it was a
very interesting concept.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.220
Tell me a little about
what you meant by that.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.000
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.610
It all started when I learned
about a high school in Chicago

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.870
where students had to pass
maybe 84 units to graduate.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.640
And if they didn't pass a unit,
they got the grade Not Yet.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.150
I thought that isn't that great,
because if you get a failing

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.230
grade, you think, I hate
this, I'm out of here,

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.450
I'm no good at this.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.160
And you kind of lose your steam.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.940
But Not Yet means hey, you're
on a trajectory, a learning

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.500
trajectory.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.730
Maybe you're not at the finish
line, but you're on your way

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.230
there.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:09.370
And the students went around
the school unabashedly saying

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.640
to each other, how many
Not Yets do you have,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.170
how many Not Yets do you have?

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.660
So we started a
program of research

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.220
that's still
continuing on the word

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:27.480
yet, and showing that saying
not yet after a wrong answer

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.730
keeps up motivation and
encourages persistence.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.500
And listen to yourself.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.170
If sometimes you say,
I'm not a "hmm" person,

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:43.060
or I could never do "hmm,"
then just add the word yet.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.420
Or if one of your employees
says, I can't do it,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.010
I'm no good at this yet, it
takes a very fixed mindset

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:58.400
statement, and it puts it in a
whole different growth mindset

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.824
context.

00:27:59.824 --> 00:28:01.740
MALE SPEAKER: Just the
second to last question

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.580
for me is you did some
interesting research very

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.964
recently around gaming and
gaming applied to math.

00:28:07.964 --> 00:28:09.380
Talk a little bit
about how you're

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.050
able to incorporate your
concept of the growth mindset

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.680
into that experience.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.840
CAROL DWECK: We teamed
up with Zoran Popovic

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.070
and his colleagues at the
University of Washington

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:26.480
to create a math game
called Brain Points

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.380
that incorporated growth
mindset principles.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.700
There were algorithms
built into the game that

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.010
detected the students' effort,
their use of strategies,

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:39.975
and their improvement.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.200
And then in our experiment,
we compared Brain Points

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.830
to the standard
version of the game.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.500
Now the standard
version of the game

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.540
is your usual game,
where the more you

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.680
zoom through and answer
problems correctly,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.750
the more you rack up points.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.690
Not in Brain Points.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.790
Actually, if you zoom
through, it apologizes to you

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.690
and says you didn't earn
any points that time.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:13.360
We're sorry.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.380
We'll give you something more
challenging the next time.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.660
So what happened
was this: First,

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.660
students played-- these
were grade school students--

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.040
they played longer
because they could

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.510
leave the game at any point.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.730
They played
significantly longer.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.240
They used more strategies.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.150
We dropped in difficult
problems occasionally.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.420
They persevered on them longer.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.150
But this was my
favorite finding:

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:51.080
In the standard version, it
was mostly the high achievers

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.330
who played to the end.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.440
But in the Brain
Points version, they

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.380
stayed in, they played to
the end, they liked it,

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.740
but so many more lower
and medium achievers also

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.092
stayed till the end.

00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:08.925
MALE SPEAKER: So what
keeps you up and night

00:30:08.925 --> 00:30:11.070
as you think about where
your research can go,

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.920
because like any
scientific endeavor,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.050
it's constantly being
challenged and revisited.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:18.810
What keeps you up worrying
about where your theory could

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.552
be right or wrong or improved?

00:30:21.552 --> 00:30:22.260
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.370
I always had this
attitude of challenging

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.520
my ideas and my theories,
because if you're wrong,

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.610
you want to know it
as soon as possible.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.640
You don't want to
spend your life on it.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.830
So what keeps me up
at night in a good way

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:44.590
are different areas where
it could be applied.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.940
So we have a whole
program of research

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.750
on peace in the
Middle East where

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.246
we're using mindset principles.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.270
I'm not minimizing the
hugeness of the problem,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.520
but we're using
mindset principles

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:09.550
to try to build some
greater understanding.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:15.860
So I love to think of ways that
we can extend it into areas

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.680
we never thought of before.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.580
I love to think of
ways to implement it

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.210
so that more kids who
need this way of thinking

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.220
can benefit from it.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.580
And something that also
keeps me up at night

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:38.060
is the fear that people
are developing what I'm

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.020
calling a false growth mindset.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.180
It's this idea of if
it's good, I have it.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.980
So a lot of people are kind
of declaring they have it,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.040
but they don't.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.740
They think it just means
open-minded or being

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:01.300
a nice person, or maybe
they're saying they have it

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.810
for fixed mindset reasons.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:08.170
I want you to judge me as
being the right kind of person.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.350
So developing a growth
mindset is really a journey.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:18.440
It's a lifelong journey of
monitoring your trigger points

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.990
and trying to approach things
in a more growth mindset way

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.690
of taking on the challenges,
sticking to them,

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.610
learning from them.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:31.640
So right now I'm writing
something for educators

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:39.670
that I'm calling false growth
mindset to tell them, no, you

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:40.950
can't just say it.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.260
You have to take a journey.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.240
Because we're doing research
now showing that many teachers

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:48.170
and parents who say they
have a growth mindset

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.870
are actually responding
to kids in ways

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.350
that are creating fixed
mindsets for the kids.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.310
So that's kind of
the array of things

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.640
that keep me up at night.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.584
But that said, I do
sleep pretty well.

00:33:03.584 --> 00:33:05.000
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, with that

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.735
we'll open up for questions
from the audience.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:09.860
And I'm going to take a
quick look at the dory too,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.780
so the mics can
get passed around.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.500
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was introduced
to your book a couple of years

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.000
ago.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.270
And I have 15
nieces and nephews.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.270
And I find myself,
when I'm with them,

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.780
I don't know what
to say to them.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.840
Because I don't want to
be, oh, you're so smart.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.420
Because I'm not supposed to
use that word or whatever.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.990
But it's like I forget
what to say when they're

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.330
telling me about friends
at school or problems

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.170
they're having.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.760
It's somethings like
that sounds really hard.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.156
Am I just supposed to
say, well, that's hard.

00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:42.030
I can do hard things.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.052
You can do hard things.

00:33:43.052 --> 00:33:44.010
Do you have any advice?

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.380
CAROL DWECK: OK.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:53.470
The question is if you can't
say smart, what can you say?

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.480
You can say so
many other things.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.790
One thing is you can just
show interest in the process

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:05.345
that the child or other
person is engaging in.

00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:07.540
In our research,
that's what we've

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.670
shown is effective:
focusing on the process,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.969
or appreciating the process,
someone is engaging in

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.230
or that has engaged in.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:23.520
So just show interest, ask
questions, give encouragement

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.350
if they've been
grappling with something

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:31.040
and they've tried new strategies
or stuck to the strategies.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.510
One parent said, oh, I hate it
because I can't appreciate when

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.630
my child does something great.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.260
I say, whoa, where'd
you get that from?

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.710
Of course you can appreciate
it, but then tie it

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.389
to something they engaged in.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:48.080
Oh, you couldn't
do that yesterday.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.790
You made progress.

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.199
That's so exciting.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.080
Oh, that's great.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.620
You really stuck to
it and learned it.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:01.340
Or you tried all different
ways and look, that worked.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.840
So you're really
appreciating some outcome

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.360
where they are,
and you're talking

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.170
about how they got there.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.820
But if you don't have that
information, just ask them.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.220
Never praise effort
that isn't there.

00:35:20.629 --> 00:35:22.420
MALE SPEAKER: Got a
question from our Dory,

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.630
and then we'll go
back to the room.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.129
So the question
from the Dory is how

00:35:25.129 --> 00:35:29.160
do you think shame plays a role
in the growth mindset-- fixed

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.220
versus growth?

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.870
CAROL DWECK: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:37.390
We have studied
that, and we have

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:44.750
shown that shame is a big
factor in a fixed mindset.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.800
You don't want to
take on a challenge.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.890
It's humiliating to have the
set back within a fixed mindset.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.070
It means you're not the
person you want to be,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.390
and other people aren't going
to look at you in the same way.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.170
We've studied it in adolescence.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:07.660
Adolescents in a fixed
mindset feel incredible shame

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.230
when they are
excluded or rejected,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.740
and that makes them want
to lash out violently.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.940
For many years, many
people's research

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.400
has shown that shame is
not a productive emotion.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.300
It makes you want
to hide or lash out,

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.770
both of which are
not going to get you,

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.170
in the long run,
where you want to be.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:40.920
In a growth mindset, you
could feel very disappointed.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.820
You can feel hurt.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.300
You can feel guilty.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:47.450
You can feel a lot of things.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.280
But these are emotions that
allow you to go forward and be

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.791
constructive.

00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:55.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Jennifer and thanks

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.016
for coming to speak with us.

00:36:57.016 --> 00:36:59.506
I worked on the K-12
education outreach team

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:02.550
here, focusing specifically
on computer science education

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.130
and diversity in that.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.860
So I'm curious if you've
looked into how stereotypes may

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.620
interact with growth mindset.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.430
For instance, thinking
that math is not for girls.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.490
How does that interact
with growth mindset?

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.380
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.880
So how does the growth mindset
interact with stereotypes?

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.470
We've done extensive
research on that.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:36.380
So a fixed mindset would be the
belief that I can't do math,

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.380
girls can't do math, et cetera.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.980
And a growth mindset is it's
a learned set of skills.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.860
Anyone can get better at them.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.610
So notice, first of all, that
a stereotype is a fixed mindset

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.110
label.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.660
It says it's fixed and certain
groups have it and certain

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.270
groups don't.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.770
But in our research,
we also find

00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:00.950
that when females have a fixed
mindset about math or computer

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.210
science, they're more
vulnerable to the stereotypes.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.730
So in one study that we
did at Columbia University,

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.040
we found that when
women in calculus

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.230
have a fixed mindset
about their calculus,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:24.880
their math abilities, when they
encountered stereotyping where

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.690
they felt their classmates
or the professors

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:32.890
thought women weren't as good
as men, they fell prey to that.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:37.580
So as we tracked them over their
semester they started thinking,

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:41.760
I don't belong here, I
don't like this anymore,

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.450
I don't have confidence I
can succeed in this area.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.660
And ultimately, they
did not intend as much

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.610
to take it in the future.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.730
Whereas if they had
a growth mindset,

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.940
they did not like
the stereotyping,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.660
but it didn't speak to them.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.460
They didn't believe that
they couldn't improve, learn,

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.950
and succeed.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.680
So they maintained
their confidence,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.990
and maintained their
enjoyment of math,

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:17.430
and they maintained their desire
to take math in the future.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.530
We just finished a study of
women in computer science

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.850
and are finding very
similar things in addition

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.790
to finding that teaching
a growth mindset

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.920
is helping women
withstand the stereotypes,

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.860
maintain their interest,
maintain the sense that it's

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.290
a field they belong in.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:44.000
And these result in higher
grades in the course.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.410
So we're very, very interested
in that intersection

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:54.290
between growth mindset
and stereotyping.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.730
We also are finding at
the transition to college

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:04.790
that learning a
growth mindset helps

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:10.300
students from underrepresented
groups in general even more,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.000
because it helps them deal
with stereotypes that they

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.855
might encounter.

00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:18.730
MALE SPEAKER: Got another
Dory question here,

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.760
which I think is an
interesting take.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.020
Do you see any context in
which a fixed mindset is more

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.442
beneficial to growth mindset?

00:40:26.442 --> 00:40:27.900
CAROL DWECK: Well,
first let me say

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.110
that a growth mindset
doesn't require you to go

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.790
around improving everything.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.510
You can focus.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.670
And you can decide no,
I'm not going to do

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.580
that, I'm not going to do that.

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.750
But research, not my research,
but research of others

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.680
has, in fact, looked
at this question

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.400
and found two areas,
so far, in which

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.130
a fixed mindset is better.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.250
One is sexual orientation.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.680
People who accept that this
is who they are and this

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:03.370
is who they are meant to be
seem to be better adjusted

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.310
than people who think
I should be changing.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:11.280
And the other is aging.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.870
So it's nice to feel you can
stay young through exercise

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.510
and so forth, but people who
run around nipping, and tucking,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.780
and the tummy tuck,
and the this, that,

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.720
and the other-- it's kind
of a desperate attempt

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.230
to retain extreme youth.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.090
That doesn't seem to
be so great either.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.420
But when it comes
to skill areas,

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:46.020
it looks like a growth mindset
is typically more advantageous.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.620
AUDIENCE: Could you
identify specific behaviors

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.990
that one to try to
advancing on the journey

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.410
for an open mindset?

00:41:56.410 --> 00:42:01.665
And how do you know that you're
not kidding yourself or falsely

00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:03.005
believing that you are one?

00:42:03.005 --> 00:42:04.745
How do you know
when you get there?

00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:06.110
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.100
Great question.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.750
What are some
specific behaviors you

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:15.640
can do to get yourself on
the road to a growth mindset?

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.770
Here are some ideas.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.940
So first, if you have
a choice of something

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:27.280
safe versus the challenge,
take the challenge.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.920
If you hit an obstacle,
try to interpret it

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.290
in a growth mindset way.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.480
So what can I learn from this?

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.580
What can I do next?

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.080
As I mentioned
before, if you see

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:46.050
someone who's better than
you, go learn from them.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:49.940
So those are a set
of behaviors you

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.670
can start doing in
addition to, as I also

00:42:54.670 --> 00:43:00.210
mentioned before, monitoring
those fixed mindset triggers.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:07.990
And this thing is that it's a
journey that one is always on.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.610
It's not ever the
case that you've

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.550
arrived at a full,
permanent growth mindset.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:21.860
It's something that you have
to look at all the time.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.100
So listen to that voice in your
head at the trigger points,

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.990
because even I hear myself
saying sometimes in my head.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.440
I was never good at that.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.880
Whoa, did I say that?

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.680
So listen to that
voice that's constantly

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.710
running in your head.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:48.350
And I actually recommend that
as a very, very first step.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:52.680
The first few weeks that
you embark on this journey,

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:58.240
don't push yourself to
exhibit any growth mindset

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.920
characteristics.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.440
Just listen to that voice
that says, don't try this,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.110
you might look foolish.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.360
You made a mistake.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.560
If people knew that,
they wouldn't look at you

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.720
in the same way.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.230
That person's better than me.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:15.480
I hate them.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.320
Just whatever that voice
is saying in your head,

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.680
listen to it.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.760
And even do it with friends.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.410
Discuss it.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.710
Or when you see
someone doing something

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.840
that looks effortless,
are you thinking,

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.160
oh, they're just
brilliant and talented?

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.570
Catch yourself thinking that.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:38.640
Or someone who's struggling,
are you thinking, oh, they're

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.250
not really good at that.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:44.090
Albert Einstein says
I'm not that smart.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.560
I'm not smarter
than other people.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.710
And he meant it.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.250
He said, I just stick
to things to longer.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.510
That's why people thought
he was slow, originally.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:58.070
He knew he didn't understand
time, space, energy,

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.170
and so forth.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.530
So I would say the
very first step

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.780
is the first few weeks just
listen to that fixed mindset

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.300
voice.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.330
It's there.

00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.450
We all have it, and
if you don't hear it,

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.420
it will rule your behavior.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.720
I actually read your book right
before I started at Google.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.330
And I know I have a
very fixed mindset,

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:22.320
and this is sort of a fixed
mindset question, even.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:31.210
But have you seen patterns in
which kids have fixed mindsets?

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:33.880
Are there differences
across socioeconomic lines?

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.290
Do you see that
certain teachers--

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:40.660
most of their students will
have the growth mindset?

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.910
Do you see patterns with
who has the growth mindset,

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.772
and how does that
happen to kids?

00:45:46.772 --> 00:45:47.480
CAROL DWECK: Yes.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.300
So first of all,
I don't rule out

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.170
that there could be
temperamental factors.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:56.850
You kids pop out differently.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:02.180
And some of them you see they're
tearing around the world.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:02.920
They fall down.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.530
They get up.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.920
And then other kids, you
look at them sideways,

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.980
and they think, what did I do?

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.030
So there could be these
temperamental factors.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.890
But we've shown the
environment is really powerful.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:19.090
We actually did a study where
we looked at mothers' praise

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.870
to babies.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.820
And found that the praise
they gave to their one, two,

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.210
and three-year-olds predicted
the child's mindset and desire

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.730
for challenge five years later.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.510
So that environment is powerful.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:36.100
Another thing we found is
that the way parents reacts

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.820
to kids' mistakes is
this big determinant

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.010
of the child's mindset.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.050
A parent can say, I
have a growth mindset.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:48.220
But if a child makes
a mistake, and they

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:51.970
act like it's negative,
importantly negative,

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:54.860
or even if they excuse
it and gloss over it

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.200
in a way that communicates
to the child is negative.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:03.690
That child is more likely to
have more of a fixed mindset.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:07.490
So yeah, there can be
temperamental input.

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.526
The environment is powerful.

00:47:10.526 --> 00:47:11.359
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:47:11.359 --> 00:47:13.770
I want to thank you so
much for taking time

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.127
to come to Google today
and for the terrific turn

00:47:16.127 --> 00:47:17.960
out that we have here
and, I know, virtually

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.685
through the live stream.

00:47:18.685 --> 00:47:19.570
So thank you very much.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.486
CAROL DWECK: Pleasure.

00:47:20.486 --> 00:47:21.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:22.920
Thank you.
