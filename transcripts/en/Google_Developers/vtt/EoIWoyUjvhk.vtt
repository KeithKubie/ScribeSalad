DALE HUMBY: Welcome everyone
to our fourth Hangout

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.050
of Experts on Air, hosted by
the Google Developer Expert Team

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.380
from around Africa.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.720
To introduce the GDE program,
Google Developer experts

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.580
are recognized by Google as
experts on various Google

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.650
technologies, such
as Android and cloud.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.830
Every month we host a show,
and it's a live Hangout on air.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.820
And each month we
present a theme.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
Today's theme is implementing
material design on Android.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.370
And after the show,
you'll be able to download

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.610
the MP3 podcast,
and we'll also make

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.780
the video available on
YouTube to watch later.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.720
To introduce our panel
today, we've got Alex Koller.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.440
And he's an Android GDE from
Cape Town in South Africa.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.560
And he's going to be
presenting the Android talk.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.130
We've got Johan du
Troit and Hiren Patel,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.600
and they're both Cloud
GDEs from Cape Town.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.920
We've got Femi Taiwo.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.240
And he's a cloud GDE
from Lagos [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.330
And Kenneth Kinyanjui, a cloud
GDE from Nairobi and Kenya.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.319
We've got Dario Mungoi, and
he's one of our newest GDEs.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.920
And his speciality
is also Android.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.790
And he's joining us from
Maputo, in Mozambique.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.230
Also joining us today
is Eugene Mutai,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.360
an AngularJS GDE from Nairobi.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.710
And from the Google team,
we've got Mercy Orangi,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.540
and she's in charge of the
Google Developer ecosystem.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.060
She's a community manager
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.840
with a main focus
on Google Launchpad.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350
And myself, Dale Humby,
also a Cloud GDE.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.430
I come from Cape Town.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.110
And I'll be hosting
your show today.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.810
First off, we're going to hear
from our spotlight speaker, who

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.310
is Femi.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.710
And he's one of our newer
GDEs, telling us about himself

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.019
and what's happening in
his community in Nigeria.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:46.435
Then we're going
to have Alex, who

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:48.940
is going to be presenting
our topic for today,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.670
"Implementing Material
Design on Android."

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.260
After which, we go into a five
minute question and answer

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.210
session, where you can post your
questions in the Hangout on Air

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.110
Q&amp;A app, the G+ event page,
or the Google Development

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.245
Africa's community G+ page.

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:09.470
And we'll give Android GDEs
Alex and Dario a chance

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.889
to answer your questions.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.050
And then we're going to have
a quick wrap up at the end.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.530
So first up, we've got Femi.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.030
Femi, you're one of our first
Google Developer Experts

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.887
in West Africa.

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.470
Can you tell us a
bit about your story

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.277
and how you got into
being in software?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.530
FEMI TAIWO: Right.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.930
Thanks, Dale.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.990
I'm glad to be here.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.545
My name is Femi Taiwo.

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:35.780
And I'm a developer on
Cloud, the first [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.480
here in West Africa.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.135
I am the CTO for a company that
I co-founded six years ago.

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:44.220
We are called INITS, and
we do solutions mostly

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.460
around identity management.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.530
So you asked about my story.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.230
I began programming about 12
years ago with QBasic on 133.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.510
And I have spent
quite a bit of time

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.650
moving around five or
six different languages.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.615
I've sort of settled on just
two, that's Python and PHP.

00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:08.960
I love [AUDIO OUT]
weekend hacks,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.300
creating small
apps, small stuff.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.372
[INAUDIBLE] still like
writing lots of code.

00:03:16.372 --> 00:03:17.080
DALE HUMBY: Cool.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.230
And part of the
work that you do is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.240
to help organize
events around Lagos.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.850
What sort of events are
upcoming that we could go to?

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.960
FEMI TAIWO: It's
called a DevFest.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.210
A DevFest brings
together hundreds

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.990
of developers in one location
to learn, share, and interact.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.820
Here in Nigeria,
there are six of them.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.100
We've already had three.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.010
And there's one happening now in
Abidjan this weekend, next week

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.460
in Kano, and finally, one in
Lagos at the end of November.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.880
You can find out more
about them on the links

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.010
we share after this [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.380
DALE HUMBY: Cool, thank you.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.070
And you also have made a
couple of apps in your past.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.110
Anything that you're
famous or infamous for?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.240
FEMI TAIWO: Yes.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.130
Our most popular
gig is software we

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.550
wrote that was used
to register 70,

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.160
71 million people in Nigeria
for general elections.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.210
Computer software that did that.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.190
And in respect to apps,
it would be NewsBasket.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.380
It's a mobile app focused
on news in Nigeria,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.420
and something that we
just released again today.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.510
DALE HUMBY: And recently
you've migrated NewsBasket

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.130
to Material Design, right?

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.540
FEMI TAIWO: Yes.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.160
There's now a new version we
put up on Play Store today.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.740
It was created using much
of our design principles.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.140
And the feedback from our first
users has being quite good.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.010
We're happy with it.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.080
[AUDIO OUT] --looks,
it feels, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.780
DALE HUMBY: Great, thanks Femi.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.730
I'm now going to
hand over to Alex.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.050
And he's going to tell
us how we can migrate

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.460
our apps to Material
Design, like Femi

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.796
did for his NewsBasket app.

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:19.870
Over to you, Alex.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.130
ALEX KOLLER: Thanks, Dale.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.130
So everyone, I am
Alex, and we're

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.170
going to walk through
implementing some Material

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.896
Design patterns on Android.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:33.330
So, just a quick recap of
what Material Design is.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.950
It's a design framework
for implementing

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.360
a consistent design
across multiple platforms,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.020
including the web
and native mobile.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.140
It focuses on bold
colors, tangible surfaces,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.074
and meaningful motion.

00:05:48.074 --> 00:05:50.490
But we're not going to focus
too much on the theory of it,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.570
because in our previous
episode of this Hangout on Air,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.440
Hiren Patel covered that and
implementing it on the web.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.070
So be sure to check that
out if you are still

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.140
interested in Material Design.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.950
We're going to have lots of
XML layouts and code snippets

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.060
in the presentation.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.840
But don't worry about getting
all of that detail down.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.760
These slides and
more information

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.820
will be available
after the show.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.080
So why go Material?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.250
Well ultimately, it's to improve
the UI and success of your app.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.040
Using a design that's consistent
with the operating system

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.560
design builds the user's trust
in your app and your brand.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.150
Case studies suggest that
a well-implemented material

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.060
design can significantly
increase conversions

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.870
within an app.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.240
Google Developer Story videos
are first hand experiences

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.242
of developers using
Google products.

00:06:44.242 --> 00:06:45.950
And we're going to
look at a few of those

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.760
now, where the teams actually
implemented in Material Design.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.960
Up first is Trello, which
is a visual collaboration

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.620
tool that gives teams a shared
perspective on projects.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.140
And they found that after
implementing Material Design,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.500
they saw a significantly
increased engagement

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.060
from users across most of
the tasks within the app.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.060
The next one we're going
to have a quick look at

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.960
is The Hunt, which is a style
and product sharing community.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.590
They found that in comparison
to platforms where they didn't

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.520
have any Material Design,
they saw a 50% improvement

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.850
in starting hunts.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.220
And this is a strong
indication that people

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.896
want to interact
with Material Design.

00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:31.950
The last one we're going
to have a quick look at

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.040
is Pocket Casts, which
is a leading podcasting

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.256
app on Android.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.110
And they found that
Material Design

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.870
helped them make the app
available across all forms

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.810
of Android, including Android
Wear, Auto TV, and Chromecast.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.770
And this led to a 30%
increase in sales.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.150
So be sure to watch these
and more Developer Story

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.540
videos to learn how those who
have already found success

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.800
have done it.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.356
So now that you're convinced
that Material Design is

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:01.980
something you want
to do with your app,

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.120
how are we going to
go about doing it?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.580
Well, that's where the Design
Support Library comes in.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.320
It's part of the support
library family on Android.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.950
It adds support for various
Material Design components

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.910
and patterns for app
developers to build

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.490
upon, such as
navigation drawers,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.730
floating action buttons,
snackbars, and tabs.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.620
It also lets you
apply material styles

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.230
to all existing components,
such as EditTexts, CheckBoxes,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.870
and dialogues.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.630
And possibly most
importantly, it

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.250
lets you build a
consistent material

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:43.230
design all the way
back to Android 2.1.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.200
So to implement this Design
Support Library in your app,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.237
simply add this dependency
to your gradle build file.

00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:53.570
As you can see, I've listed
other support libraries that

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.680
are available, and these will
help you create a more complete

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.930
material design.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.990
Such things as CardViews
and RecyclerViews.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.250
But we're going to focus
just on the Support Design

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.040
Library for now.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.440
So the first thing you'll do is
set up your application theme.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.770
And it's important to note
here that we are extending

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.470
the Theme.AppCompat themes.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.540
And that makes sure that
the material attributes

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.770
are applied to your app.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.890
And then we'll want to
define a few colours.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.160
Colour Primary, Primary Dark,
and Colour Accent are the main

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.440
colours that will be used
throughout your app for styling

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.230
and giving colour to
things such as toolbars,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.345
and action buttons, and
accents to all of the controls.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.840
We're going to have a quick
look at how to implement

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.885
a few material UI components.

00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:48.510
First one we're going
to have a look at

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.030
is quite a common
pattern where there

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.050
is an AppBar and
flexible space at the top

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.900
of some scrollable
content on your screen.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.090
As you can see on this slide,
as the user scrolls up,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.521
the top section gets collapsed
into a more compact version

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.020
of that.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.170
So to get started,
the first thing

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.340
we need to know a bit about
is the CoordinatorLayout.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.470
And this is a new layout
that was introduced

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.820
in the Design Support Library.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.860
And it coordinates
animation behavior

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.060
between views inside of it.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.960
It's possible to define
your own behaviors,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.157
but basic ones are provided for
floating action bars, AppBars,

00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:31.740
and snackbars.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.680
So basically, it
lets the views inside

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.690
of that layout interact
with each other

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.790
without those views knowing
too much about the other views.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.730
Let's get into
our AppBar layout.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:51.670
So this XML layout shows
that we have an AppBar layout

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.780
at the top.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.057
And inside of that, a
CollapsingToolbarLayout.

00:10:56.057 --> 00:10:58.140
And that's the one that's
responsible for actually

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:03.400
collapsing the space and moving
the views around inside of it.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.800
Now you can see, we've set
some scroll flags on that view.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.232
We've set it to scroll
and exit until collapsed.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:13.940
And that says that
when the user scrolls,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.940
that section should also scroll.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.420
And it should be collapsed
until the user starts

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.700
scrolling back down again.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.400
And inside of that layout we
have two views-- an image view

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.380
and a toolbar.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.310
The image view is acting as a
flexible space in this example.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.390
And the toolbar will
be pinned at the top.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.690
And let's set the collapse mode
to pin so it will stay there.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.430
And on the image view,
our collapse mode

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.540
is set to parallax.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.000
And that means it will scroll
with a parallax effect,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.566
slightly slower than
the content below it.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:51.580
And that's all you need
to implement that pattern.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.900
It's quite straightforward.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.550
Next we'll look at the
Floating Action Button.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.500
And just as a reminder,
that's the circular button

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.940
that's used to promote a
primary action on your screen.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.940
It's usually anchored
to one of the corners

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:10.350
or sides of the screen or
along the seam of two views.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.710
To implement it is
quite straightforward.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.560
We simply implement a
FloatingActionButton view.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.110
And this extends an image for
you so you can use it in a way

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.370
that you're familiar with.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.328
But there are a couple
of attributes that we'll

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:23.250
look at specifically.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.380
And that's the layout gravity,
which lets us anchor that

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.160
to the side of our layout.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.570
And also the FAB size.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.920
We have two options there, the
normal size or a mini size.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.860
And as you can see, we've
included this inside

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.740
of our CoordinatorLayout
because that lets

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.066
us interact with other views.

00:12:42.066 --> 00:12:43.940
So we're going to have
a quick look at adding

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.540
a snackbar to the set up.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.320
Now the animation
you'll see on this slide

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.830
shows that when the
snackbar comes up,

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.770
it actually moves the floating
action button with it.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.250
So, snackbar is like a
toast, except it forms

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.490
part of the view hierarchy.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.570
So it actually interacts
as part of your view.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.610
And what we've got here,
this little bit of code

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.240
is to say when the Floating
Action Button is pressed,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.520
simply create a
snackbar and show it.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.650
And that's what you're
seeing in the animation.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.430
And because those
two views are inside

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.020
of the same Coordinator Layout,
they interact with each other.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.080
And that's a Coordinator Layout
in action using the default

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.980
behaviors of those two views.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.060
One more pattern is
the Navigation Drawer,

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.760
that you should
be familiar with.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.840
It's a flexible
navigation pattern,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.210
and it usually slides
in from the left.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.770
As you can see in
this screenshot,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.450
it has a section at
the top where you can

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.680
put anything you want in it.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.017
And then the navigation
items below that.

00:13:46.017 --> 00:13:48.100
And we've actually got it
separated with sub-items

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.350
in this one.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.820
So let's have a quick look at
how we will implement that.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.620
First, you'll see on the
left we have the XML layout.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.880
At the top level of our layout,
we have the drawer layout.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.380
And inside of it,
as the last child,

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.590
we add the new NavigationView.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.250
And that is effectively a
drawer that will slide out.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.460
And we've added special
properties to that.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.440
The Header Layout, which can
be any XML layout that gets

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.250
inflated into that properties
section of the page view.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.950
And then we also have
the menu [? attribute. ?]

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.930
And that will look
for an XML menu

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.240
file that we've defined on
the right of this slide.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.450
And that defines the
groups and items that

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.050
are in the navigation drawer.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.940
And you can see that
we've got one group there

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.790
and multiple items inside of it.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.020
And for each item, we can define
the icon that's displayed,

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.340
and also the title of
the text is displayed.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.590
So with those two files
and the Header Layout,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.590
you can very quickly get a
Navigation Drawer in place.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.390
So if you've been
following along,

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.280
you already have a
materialized app.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.930
Isn't that fantastic?

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.380
Well, almost.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.620
It's worth noting that although
it's very easy to get started,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.750
there are a few tricky bits you
need to master along the way.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.400
But don't worry,
it's available online

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.190
in a detailed codelab, which
we'll look at in a second.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.610
It's also worth
noting that there

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.790
are a few bugs in that
Design Support Library,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.370
but there are regular
releases that help fix

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.060
those problems as they develop.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.920
So the codelab I
mentioned is a brand

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.320
new Material Design and
codelab for building

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.460
apps with the Design
Support Library.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.180
Exactly what we've
covered today,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.660
but in a lot more detail.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.160
The link will be posted
just after this Hangout,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.830
but that is definitely
the place you

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.190
will want to start if you're
new to Material Design

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.660
and want to get going quickly.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.230
So there are no excuses now.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.560
It's time to get going.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.060
And here are some important
links and resources.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.150
First of all,
Material Design Spec.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.500
That's everything you need to
know about Material Design.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.420
And we've also got the code
lab, which I just mentioned.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:04.110
And probably most importantly,
our Google Developers Africa

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.080
community.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.870
It's the best community of the
funnest developers in Africa.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.220
So be sure to check that out
if you're not familiar with it.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.550
Thank you.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.010
DALE HUMBY: Thanks
so much, Alex.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.110
That was great.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.890
I'm now going to hand over
to Johan and Kenneth, who

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.150
are going to field the questions
that you may have and post them

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.850
to Android GDEs Alex and Dario.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.420
So if you have any questions,
please post them in the Hangout

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.680
on Air Q&amp;A app or in the G+
event page for this event,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.050
or on the Google Developer
Community G+ page.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.060
So Johan and
Kenneth, over to you.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.670
Thanks.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.378
Yeah, so we're watching
all the channels.

00:16:42.378 --> 00:16:44.610
If you have any questions,
just pop them in there.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.502
So the first one I got was,
"is there any downsides

00:16:48.502 --> 00:16:49.710
to actually using Materials?"

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.690
So, does it take more battery,
is it a bigger app size?

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.830
Is it only for
certain types of apps?

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.890
What would you say?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.440
ALEX KOLLER: That's
a great question.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.980
Basically no,
there aren't really

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.030
any major drawbacks to
implementing Material Design.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.150
It's really just what
sits on top of your app.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.329
It's the UI layer.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.329
Although it's definitely
not suited to all apps.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.890
I wouldn't use it for
a game, for example.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.760
But for most general
applications,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.020
it certainly is the
design framework

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.329
that you should look at.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.070
KENNETH KINYANJUI: We've
also got another one.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.160
Is it only on certain
versions of Android?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.200
And also, "will it be a
problem if my users are running

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.260
older versions of Android?"

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.100
ALEX KOLLER: Another
great question.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:47.290
Maybe this is a good opportunity
to bring Dario into the fold.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.370
DARIO MUNGOI: Hello guys.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.770
So going straight to
the answer, actually,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.380
as Alex said during
the presentation,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.920
the Material Design
supports apps

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.430
running from API 7, which
is the version 2.1 app.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.650
So there's no need to worry
about compatibility issues.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.550
So it's good to go.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.710
JOHAN DU TOIT: [INAUDIBLE] I've
got another question about when

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.340
you're putting screenshots
on the app store

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.060
and it's a Material app.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.700
Are there certain guidelines
that you should follow?

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.359
Where can you have
a look at those?

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:28.900
ALEX KOLLER: Well,
there isn't really

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.050
any difference between
providing screenshots

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.910
when your design changes, it
will be done in the same way.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.030
But there are a bunch of
tools available to help

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.480
you make better screenshots.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.100
Starting with
Android Marshmallow,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.810
there's a System UI
Tuner developer option,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.550
which lets you set the
status bar as you want it

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.950
for your screenshots.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.292
And then also the
Device Art Generator,

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:51.375
which is available online.

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.130
It helps you put
your screenshots

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.730
in nice, device frameworks,
frames, and nice shadow effects

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:02.920
so you can get very good looking
screenshots quite easily.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.440
JOHAN DU TOIT: And I'm
sure you'll link us, right?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.966
ALEX KOLLER: I
certainly will, yeah.

00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:12.120
KENNETH KINYANJUI: So
we've got another one.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.062
"Are only Material apps
featured on the App Store?"

00:19:16.062 --> 00:19:16.770
ALEX KOLLER: Aha.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.520
That is a question I've heard
from quite a few developers

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.680
because when Material
Design came out,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.640
it was obviously quite a lot
of work to immediately migrate

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.410
to Material.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.910
So there was a concern
that their apps might not

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.680
be featured by Google.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.130
But Google have said
that they don't only

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.840
feature Material apps.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.710
They feature well designed
apps and well built apps.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.420
So you don't have to stick
to Material framework.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.150
You should do what's best for
your product and your app.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.660
JOHAN DU TOIT: I've
got another one.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.370
So the Support
Library, does it only

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.510
point to that set of
components you showed,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.660
or is it a certain guideline,
it's principles, concepts,

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.829
that you can follow?

00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:02.620
ALEX KOLLER: Right.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.832
So I mentioned briefly the
Support Library family.

00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:09.040
And that means that there's
actually a whole bunch of

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.630
[AUDIO OUT] And most
of them are focused

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.180
on features being back ported
from new versions of Android.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.630
But the Design Library
is specific in that it

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.590
adds new components and
behaviors to Android.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:30.840
So the Design Support Library
does add new UI components,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.250
whereas the Material Spec, which
is the online version of how

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.230
Material should work--
that explains how

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:40.200
it should work in great detail.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.850
Whereas the Design
Support Library

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.020
provides you with components
to just add to your app.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.545
JOHAN DU TOIT: I'll take
the next one then quick too.

00:20:54.545 --> 00:21:00.110
I see someone who likes
the YouTube animations.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.305
Are animations-- because
I've seen a lot of them

00:21:02.305 --> 00:21:05.540
and this person has to--
when you scroll down

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.110
and you see the header grow
smaller, is that built in?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.285
So, are there animation
libraries that you can use?

00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:14.968
Or is that separate
from Material?

00:21:14.968 --> 00:21:17.782
How would you go
about doing that?

00:21:17.782 --> 00:21:18.740
ALEX KOLLER: Excellent.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.680
So one of the important
parts of Material Design

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.410
is to use motion meaningfully.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.740
And you described some
good examples of that.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.420
And the Support Design
Library does help facilitate

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.450
a lot of that motion, as we saw
with the snackbar on the FAB

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.400
and also the collapsing
toolbar layout.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.300
The example about
the icon animating

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.510
is probably a brilliant
example of the animated

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.620
effect [? drawable. ?]
Now that is available

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.710
in Lollipop and Up
only at the moment.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.270
It hasn't yet been back ported
to the Design Support Library.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.881
But I'm pretty sure we will
see it there soon enough.

00:21:59.362 --> 00:22:00.320
JOHAN DU TOIT: Awesome.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.440
Well, that's all the
questions I can see.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.780
Kenneth, I don't know
if you can see any?

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.260
DALE HUMBY: OK.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.400
Thank you Johan and Kenneth
for fielding all the questions.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.500
Thanks everyone, for who
all asked the questions.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.890
And to Alex and Dario
for a great talk

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.250
and answering our questions.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.230
Next, we have Hiren, who's going
to tell us about a recent PHP

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.279
conference that he presented at.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.070
Over to you, Hiren.

00:22:33.217 --> 00:22:34.300
HIREN PATEL: Thanks, Dale.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.610
So yes, I attended the
PHP conference recently.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.240
And basically, it's a conference
that happens every year here

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.410
in South Africa.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.640
And this year it happened
up in Johannesburg,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.720
sort of early October.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.350
So the conference
this year was centered

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.330
around one day of workshops
and two days of talks.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.590
And as part of the
GDE program, we

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.380
ran a workshop on PHP on Google
App Engine at the conference.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.340
So I thought this was
quite a fitting time

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.240
to run the workshop.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.090
The reason being that
PHP on Google App Engine

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.910
is now generally
available, which means

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.490
it's fully supported and so on.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.530
So that went quite well.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.950
We went through the
intro and a helloworld

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.190
on getting PHP
running on App Engine.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.370
We also had some international
speakers talking about PHP

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.490
Composer, as well as http/2.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.050
And then we had a passionate
bunch of local speakers

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.339
as well.

00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:32.880
So if you asked me what were
the hot topics at the conference

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.970
this year, they would have to
be the workshop and the talk

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:43.500
on Docker, the talk on
PHP 7, the talk on http/2,

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.120
and the workshop
and talk on Laravel,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.860
which is a new upcoming
PHP framework for the web.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.120
And if you asked me
what the community was

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.730
most excited about at
this conference-- so

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.670
we all know that most of
the web is run with PHP,

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.880
and so the community
and the speakers

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.750
were mostly excited
about the upcoming PHP 7.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.040
Mostly because of its
performance advantages

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.000
over the previous version 5.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.200
So for those who aren't
following the PHP 7

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.230
announcements, PHP 7's
is now close to that

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.400
of Facebook's HipHop runtime.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.140
So there's quite a bit of
reason for excitement there.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.020
And then couple
this with http/2,

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.486
and it means a lot
of good things coming

00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:27.610
for the web coming forward.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.679
So there's a lot of excitement
about these two things.

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:32.220
So I just want to
remind the audience

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.940
that the talks for the PHP
conferences are all recorded

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.730
and will go on to YouTube.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.980
So if you go to YouTube and you
search for the PHP South Africa

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.620
user, you will find recordings
for not just this year,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.200
but the previous years
of conference as well.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.435
So if you are a PHP
developer and you

00:24:48.435 --> 00:24:51.060
need to keep up to the industry
with what's going on in the PHP

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.450
world, I highly encourage you
to check this conference out.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.080
phpsouthafrica.com.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.050
And that's the wrap.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.746
Back to you, Dale.

00:24:59.746 --> 00:25:01.950
DALE HUMBY: Thanks
very much, Hiren.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.630
That's our show for the month.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.730
Thanks everyone for listening in
and posting all your questions.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.197
And to Alex and the GDEs
for joining us today.

00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:12.780
In the next two days,
we'll be posting

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.416
a link to the audio file as well
as a link to the YouTube video.

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:18.550
We'll put those in
the G+ community.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.140
We'd also love your feedback
for the show and any ideas

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.160
for the next show.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.880
If you would like to
speak at an upcoming event

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.940
or be featured in our spotlight,
also fill in the form.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.424
We'll make the links to those
feedback forms available

00:25:30.424 --> 00:25:32.040
in the G+ group.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.550
So, thank you everyone, and
see you in the next month.
