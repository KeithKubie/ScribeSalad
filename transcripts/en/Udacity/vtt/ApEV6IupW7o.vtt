Hi and welcome to Descriptive Statistics. Whether you're

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.910
a financial advisor, sports coach, or the everyday person,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.100
statistics allows you to summarize data and shapes how

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.550
we make decisions. In the first half of our

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.160
statistics series, you will learn how to compute

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.960
values from data by hand, and by using Google

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.990
spreadsheets. By the end of this course, you'll have

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.100
the tools necessary to gather, organize, compute and visualize

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.530
information from a data-set. And for the final project, you'll

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.010
use the tools you have learned to compute statistics hidden within

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.720
a deck of cards. So I'll let Katie Corminick take

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.870
over from here so you can get started with the class.
