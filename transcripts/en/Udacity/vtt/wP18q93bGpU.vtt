00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now here we have the earth,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Syene where the sun's rays strike vertically,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Alexandria where they strike at an angle α,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and this angle α is the same as this angle α,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we're hoping we can use that to calculate the circumference.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, let's see.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We know there's 360 degrees in a full circle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This alpha is going to represent some fraction of that 360 degrees--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
maybe a half, maybe a quarter--we don't know yet.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What we do know is that the ratio of this length--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to call this length d--to the full circumference of the earth

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
must be equal to the ratio of this angle

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
over 360 degrees.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, I'll talk about that more in a second, but let's just write that down.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The ratio of this distance d to the full circumference of the earth

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is also equal to the ratio of α to 360 degrees.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A good way to confirm that this equation makes sense

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is let's think of some limiting cases.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What if α were 0? That would be a really, really tiny angle covering absolutely no distance.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
0/360 = 0.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That would mean this length would have to be 0 as well. Good.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, what if α were a full 360 degrees?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What would d have to be for this formula to make sense?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Check the appropriate box.

00:01:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Would d have to be 0, 1, or C--the circumference of the earth?
