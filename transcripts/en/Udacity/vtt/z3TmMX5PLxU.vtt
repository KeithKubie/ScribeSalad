00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.590
Now let's work on finding
the intersection of planes.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.245
Let's start by assuming we have
two planes Ax + By + Cz = k1 and

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:15.296
Dx + Ey + Fz = k2,
where the normal vectors A,

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:19.146
B, C and D, E, F aren't parallel.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:22.230
Given two non-parallel planes,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.590
I claim their intersection will be
a line instead of a single point.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.890
&gt;From the picture,
this may seem intuitive but

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.340
how can we show this fact
algebraically in all cases?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.100
Let's use a tool from the previous
lesson, the cross product.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.940
Consider the cross product of these
two normal vectors n1 and n2.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.800
Since the two normal
vectors are not parallel

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.060
their cross product will not be zero.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.090
Also remember that n1 cross n2 will
be orthogonal to both n1 and n2.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.890
Let's pick an arbitrary point in
the intersection of the two planes and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.740
call it x0.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.480
If x is any other point
in the intersection,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.420
then let's call d sub x,
the vector from x0 to x.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.360
Since x0 and x are both in the first
plane, the vector connecting them,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.910
d sub x, will be orthogonal to the
normal vector to the first plane, n1.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.920
By similar reasoning since x0 and
x are both in plane two,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.660
the vector connecting them
dx will be orthogonal to n2.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.330
Since dx is orthogonal to both n1 and
n2 and since we're in three dimensions,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.360
dx must be parallel to
the cross product of n1 and n2.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.800
Since dx is parallel to n1 cross n2

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.680
no matter what x we picked, that means
the intersection of these two planes

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.350
has to be a line that is
parallel to n1 cross n2.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.700
So what are the consequences of this?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.650
Well if we have a system of two linear
equations in three dimensions, then

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.920
the set of point satisfying the system,
could form a line's worth of solutions,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.639
if the equations define two
planes that are not parallel.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.480
No solutions, if the equations
define different parallel planes, or

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.330
a whole plane's worth of solutions, if
the two equations define the same plane.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.900
However, if we introduce
a third equation to our system,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.010
then we could have another possibility.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.830
The common intersection of the three
planes could be a single point.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.140
Or it could be a line,
a plane, or nothing at all.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.030
There are a few important
observations we should make here.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.490
Recall that one equation in two
variables defines a line or

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.160
a one dimensional linear object.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.500
A single equation in three
dimensional space defines a plane,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.260
which is a two
dimensional linear object.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
In general a single equation
in some number of variables,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.180
will define a linear object
that has a number of dimensions

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.850
one less than the number of variables.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.320
However we need to be careful to
distinguish between an equation

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.570
say in two variables,
and an equation in,

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.000
say, three variables, where one of
the variables has a coefficient of 0.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.360
In the former case,
the equation defines a line in 2D.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320
But in the latter case the equation
defines a plane in 3D.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.580
Being aware of the context of your
problem will help you avoid this error.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.650
Another observation is that
the coefficients of the variables

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.600
in a linear equation
give the coordinates for

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.980
a normal vector to the linear
object it defines.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.942
So for the line Ax + By = k we
obtain the normal vector AB and

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:47.840
for the plane Ax + By + Cz = k,
we have a normal vector of ABC.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.200
This trend will continue as we
move into higher dimensions.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.970
And again, this is why the normal vector
is a useful piece of information for

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.730
defining a linear object.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.790
One last observation is that we need
at least two lines in two variables

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.830
to obtain a unique
intersection of lines.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.140
And we need at least three planes
in three dimensional space or

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.060
three variables to obtain a unique
intersection of the planes.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.180
This observation will generalize as we
progress into higher dimensions, and

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.690
in a little bit we'll see
an algebraic reason why it holds.
