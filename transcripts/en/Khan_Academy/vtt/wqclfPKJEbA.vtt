00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.520
- [Teacher] In multiple videos already,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.970
we have talked about the
three branches of government

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.280
at the federal level.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.450
You have the legislative
branch, which is Congress,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.740
made up of two houses.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.110
The House of Representatives
and the Senate.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.810
You have the executive branch
with the President at the head

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.643
of the executive branch.

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:22.460
And of course you have the judicial.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.640
Now what we're going to
focus on in this video is

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.270
in previous videos we've talked about that

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.060
the executive branch is in
charge of running the government

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.150
while the legislative
branch, they're the folks

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.640
who either write laws
or control the budget.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.650
Now what we're going to do in this video

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.960
is dig a little bit deeper in terms of how

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.960
does Congress have oversight
over the executive branch.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.490
When we think of the executive branch,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.170
we often think of the President or maybe

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.100
the people who work around the president.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.980
But the federal bureaucracy
is roughly 2.8 million people,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.170
and we talk about that in other videos.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.500
And so, how do we have oversight

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.770
over these 2.8 million people?

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.410
Well first of all, there is
a whole managerial structure

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.300
within the executive branch,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.940
but on top of that, you
have the legislative branch

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.460
having oversight over
the executive agencies.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.890
Over these 2.8 million people.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.800
And there's two primary
means of this oversight.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.880
The first one is Congress sets the budget.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.880
This is often known as power of the purse.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.200
And if Congress doesn't
like how a certain agency

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.390
is spending its money, they
might reduce the budget there.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.880
If they really think that
some agency's doing a good job

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.920
or needs more resources, they
might give them more resources

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.270
in the next budget.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.100
The other tool of
oversight that Congress has

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.110
is committee hearings.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.800
And we have talked about
this in other videos.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.970
But this is where the
appropriate committee

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.760
within Congress, it might
be within the Senate

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.330
or the House of Representatives,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.990
will call in leaders
from the executive agency

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.490
that they are overseeing
to ask them questions.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.190
Hey, why did this not go as we planned?

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.240
Or how do you deal with this situation?

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.750
Or why are you spending more money

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.730
than we thought you were
actually going to spend?

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.200
Now, to be clear, this is
not always going to work.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110
When we're talking about
2.8 million people,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.130
there definitely might
be things that go on

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.620
within these executive agencies
that Congress, of course,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.120
will not have complete control of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.770
with just these two levers.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.380
Or they might not even
know all of the details.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.970
But they try to do the committee hearings

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.010
in order to get a reasonable understanding

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.310
of what's going on and then
leverage their budgetary powers

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.790
in order to have some level of oversight.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.910
Now to get a feel for
what this looks like,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.440
I'm about to show you an example

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.070
of a Senate committee hearing.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.150
And this is a committee
hearing where they brought in

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670
some folks from the FBI.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.200
And what's interesting about this one,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.890
this is not about national security.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.680
This committee hearing is about relocating

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.460
or where they put the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.110
agency buildings.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.260
And you can see that there's
definitely a tone of oversight

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.960
in this video.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.430
- Mr. Matthews, I'm having a hard time

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.380
accepting what you're saying here.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.080
So I'ma be perfectly blunt about that.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.900
You now say a major reason for terminating

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.630
the original prospectus was that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.300
the transfer of the Hoover Building,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.690
something that you all
wanted, and we didn't want.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.270
Congress didn't like that idea.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.300
But you said it was
something you needed to do

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.220
to get it done.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.010
So now we're supposed to
believe that's the reason

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.690
why you terminated for
something that you wanted.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.610
Secondly, the consolidation,
one of the major reasons

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.020
for the consolidation on
costs is to save rental costs.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.070
That's what you've told us all along.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.910
That it's more expensive to have places

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.270
outside of the central location.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.980
And now you're saying it's a wash.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.730
Can you understand why
I'm hanging a hard time

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.300
accepting the information
you're presenting?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.193
- Yes, Senator.

00:03:56.193 --> 00:03:58.610
So with respect to your
first question, the issue--

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.236
- And quickly 'cause I heard-- we have

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:03.080
your written statement on the
transfer of the buildings.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.400
I agree with you on the
transfer of the building.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.430
Didn't makes sense.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.800
But you insisted on it.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.930
- Well I would say personally
I came here in August.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.740
- Your agency insisted
on it in the prospectives

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.770
that they submitted,
they insisted that this

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.200
be part of the deal.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.660
- Yes, they did, and I
suggest that was a mistake.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.270
- And I've suggest that the information

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.070
you're giving us right now
maybe likewise a mistake.
