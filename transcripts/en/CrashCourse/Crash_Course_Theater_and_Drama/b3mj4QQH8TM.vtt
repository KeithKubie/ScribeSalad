00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.660
This is Crash Course Theater, and as much
as we may all adore the violence and raunch

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.540
of Roman performance.. it’s time to move
on.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.869
Aw, Yorick - you disappointed?

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.430
I know it well, you’re a fan of the rope
dancing maidens aren’t you?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.900
So bawdy, this one!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.800
The theater of Greece and Rome is only one
tradition, and today we’re going to survey

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.050
another: Sanskrit theater.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.491
We could devote several episodes to classical
Indian theater, but because we have two and

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:36.960
a half millennia of opening nights from around
the world to cover in this series, today is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.560
more of a highlights reel—and those highlights
include happy endings, rectangular theaters,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.730
and fish bellies.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.861
INTRO
We don’t really know when Sanskrit theater

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:59.850
started or how it evolved, but likely it followed
a process similar to Greek drama and—spoiler

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.680
alert!—the future reemergence of theater
in the medieval period.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.010
Basically: People create religious rituals
to honor their gods.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.159
Someone gets the bright idea that, instead
of just singing praises, it might be cool

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190
to act out some devotion.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.750
And before you know it, you have characters
and plots and sometimes a chorus of frogs.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.750
Thee-ah-TAH!

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.700
Sanskrit literature starts around 1500 BCE,
and like Greek literature, it was originally

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.040
an oral tradition.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.310
Its great works—the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana—weren’t written down until much,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.310
much later.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.200
The Mahabharata is an epic tale of a battle
between two groups of cousins.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.820
The Ramayana is a more intimate family narrative
… that also involves a monkey king.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.820
Yeah.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.890
It’s as dope as it sounds.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.150
Most Sanskrit dramas are based on excerpts
from these epics.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.400
There’s no solid date for the first Sanskrit
dramas, either, though we do have a bunch

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.130
of surviving plays from the first century
CE, suggesting this tradition had already

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.060
been around for a while.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.869
The golden age for Sanskrit drama comes a
little bit later, around the 4th and 5th centuries,

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.520
during the Gupta Dynasty.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.149
Which was a good time if you were into science,
math, or ... theater.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.440
That’s us!

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.090
All told, about two-dozen dramas survive;
we’re going to look at one later in this

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.099
episode.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.161
The plays were typically written in a mix
of Sanskrit, the fancy literary dialect, and

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.680
Prakrit, the more common dialect.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.650
If the Greeks have taught us anything, it’s
that if you want to have a great age of drama,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.870
you need someone to come along and lecture
you on how to do it right.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.660
In Sanskrit theater, instead of Plato and
Aristotle, we have Bharata Muni.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.090
Speaking historically, he may not actually
have been a real person, but more of a literary

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.739
construct like Homer, except he was also semi-divine.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.739
Sorry, Homer.

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.530
We still think you’re fabulous.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.660
Sometime in the common era, Bharata Muni wrote
the Natyasastra, which is basically an all-purpose

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.129
guide to theater: How to write it, how to
stage it, how to watch it, all the different

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.840
ways an actor can move her nose.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900
And much more.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.900
So much more.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.280
It’s like Aristotle’s Poetics if, after
writing about tragedy, Aristotle decided to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.099
write about… everything else.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.770
Oh and the Natyasastra, is also structured
as a 6000 verse poem.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.310
Obviously we’re not going to have time to
summarize all of the Natyasastra–turns out

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.400
there are LOTS of nose movements; I’m partial
to this one [C/U ON SOME NOSE MOVES] –but

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.159
we will look at the philosophies that underlie
the composition of plays.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.710
We’ll also look at how plays should be performed,
at least according to Bharata Muni.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.510
But first, let’s check out the Natyasatra’s
theory of the origins of drama.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.600
Theater, it says, was created by Brahma, because
Brahma’s job is creating stuff.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.659
See CC World Mythology, with this handsome
half bird sir - don’t worry Thoth and I

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.970
still hang out on the weekends.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.590
Brahma and some other gods are worried that
the scriptures are just too literary, so he

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.910
comes up with drama as a religious teaching
tool.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.489
Brahma teaches it to the god Bharata, who
teaches it to his 100 sons.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.500
They prepare a play about that awesome time
the god Indra defeated some demons.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.440
The gods in the audience love the play, the
demons not so much.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.260
They start wilding out, and Indra has to defeat
them—again!

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.529
The demons are still pretty upset, but they
are reassured that some plays will make fun

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.719
of the gods, so they agree to stop their attack.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.219
Man, and you thought your preview audiences
were tough!

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.219
YEESH!

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:29.779
After that exciting origin story, the Natyasastra
introduces the idea of rasas.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:34.729
Greek and Roman plays were divided by genre—comedy,
tragedy, satyr plays.

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:35.960
Sanskrit theater is different.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.389
Instead of genre, plays are defined by the
kinds of moods they evoke.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.139
These moods are called rasas.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.099
There are initially eight of them: erotic,
comic, pathetic, furious, heroic, terrible,

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.889
odious, and marvelous.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.889
Eventually a ninth rasa, is added: peace!

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.780
A very nice mood to evoke!

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.340
Not terrible or odious in the least.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.289
How do you evoke these rasas, you might ask?

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.639
A playwright does it by drawing on eight major
human emotions, which are called bhavas.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.749
There are eight of those: pleasure, mirth,
sorrow, wrath, vigor, fear, disgust, and wonder.

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.149
You put the bhavas together in the right combination
and you evoke the appropriate rasa.

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:18.699
Hold the odious phone, though: not only are
there nine rasa-moods and eight bhava-emotions,

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.360
there are also ten categories of play, somewhat
based on length, because a Sanskrit drama

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.839
can have between one and ten acts.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.629
These categories don’t have precise English
translations, but most surviving plays belong

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.349
to two main categories: nataka plays and prakarana
plays.

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.180
Nataka plays are five to ten acts long.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.000
They usually borrow stories from the classic
Sanskrit epics and deal with gods and heroes

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.479
and demons.

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.939
These plays are a little like tragedies, except,
like most Sanskrit plays, they end happily.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:00.990
This helps the audience live in harmony with
the universe - which I mean hey, not a terrible

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.460
aim for the arts, right?

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.149
Prakarana plays are also five to ten acts
long.These are closer in spirit to Roman comedies

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:12.919
in that they often have urban settings and
deal with everyday human characters.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.330
Other kinds include dima plays, which have
16 heroes, and anka, one-act plays in which

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.319
women lament.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.379
Very exciting things happen in these plays—like
kidnappings and battles and berserk elephants—but

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.409
those things mostly happen offstage.

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.270
Onstage, we get messengers’ reports and
dialogue about how people are dealing with

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.919
invading monkey forces, but not usually the
monkey forces themselves.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.179
Which, I mean, makes sense.

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:44.529
What director wants to manage the blocking
for an army of monkeys?

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:49.330
Besides what types of plays there are, the
Natyasastra has a lot of ideas about how plays

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.770
should be staged.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.319
Like Greek and Roman theater, Sanskrit theatre
was often staged in conjunction with religious

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.199
festivals and preceded by elaborate religious
rituals.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.960
But UNLIKE Greek and Roman theater, players
weren’t exclusively men: troupes were male,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.949
female, and mixed gender.

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.469
Plays were also sometimes commissioned as
court performances.

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:16.089
Bharata Muni says although the best spectators
are noble, theater is for all classes.

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:21.090
Members of the four castes—priests, warriors,
merchants, and peasants—all seem to have

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.589
gone to the theater, though they didn’t
get to sit together.

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:29.199
No classical Sanskrit theaters survive, and
sadly we know nothing about their concession

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.199
snacks.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.669
But Bharata Muni does have some pointers on
architecture.

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.919
Theaters could be rectangular, square, or
triangular and small, medium, or large.

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.499
The medium-sized rectangle was the most popular
design.

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.899
And in case you’re thinking, hey isn’t
bigger better, - turns out you’re more right

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:51.900
than you think, because large rectangles are
reserved for the gods.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.830
Half of the theater was for the audience,
the other half was for the stage and the backstage.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:01.459
There were also four color-coded pillars,
and the whole thing was meant to symbolize

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.860
the entire universe.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.860
No pressure.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.229
If you think that seems precise, wait until
you hear about the acting.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:12.659
Acting in the classical Indian theater is
incredibly specific and highly stylized.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:17.779
The way a performer stands and blinks and
crooks a finger and flares her nostrils—all

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:23.490
of that is conveying vital information about
her character and the circumstances of the

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.490
play.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.309
The Natyasastra lists six ways you can move
your nose, nine ways you can move your neck.

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:34.620
There are seven ways you can move your eyebrows,
each with its own distinct meaning – from

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:41.709
lowering “in envy, disgust and smelling”
to contracted in “manifestation of affection”.

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:44.310
And don’t even get Bharata Muni started
on the eyes.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.310
Or the fingers.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.310
Or the feet.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.440
That said, it’s communicating through emotion
that matters most.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.000
Rhythm and music, costume and make-up, are
also crucially important.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.810
Props, too.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:55.940
But not scenery.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.380
Sanskrit drama doesn’t do scenery.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.990
To get a feel of how these plays...uh, played
out, let’s take a look at one of the most

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.920
beloved Sankrit dramas, Kalidasa’s “The
Recognition of Sakuntala.”

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.480
No solid date for this one, but best guess:
early in the common era.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.779
Thoughtbubble, You Better Recognize:
The play begins with a prayer to Shiva, the

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:13.779
destroyer.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:14.779
But in a pretty meta gesture a director stops
the hymn so that he can rehearse with one

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:15.779
of his actresses.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:16.779
She sings a song, and the play begins.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.040
In the first act, King Dushyanta is out hunting
deer near a bunch of hermitages when he decides

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.519
to hide behind a tree, perving on some beautiful
hermit maidens—especially Sakuntala.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.850
The king falls in love, but ooohhh dip, she’s
in the wrong caste!

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.420
The king mopes because he’s soooooo in love
with the hermit girl and is trying to find

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.290
an excuse to see her.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.290
But then!

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.670
Two youths come and ask him to protect the
hermitage.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.670
Score!

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.270
Before long, the king and Sakuntala confess
their love.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.850
By the next act, their wedding has taken place
and also presumably sex.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.110
Then the king has to leave to do king stuff.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:58.980
Daydreaming, Sakuntala accidentally offends
the touchy poet Durvasa.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.709
So he curses her, telling her that King Dushyanta
will forget all about her until she presents

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:08.740
him with a token, like the ring he conveniently
left.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.740
Sakuntala, who is pregnant, brings the king
his kingly ring, to bring to mind their forbidden

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.740
fling.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.740
But alas!

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.629
The king fails to recognize her.

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:24.139
And she’s like, “But wait, I have this
ring.” which ... fell into the Ganges.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:25.310
Oops!

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.370
Sakuntala leaves the palace dejected, and
after a long while a fisherman finds what

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.449
is clearly a KINGLY RING in the belly of a
fish!

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:40.209
When the king sees it, he remembers Sakuntala,
but is busy fighting demons.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:45.220
After the king defeats them, Indra rewards
him with a ride through the heavens.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:51.820
In the final act of the play, Act VII, the
chariot lets the king off at a hermitage.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.019
And even after years, he recognizes Sakuntala
… and his son!

00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:58.129
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:00.710
Reunited and it feels so good!

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.710
Yay!

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.710
A happy ending!

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.389
Harmony with the universe achieved!

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:09.490
As you can see, a nataka is very different
from its Greco-Roman counterparts.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.649
Seven acts, a lots of events, a multiyear
span, a ton of locations, and a distinct mix

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:17.720
of tragedy and comedy and prayer and sex and
hermits.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.250
Sorta has it all.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.250
And then some!

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.970
There was even a rampaging elephant.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:27.440
Somehow it all comes together to help the
audience achieve that harmony with the universe.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.740
Nice work, Kalidasa.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.660
Sanskrit drama thrived for hundreds of years.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:36.139
But in the next episode we’re going to go
back to Rome to talk about the decline of

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.139
drama.

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:40.550
There’s gonna be a whole mess of trouble
from the Goths and the Visigoths, and then–

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.790
for a bunch of centuries – no Western theater
at all.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.319
Unless you count mimes.

00:11:47.319 --> 00:11:50.380
Turns out the Dark Ages means dark nights
for theater, too!

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.730
Get it, Yorick?

00:11:51.730 --> 00:12:08.819
Because a dark night is a night when there
isn’t a performance and a theater 

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:24.529
and it’s closed… oof, tough customer,
this guy…

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:26.839
Okay!

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:36.100
Until next time… curtain!
