00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So congratulations--you've now built a search engine.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've got all of the components that you need for a search engine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You've got a way to collect a corpus,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
using a Web crawler that you built in the first 3 Units.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In Units 4 and 5, you figured out--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and hopefully understood--how to build the index

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and then how to make it faster in Unit 5.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And in Unit 6--what we've just finished--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you figured out how to rank the results.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's one little bit left:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we haven't used those ranks,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
so one of the questions on your homework

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
will be using the ranks to get the best result.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If we want to get the best result, just having the dictionary ranks

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is not enough--we need to use that to find

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the result that matches the query that has the best rank.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And that's one of the questions that you'll do on the homework for this Unit.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are a lot of other hard problems.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So you have a few problems left to solve

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
before you can build a search engine that will compete with Google.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Probably the hardest one: you've got to come up with a name.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is really hard.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You could try "Yoogle",

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You could try "DuckDuck Find".

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
None of those really work--you'll have to come up with a better name,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and this is a pretty tough problem.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Make sure to also talk to your Trademark lawyers.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Another thing you'd like to be able to do

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is actually get your search engine on the Web

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so other people can send queries to it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That's not something we're going to cover in this class,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but if you take the Web Applications course

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that will start shortly after this class finishes,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
you'll learn a lot about how to build

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Web applications and be able to do that.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So congratulations--you've reached the end of Unit 6.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And this is actually the last technical content

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that will be in this course.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Unit 7 will get you ready for the final exam and will give you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
some interesting examples of using Computing in Context.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So congratulations. You've now finished building a search engine

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it actually does Page Ranking

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
better than any search engine that existed before 1998.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
That's quite amazing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I first want to also congratulate David for getting you to this point.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I think that's quite amazing and, honestly, he's put a lot of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
sleepless nights into thisl.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But also, i want to tell you: you guys are my heroes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You got to a point where you reached something, I think,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
really significant in this class--you actually learned how to--

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And you programmed your own search engine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now, I have to say--I'm a little bit jealous.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
When I was a student at college,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
there was no search engines, and there wasn't even

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and ability for me to learn all this stuff.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
As for you, you've been afforded the ability to learn all this stuff.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But then you really got an amazing speed here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's something really, really significant.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I hope--I mean, if you keep up that speed

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and keep improving yourself with that same speed and learn new things--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
maybe in 3 or 4 years you are the next Google.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That would be really amazing.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Well, I think you're definitely on track to doing that,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and I hope you'll take some of the courses that we'll start offering,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
as 200 available courses and more advanced courses later.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is the end of Unit 6--we're not going to have

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
any more technical content to the course.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Unit 7 is going to be all field trips and interviews,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
giving you some idea of how the things that you've learned in class

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
fit into Context--and that should be a lot of fun.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The other thing that you'll have, as part of Unit 7,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is the final exam.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And I hope everyone enjoys Homework 6

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and will be ready for the final next week. &gt;&gt;And I hope you enjoy the final exam.
