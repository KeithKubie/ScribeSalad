00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.739
You've made it.
You're just about at the end of

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:03.880
the course.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.260
You probably feel proud of having
accomplished your goal and have rewarded

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.390
yourself with ice cream or a new
video game, well, that's what we did.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.260
&gt;&gt; Anyway, inevitably you will have
questions while developing your million

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.329
dollar baby.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.380
And you probably won't come back to
the course, so where should you go?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.880
&gt;&gt; Our team of developers,
technically writers and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.075
other awesome folks keep all the Google
maps API reference documentation,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:32.049
walk-throughs, sample code and other
useful tips on our developers site.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.520
We've linked to it a bunch of
times throughout the course, and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.140
there's another URL in the notes below.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; In the web area of the site,
you'll find most of

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.840
the information on the JavaScript API
that we presented in this course.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.520
You can drill down into the Reference
section of the documentation for

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.640
each API to get the technical details
on all the classes, methods, and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.070
objects we've used.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.950
There's also plenty of sample
code you can view that

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.090
looks suspiciously similar to some of
the examples we've seen in the course.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.770
&gt;&gt; In the Web Services section you can
see information on the services we've

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.820
demonstrated through HTTP requests.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.840
You can drill down into each
individual service to get the details

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.760
on the request parameters and responses.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.830
&gt;&gt; You can visit the Android and iOS
sections of the site to learn more about

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.470
incorporating the Goggle Maps APIs
into your native mobile applications.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.639
Most of the features are similar
to those that we've covered for

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.231
JavaScript API in this course.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.891
&gt;&gt; There is also a great FAQ, which
should be your first line of defense for

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.722
questions on the Google Maps APIs.

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:35.559
The FAQ also have a section on
understanding the terms of service,

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:38.930
quotas and usage limits and
identifiers, like API keys.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.780
&gt;&gt; If you have a specific coding
question, we encourage all of our Maps

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.680
developers to use Stack Overflow to post
questions and contribute to solutions.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.142
&gt;&gt; If you are, or are looking into
becoming a premium plan customer,

00:01:52.142 --> 00:01:56.420
remember, some use cases require that,
there's a great online resource for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.500
information on the premium plan.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.900
This includes things like terms of use,
quotas and rates, support and SLA, and

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.350
tips and tricks for using your licence.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.100
Finally, if you enjoyed this course,
there are some great channels for

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.370
more information on
the Google Maps APIs.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.700
For example,
the Geo Developers blog, and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.990
our Google developers YouTube channel
linked in the instructor notes.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.490
&gt;&gt; Well, it's been a great journey, but
now I have to go back to New York and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.870
get back to my real job.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.733
Working with developers
using the Google Maps APIs.

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.153
&gt;&gt; And I have to go home to my new baby.

00:02:27.153 --> 00:02:31.692
&gt;&gt; Luckily I mapped it and it'll
only take me 957 hours to walk home,

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:33.818
but I couldn't avoid ferries.

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:35.657
&gt;&gt; I think I'll probably
roller blade back home.

00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:38.056
&gt;&gt; Thanks for taking the course.

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:39.950
&gt;&gt; And happy mapping.
