00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:09.208
Narrator: TO MAKE STACKABLE
CHIPS, THEY USE A RATIO

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.545
OF 1/3 WATER TO 2/3 POTATO
FLAKES

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.647
WITH A LITTLE CORNSTARCH
MIXED IN.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:20.353
A CONVEYOR DELIVERS THE MIX
TO AN AUGER, WHICH DISPERSES IT.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.189 align:start size:34% position:66% line:0%
♪♪

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.962
USING FOUR TONS OF PRESSURE,

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.732
THEY ROLL THE MIX
INTO ONE LONG POTATO SHEET.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.506
A ROTARY CUTTER
PUNCHES OUT OVAL SHAPES.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:43.176
A DEVICE PULLS AWAY
THE SCRAP DOUGH,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.879
LEAVING FLAT, UNCOOKED CHIPS.

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:51.050
THE SCRAP DOUGH IS RECYCLED
INTO THE CHIP-MAKING PROCESS.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.121
THE CUT CHIPS HEAD INTO A FRYER.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.822
AS THEY TRAVEL
THROUGH THE FRYER,

00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:00.159
ROLLING MOLDS GIVE THE CHIPS
A CONCAVE SHAPE.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.664
THIS SHAPE MAKES THEM EASY
TO STACK.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:09.001
THE CHIPS SPEND 11 SECONDS
FRYING IN HOT OIL.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.170
THIS MAKES THEM CRISPY.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.041
THEY TRAVEL UNDER BLOWERS
TO GET RID OF EXCESS OIL.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.078
THE CHIPS
GET A COAT OF SEASONING,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.414
THEN DO A BACKFLIP OFF ONE
CONVEYOR ONTO ANOTHER,

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:26.185
FALLING IN NEAT PILES.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:30.056
A WORKER INSPECTS
THE ROWS OF CHIPS.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.694
THEN IT'S ON TO ANOTHER CONVEYOR

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.198
THAT SHAKES THEM UP
TO LOOSEN THE STACKS.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:47.006
THEY TRAVEL OVER SCALES TO
BE PORTIONED OUT FOR PACKAGING.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:52.178
AUTOMATED SPOONS FEED THE CHIPS
INTO THE OPEN ENDS OF THE TUBES.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.282
GUIDES TAP THE TOPS OF THE TUBES

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.751
TO NUDGE THE CHIPS
INTO POSITION.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.654
GRIPPERS LOWER
THE STACKED TUBES TO A STATION

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:05.925
WHERE SPINNING HEADS
FORCE ON METAL BOTTOMS.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.630
NOW THEY'RE READY FOR SHIPPING.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.634
IT TAKES ABOUT 20 MINUTES TO
MAKE A TUBE OF STACKABLE CHIPS,

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.737
BUT IT TAKES LESS TIME
TO POLISH THEM OFF.
