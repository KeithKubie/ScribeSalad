boxes that's weight these are where your

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
boxes that's weight these are where your
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340
boxes that's weight these are where your
vocal cords are yeah and actually when

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
vocal cords are yeah and actually when
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.069
vocal cords are yeah and actually when

these cords in your voice box and your
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039
these cords in your voice box and your
larynx that's what makes sound so what

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
larynx that's what makes sound so what
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.480

makes you able to sing and that's where
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969
makes you able to sing and that's where
that's where it comes from magic how

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
that's where it comes from magic how
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.440
that's where it comes from magic how
thinking about how beautiful that is

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
thinking about how beautiful that is
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.510
thinking about how beautiful that is
that's where sound comes from well so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
that's where sound comes from well so
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429
that's where sound comes from well so
I'll just say that sentence that's where

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
I'll just say that sentence that's where
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:08.120
I'll just say that sentence that's where
sound

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130
 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.120
so we're in the trachea and it's hard

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130
so we're in the trachea and it's hard
 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.080
so we're in the trachea and it's hard
it's hard like a hose the trachea is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090
it's hard like a hose the trachea is
 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.509
it's hard like a hose the trachea is
hard you I mean like at all times I can

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519
hard you I mean like at all times I can
 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.720
hard you I mean like at all times I can
say my I'm hard because if I have a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
say my I'm hard because if I have a
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940
say my I'm hard because if I have a
trachea yeah so whenever anyone tells

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
trachea yeah so whenever anyone tells
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400
trachea yeah so whenever anyone tells
you I'm hard just think they might be

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
you I'm hard just think they might be
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.040
you I'm hard just think they might be
talking about their trachea yes

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
talking about their trachea yes
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.930
talking about their trachea yes
tracheas harvest has a lot of cartilage

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
tracheas harvest has a lot of cartilage
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.759
tracheas harvest has a lot of cartilage
and this takes the air down and breaks

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769
and this takes the air down and breaks
 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.670
and this takes the air down and breaks
into two separate the bronchi bronchus

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
into two separate the bronchi bronchus
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.940
into two separate the bronchi bronchus
so it's one is bronchus - yes absolutely

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
so it's one is bronchus - yes absolutely
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.280
so it's one is bronchus - yes absolutely
and then that further breaks down into

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
and then that further breaks down into
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.199
and then that further breaks down into
the bronc kills from Kiehl's are like

we are in the lungs baby and that means
 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.610
we are in the lungs baby and that means
we are ready to countering LVO lies and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
we are ready to countering LVO lies and
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.520
we are ready to countering LVO lies and
