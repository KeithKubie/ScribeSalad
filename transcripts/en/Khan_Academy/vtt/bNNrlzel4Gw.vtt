00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:03.750
- [Voiceover] Right
here, we have 65 blocks.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.457
And you can count them if you like.

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:09.973
But we can represent
them with the number 65.

00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:12.689
By writing a six in the tens place,

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.858
we're literally saying
that we have six tens.

00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:19.689
And this is a 10, this is
a 10, this is another 10,

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.931
this is another 10, this is a 10,

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:24.914
this is a 10, and this is a 10.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.763
We have six groups of
ten and that makes 60.

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:31.433
And then we have five ones.

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:34.052
Five in that orange color.

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.782
And then we have five ones.

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:37.446
And you see them right here.

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:39.791
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.195
Now let's do something inter...

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.173
Well, actually, let me just
first write that down again.

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:44.205
Just to emphasize it.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:46.806
We can write down that 65,

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:50.838
65 is equal to six tens,

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:55.485
six tens plus five ones.

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.282
Plus five ones.

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:01.804
Now, let's do something interesting.

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:03.801
Let's start with 65,

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.600
so let me write that down again,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.340
so we're gonna start with 65.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.128
I'm having trouble changing colors.

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:12.020
We're gonna start with 65

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.940
and I'm gonna subtract...

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.470
I'm going to subtract 40.

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:20.585
I'm going to subtract 40 from that.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.943
What am I really doing here?

00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:24.382
Well, I'm starting with 65,

00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:25.709
I'm starting with this,

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.050
and I'm subtracting
four tens and zero ones.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.291
Let's subtract four tens from here.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:33.904
Let's subtract

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:38.616
one, two, three, four.

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:41.287
I took away four of the tens.

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:43.992
How many tens do I have left over?

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:46.326
Well, I have left over two tens.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.983
This is going to be equal to two tens.

00:01:49.983 --> 00:01:51.412
And how many ones do I have?

00:01:51.412 --> 00:01:53.883
Well, I still have five ones.

00:01:53.883 --> 00:01:55.729
So, I still...

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.348
I still have five ones.

00:01:57.348 --> 00:01:58.446
And that makes sense.

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.965
I had five ones, I took away zero ones,

00:02:00.965 --> 00:02:03.252
so I'm still going to have five ones.

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:05.167
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:07.349
We can write 65.

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.987
65.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.044
Minus 40.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:15.819
Minus 40 is...

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.678
Let me do the...

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.675
I want to do the ones
in that orange color.

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:21.728
Minus 40 is equal to,

00:02:21.728 --> 00:02:23.102
another way of saying two tens

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:26.201
is by putting a two in
the tens place, and a...

00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:27.619
And then we have five ones.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.125
A five in the ones place.

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:34.639
Two tens plus five ones, or 25.
