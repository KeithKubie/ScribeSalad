00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: Everybody
knows this woman

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.196
has been nominated for an Oscar
for her work in "House of Sand

00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:09.290
and Fog" and the Emmy for
Best Supporting Actress

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.460
for "House of Saddam."

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.790
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
House house, house.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.345
FEMALE SPEAKER: I wasn't going
to point that out, but you did.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:18.720
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: It carried
on for a couple of years--

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.930
house, house, house,
house lake, "Lake House,"

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
"House of Sand and Fog," "House
of Saddam," "Horror House."

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.450
And then I had an offer for
"Odd Life of Timothy Green,"

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.290
Disney movie, I thought,
OK, no more houses.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.770
This one has nothing
to do with a house.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.090
By the time I got
closer to Disney,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.370
where I had a meeting with
this amazing producer,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.690
I thought, I have to find
out what her name is,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.340
because I just can't get in
and say, hi, how are you?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.090
So I looked at my
cell phone to find out

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.890
what her name is, so when
I enter, I would say,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.520
hello, Mrs. So-and-so.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.570
Guess what?

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.879
Her family name was Housebrick.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.379
Oh my god.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.670
It had to be her family name.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.820
It's not the name of the movie,
nor the name of the director,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.220
but the producer's
family name, Housebrick.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.490
So I thought, I'm still stuck
with house, which is beautiful.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.760
Ask every immigrant,
every displaced person who

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.870
has left her home
country, has migrated,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.770
ask them what comes first?

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.380
They all tell you, house.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.160
Maybe that's why.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080
This was the universe
trying to tell me

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.350
that you have a house
with us no matter what.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.930
Maybe.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: And now you have
all of Earth in "The Expanse."

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.690
Please tell us about
how you got involved.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.273
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
So heartbeats away

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.210
from governing the world,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.270
Help me through.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.530
Vote for me.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.760
I promise you, I would
save Earth for you.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.226
I would not allow Mars nor
Sirius, nor the Belters

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:03.360
to come and take our resources.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.340
That's what my character,
Chrisjen Avasarala,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.300
is afraid of, and
she has the right

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.990
to be afraid of, of Martians.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.700
All they want is to come to
Earth and take our resources.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.280
And we still have a lot.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
We have already colonized
Mars and the solar system.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.900
We have colonized Belters
with all due respect

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.240
to the chief of the
Belters here today.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.170
But we're still afraid of them.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.160
The core of the idea
of politics has not

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.250
changed, not even in 200 years,
where this TV series is set at.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.080
So in numerous interviews
that I watched,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.000
you talked about how
when it was nonfiction,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.130
you would learn about the person
that you were about to portray,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.885
and in fiction, you
would create a history.

00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:00.260
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
From scratch.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: From scratch,
so for Chrisjen Avasarala,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.475
what did you do?

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:06.350
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Chrisjen was really hard,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.530
my first politician.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.170
I had done lots of
doctors and professors.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.270
And I still remember a
comedian friend of mine

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.100
once told me, oh,
Mrs. Aghdashloo, you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.350
get to play all the
doctors and professors.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.360
And I said, believe me, Antony,
I'm dying to play a maid.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.670
He goes, a maid?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.382
You?

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:27.210
You come in with
that voice of yours.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.810
You say, Madam,
the tea is ready.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.870
That tea must be poisoned,
or there is no reason

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.160
I'm bringing you into this!

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.340
He put an end to
my life's dream.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.940
Thank god.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.680
I got it.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.590
I got it last year.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.910
I portrayed a maid in a movie
called "Septembers of Shiraz,"

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.100
based on the Iranian
writer's book

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.840
called "Septembers of Shiraz,"
New York's best seller.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.550
Amazing, with Adrian
Brody and Salma Hayek.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.480
Finally, I portrayed a maid.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.230
But a politician, it
was my first time.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.270
And I was, again, walking,
pacing, back and forth,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.610
thinking, how am
I going to create

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.380
this character from scratch?

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.839
I'm going to have to
start with my heroes,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.050
with women whom I have admired
since childhood, with women

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.760
whom I have looked up
to, followed their path,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.250
and wanted to be them or
to do what they are doing.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.090
So all of a sudden,
Indira Gandhi came.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.620
It was like the door opened,
and Indira came in, and I said,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.160
oh, Indira, please do sit down.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.890
Obviously, Indira was
followed by Benazir Bhutto,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.250
one of my favorites ever.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.886
I loved her so much that I was
so furious when she was killed.

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:55.510
I was furious with her.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.530
Why an educated woman,
a well-read politician,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.270
why she should poke out her
head from a limousine that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.642
is driving 5 miles per hour,
every assassin's paradise.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:11.160
Anyhow, Benazir came in,
and I'm looking at Benazir.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.980
I'm like, although this
character is from far east,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.190
far, far, far east, and it's
an international, universal

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.790
character, but I still need
more women, more people,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.070
who are not necessarily
from east or far east.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.940
And obviously the door opens,
and another favorite of mine,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.210
Margaret Thatcher, comes in.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.280
I loved Thatcher.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.740
I happened to be in London when
she became a prime minister.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.170
Her first speech
changed my life forever.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.980
I wanted to study art
before I saw her speech.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.960
But right after her speech,
I decided to study politics.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.300
And I managed to do
it, and got my BA

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.160
in international relations,
political science in '84.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.220
So Thatcher is coming.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.130
And I know in the
UK, it's very hard.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.110
When you say you love
Thatcher, some people

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.940
really get upset with you.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.260
They're like how?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.960
Why?

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.700
A woman like you?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.300
And I said, well,
look, I was living here

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.850
at the time of Callaghan.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.290
It was the Labour Party, and the
UK was on the verge of a nasty

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.660
breakdown.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.630
Thatcher came.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.850
She said it in her speech.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.170
She said, I'm hearing rumors
that people call me Iron Lady.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.000
I am the Iron Lady.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.260
Tighten your belts.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.720
We are going to change
Britain for good.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.430
And she did.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.470
So that's why I
love her so much.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.560
Right after her,
Madeleine Albright,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.120
another one of my heroes,
whom I love and adore.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.260
Thatcher was followed by
Madeleine for a reason.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.100
Everything is interrelated
in this world.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.360
Both women are famous
for their broaches.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.180
They have books
about their broaches.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.160
That's why Madeleine
followed Thatcher,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.470
and right after that, of course,
Secretary Clinton, Hillary

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.970
Clinton.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.050
And I'm like, OK,
now everybody's here.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.260
Now I can see them.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.470
I can feel them.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.090
It's so tangible now.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.770
I can see the character.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.760
Now I can start breathing
life into this character.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.935
It was only then that I was
satisfied that I may be able.

00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:25.810
With all those, you were
two heartbeats away.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.976
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Exactly.

00:07:26.976 --> 00:07:29.540
They were all there,
like "Sense8."

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.430
All my other selves were there.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.920
Have you ever watched "Sense8"?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh-huh.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.878
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
The Wachowskis.

00:07:34.878 --> 00:07:35.680
It's very nice.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.431
I love that series, "Sense8."

00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:40.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
I have a question

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.250
about what led you to
decide to write your memoir?

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.310
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
My American friends.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, really?

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.343
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
More than anything else,

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:50.750
my American friends.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.770
For 20 odd something years, I
was asked so many questions,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.400
so many odd questions about
driving camels back in Iran,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.740
or about-- somebody
was actually like,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.550
did you have telephones in Iran?

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.960
Like telephones?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.270
Yes, we did have telephones.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.180
When I was born,
we had telephones.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.460
So I thought, I have
to educate them.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.230
They have to know.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.830
We owe it to them, this
beautiful vast country

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.230
who's been taking care of
us, who's been so graciously

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.370
accepting us.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.640
So I thought, for the sake of
the people of this country,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.770
for the sake of
the modern history,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.360
I need to write this down.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.240
Another fact was
that every time I

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.049
met an educated, well-read
American, elderly,

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.150
immediately, they would
say, oh, you're from Iran.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.200
Yes, we do remember Iran,
what happened to Iran.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.080
Mohammad Mosaddegh, the
first and last democratically

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.050
elected prime minister of Iran
who was sent to exile, CIA coup

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.020
d'etat, 1953 in Iran.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.250
They knew every detail about
Mossadegh, this deposed

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.140
prime minister of Iran.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.380
Young people, if I would
tell them that I was Iranian,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.290
they would say, oh,
Ahmadinejad, Ahmadinejad.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.590
And I just didn't want to be
identified with Ahmadinejad.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.560
I had to do something about it,
and I thought maybe the best

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.720
thing is to write my memoir,
but do not concentrate solely

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.200
on the memoir,
because more or less,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.740
we all have the same life.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.090
Every one of us is a
moving film, movies.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:37.390
But I can set my memoir against
the history, the modern history

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:43.120
of Iran that was going on while
I was in Iran during the Shah's

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.670
reign.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.950
Now that there's such a huge gap
that Americans know Mosaddegh,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:54.150
which was 52, and now they know
Ahmadinejad, which is 2008,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.950
as though Iran did not exist
in between the two of them.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.820
That was the first reason
that made me sit down.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.056
And I had basically two choices.

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:08.760
Harper-Collins told me that I
either could write it myself,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.350
or have a ghostwriter.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.460
I sent the first chapter
to a ghost writer,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.580
especially because I
was going to the UK,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.580
to London, to
portray [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.370
in a play that was going to take
4 and 1/2 months of my life.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.090
And I thought, I'm
a method actor.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.900
I would rather not
combine works together.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.830
But when the chapter
got back to me,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:39.920
it was beautifully written,
so rich, literally speaking.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.170
But it wasn't my voice.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.510
It sounded non-Iranian.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.550
It sounded American, and
it had lost my voice.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.570
So I called back, and I
begged Harper and Collins

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.650
to allow me to write it myself.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.250
And to cut the story short,
it took me 2 and 1/2 years

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.000
to finish it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.250
But I'm glad I did it.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.080
It has an accent, but
it doesn't matter.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.510
It has my accent.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.040
So when you read it, you realize
that whatever I'm saying,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.590
it's me saying it.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.110
No one has tried to add anything
to it, or take away from it,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.901
or interfere with it.

00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:18.275
FEMALE SPEAKER:
So I was curious,

00:11:18.275 --> 00:11:20.770
"The Alley of Love
and Yellow Jasmines,"

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.890
how did you come up that title?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.220
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: This is one
of my favorite, favorite things

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.780
ever.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:35.750
As you all know, I was on "24."
"24" is amazingly successful

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.500
all over the world.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.710
People of the world love "24."

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.450
Marrakesh, Tunisia,
Jordan, wherever

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.420
I went, as soon as I open
my mouth, they were like,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.070
are you the woman on "24"?

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.410
I was at the bazaar in
Marrakesh, poverty personified.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.260
This young, 10, 12 years
old boy is following me,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.940
and I was a bit afraid.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.330
I noticed he's following me.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.680
I decided to act strong.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.980
I turned around, and I
looked at him, and I said,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.830
what do you want?

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:18.550
He took a look at me, and he
said, madame, c'est artiste?

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.480
I said, yes, oui.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.640
He goes, vingt-quatre?

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.970
"24"?

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.941
I said, what is your name?

00:12:25.941 --> 00:12:26.690
He said, Muhammad.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.160
I said, Muhammad, I
get you a sandwich.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.250
I give you a coin.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.230
Do you like coca-cola?

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.920
He goes, yes, I like coca-cola.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.610
Don't tell anyone
I am from "24,"

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.350
or I won't be able
to leave the bazaar.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.250
In Japan, they love it.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.720
They love it in Japan,
and they dub it in Japan.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.880
So I was told that not
only one or two reporters

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.180
want to interview me
for "24" from Japan,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.530
but also there is
a dozen of them.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.720
Therefore, they decided to
have a moderator in LA with me,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.490
and have all these reporters
on a conference line

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.188
from all over Japan.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.580
They asked me questions,
so many questions.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.330
They were all women reporters.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.120
And they asked me questions
and so many questions,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.450
and finally one of
them said, all of this,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.740
I would answer in English, the
moderator would translate it

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.940
into Japanese, they would ask
their questions in Japanese,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.160
vice-versa.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.630
So the last question was,
ask Shohreh to close her eyes

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.660
and tell us, what is it that she
misses the most about her birth

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.610
country, Iran.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.480
And I did.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.470
I listened to them.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.810
I always do.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.417
And I closed my eyes,
and the first thing

00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:54.270
that came to my mind were these
tiny, narrow, crooked alleys

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.710
back in Iran.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.990
Usually, old countries
do have that.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.820
There are a lot of these
tiny, crooked alleys in Spain

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.670
as well.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.690
I was working there
for 3 and 1/2 months

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.950
and managed to see these alleys.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.170
In Iran, the
generation before me

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.060
I call these alleys
[SPEAKING PERSIAN],

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.214
the love alleys, or the truth
alleys, [SPEAKING PERSIAN].

00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:24.730
And these alleys came.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.660
In the spring, the
walls of these alleys

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.380
are filled with yellow jasmines.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.455
And if you have smelled
yellow jasmines,

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:39.450
you know that its scent stays
in your nostrils forever.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.540
So these two, the image
and then the smell, came.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:48.140
And I said, well the alley
love and yellow jasmines.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.020
That's all I can remember.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.690
As soon as I said that,
the moderator translated

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.570
into Japanese, and then they
started talking, and talking,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.560
and talking.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.200
And nobody is telling
me what's going on.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.490
And finally, I said excuse
me, excuse me, excuse me.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.180
What is going on?

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.550
And the translator
said, ladies are

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.900
talking about yellow
jasmine, and the fact

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.150
that they don't have
yellow jasmines in Japan.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.680
They only have white jasmines.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.640
And I said, leave
it to the Japanese.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.480
By now, they have put
the seeds in a box.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.470
They're flying to Japan
to put it in the ground.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.010
That's why the alley of love and
yellow jasmines. [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.935
FEMALE SPEAKER: So this is
participatory with you guys.

00:15:29.935 --> 00:15:31.060
So think of your questions.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.310
Start lining up, and I'm going
to ask one other question

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.920
right now.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.920
So I expect bodies to
start getting off of seats.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.729
So you were a tomboy?

00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:43.020
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: I am still.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.300
You can-- a tomboy, I am, yeah.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
was a tomboy too.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.660
But anyway, is that
common in Iran?

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.160
I mean, for girls to be
climbing trees, and--

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.690
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Not really, no.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.390
Every time I did it,
both my grandmothers

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.670
were out looking at me
like, who is this creature?

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.930
And my grandmother was like,
you know you're a girl.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.226
You know you cannot
go up the tree.

00:16:11.226 --> 00:16:12.390
You know what happens.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.850
You're a girl.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.690
And I'm like, yes, I
am, but I can do it.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.107
I was raised with
three brothers.

00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:19.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right, OK.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.067
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: And
I was the first one.

00:16:20.067 --> 00:16:20.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: You had
to keep up with them.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.808
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: I
had to keep up with them.

00:16:22.808 --> 00:16:23.610
I had to beat them.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: But you also
wanted to be an actress.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.280
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Since I was seven years.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.990
I started when I was
seven, and my mother

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.980
kept saying not under our roof.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.410
Not under our roof.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:39.620
It wasn't a respectable
profession or job back in Iran.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.090
And my father was
afraid that I'm

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.810
going to join the cinema
and all of a sudden,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.330
he's going to see me
naked, which he never

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.740
got a chance to do.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.620
After a while, he noticed,
no, I'm a real actor.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.920
I'm not a starlet.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.300
I'm not there because
I love acting.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.960
There's a huge
difference between those

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.960
who are born actors and
those who love acting.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.750
And we have both of them.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.060
To me, most of the
stars love acting.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.730
They're not born actors.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.630
They do great jobs because
they have a lot of help

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.780
from people who can teach
them, who can take them

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.960
through different paths.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.700
But they're not born actors.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.550
They love acting, and
they do great jobs.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.470
But there are some
who are born actors.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.390
I was one of them.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.290
That's why all my life I fought.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.470
I literally fought
to become an actor.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.030
Because this is
what I wanted to be.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.510
I'm so happy that I fought
for it, because now I'm

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.490
a happy person.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.520
Every time my mother comes and
says, oh, are you happy now?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.760
You had to go through countries.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.320
You had to live in exile.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.150
You had to do that.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.220
Are you happy now?

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.740
I'm like, Mom, I've
been happy since the day

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.020
I became an actress.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.144
I've always been happy, because
I did what I wanted to do.

00:17:56.144 --> 00:17:58.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: Looks
like we have a question.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.840
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.300
Hi, love your role
on "The Expanse."

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.670
You're doing a great job.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.380
The show has become infamous
for the zero gravity scenes.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.640
They're difficult
and they're arduous.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.300
And I was just wondering
if you had the foresight

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.889
to put a no zero G
clause in your contract,

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:17.180
or whether we're going to be
seeing you floating around

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:17.790
at some point.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.690
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
When I joined,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.690
I was told that my character
is the only one who

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:24.780
gets to go outside and do
exterior, because I'm on Earth.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.010
So no, they're
not taking me to--

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.760
AUDIENCE: You're not
going to go to space?

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.718
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: I
didn't have to sign that.

00:18:31.718 --> 00:18:35.680
I should have signed many
papers, but I didn't.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.310
But thank you.

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:40.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go ahead.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.190
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:46.120
I'm not sure if you can
actually answer this.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.740
And it's somewhat of a comment.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.980
I wanted to say that your
acting on "The Expanse"

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:57.860
is really spectacular, because
you bring a level of subtlety

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.520
that you don't always
see, particularly

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.121
in syndicated television.

00:19:04.121 --> 00:19:05.370
I mean, you have a great cast.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.900
I mean, Jared
Harris, Thomas Jane,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.030
you have some veterans there.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:14.250
But the way that you
portray your character,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:20.100
I'm not quite sure if she's a
good person or a bad person,

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.750
because her motivations on
the surface for what she does

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.800
and what she said seem
good and seem pure,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:34.480
but as anybody in that
position of power would be,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:40.500
there's a level of ruthlessness
that is pretty high, like when

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.460
she has the Belter
strung up on the wall,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.680
and is just letting gravity
basically take him down.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.890
And in particular in
this last episode,

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.370
where you're sitting there
with-- I forget [INAUDIBLE]--

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.380
Elise, and on the surface,
it seems like you're there

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.500
because you're having a
moment of existential crisis.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.630
You're just so heartbroken
over your own son,

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.380
and you have some
information about her son.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.120
And you just want
to let her know

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.640
that you share your
share that pain,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.630
and while you guys may
have had differences

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.080
and you're on different
sides of the fence,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.070
you felt compelled
to tell her this.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.820
And then she's talking to you.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.570
And she starts
talking about, well, I

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.400
get these postcards
every couple of months.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.710
And then you see this
look in your eye,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.880
and that's why you're there.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.454
You're not there to console her.

00:20:32.454 --> 00:20:33.906
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Yeah.

00:20:33.906 --> 00:20:35.842
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
think he's onto it?

00:20:35.842 --> 00:20:37.758
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Well,
I have to thank you.

00:20:37.758 --> 00:20:42.270
Thank you, thank you so much
for saying these things.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.260
This was my main
problem when I started.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.675
This is science fiction,
set 200 years from now.

00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:53.160
Although science fiction, it
speaks for today relatively.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.510
We're still people.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.310
We're still dealing
with politics, problems,

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.830
transparency, which I
don't believe in politics.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:06.200
And I was wondering, should I
play this woman like a human?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.190
Because her story line is
very much shakespearean.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.550
Those three stories that are
running along simultaneously,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:20.850
like Morse and Thomas
Jane's character, Holden,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.140
looks very film noir to me.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.050
Him, the detective
with the fedora hat

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.790
looking for the femme fatale.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.370
The space shuttle rightfully
has been named Space Opera,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.410
which is fantastic.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.170
What happens to my story?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.990
This is truly a
Shakespearean story.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.280
Should I play it like
a human, or should I

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.930
play it like a half
human, half futuristic?

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.070
But finally, I came to my
senses thinking, no matter

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.670
what, I was thinking from
the very beginning to now,

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:00.700
we changed our pashminas for
beautiful brand clothings.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:08.450
We exchanged our chariots
for Range Rovers and Jaguars

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.040
and high end, expensive cars.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.980
How much have we
gone through inside?

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.030
How much have we learned inside?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.170
Little, in comparison,
especially with when

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.820
it comes to technology.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.060
Therefore, we are still human.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.130
We're still people.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.320
We're still making mistakes.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.760
And it's very Shakespearean.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.500
So I had better keep her
on the humanitarian side,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.650
rather than turning
her into an evil.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.580
Another thing is
that every time I

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.430
portray a character, good
or bad, or St. Elizabeth

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.850
in nativity, I don't judge
them, as I don't judge people

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.660
in real life, until they
do something that I really

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.870
have to leave them behind.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.740
I don't judge them,
because we never

00:22:55.740 --> 00:23:00.910
know who's coming from where,
what kind of walk of life.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.670
That's why I don't
judge my characters.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.260
And with this one,
I decided that she

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.790
is an amazing politician.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.860
She's shrewd because
she has to be.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.190
She's brutal.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.290
Name a politician who is not.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.600
By nature, you turn into one.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.490
And that's why I decided
to more or less emphasize

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.660
her human side over
her futuristic side.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.180
You just solved
one of my problems.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.135
Thank you so much for
referring to this.

00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:31.090
Merci.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.625
Thank you.

00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:33.666
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go ahead.

00:23:33.666 --> 00:23:35.457
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Our audience sees that.

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:38.950
AUDIENCE: Hi, I had
a other questions.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.810
She knows what I wanted
to ask originally,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.379
but then maybe she
would ask it if she can.

00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:44.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Go ahead.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.419
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Anne,
you know the question?

00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:49.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but anyway, I
actually found something better

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.880
to ask you.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.530
I mean, I'm a great fan of
your almost your whole career.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.860
I've seen a lot of your stuff.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.850
In this movie, you're
talking about a woman

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.340
in power position.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.480
Thinking back, I found
that almost every kind

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.110
of political drama we've
seen, political fiction,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.710
if there's a woman
in power, she's

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.920
almost always villainous, right?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.670
There is almost always-- I mean,
even the real life depictions

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.070
you just listed, Benazir
Bhutto, Indira Gandhi,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.250
I mean, Margaret
Thatcher, there is

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.460
this sense in
their public image,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.220
there's this sense that there's
a little villainy there too.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.460
I mean, there seems to be
this public image of if there

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.940
is a woman in power,
there is something wrong,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.030
and maybe she's evil.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.452
Maybe she's dark, and
there's something like that.

00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.660
I was wondering especially
because of your background

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.950
in political science.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.601
What do you think of that, and
do you think that's changing?

00:24:45.601 --> 00:24:47.350
And how do you approach
that in your role?

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.808
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
It is changing.

00:24:48.808 --> 00:24:53.260
The role of women in
cinema is changing totally.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.440
And it's as I've always said.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.830
It's because of the fact that
it's changing in the society.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.260
Look at the ladies who
are here with us today.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.210
I think there are more than men.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.710
We have more women
here than men.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.860
So it's changing.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.970
The society is changing.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.580
So is cinema.

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.710
That is a reflection
of the society.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.470
And you're right.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:21.210
For some odd reasons, when we
bring a lead, a female lead,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.080
into a movie or a TV series,
for some odd reasons,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.480
she has to be a villain.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.780
But on the other hand,
there's a fine line

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.290
between a villain and an angel.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.730
There's a fine line.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.040
Where is the line, and how
do you find the differences,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:45.330
and where can we take
these two characters?

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.290
Brits have a saying.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.640
They say, don't
treat me like a dog.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.750
I'll act like a dog.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:57.040
So if they treat women
in the right way,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.160
if they give them
the key positions

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.795
in huge industrial places,
or industry, Hollywood,

00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:11.770
the American film industry, we
see more and more female leads,

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:15.920
not only in TV series, but also
in films that may be villains

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.800
or may be angels.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:24.580
But it all depends on how women,
how we are doing in our real

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:30.270
lives in real society that
could be depicted and shown

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.610
on the silver screen.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.820
It all depends on us, and we are
doing a great job, I believe.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.780
I mean, everywhere women
are doing their best.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.770
Even in Saudi Arabia,
finally, finally, they

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.560
got their right to vote.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.890
So we are at the
very beginning of it.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.990
You won't believe how late
some countries have given

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.870
the rights to women to vote.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.130
It's unbelievable.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.880
So we're at the very
beginning of it,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.750
but the equality of
genders is under way soon.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.240
We have already gotten
there, but we still

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.300
need to talk about it, and
make other people, especially

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.780
the countries under
development, understand

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.720
the importance of women's
role in a society, that really

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.650
women and men, they're
not that much different.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.860
They can both be helpful and
profitable to their societies.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.160
But we need more strong
females, and you are right.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.720
And maybe it's because
there are still

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.500
male leads who bring more people
to the theaters than females,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.060
especially in the far east.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.850
And this is unbelievable.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.740
Sometimes, when people
talk about the inequality

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.200
of receiving salary
here in our industry,

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.790
some women say they
receive less than men.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:57.320
I truly believe it's
not about gender.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.080
It's not about
because we are women.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.700
They are men.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.840
It's because they bring more
people to thee theaters,

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.950
especially when it
goes to the far east

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.020
or the Middle
East, or east east.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.080
It seems like
there's still actors

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.730
who bringing people to the
theaters rather than actresses.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.920
But that will change soon.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.753
AUDIENCE: I hope so.

00:28:18.753 --> 00:28:21.630
Do you think-- Sorry,
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.850
but do you think there's
this kind of the thing,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.960
that some things, the
femininity of a political power,

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.580
scares some people,
especially scares

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.780
some men who feel threatened?

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.150
I mean, your examples
that you came up,

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.920
they were strong women, but I
mean, Merkel, Angela Merkel,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.080
wasn't on your list.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.610
I mean, she doesn't seem to
bring some of her femininity

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.720
into her governance.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.030
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: We
all try not to do that.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.270
I mean, now I'm joining
you in this one,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:58.210
because when you were
carrying a key position,

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.110
people do respect you a lot.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.180
You don't want to mix it
up with your femininity.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.500
You don't want people to respect
you because you're a woman.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.080
Oh, look at you, because
you have nice hair.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.860
On the contrary, you tuck the
hair back, try to wear suits.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.690
Why do you think we
wear suits all the time

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.140
when we go to meetings?

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.270
Because we're trying to
say that I am like you.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.600
I'm not different.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.770
I'm not necessarily a woman.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:28.560
I'm not proud of my
hair or my figure.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.370
I'm here because
I'm a human being,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.579
because I love my
profession, I love my job.

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:35.120
Because I'm here because I want
to talk to you about this job

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:40.110
and see what we can do
to make it even better.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.360
That's why we try not
to even-- I sometimes

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.410
forget I'm a woman, especially
with this thick voice,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.590
and especially when I call,
some people say, sir, hold on.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.690
And I'm like, yes.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.646
I will hold on.

00:29:52.646 --> 00:29:55.220
I'm happy they called me a sir.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.980
British embassy, all the time.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.126
Every time I call to ask
for a visa for my mother,

00:29:59.126 --> 00:30:00.500
they're like, sir,
hold the line.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.002
I'm holding.

00:30:02.002 --> 00:30:03.640
I'm happy they called me a sir.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.347
So yeah.

00:30:04.347 --> 00:30:05.430
AUDIENCE: Thank very much.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.763
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: My pleasure.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.410
AUDIENCE: So now that
you've finished your book,

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.210
you're creating
something of your own,

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:18.010
do you have any interest
in going behind the camera

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.450
or doing any writing
in the future?

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:23.820
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: You just
asked the best question ever.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:24.400
I'm dying.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.290
I'm dying to direct.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.010
And I think I can do a good job.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.780
I love acting.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.150
I love teaching it.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.960
As a matter of fact,
my second book,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.670
the one after this one, which
I'm working on right now,

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.920
is purely about acting.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.310
It's all technical.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.140
I want to teach
youngsters who would

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.360
like to become actors
stuff that they do not

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.330
learn in colleges, not
in the universities,

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:56.190
not until you start working,
and you learn it by experience.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.940
That's why I love to teach it.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.080
I love to interact with actors.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.040
I try to do that all the
time, every time I'm working.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.080
And sometimes, they come to me.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.110
They ask me, and I
try to do my best.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.996
So I'm trying to act, to direct.

00:31:10.996 --> 00:31:13.540
I would love, love,
love to direct.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.670
And who knows?

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.690
Maybe I'll start with "Expanse."

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.970
I've already talked about it.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.210
And some of them like the idea.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.440
They were like, oh, we
should pitch it to so and so.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.390
And I was like, go pitch it.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.635
Go do whatever you can do.

00:31:26.635 --> 00:31:28.170
Pitch it as soon as you can.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.700
I'm dying to direct
one of these episodes.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.240
Yeah?

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.150
That's what I'm hoping to do.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.630
Working with actors.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.170
FEMALE SPEAKER: Speaking of
tweeting, did you say tweeting?

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.170
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Yes.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes,
so I understand--

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.230
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Lots
of tweeting, Instagram.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: "The
Expanse," every Tuesday night,

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.020
you guys get online.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Yes.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: 10 o'clock
Eastern time and then also--

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.570
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: 10
o'clock Eastern time,

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.390
7:00 Pacific, right?

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.190
And we do live tweets and
Instagram, and Facebook,

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.120
and some people can't believe
it, especially Iranians.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.490
I love them.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.480
Somebody sent me a text message
saying, is this really you?

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.717
And I'm like, yes, it's me.

00:32:05.717 --> 00:32:06.300
Where are you?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.820
Caspian Sea.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.500
I'm at the Caspian Sea.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.620
And I was like, no
wonder you won't believe,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.380
or you can't believe
that it's really me.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.730
Do you want me to send a selfie?

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:16.940
He goes, yes please.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.210
And I did send a selfie.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:18.710
He loved it.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:21.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: You guys have
really been engaging the fans

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.060
through this.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.601
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Yes, I love them.

00:32:23.601 --> 00:32:26.520
It's for them, because
of them that I'm here.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.290
Sometimes, some
actors really make

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.740
me feel appalled
when they refuse

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:37.910
to take a picture with a fan,
or the way they dismiss them.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.470
And I'm like, if it weren't
because of this fan,

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.290
you would have not been here.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:45.970
But maybe they don't feel like
taking pictures at that moment,

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.540
and I'm being bizarre here.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.569
But I love my fans.

00:32:49.569 --> 00:32:51.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: So are
there any other questions?

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.114
Because on that note, we
might have you join us

00:32:55.114 --> 00:32:56.780
at the back of the
room, where the books

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.340
are for signing and selfies.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.070
So thank you very
much for coming.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.170
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO:
Let's take selfies.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:01.760
I love selfie.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.830
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much for coming.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.820
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: And thank
you very much for having me.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.450
Merci.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.310
And Google too, merci.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.545
SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO: Thanks.

00:33:09.545 --> 00:33:11.180
