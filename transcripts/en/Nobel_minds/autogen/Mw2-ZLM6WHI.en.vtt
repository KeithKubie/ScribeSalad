and Selam arrays before could you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770
and Selam arrays before could you
 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.959
and Selam arrays before could you
explain it for them in simple terms

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969
explain it for them in simple terms
 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.129
explain it for them in simple terms
please so I would say that our genes are

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:12.139
please so I would say that our genes are
 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.160
please so I would say that our genes are
encoded by DNA and DNA is present in the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170
encoded by DNA and DNA is present in the
 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.440
encoded by DNA and DNA is present in the
chromosomes in the cell nucleus and the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450
chromosomes in the cell nucleus and the
 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.379
chromosomes in the cell nucleus and the
telomeres they are the ends of the

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389
telomeres they are the ends of the
 

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:22.359
telomeres they are the ends of the
chromosomes and they have an important

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369
chromosomes and they have an important
 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.889
chromosomes and they have an important
function to protect the chromosomes and

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899
function to protect the chromosomes and
 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.419
function to protect the chromosomes and
maintain the integrity of the

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429
maintain the integrity of the
 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.940
maintain the integrity of the
chromosomes and so what would happen if

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950
chromosomes and so what would happen if
 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.649
chromosomes and so what would happen if
they weren't protected if the Crimson's

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659
they weren't protected if the Crimson's
 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.419
they weren't protected if the Crimson's
were protected by these protective caps

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429
were protected by these protective caps
 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.969
were protected by these protective caps
that his telomeres so then the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979
that his telomeres so then the
 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.609
that his telomeres so then the
chromosomes would get shorter with every

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619
chromosomes would get shorter with every
 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.589
chromosomes would get shorter with every
cell division and in the end that would

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599
cell division and in the end that would
 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.919
cell division and in the end that would
lead to loss of genetic information but

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929
lead to loss of genetic information but
 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.230
lead to loss of genetic information but
it would also mean that the chromosomes

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240
it would also mean that the chromosomes
 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.599
it would also mean that the chromosomes
will be degraded and that will start the

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609
will be degraded and that will start the
 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.459
will be degraded and that will start the
degradation process in ourselves in

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469
degradation process in ourselves in
 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.080
degradation process in ourselves in
eventually lead to cell death

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
eventually lead to cell death
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.419
eventually lead to cell death
so has profound implications for for

so has profound implications for for
 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.859
so has profound implications for for
cells and organisms as a whole

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869
cells and organisms as a whole
 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.870

shorten your telomeres have in terms of

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
shorten your telomeres have in terms of
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.309
shorten your telomeres have in terms of
normal cell function and disease so it's

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319
normal cell function and disease so it's
 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.529
normal cell function and disease so it's
evident that this is a fundamental

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
evident that this is a fundamental
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.710
evident that this is a fundamental

have actually been detected in a certain
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.460
have actually been detected in a certain
group of inherited diseases and they are

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
group of inherited diseases and they are
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.680
group of inherited diseases and they are
characterized by difficulty to maintain

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690

marrow so if you have too little

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
marrow so if you have too little
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.710

telomerase activity the stem cells in

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
telomerase activity the stem cells in
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.650
telomerase activity the stem cells in
the bone marrow are at risk and some of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660
the bone marrow are at risk and some of
 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.110
the bone marrow are at risk and some of
these patients develop severe anemia so

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
these patients develop severe anemia so
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.210
these patients develop severe anemia so
we know about this implication in

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
we know about this implication in
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.880
we know about this implication in
disease we know in cell function but the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
disease we know in cell function but the
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.220
disease we know in cell function but the
story in which we discovered the role of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
story in which we discovered the role of
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.990
story in which we discovered the role of
telomeres and how telomerase is

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
telomeres and how telomerase is
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.490
telomeres and how telomerase is
important in maintaining seal of a

length is a story that's told in several
 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.690
length is a story that's told in several
chapters and I wonder if we could go

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
chapters and I wonder if we could go
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.160
chapters and I wonder if we could go
through each of those chapters interns

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
through each of those chapters interns
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.500
through each of those chapters interns
discover how he went from from from the

discover how he went from from from the
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.510
discover how he went from from from the
beginning to what we know now and so

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
beginning to what we know now and so
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.010
beginning to what we know now and so
that the story starts before the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020
that the story starts before the
 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.300
that the story starts before the
discoveries were made that were in

reward with him there with Nobel Prize
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.150
reward with him there with Nobel Prize
in medicine and what if you could tell

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160
in medicine and what if you could tell
 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.590
in medicine and what if you could tell
us a bit about what we knew about how

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
us a bit about what we knew about how
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.370
us a bit about what we knew about how
DNA is copied in the first place so what

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
DNA is copied in the first place so what
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.880
DNA is copied in the first place so what
was known in the up in the 70s was that

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
was known in the up in the 70s was that
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.380
was known in the up in the 70s was that
DNA is copied by DNA polymerases and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390
DNA is copied by DNA polymerases and
 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.140
DNA is copied by DNA polymerases and
this is a rather complicated process

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150
this is a rather complicated process
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.330
this is a rather complicated process
when both strands of the DNA thread has

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
when both strands of the DNA thread has
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.820
when both strands of the DNA thread has
to be copied and it proceeded smoothly

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830
to be copied and it proceeded smoothly
 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.530
to be copied and it proceeded smoothly
in one direction but in the other

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
in one direction but in the other
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.229
in one direction but in the other
direction it is a stepwise process and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239
direction it is a stepwise process and
 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479
direction it is a stepwise process and
the problem is that when it reaches the

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
the problem is that when it reaches the
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.420
the problem is that when it reaches the
end on one of the strands it's not

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
end on one of the strands it's not
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.780
end on one of the strands it's not
possible to copy the very end of the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790
possible to copy the very end of the
 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840
possible to copy the very end of the
chromosome and scientists didn't know

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850
chromosome and scientists didn't know
 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.670
chromosome and scientists didn't know
how this could occur and how this could

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
how this could occur and how this could
 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.560
how this could occur and how this could
take place and and many different

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570
take place and and many different
 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.350
take place and and many different
theories were around to explain it but

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360
theories were around to explain it but
 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.310
theories were around to explain it but
in fact nobody knew so people knew about

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320
in fact nobody knew so people knew about
 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.710
in fact nobody knew so people knew about
a mechanism copying DNA but what the

a mechanism copying DNA but what the
 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.050
a mechanism copying DNA but what the
missing piece was held how DNA the very

ends is copied yes and it was also known

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
ends is copied yes and it was also known
 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.830
ends is copied yes and it was also known
that that was very important for to keep

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
that that was very important for to keep
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.680
that that was very important for to keep

and so then we reached the first chapter

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760
and so then we reached the first chapter
 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.750
and so then we reached the first chapter
of the the telomeres long race story and

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760
of the the telomeres long race story and
 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640
of the the telomeres long race story and
could you talk us through the first

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
could you talk us through the first
 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.350
could you talk us through the first
steps in the key experiments that that

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360
steps in the key experiments that that
 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.509
steps in the key experiments that that
were performed to that reveal the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519
were performed to that reveal the
 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.780
were performed to that reveal the
existence of telomeres so in fact it was

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790
existence of telomeres so in fact it was
 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.280

chromosomes and she discovered and found

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
chromosomes and she discovered and found
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.180
chromosomes and she discovered and found
that they had a specific sequence at the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190
that they had a specific sequence at the
 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.590
that they had a specific sequence at the

interested in understanding how these
 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.460
interested in understanding how these
chromosomes were maintained now Jack

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470
chromosomes were maintained now Jack
 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.760

szostak he had a different problem he

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
szostak he had a different problem he
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.310
szostak he had a different problem he
was wanting to make artificial mini

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.510
was wanting to make artificial mini
chromosomes and put them into yeast and

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520
chromosomes and put them into yeast and
 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.210
chromosomes and put them into yeast and
when he made such he discovered that if

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220
when he made such he discovered that if
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.940
when he made such he discovered that if
they were linear and they could not be

they were linear and they could not be
 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.860
they were linear and they could not be
maintained in yeast as they were rapidly

maintained in yeast as they were rapidly
 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.060
maintained in yeast as they were rapidly
degraded so what was happening was that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070
degraded so what was happening was that
 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.350
degraded so what was happening was that
there was a piece of DNA that was being

szostak was working on yeast and he was

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300
szostak was working on yeast and he was
 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.750
szostak was working on yeast and he was
trying to work out why chromosomes he

was introducing its use for degrading so
then we reached the next part of the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880
then we reached the next part of the
 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.820
then we reached the next part of the
story which is the key experiment could

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830
story which is the key experiment could
 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.740

you talk us through that please yes so

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750
you talk us through that please yes so
 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.050
you talk us through that please yes so
as in all good science there are lucky

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060
as in all good science there are lucky
 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.600
as in all good science there are lucky
moments and then one of these lucky

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610
moments and then one of these lucky
 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.280
moments and then one of these lucky
moments was when Elizabeth Blackburn

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290
moments was when Elizabeth Blackburn
 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.590
moments was when Elizabeth Blackburn
actual stuck met at a conference in 1980

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
actual stuck met at a conference in 1980
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.170
actual stuck met at a conference in 1980
and they heard and about each other's

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180
and they heard and about each other's
 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.800
and they heard and about each other's
results and then they decided to test

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810
results and then they decided to test
 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.920
results and then they decided to test
the possibility that the EM sequences in

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930
the possibility that the EM sequences in
 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.050
the possibility that the EM sequences in
the tetrahymena could actually function

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
the tetrahymena could actually function
 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.870
the tetrahymena could actually function
in a very different species yeast which

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880
in a very different species yeast which
 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.210
in a very different species yeast which
in in evolutionary terms is far away

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220
in in evolutionary terms is far away
 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.030
in in evolutionary terms is far away
from each other and so what happened

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040
from each other and so what happened
 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.659
from each other and so what happened
yeah so then they made mini chromosomes

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669
yeah so then they made mini chromosomes
 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.040
yeah so then they made mini chromosomes
just like the one that Jack szostak had

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050
just like the one that Jack szostak had
 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.980
just like the one that Jack szostak had
made before but now they put tetrahymena

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990
made before but now they put tetrahymena
 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.600
made before but now they put tetrahymena
tell

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610
tell
 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.640
tell
DNA at both ends and when they

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650
DNA at both ends and when they
 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.040
DNA at both ends and when they
introduced these mini chromosomes now

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050
introduced these mini chromosomes now
 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.080
introduced these mini chromosomes now
into yeast cells now they could be

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090
into yeast cells now they could be
 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.809
into yeast cells now they could be
maintained for a long periods of time

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819
maintained for a long periods of time
 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.779
maintained for a long periods of time
and in an intact manner and so it's

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789
and in an intact manner and so it's
 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.219
and in an intact manner and so it's
quite incredible that the experiment

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229
quite incredible that the experiment
 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:34.990
quite incredible that the experiment
work because you have 230 different

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000
work because you have 230 different
 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.320
work because you have 230 different
organisms taking the protective cap from

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
organisms taking the protective cap from
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.029
organisms taking the protective cap from
one organism and attaching it to another

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039
one organism and attaching it to another
 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.209
one organism and attaching it to another
it seemed to work fine yes and I think

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219
it seemed to work fine yes and I think
 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.059
it seemed to work fine yes and I think
that was the one of the most important

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:46.069
that was the one of the most important
 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:47.950
that was the one of the most important
aspects of the experiment because that

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960
aspects of the experiment because that
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.230
aspects of the experiment because that
immediately said that this must be a

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240
immediately said that this must be a
 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.990
immediately said that this must be a
very strongly conserved and fundamental

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000
very strongly conserved and fundamental
 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.809
very strongly conserved and fundamental
mechanism that was discovered and so the

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819
mechanism that was discovered and so the
 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.100
mechanism that was discovered and so the
next chapter of the story involves

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110
next chapter of the story involves
 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.110
next chapter of the story involves
discovering how these telomeres are made

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120
discovering how these telomeres are made
 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.850
discovering how these telomeres are made
in the first place and could you talk us

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860
in the first place and could you talk us
 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.999
in the first place and could you talk us
through that please yes so the

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009
through that please yes so the
 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.580
through that please yes so the
hypothesis was then that there might be

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590
hypothesis was then that there might be
 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.610
hypothesis was then that there might be
a new and unknown enzyme that was

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620
a new and unknown enzyme that was
 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.379
a new and unknown enzyme that was
involved in actually adding DNA

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389
involved in actually adding DNA
 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.110
involved in actually adding DNA
sequences to the telomere ends and Carol

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120
sequences to the telomere ends and Carol
 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.570
sequences to the telomere ends and Carol
Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn started

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580
Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn started
 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.709
Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn started
a search for the enzyme and so they used

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:20.719
a search for the enzyme and so they used
 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:23.499
a search for the enzyme and so they used
Tetrahymena cell extracts added DNA

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:23.509
Tetrahymena cell extracts added DNA
 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.390
Tetrahymena cell extracts added DNA
sequences corresponding to the telomere

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400
sequences corresponding to the telomere
 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.379
sequences corresponding to the telomere
DNA and building blocks for DNA and then

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389
DNA and building blocks for DNA and then
 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.390
DNA and building blocks for DNA and then
they could actually analyze if an

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400
they could actually analyze if an
 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.659
they could actually analyze if an
extension took place and again on

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:34.669
extension took place and again on
 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.140
extension took place and again on
Christmas Day 1984 Carol Grady could

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150
Christmas Day 1984 Carol Grady could
 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.850
Christmas Day 1984 Carol Grady could
actually detect the first signs of

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.860
actually detect the first signs of
 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.879
actually detect the first signs of
enzyme activity in her extracts and that

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:42.889
enzyme activity in her extracts and that
 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:45.399
enzyme activity in her extracts and that
was then the starting point to go on so

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:45.409
was then the starting point to go on so
 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:47.439
was then the starting point to go on so
it's a delightful Christmas present but

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:47.449
it's a delightful Christmas present but
 

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:48.999
it's a delightful Christmas present but
what exactly is the machinery that crate

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.009
what exactly is the machinery that crate
 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.089
what exactly is the machinery that crate
steven is so it turns out that this is a

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:52.099
steven is so it turns out that this is a
 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:54.309
steven is so it turns out that this is a
unique enzyme that has a protein

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319
unique enzyme that has a protein
 

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.659
unique enzyme that has a protein

that is intrinsic to the enzyme that
 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.189
that is intrinsic to the enzyme that
serves as the guide or a template to

serves as the guide or a template to
 

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:08.950
serves as the guide or a template to
determine which building blocks that

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960
determine which building blocks that
 

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.050
determine which building blocks that
should be added and in which order so

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.060
should be added and in which order so
 

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.790
should be added and in which order so
the RNA access that the template for

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800
the RNA access that the template for
 

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.159
the RNA access that the template for
construction and the enzyme that's

components are actually sufficient to

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:21.979
components are actually sufficient to
 

00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:26.140
components are actually sufficient to
make the reaction work in vitro now now

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.150
make the reaction work in vitro now now
 

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.749
make the reaction work in vitro now now
later on we know that in real cells

00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759
later on we know that in real cells
 

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.410
later on we know that in real cells
there are also many other calm

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:30.420
there are also many other calm
 

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.910
there are also many other calm
that are involved and and are

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:31.920
that are involved and and are
 

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.760
that are involved and and are
surrounding these key components that we

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:34.770
surrounding these key components that we
 

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.280
surrounding these key components that we
are talking about here and so we have

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.290
are talking about here and so we have
 

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.430
are talking about here and so we have
this this lovely finding in in different

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
this this lovely finding in in different
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.070
this this lovely finding in in different
organisms that shows that how the ends

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080
organisms that shows that how the ends
 

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.570
organisms that shows that how the ends
of chromosomes are constructed how

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580
of chromosomes are constructed how
 

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.040
of chromosomes are constructed how
protects the chromosomes from from

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.050
protects the chromosomes from from
 

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.650
protects the chromosomes from from
degradation we then need to move to how

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660
degradation we then need to move to how
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.750
degradation we then need to move to how
this is important to to the cells that

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760
this is important to to the cells that
 

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.030
this is important to to the cells that
are in yours and mine bodies so what was

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040
are in yours and mine bodies so what was
 

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.440
are in yours and mine bodies so what was
the next leap of knowledge that we had

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:54.450
the next leap of knowledge that we had
 

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.530
the next leap of knowledge that we had
in order to know that this is the case

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.540
in order to know that this is the case
 

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.380
in order to know that this is the case
well since there was early observations

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.390
well since there was early observations
 

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.860
well since there was early observations
that also said that if telomerase

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:03.870
that also said that if telomerase
 

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.620
that also said that if telomerase
activity was compromised then cells

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:06.630
activity was compromised then cells
 

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.710
activity was compromised then cells
would actually age or senesce in culture

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720
would actually age or senesce in culture
 

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.080
would actually age or senesce in culture
so it was thought that maybe this is a

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.090
so it was thought that maybe this is a
 

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.800
so it was thought that maybe this is a
key mechanism to aging however now we

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:15.810
key mechanism to aging however now we
 

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.290
key mechanism to aging however now we
know that aging at the organismal level

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300
know that aging at the organismal level
 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.870
know that aging at the organismal level
is a much more complex process and are

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880
is a much more complex process and are
 

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.830
is a much more complex process and are
many factors that influence aging and

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:23.840
many factors that influence aging and
 

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.090
many factors that influence aging and
telomere length and telomerase is one

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100
telomere length and telomerase is one
 

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.590
telomere length and telomerase is one
that is important but there are many

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600
that is important but there are many
 

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.140
that is important but there are many
others now the other key thing that also

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:30.150
others now the other key thing that also
 

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.700
others now the other key thing that also
came quite early was the discovery that

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:33.710
came quite early was the discovery that
 

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.500
came quite early was the discovery that
most cancer cells have very high

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.510
most cancer cells have very high
 

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.030
most cancer cells have very high
telomerase activity and that is needed

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040
telomerase activity and that is needed
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.950
telomerase activity and that is needed
since cancer cells proliferate very

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:42.960
since cancer cells proliferate very
 

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.380
since cancer cells proliferate very
frequently and in one sense can be said

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.390
frequently and in one sense can be said
 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.010
frequently and in one sense can be said
to have eternal life and at the same

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.020
to have eternal life and at the same
 

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.260
to have eternal life and at the same
time cancer cells also have abnormal

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.270
time cancer cells also have abnormal
 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.200
time cancer cells also have abnormal
telomeres so that has raised hope that

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.210
telomeres so that has raised hope that
 

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.470
telomeres so that has raised hope that
one may be able to develop new

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480
one may be able to develop new
 

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.640
one may be able to develop new
therapeutic strategies to treat cancer

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:58.650
therapeutic strategies to treat cancer
 

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.990
therapeutic strategies to treat cancer
based on blocking telomerase activity or

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000
based on blocking telomerase activity or
 

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.330
based on blocking telomerase activity or
to eliminate cells that have high

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:05.340
to eliminate cells that have high
 

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.000
to eliminate cells that have high
telomerase activity again one must be

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.010
telomerase activity again one must be
 

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.830
telomerase activity again one must be
careful also with potential side effects

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:09.840
careful also with potential side effects
 

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.900
careful also with potential side effects
since it's also now known that stem

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
since it's also now known that stem
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.080
since it's also now known that stem
cells have telomerase activity and that

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.090
cells have telomerase activity and that
 

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.120
cells have telomerase activity and that
that activity is important for the

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.130
that activity is important for the
 

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.740
that activity is important for the
maintenance of the stem cell compartment

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:18.750
maintenance of the stem cell compartment
 

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.630
maintenance of the stem cell compartment
so where are we with regards to

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640
so where are we with regards to
 

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.450
so where are we with regards to
understanding the role of targeting Slom

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.460
understanding the role of targeting Slom
 

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.870
understanding the role of targeting Slom
arises as a potential therapy so early

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880
arises as a potential therapy so early
 

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.370
arises as a potential therapy so early
clinical trials are ongoing in cancer in

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380
clinical trials are ongoing in cancer in
 

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.320
clinical trials are ongoing in cancer in
the cancer area primarily with two

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.330
the cancer area primarily with two
 

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.900
the cancer area primarily with two
approaches the one approach is to block

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:35.910
approaches the one approach is to block
 

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.489
approaches the one approach is to block
traumas activity and the other one is

00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:38.499
traumas activity and the other one is
 

00:10:38.499 --> 00:10:41.009
traumas activity and the other one is
actually to try to teach the immune

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:41.019
actually to try to teach the immune
 

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:42.569
actually to try to teach the immune
system to eliminate cells would have

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:42.579
system to eliminate cells would have
 

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:46.549
system to eliminate cells would have
high telomerase activity and I think

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:46.559
high telomerase activity and I think
 

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:49.769
high telomerase activity and I think
there is one phase 3 study but most of

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:49.779
there is one phase 3 study but most of
 

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.089
there is one phase 3 study but most of
the other studies are phase one or phase

00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:51.099
the other studies are phase one or phase
 

00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:53.879
the other studies are phase one or phase
two and so we still have to wait until

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:53.889
two and so we still have to wait until
 

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:55.829
two and so we still have to wait until
we get conclusive results and know if

00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839
we get conclusive results and know if
 

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.129
we get conclusive results and know if
this will be have a thickest e towards

00:10:59.129 --> 00:10:59.139
this will be have a thickest e towards
 

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:00.409
this will be have a thickest e towards
cancer or not

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:00.419

so the going back to discoveries that

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:03.549
so the going back to discoveries that
 

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:05.039
so the going back to discoveries that
have been rewarded with the Nobel Prize

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:05.049
have been rewarded with the Nobel Prize
 

00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:07.199
have been rewarded with the Nobel Prize
this year these were made in the late

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:07.209
this year these were made in the late
 

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:10.379
this year these were made in the late
1970s and the 1980s so is there any

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:10.389
1970s and the 1980s so is there any
 

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:13.739
1970s and the 1980s so is there any
particular reason why the candidates for

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:13.749
particular reason why the candidates for
 

00:11:13.749 --> 00:11:14.939
particular reason why the candidates for
the prize were deemed particularly

00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:14.949
the prize were deemed particularly
 

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.369
the prize were deemed particularly
worthy this year no actually so the

00:11:17.369 --> 00:11:17.379
worthy this year no actually so the
 

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:19.319
worthy this year no actually so the
first key discovery was mainly nineteen

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:19.329
first key discovery was mainly nineteen
 

00:11:19.329 --> 00:11:21.749
first key discovery was mainly nineteen
nineteen eighty two the second on

00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:21.759
nineteen eighty two the second on
 

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.419
nineteen eighty two the second on
enzymatic activity 1985 and RNA

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:24.429
enzymatic activity 1985 and RNA
 

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:26.999
enzymatic activity 1985 and RNA
component in 1989 so that is the

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:27.009
component in 1989 so that is the
 

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:31.259
component in 1989 so that is the
timescale but going through different

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:31.269
timescale but going through different
 

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:33.119
timescale but going through different
discoveries and weigh them against

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:33.129
discoveries and weigh them against
 

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:35.609
discoveries and weigh them against
others as it's a lengthy process and it

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:35.619
others as it's a lengthy process and it
 

00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:38.039
others as it's a lengthy process and it
must also be very evident that this is a

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:38.049
must also be very evident that this is a
 

00:11:38.049 --> 00:11:42.479
must also be very evident that this is a
general process and and also then the

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:42.489
general process and and also then the
 

00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:44.759
general process and and also then the
Nobel Committee goes through who

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:44.769
Nobel Committee goes through who
 

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:48.509
Nobel Committee goes through who
actually did the discoveries in the

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519
actually did the discoveries in the
 

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.579
actually did the discoveries in the
great detail so there is no particular

00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:50.589
great detail so there is no particular
 

00:11:50.589 --> 00:11:54.239
great detail so there is no particular
reason that it's this year but now all

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:54.249
reason that it's this year but now all
 

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:55.769
reason that it's this year but now all
the knowledge and all these factors that

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:55.779
the knowledge and all these factors that
 

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:58.619
the knowledge and all these factors that
I mentioned are around and they were

00:11:58.619 --> 00:11:58.629
I mentioned are around and they were
 

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:00.719
I mentioned are around and they were
selected to be at the top of the list

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:00.729
selected to be at the top of the list
 

00:12:00.729 --> 00:12:04.109
selected to be at the top of the list
this year and one things that the the

00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:04.119
this year and one things that the the
 

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:06.239
this year and one things that the the
achievements highlights is the the value

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:06.249
achievements highlights is the the value
 

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:08.519
achievements highlights is the the value
of curiosity driven research and the

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:08.529
of curiosity driven research and the
 

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:10.229
of curiosity driven research and the
value of high-risk high-reward research

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:10.239
value of high-risk high-reward research
 

00:12:10.239 --> 00:12:12.329
value of high-risk high-reward research
and that's a message has always been

00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:12.339
and that's a message has always been
 

00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:14.879
and that's a message has always been
told by the Nobel Prize since 1901 is

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:14.889
told by the Nobel Prize since 1901 is
 

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:16.769
told by the Nobel Prize since 1901 is
this a message that the the medicine

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:16.779
this a message that the the medicine
 

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:18.509
this a message that the the medicine
committee's keen to promote more than

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519
committee's keen to promote more than
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.939
committee's keen to promote more than
ever I think that with the Nobel Prize

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:20.949
ever I think that with the Nobel Prize
 

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.449
ever I think that with the Nobel Prize
in if you solve your medicine we are

00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459
in if you solve your medicine we are
 

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:27.989
in if you solve your medicine we are
very careful to select discoveries which

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:27.999
very careful to select discoveries which
 

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:30.629
very careful to select discoveries which
are of fundamental importance in biology

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639
are of fundamental importance in biology
 

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:33.779
are of fundamental importance in biology
but also have clear implications but it

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:33.789
but also have clear implications but it
 

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:35.939
but also have clear implications but it
is the fact that if you discover a new

00:12:35.939 --> 00:12:35.949
is the fact that if you discover a new
 

00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:37.799
is the fact that if you discover a new
fundamental by local measurements it's

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:37.809
fundamental by local measurements it's
 

00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:40.949
fundamental by local measurements it's
bound to have also medical implication

00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959
bound to have also medical implication
 

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.779
bound to have also medical implication
and this is the case also with the

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:42.789
and this is the case also with the
 

00:12:42.789 --> 00:12:45.089
and this is the case also with the
discovery of telomerase and another

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:45.099
discovery of telomerase and another
 

00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:47.519
discovery of telomerase and another
important factor is that also curiosity

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:47.529
important factor is that also curiosity
 

00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:50.039
important factor is that also curiosity
different search also in organisms that

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:50.049
different search also in organisms that
 

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:51.480
different search also in organisms that
may see in faraway

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.490
may see in faraway
 

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.999
may see in faraway
from human beings turn out to be very

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:54.009
from human beings turn out to be very
 

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:57.389
from human beings turn out to be very
important in this case a unicellular

00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399
important in this case a unicellular
 

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:00.900
important in this case a unicellular
organism 'silly ate and yeast but they

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:00.910
organism 'silly ate and yeast but they
 

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.660
organism 'silly ate and yeast but they
were enough to reveal such a fundamental

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:03.670
were enough to reveal such a fundamental
 

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.939
were enough to reveal such a fundamental
political process that has all the

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:05.949
political process that has all the
 

00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:08.340
political process that has all the
importance also in human beings and

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.350
importance also in human beings and
 

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.290
importance also in human beings and
that's a great message to end on myself

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:10.300
that's a great message to end on myself
 

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.699
that's a great message to end on myself
