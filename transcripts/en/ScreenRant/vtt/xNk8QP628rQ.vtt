the 2016 DC offering.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.540

spreading spoilers.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.990

generated using CGI.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.950
To show the movie's actors where he would
be standing in any given scene, a cardboard

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.259

by the cast and crew - was put in place.

of the books, it would have been called The
