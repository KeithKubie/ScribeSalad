MALE SPEAKER: So good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.430
And welcome to another
outstanding

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.870
Authors@Google talk.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.890
Today, we're really thrilled
to host Jody Eddy

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.540
in our midst today.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.770
I first met Jody when I wanted
to know more about the cuisine

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.340
of Iceland.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.310
And it turns out she's an
upcoming expert in that field.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.360
But she's done even more awesome
things, as well.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.760
She's a cookbook, a food
blogger, a writer.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.086
You can find more of her
information at jodyeddy.com.

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.350
So today, she'll be speaking to
us about "Staff Meals," her

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.400
latest book.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.080
And it really raises some
interesting questions.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.570
The restaurant world is out to
entertain and to feed and to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.040
serve the general public.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120
But what do they do for
their actual staff?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.190
And so to that end, Jody
interviewed a wide variety of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.250
chefs and restaurants and came
up with this book, which she

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.850
will now talk to us
more in detail.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.130
So please join me in welcoming
Jody to Google.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.380
Thank you.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.120
JODY EDDY: So I don't know if
anybody here has worked in

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.480
restaurants before.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.410
But what a staff meal is, is
what the chefs cook for each

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.880
other and what they're making
for the dish washers that are

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510
there, for the wait staff
that is there.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.220
And I used to be a chef.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
And one of the restaurants
I worked at that was a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.480
prestigious restaurant did not
serve a decent staff meal.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.510
And I actually never
even ate it.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.990
I didn't even know what a staff
meal was, because I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.040
always skipped it.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.010
And then, I went over to cook
at The Fat Duck, Heston

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.025
Blumenthal's restaurant
in England.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.780
And it was a 17-hour
day, 6 days a week.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.330
And on the first day, we went
outside, and there were picnic

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.710
tables just lined with
incredible food.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.470
And I asked one of the chefs
if it was a holiday.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.150
And he said, no, this
is our staff meal.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.640
And they did it twice a day.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910
And it was truly the thing
that got me through those

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.820
brutal days.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.530
And so I was the editor at "Art
Culinaire Magazine," and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.960
I was meeting with a friend.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.530
And we were talking about the
possibility of writing a book.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.280
And she had also been a cook.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.400
And we were just talking about
what that was in a restaurant

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.770
that we loved the most.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.010
And it was the staff meal.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.340
And so we decided that's
what we would focus on.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.300
And so it's a little tricky,
because a lot of restaurants

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.800
have terrible staff meals.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.690
And as we did our research, we
really wanted to find those

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.900
genuine staff meals.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.180
We didn't want a restaurant to
just put on a show for us when

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.810
we showed up.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.750
And so we just kind of did
some covert research on

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.170
Facebook, through Twitter--

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.230
we had so many chef contacts
in the industry--

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.210
just asking, do you have
a great staff meal?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.070
Tell us about it.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.620
And we didn't tell them what
the project was about.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.230
And information just poured in
about incredible staff meals

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.350
around the world.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710
And so it was really heartening
to realize that it

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.250
wasn't just the restaurants
we had landed at that had

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.930
incredible staff meals,
but they existed

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.200
all over the world.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.330
And so that's how it started.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.135
And it was really difficult.

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:10.060
We had 25 restaurants
in the book.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.730
It was hard to really focus on
what those 25 staff meals

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.290
would be, because we were
finding hundreds and hundreds

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.240
of amazing staff meals.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.260
But we focused, and
we found our 25.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.410
And it was interesting.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.550
When we started writing our
book, which was about three

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.300
years ago now, there wasn't a
lot of research out there on

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.230
staff meals.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.930
You didn't see it mentioned
anywhere.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.820
There was a "Gourmet" magazine
article written about the El

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.040
Bulli staff meal.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.000
There was David Waltuck's
book.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.120
He's a chef who used to run a
restaurant called Chanterelle.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.680
He wrote a really beautiful book
on staff meals about 10

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.600
years before.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.172
But that was really it.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:55.770
So we had a hard time initially
just getting a book

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.950
deal and finding an agent who
believed in this concept,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.610
because it wasn't something that
they were familiar with

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.700
in the industry.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.720
And they thought it was going
to be too obscure.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.160
And even when we started
approaching the restaurants

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.430
who had great staff meals, they
didn't quite understand

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.480
why we would want
to focus on it.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.540
It was always a tradition that
was just kind of "back of the

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.779
house" that nobody really
thought about.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.170
It was kind of an afterthought
for them.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.670
But then, the restaurants we
visited, when they started

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.960
looking at what they were
actually doing every day and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.380
realizing that the bottom line
were happy employees, they

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.960
realized themselves how
incredible this tradition was.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.440
And today, there are mentions
of staff meals everywhere.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.190
And even as we started writing
the book, I asked Ferran Adria

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.060
if he would be in our book.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.000
And he told me he was writing
his own book on staff meals,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.020
which really scared
me, initially.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.390
I thought, well, if Ferran is
writing a staff meal book,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.730
that's going to be the
staff meal book.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.930
And then restaurants started
serving staff

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.580
meals to their customers.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.830
And there were food trucks
opening up about staff meals.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.680
There were restaurants opening
up that were serving their

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.100
staff meals.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.980
So we were initially a little
afraid that it was going to be

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.700
very over-saturated by the time
our book was released.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.280
But a friend in the industry
said, this is great, it's

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.410
creating a genre.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.240
And I don't know if you have
a lot of staff meal-related

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.940
restaurants here.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.040
Do you see it now?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.890
Are you seeing it mentioned?

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.150
So that's kind of
how we began.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:41.370
And I visited every single
restaurant that's in our book.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.380
And it was tricky at first to
figure out how we were going

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.030
to coordinate photography.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.680
And so we ended up using
regional photographers for

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.950
every restaurant.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.400
So we have 17 photographers
in our book.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.510
And we were a little concerned
that it might look like a

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.050
mishmash with all these
photographers.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.540
But I think it actually really
speaks to what "Staff Meals"

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.990
is about, because each one
is so distinctive.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.310
And I feel like it
worked for us.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:18.000
And so we also brought along
to every visit a journal, a

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.780
sketchbook.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.410
And we brought art supplies
with us, because chefs are

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.330
actually really creative
people.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:29.900
And so we have these incredible
journals filled

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.270
with drawings and artwork
about what staff meal

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.180
means to the chefs.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.260
So if you look throughout the
book, you'll see writing and

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.480
you'll see drawings.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.310
And those are actually elements
that came from these

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.830
staff books.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.450
We're actually trying to figure
out what to do with all

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.470
of these staff books that we
have, because we have hundreds

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.860
of illustrations by some of
the world's top chefs, and

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.420
they're not all in the book.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.440
And so we're figuring out if
we should do a book just

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.050
solely based upon that.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.010
So this is a regional
restaurant, Ad Hoc.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.230
I really felt like Thomas
Keller, in his "French Laundry

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.780
Cookbook," writes this
really incredible

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.910
piece about staff meals.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.940
So I really felt like we needed
to have a Thomas Keller

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.770
restaurant.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.840
I was initially thinking French
Laundry would be where

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.490
we would land.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.980
But he really wanted us to focus
on Ad Hoc, because they

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.880
actually are serving the
staff meal at Ad Hoc.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.750
They have an incredible
tradition there.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.010
Every Monday--

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.740
they don't work on Tuesdays--

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.870
they have this blowout
staff meal.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.380
They save the wine from the
week, all the leftover wine.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.190
They can bring their dogs
to the staff meal.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.180
And it's this gorgeous feast.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.470
And so that's what
we covered there.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.750
And we asked if we could also
cover their daily staff meal,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.720
just their regular staff meal.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.170
They're like, well, it's not
that special, but sure.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.470
And that, in itself, was
this incredible meal.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.620
So once again, it was them not
really realizing how unique

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.960
and special this was.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.860
And Thomas has a chef on staff
just exclusively to make staff

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.690
meal every day at Ad Hoc.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.170
That's how important
it is to him.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.150
And we talked a lot about what
is that bottom line, what does

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.950
staff meal deliver to
your restaurant.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.990
And there's so many intangibles,
really.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.990
But ultimately, it's a really
happy employee.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.720
And I think that's very
similar to Google.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.870
It's delivering to you this
quality of life that you can't

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.640
get everywhere.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.120
And when I've talked to chefs
who don't have good staff

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.630
meals at their restaurants, they
feel really bitter about

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.440
it, because they know that
there are restaurants out

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.130
there now-- with our book, with
other books-- that have

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.860
great staff meals.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.160
And they realize maybe
they're missing out.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
And that photographer
is Eric Wolfinger.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.990
He photographed "Tartine Bread."
So I work with him on

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.320
several different projects,
and he's a

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.910
great guy to work with.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.190
This is Arzak in San
Sebastian, Spain.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.240
And I don't know if you're
familiar with Arzak, but it's

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.960
a fourth-generation Spanish
restaurant.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.880
And Juan Mari Arzak really
put avant-garde Spanish

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.550
cooking on the map.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.130
It used to be a traditional
Spanish restaurant.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.650
His daughter, Elena, who's
standing next to him, she was

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.740
just voted San Pellegrino's best
female chef in the world.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.520
And what was so special about
their staff meal is they have

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.640
this beautiful marble table in
the back of their restaurant.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.030
He's always served
a staff meal.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.990
And Elena said, I've been
sitting at this table having

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.370
staff meals since I
was two years old.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.000
And it's just really incredible
how much it was a

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.950
part of her life.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.830
That shoot was a nightmare.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.980
We have over 100 cooks.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.040
And we had to stand in a busy
median to take the picture.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.910
And everyone in town
knows Juan Mari.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.940
So it took us hours to get this
picture, because everyone

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.280
was stopping by to say hello,
and he was engaging.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.290
But we eventually got it.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.440
And this is Au Pied de
Cochon in Montreal.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.320
They do an after-hours staff
meal, which is kind of unusual

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.130
in the industry.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.700
So at around 2 o'clock, they're
banging out their

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.280
staff meal.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.940
And it was exhausting, but
they were all really

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.930
exhilarated by it.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.250
And I thought it would be
lighter food, because it was

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.130
so late at night.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.210
But it was this heavy
pork, because

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.390
they're known for pork.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.280
And it was intense.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.790
And this is the Bristol
in Chicago.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.160
I actually cooked with
the chef there,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.410
Joe, at The Fat Duck.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.200
So when I asked Joe, what's the
best restaurant in Chicago

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.030
for staff meal, he's
like, mine.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.860
And I said, come on, tell me
what the-- and he's like,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.240
mine, I'm telling you.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.790
So I trusted him, and it
is actually amazing.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.290
And I had such a great
experience with this chef and

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.690
this restaurant.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.420
I'm actually writing a
book with him now.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.676
So something really positive
came out of this visit.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:15.910
And this is John Currence, who
is at City Grocery in Oxford,

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.920
Mississippi.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.270
And what was really, I think,
interesting about this is I

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.010
really respect John as a chef,
but when we invited him-- and

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.250
I've worked with him before, so
I thought he would say yes

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.790
right away.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.280
And when I invited him, we
didn't get a response at

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.500
first, and he kind
of put us off.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.120
So I finally said, you know,
if you don't want to do it,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.730
that's fine.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.690
And he's like, you know what,
I'm just so embarrassed.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.380
I've had a restaurant for 10
years, and I don't have a

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.050
staff meal.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.440
I've never served one.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.950
And it's something I've always
wanted to do, but I just have

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.600
never gotten around to it.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.240
And he said, so this book--

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.940
I'm going to do it.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.750
I'm going to start.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.270
And so he started the staff meal
tradition because of our

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.940
book, which I thought, for
their employees, it was a

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.900
pretty amazing thing, all of a
sudden, to add this great perk

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.920
to their day.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.780
And when I went back on the
book tour, so maybe a year

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.510
later, I thought, I'm going to
find out if he's still serving

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.530
staff meal.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.970
And every day, they have an
incredible staff meal.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.870
So there's John.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.780
And this is Dill in Reykjavik
that actually, I think, Cliff

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.830
has been to.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.880
It's how Cliff and
I connected.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.160
I spent a lot of time
in Iceland.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.930
And this staff meal was really
unique and special, because

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.410
when this restaurant started,
the Icelandic economic

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.450
collapse happened.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.220
And all of the chef's investors

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.880
had pulled out overnight.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.340
So his staff worked for him
for free for months.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.200
And it was really incredible.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.270
And his producers supplied free

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.450
product to him for months.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:57.550
So this staff meal, it was
the day after Christmas.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.350
And he let his employees
invite their families.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.750
So it was a really
extravagant meal.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.760
But it was a real "thank you"
to his staff for really

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.630
sticking with him.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.520
And now Dill is one of
the most successful

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.830
restaurants in Iceland.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.630
But it was really special.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.640
And that's Gunnar and his
partner, Oli, in the business.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.730
And so I'm now writing a
cookbook with him, as well.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.730
And I have more on that later.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.170
And this is The Fat Duck.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.860
And so it was really fun, after
so many years-- and it's

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.050
kind of where it all started--

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.580
to return to The Fat Duck and to
share in their staff meal.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.020
And the head chef, Johnny,
was still there.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.340
And so it was really incredible
to go back.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.030
This is Fresca in Colorado.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.260
And they actually served
a Mexican staff meal.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.710
And they're known for their
Italian cuisine.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.120
And that's something you find in
staff meals a lot, too, is

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.380
that the restaurants aren't
necessarily serving what

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.160
they're serving in the
restaurants to their guests.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.200
But they're an amazing
Italian restaurant.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.420
And I really wanted an
Italian meal there.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.800
And so they served
a Mexican meal.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.090
And I did ask them, could we
do a second staff meal, and

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.180
could you do Italian?

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.430
Because I really wanted
to showcase that.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.900
So they did.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.460
But it's certainly something
you see with staff

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.450
meals all the time.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.060
And this is Grace in Portland.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.410
It's in a church, so it was
just beautiful to shoot.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.200
And this is the Herbfarm
in Seattle.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.920
This is actually the first
staff meal I shot.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.900
They invite their producers,
their fishermen, once a week

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.540
to their staff meal, which
that's something you find, as

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.790
well, with staff meals.

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:44.750
They integrate it into their
lives and into what they do

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.210
and who they're working with.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.615
This is Annisa in New York.

00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:53.170
That's chef Anita Lo.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.085
And this is Craigie On Main,
Tony Maws's restaurant.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.740
One of his criteria for hiring
his chefs is they have to cook

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.830
a staff meal before
they're hired.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.510
And he needs to see that
they are up to snuff.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.320
And he does that by gauging
their staff meal.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.470
And that's something, certainly,
that I think is

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.010
really special about staff
meal, as well.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.560
It's a time for chefs to
experiment, because you're not

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.690
necessarily going to do that
and put it on the menu,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.440
because your guests
might not like it.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.920
And chefs have their own--
they're brutal critics with

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.630
each other.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:34.290
I've talked to so many chefs
whose menu items evolved out

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.720
of their staff meal, through
a lot of experimentation,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.830
through a lot of really
harsh criticism

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.130
from their other chefs.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.890
But it kind of becomes a
laboratory for that.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.700
And I think that's another great
thing about staff meals.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.820
This is Morimoto in
Philadelphia.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.460
The first staff meal Morimoto
ever served when they opened

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.720
the restaurant was
a maki roll.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.890
This restaurant is huge.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.230
It's incredibly long.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.750
And he made a maki roll that was
as long as the restaurant

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.300
and had his staff line up.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.340
And they all created it
themselves, and they all

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.360
rolled it themselves.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.510
And that was their first staff
meal, which is a great way to

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.560
bring people together.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.690
And this is that Cochon
in New Orleans.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.370
Again, very pork-heavy.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.610
And this is the Sean
Brock, McCrady's.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.020
And he, again, has been serving
a staff meal that is

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.200
just incredible for
over a decade.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.340
And when we interviewed
his staff,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.680
they're so loyal to him.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.570
So many of them have
been there with him

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.040
from the very beginning.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.470
And they cite staff meal, as
well, as a reason why they

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.950
stick with him, because it
really shows that devotion

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.090
that the chef has
to his staff.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.375
Sean, of course, he's all
about bourbon and port.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:55.350
And so he did an Elvis Presley
milkshake that was certainly

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.385
the most unhealthy thing
you could ever eat.

00:16:57.385 --> 00:17:00.880
It was bacon and ice cream
and bourbon and bananas.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.130
But it was delicious.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.280
This is Uchi in Austin.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.740
And they are also known
for their staff meal.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.819
Now, we've talked about
Uchi and how

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.109
incredible it is, really.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:21.010
And this is Mugaritz.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.240
This is Andoni Aduriz in San
Sebastian, the third best

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.060
restaurant in the
world right now.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.720
And what was really special
about his staff meal is, a

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.840
year before, his kitchen had
been incinerated by a fire.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.480
And they had to close down for
almost an entire year.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.420
And so they had reopened just
a month or two before.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.590
And I asked about that first
staff meal, when they all came

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.520
back, because he also is known
for his staff meals.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.150
And he said, you know, it wasn't
anything elaborate,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.640
because we were still
under construction.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.200
But they just had a pot of tuna
stew in the middle of

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.320
this construction site.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.440
And chefs from around the
world, restaurants, had

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.770
absorbed his chefs while
they were waiting

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.310
to go back to Mugaritz.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:09.190
So all his chefs had returned
from around the world, and

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.310
they had this staff meal.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.550
And of course, he said it was
the best one he's ever had.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.310
But he takes staff meals so
seriously that he devotes an

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.530
entire station in his restaurant
only to staff meal

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.240
that two chefs are
always manning.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.050
And he has a nutritionist who
develops their staff meals,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:30.210
because he feels like it's not
just about having a great

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.650
meal; it's about getting
yourself through the

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.030
day as a busy chef.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.570
So it was very impressive.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.010
And other chefs that I talked to
about this, the nutrition--

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.500
and they were like, no way.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.430
But he takes it that
seriously.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:49.580
This is Ana Sortun at
Oleana in Cambridge.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.990
I'm from Minnesota originally,
so I had to cover a Minnesota

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.580
restaurant.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.630
So this is Piccolo
in Minneapolis.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.330
And again, Doug Flicker--

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.950
I expected Scandinavian
or German,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.290
and he served barbecue.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.670
And it was a lot of fun but
definitely unexpected to have

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.350
a big barbecue blowout
in Minnesota.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.370
And this is The Slanted Door.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.180
And this is actually at the
commissary, where Charles

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.890
prepares a lot of the food for
all the different restaurants.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.480
And his aunt, who he calls Mama,
actually she doesn't do

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.240
it as much anymore, but she
used to always prepare the

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.890
staff meal for all
the employees.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.850
And it was just an
incredible day.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.640
There were about 80 employees
there that

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.680
she was cooking for.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.200
And it was really amazing.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.290
And this is Stephane Reynaud,
who wrote a book that is one

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.300
of my favorites, called "Pork
and Sons." And this is him at

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.790
his restaurant in a
suburb near Paris.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.890
And he's one of my biggest
food heroes.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.400
He's one of the reasons I
went to culinary school.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.340
And so when I got the email
from Stephane that he was

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.370
going to do it, I was just--

00:19:59.370 --> 00:19:59.830
[GASPS].

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.940
And it was just an
incredible day.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.120
And this is Fergus Henderson
and his partner Trevor.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.310
And again, St. John in London
is known for their offal.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.070
And he served a completely
vegetarian meal.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.710
It was an Indian vegetarian
meal.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:21.270
It was incredible, but not
what we expected to have.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.760
But he didn't participate with
his staff in the meal.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.530
He ate his meal on the
side by the bar.

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.310
It was a slice of caraway bread
and a glass of Madiera.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.875
And we asked, do you always
eat by yourself?

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:39.000
And he's like, no, but sometimes
you just don't want

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.950
to do staff meal with
everyone there.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.480
Sometimes you just need a quiet
space in the corner.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.650
And so that was his solitary
staff meal.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.440
This is Ubuntu.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.060
It's actually closed
now, unfortunately.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.360
It's in Napa.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.970
And again, it's a vegetarian
restaurant, really incredible.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.310
But I covered them for
"Art Culinaire"

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.610
maybe two years before.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.200
And when I was leaving,
I saw a giant

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.015
pork loin on the counter.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.160
And I was like, what is that?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.240
It's obviously not going
into your menu.

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.860
And he's like, that's
our staff meal.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.810
We're such carnivores here.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.910
So for their staff meal, it's
usually a blowout meat fest.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.026
And then, at night, they're
serving vegetarian.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.310
And this is wd-50 in New York.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.070
And they, again, had--

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.100
just very, very avant-garde.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.020
And their staff meal was a
traditional French staff meal

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.710
that, again, you just never
expected to come from them.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.140
My friend Ben is at the
end of that picture.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.510
And he, again, is a chef I
worked with at Fat Duck.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.600
So it was really fun to kind of
integrate all these chefs I

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.020
had had these great staff
meals with in

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.980
England later on.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.315
And that's Michel Bras at his
restaurant in France.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.860
That's him and his
granddaughter.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.000
He has his grandkids come in
when they have school off.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.015
And what's really special about
their staff meal is he's

00:22:06.015 --> 00:22:08.540
got a slightly avant-garde
restaurant.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.440
But his mother used to run a
traditional French restaurant.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.120
And she has been making staff
meal for them for decades.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.170
She's in her '80s now.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.560
She's not doing it
every day again.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.160
But his staff has an incredible
staff meal, and

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.190
they eat it in the back.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.620
But he has this table in the
front of his kitchen.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.710
And his entire family comes.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.290
His son works with him.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.910
Their wives come, the grandkids
are there, the

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.840
mother comes.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.470
And he said, as a busy chef,
this is often your only time

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:42.220
to see your family.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.830
So it was really a real family
meal, which is something staff

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.100
meal is always called, just to
see his entire family there.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.900
And they come every single
day for the staff meal.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.200
And this is Ferran Adria.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.360
And I interviewed him
for another project.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:04.610
But the interview turned into
him talking about staff meals

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.910
for, like, two hours
with me, because he

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.470
feels it's so important.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.340
And so I asked him, I understand
you can't be in our

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.465
book, you have your own
book, but if you

00:23:14.465 --> 00:23:15.390
would do our foreword.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.370
And so he agreed.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.840
And that was a nice--

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.650
So I did a kind of
nontraditional book tour.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.360
I didn't really do a lot of
book signings in cookbook

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.110
stores or in bookstores.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.710
I revisited a lot of
the restaurants

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.800
that were in the book.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.820
And they served a staff meal to
a lot of journalists that

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.030
came so that people could
really get that

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.610
behind-the-scenes staff
meal experience.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.170
And it was a really, I think,
fun way to kind of break out

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.030
of that traditional bookstore
signing mold.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.450
And we just had a really
good time.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.510
And it was fun to return
to these restaurants.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.810
And so that's Elena
and Juan Mari.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:03.720
And it was exhausting, but
it was really rewarding.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.200
So that's staff meals.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.060
And I was going to go
into Iceland, a book

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:07.800
I'm working on now.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.156
But does anybody have any
questions about--

00:24:10.156 --> 00:24:11.450
AUDIENCE: When is this
usually happening?

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.010
Is it before they
open, or is it--

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.550
JODY EDDY: Yeah.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.460
Yeah, usually, if they do a
lunch service, then it happens

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.420
around 3 o'clock
during the day.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:24.060
And often there's somebody in
charge of creating the staff

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.850
meal throughout the day.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.080
So that's what they're
doing for the day.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.900
But it's not necessarily the
chefs that are preparing it.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.890
As a stage at The Fat Duck, I
had to prepare staff meals.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.090
And it's so nerve-wracking
when you're new to the

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.340
industry and you're cooking
for the-- it's much more

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.330
nerve-wracking than cooking
for customers, actually,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.130
because you're cooking
for your peers.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.580
But usually, around 3 o'clock.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.790
And like I said, a few
of them did do

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.190
after-hours staff meals.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.600
But that was rare.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:25:00.440
And if they don't have a chef on
task that's doing the staff

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.420
meal, it is often prepared,
because what staff meal is all

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.900
about is just using all
on your leftovers.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.220
So often, a chef has to just
to run into the walk-in and

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.460
find whatever is there on the
staff meal shelf-- there's

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.380
usually one devoted to it-- and
just grab the ingredients

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.810
and prepare it in 10 minutes,
which, again, is very

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:19.380
nerve-wracking.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.260
But it's a real test, too,
to who you are as a

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.936
cook and your talent.

00:25:24.936 --> 00:25:26.820
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing that
most chefs, when they're

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.530
preparing meals for their
customer base, they're

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.340
optimizing for taste and
they're optimizing for

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.570
presentation and all those
things that create an

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:33.865
experience.

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.010
JODY EDDY: Yes.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:35.780
AUDIENCE: What's
the difference?

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.240
What are they optimizing for
when they're talking about a

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.810
meal for a staff meal?

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.220
And in particular,
is it nutrition?

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.070
Does that actually
come into it?

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.290
JODY EDDY: Does--

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:43.680
I'm sorry?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.720
AUDIENCE: Nutrition, like the
longevity of, will this get me

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.340
through a shift?

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.060
JODY EDDY: Exactly.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.130
Yes, definitely.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.105
It's something I heard over and
over again from cooks that

00:25:52.105 --> 00:25:55.120
I interviewed who were
not the head chefs.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.900
They really preferred
light staff meals.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.060
They wanted something that
wouldn't then send them into

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.220
service just feeling like they
ate Thanksgiving dinner.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.140
So they really did focus on
that, using all the leftover

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.730
vegetables.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.660
But of course, you're using
your beet greens, not your

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.870
beets that are going
on the menu.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.500
But there was certainly
a focus on that-- not

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.930
necessarily to the extreme
that Mugaritz went.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.890
But you're also getting--
because of the plating issue,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.290
it's served usually
family style.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.050
And it's just giant platters.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.560
And we really emphasize, don't
plan this ahead of time.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.560
Just really make it organic.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.990
And really let it evolve
out of your leftovers.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.210
And we did go to a few staff
meals where the meals were

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.190
just so beautifully plated,
it was like

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.420
service for their customers.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.150
And I'm like, is this how
you really do this?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.360
And they're like, no, but you
here, you're photographing.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.860
We're like, no, no, no, we
really want the real thing.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.330
And then they're like,
oh, right.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.250
So then it all goes on
the family platter.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.250
And I think that really brings
everyone together, that

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.950
communal eating.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.450
But certainly very different
than what you're seeing in the

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.960
restaurants.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.880
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite
staff meal you've ever had?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.596
JODY EDDY: Oh, I never answer.

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:16.430
I have a few, but I try to
remain diplomatic on that one,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.070
just because I feel
these chefs really

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.320
put themselves out.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.370
I sound like I'm trying
to be diplomatic,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.385
but they were wonderful.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.430
I do, of course, prefer-- with
The Fat Duck and my connection

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.360
there, I think they always
have a little leg up.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.290
Because, certainly, often these
chefs are given maybe 10

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.860
minutes to make the
staff meal.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.210
And so a lot of them would say
that it's something throughout

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.450
the day, as they're doing their
mise en place, their

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.440
prep work, for service and
they're chopping off the tail

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.790
end of a vegetable
that's not going.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:59.420
Or often they're not serving the
chicken thighs, only the

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.120
chicken breasts.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.820
Or at the Bristol in Chicago,
they use whole chickens, but

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.380
then they have all these
leftover chicken feet.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.990
So they actually did a dish that
was all the chicken feet.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.310
And they said they're always
thinking about staff meal and

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.500
as all of these leftovers are
happening and they're trying

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.450
to maximize, what dish is going
to transpire out of

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.450
those ingredients
for staff meal.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.530
One thing that I also love about
staff meal is that a lot

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.030
of these recipes are coming from
their family favorites,

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.980
their beloved family recipes.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.070
What I saw at Fat Duck, we had
chefs there from all over the

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.640
world, and often you were
getting the chef from

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.110
Argentina, his favorite recipe
from his grandma.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.810
And then you'd have a chef
from Mexico cooking his

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:48.030
favorite family recipe.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:53.070
And I loved that exchange also
that happens between chefs

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.610
from around the world really
sharing what they're about,

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:57.880
because often that's not what
they're cooking in the

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.380
restaurant.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.140
So it's a great learning
experience and a nice way to

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.070
learn about cooking in other
parts of the world.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.910
AUDIENCE: I was just noticing
the geographic distribution of

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.430
restaurants that you chose.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.390
Did you have any idea of where
you wanted to go versus just

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.440
choosing really great
staff meals?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.355
JODY EDDY: No, we just wanted
really good staff meals.

00:29:21.355 --> 00:29:24.660
AUDIENCE: So did find a
concentration anywhere?

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.400
JODY EDDY: Well, a lot of
chefs you talk to-- like

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.520
Thomas Keller will attest to
this-- a lot of chefs who have

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.620
cooked in Europe, they talk
about the incredible

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.010
traditions of Italy and of
France in their restaurants.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.530
They have staff meals
often twice a day.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.100
And they're really amazing.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.450
So I wasn't necessarily looking
to France or looking

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.150
to Italy, but you certainly
heard that from chefs who had

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.380
worked in Europe, that it
was very impressive.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.120
And a lot of chefs, too, that I
interviewed that had worked

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.130
there said, when they came back
to their restaurants or

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.480
when they opened a restaurant or
when they had the idea for

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.250
the restaurant, they're like, I
have to serve an incredible

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.510
staff meal, because they were
seeing that in Europe.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.420
And they're really
known for it.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.980
MALE SPEAKER: Jody, thank you
very much for stopping by.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.670
We'll have some book
signing at the end.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.940
So thank you very much.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.190
JODY EDDY: Thanks for coming.
