00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:10.508
I'm Marissa Mayer, and I'm
really excited today to be

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:14.446

incredibly talented, the one

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.085
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: At Google,
we've seen Gaga build her

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.615
career by embracing technology,
including some

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.586
Google Tools, as well
as constantly

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:34.521
innovating for her fans.

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.385
And we're going to get a glimpse
behind the scenes to

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.591
see how some of that innovation
works today.

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:40.306
But first I'd like to
play a video to

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.806

to say before we begin,

00:03:03.985 --> 00:03:05.080
thank you so much.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.325
This is such an honor.

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:10.396
You know, when I was in high
school, all my girlfriends

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:12.260
wanted to get jobs here.

be what they were searching

for or putting on the -- you
know, the side column, what

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.136
comes up first. I believe that's
what my friend Mary

Last week, you opened up a
moderator page on your YouTube

questions here.

We'll go through those and
also go -- &gt;&gt;Lady Gaga:

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Branding.

00:04:57.023 --> 00:04:58.450
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So the first
question I'm going to ask, it

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.211
came in video form, but
it was also going

00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:01.630
to be my first question.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.313
It comes in from a user,
we'll go ahead and

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:08.133
roll that video question.

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:09.610
&gt;&gt;Video: Hi, Gaga.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.520
My first question that
I wanted to ask

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.615
was, how are you?

00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:16.263
I remember in one of your
interviews you said that was a

00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:19.038
question that interviewers never
really asked you and

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:21.013
actually meant it.

00:05:21.013 --> 00:05:24.403
And so I wanted to ask you
and actually mean it.

00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:25.773
So how are you?

00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:27.538
&gt;&gt;&gt; Awwwww.

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:32.845

00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:35.185
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Well, I am
absolutely wonderful and a

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:39.301
little bit choked up, because
that is why I am still here

00:05:39.302 --> 00:05:43.348
and why I work so hard, it's
because I really am very

00:05:43.348 --> 00:05:46.418
blessed to have fans with
such a beautiful spirit.

00:05:46.418 --> 00:05:49.880
And I'm sure you can see just
from that one video very much

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.543
what a lot of my day is like.

00:05:51.543 --> 00:05:56.593
I do spend a lot of time on
Google, looking for fan videos

00:05:56.593 --> 00:05:58.203
and messages.

00:05:58.203 --> 00:06:00.678
And I'm doing wonderful today.

00:06:00.678 --> 00:06:04.578
And I would say that the only
reason I ever mentioned that

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:07.731
people don't ask me how I am
genuinely is because it took a

00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:11.248
lot of bravery to get to
where we are today.

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:15.488
A lot of people see glasses
and shoulderpads and crazy

00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:19.413
outfits, and over the years,
it was very difficult to do

00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.930
interviews, because that's all
people would talk about.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.545
So I guess what I would say
is I'm doing wonderful now

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:29.396
because of how brave that --
all my fans have made me.

00:06:29.397 --> 00:06:32.538
So thank you for making me
brave, and I hope I can --

00:06:32.538 --> 00:06:36.135
thank you brave. Thank you.

about your tour.

00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:54.373
So Gagafame11 from the U.K.
asks, do you have any funny

00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.790
stories to tell about things
that have happened backstage

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.961
at the Monsterball?

00:06:58.962 --> 00:07:01.078
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: There are lots of
funny things that happened

00:07:01.078 --> 00:07:03.960
backstage at the Monsterball.

like surprises, and

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.958
I don't like pranks.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:14.233
I'm sure you can maybe tell that
just from -- but I don't

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:15.615
like pranks.

00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:19.118
But I actually, with me, have
brought all my friends from

00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:21.146
New York City on tour with me.

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:23.705
So I have had very
few, I should

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:26.116
say, famous acts opening.

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:29.558
It's been mostly really
underground bands and deejays

00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:31.991
that I've known his I
was 18 years old.

00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:35.151
So there's a lot of backstage
shenanigans.

00:07:35.152 --> 00:07:38.276
Very often they make jokes about
my diet, because they

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:41.158
know I have to stay fit for
music videos, so they'll leave

00:07:41.158 --> 00:07:44.901
mounds of cheese burgers and
stuff in my dressing room.

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:48.158
It's really awful.

00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:50.543

[ Laughter ]

00:07:53.825 --> 00:07:55.666
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So going back
to before the cheese burgers,

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:58.836
where you got your start, one
of your fans, MysticalMatty

00:07:58.837 --> 00:08:01.340
from California, asks, where
were you the first time you

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.575
heard one of your songs
on the radio?

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:06.935
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I was in Canada.

00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:08.900
[ Cheers ]

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.546
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And I'll
never forget it.

00:08:10.547 --> 00:08:13.736
But it's a very different --
it's funny, it's almost more

00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:16.685
enjoyable now when I hear it
for the first time on the

00:08:16.685 --> 00:08:21.573
radio, because at the time in
Canada, I had -- I mean, many

00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:23.871
people don't know this about me,
because it seems as though

00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:27.031
one just is at number one, it
was that big massive oh, she

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:29.050
became a star overnight.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.316
But to tell you the truth, I
had been working so hard,

00:08:32.317 --> 00:08:37.533
doing three shows a night, all
day long going to radio

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:42.853
stations, doing -- the reason
we're here at Google today is

00:08:42.853 --> 00:08:46.970
because the original campaign
for my music and my project

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:52.536
began with online media-based
advertisements.

00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:54.620
So that's really
where I began.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.136
So I remember I was in Canada,
and I was really tired, and I

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:03.251
was about to go on stage at this
outdoor performance -- I

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.350
actually think it was in
Winnipeg, which is where Maria

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.145
Aragon is from, from
the video.

00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:12.520
And I remember I heard it,
and I started crying.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.016
And my tour manager, David,
said, "How does it feel?" And

00:09:16.017 --> 00:09:20.986
I said, "It's about damn
time!" [ Laughter ]

00:09:20.987 --> 00:09:22.785
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So now when it
comes on, it's a little bit

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:25.108
more of a gracious,
humbling moment.

was the moment in your career
when you realized you were

00:09:36.378 --> 00:09:39.155
going to be an international
superstar?

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:44.016
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I still don't
feel like one.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.223
I really -- &gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer:
How is that possible?

00:09:46.223 --> 00:09:50.236
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I know that
sounds very silly.

00:09:50.237 --> 00:09:53.930
But even this morning, I was
getting ready to tweet that I

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.175
was coming here today, and
I got, like, 50 frigging

00:09:57.175 --> 00:09:59.766

to know.

worried for security.

But I need to market my
record, you know.

00:10:22.575 --> 00:10:24.085
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: -- where
I'm going to be.

00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:25.863
Everyone was saying, they know
we were going to be there,

00:10:25.863 --> 00:10:28.905
just don't tell them when.

00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:32.506
And, oh, my gosh, my security
is always -- they want to

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:36.328
shoot me, because I will
literally leave the house and

00:10:36.328 --> 00:10:38.511
go to the bodega down
the street where

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:39.850
I live in New York.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.210
And they're like, "Where are
you?" Because where I live, I

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.108
have been hustling for so long
that it's more just like,

00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:51.481
"You're home." Like, everybody's
so cool.

00:10:51.482 --> 00:10:54.880
And I guess even though my first
album was called "the

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.073
fame," that was never the
ultimate goal of any of this.

00:10:59.073 --> 00:11:03.583
It was always that I just really
am genuinely a musician

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:06.365
to my core, and a lot
of people don't

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.770
know that about me.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.730
But I write every lyric, every
Melody, I'm in there with the

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.690
producers, whipping them to make
the new future of music.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.635
And I -- that is why I'm here.

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:21.170
I'm not here to be
a superstar.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.110
But -- So, yes and no.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.270
I -- I never, ever -- there was
never a day when I woke up

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.675
and said, "I'm a superstar."
I'm still

00:11:31.675 --> 00:11:34.128
waiting for that to happen.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.858
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Fair enough.

00:11:35.858 --> 00:11:39.056
So in terms of formative
experiences, hugs and kisses,

XOXO94, from Pennsylvania, asks
-- &gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I love

[ Laughter ]

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.850
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: -- you said
that in school, a lot of

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.295
people bullied and you
didn't like you.

Now that you're famous, have any
of them, quote, unquote,

00:11:52.383 --> 00:11:54.310
tried to apologize and
become friends.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.116
If so, what did you
say to them?

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.965
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I wouldn't
say apologize.

00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:02.408
There's been lots of concert
ticket requests.

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:04.413
[ Laughter ]

00:12:04.413 --> 00:12:07.773
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And I think one
of the most awkward things

00:12:07.773 --> 00:12:11.358
that anyone ever said to me
was, "Well, my, my how the

00:12:11.358 --> 00:12:20.136
tables have turned." But to be
honest, I don't have that kind

00:12:20.137 --> 00:12:24.303
of vengeful spirit in myself,
and I never did.

00:12:24.303 --> 00:12:27.945
It was just more that, you know,
I say this with so much,

00:12:27.945 --> 00:12:32.371
you know, genuineness from my
heart, is that bullying really

00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:34.253
stays with you your
whole life.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.855
And it really, really
never goes away.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:40.221
And I know you're using words
like superstar, and most

00:12:40.222 --> 00:12:44.036
Googled and billions
of YouTube videos.

00:12:44.037 --> 00:12:46.758
But I was never the winner.

00:12:46.758 --> 00:12:48.625
I was always the loser.

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:51.501
And that still stays with me.

00:12:51.502 --> 00:12:55.875
And do I want to stick
it to anybody?

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.351
No.

00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:58.786
I just want to make music.

00:12:58.787 --> 00:13:08.386
So -- [ Applause ]

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.150
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: I do think --
I think bullying is a really

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.850
big issue right now, especially
because -- The

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.940
technology.

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I'm listening.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.790
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And so I
imagine -- I imagine that Born

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.640
This Way is a little bit about
being yourself and how to

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.055
overcome bullies.

00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:29.635
And I don't know if you want to
talk a little bit -- &gt;&gt;Lady

00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:31.466
Gaga: A little bit.

00:13:31.467 --> 00:13:33.468
Well, it was so funny when I
put that song out, because,

00:13:33.468 --> 00:13:36.928
everybody was like, "Oh, the
lyrics are so literal." And

00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:41.558
I'm like, "Yeah." [ Laughter ]

00:13:41.558 --> 00:13:44.491
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: When -- you know,
when you get bullied, you kind

00:13:44.492 --> 00:13:48.810
of try to -- there's almost
like this emotional poetry

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.251
that you go through in high
school, well, someday, and you

00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:55.788
just kind of try to hide from
it and be the bigger person.

00:13:55.788 --> 00:14:00.480
But Born This Way is about
saying, "This is who I am.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.888
This is who the fuck
I am." [ Cheers ]

00:14:04.888 --> 00:14:08.805
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And there's -- I
mean, the next single, is,

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.545
like, this very classic
Gaga record.

00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:16.640
But more importantly, the song
Born This Way is this, like,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.580
gateway drug for the album and
really trying to say in the

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.016
most literal and honest way that
I can that when I go to

00:14:25.017 --> 00:14:29.805
the Monsterball, I see something
so fearless and so

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:31.791
special in my fans.

00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:38.485
But I also see something afraid,
something that I was,

00:14:38.485 --> 00:14:41.463
something that was unsure.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:45.935
And I really encourage people to
look into the darkness and

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:48.765
look into places that you would
not normally look to

00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:51.951
find uniqueness and specialness,
because that's

00:14:51.952 --> 00:14:56.345
where the diamonds are hiding.

00:14:56.345 --> 00:14:58.276

a wonderful message.

actually are a very

jazz musician.

actually is about your --

training ongoing.

roll that video.

Portland, Oregon.

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:28.026
My question is, is I was
wondering if you still took

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.775
piano training and
vocal training to

00:15:29.775 --> 00:15:31.445
improve your skills.

you answer my question.

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I love my fans.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.433
Yes, I actually vocally rehearse
every single day.

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:55.860
I do a 30-minute warmup
every single day.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.120
It's been the same vocal warmup
that I've been doing

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.208
since I was 11 years old.

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:05.273
I have my mentor, Don Lawrence,
has been my voice

00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:08.658
teacher since I was 11, so
it's over ten years now.

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:13.490
And in terms of piano,
piano's funny.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.831
It's kind of the thing that
always stays with you.

00:16:15.832 --> 00:16:18.145
I don't know if there's any
pianists in this room.

00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:21.265
But if you don't practice for
a little while and then you

00:16:21.265 --> 00:16:22.965
focus on it, you kind
of get your

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.691
chops back pretty quickly.

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:29.136
So what I do mostly for piano is
I try to find time when I'm

00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:33.586
in New York City or on the road
to do shows and have jam

00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:36.771
sessions with my band
just for fun.

00:16:36.772 --> 00:16:40.550
So whenever you see those really
horrid photos of me

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:47.741
looking drunk at a piano bar,
I'm actually rehearsing.

00:16:47.742 --> 00:16:49.910
That's just how I like
to rehearse.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.926
I like to have a couple
martinis and

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:53.936
play some Cole Porter.

I like to learn.

up here.

to know, with all the clothes

you have, how do you decide
what to wear every day and

what happens to the garments
after they're worn?

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: How do I
decide what to wear.

00:18:21.963 --> 00:18:24.343
It's actually not quite as
complicated as some of you

00:18:24.343 --> 00:18:27.850
might imagine.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.886
I -- sometimes I -- I'll plan
months ahead for certain

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:36.468
things that I -- for example,
at the grammy's, the Hussein

00:18:36.468 --> 00:18:41.755
Chalayan vessel, although it's
become known as "the egg," he

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:47.260
wants me to remind you it's "the
vessel," that was -- that

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.808
took months and months
of conception.

00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:52.530
And I wanted to do a whole
performance or a piece that

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.728
began on the red carpet and
ended after the performance.

00:18:54.728 --> 00:18:57.248
So certain things
take a while.

00:18:57.248 --> 00:19:02.418
And, yes, I do view the vessel
as a fashion piece.

00:19:02.418 --> 00:19:06.836
But like today, I wore the same
black dress because I

00:19:06.837 --> 00:19:10.856
wanted the fans to recognize me
a certain way when I enter

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: It's funny, my
father, when I was a kid, he

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:57.086
used to try to change my hands
when I was little.

00:19:57.087 --> 00:19:58.845
And the doctor would be, like,
"She was born this way.

00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:02.250
You can't" -- you know.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.623
So I think maybe some of it,
just from a neurological

00:20:05.623 --> 00:20:08.860
standpoint, might be because
I'm creatively

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.208
driven by my left side.

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.430
Maybe that's why.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.786
But he's asked that I don't
get any more on the right

00:20:14.787 --> 00:20:16.488
side, for whatever reason.

00:20:16.488 --> 00:20:20.273
I -- I think he sees this as my,
like, Marilyn Monroe side

00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:24.558
and this as my Iggy Pop side.

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:27.161
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So beyond your
clothes and tattoos, you

00:20:27.162 --> 00:20:29.570
also show tremendous style
in your videos.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.893
And the strubydoo would like
to know, how do you come up

00:20:32.893 --> 00:20:34.236
with your video ideas?

00:20:34.237 --> 00:20:36.075
Every time I watch them, I'm
stunned by the creativity and

00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:38.273
meaning I love you, Lady Gaga,

00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:40.291
Strubydoo, your little monster.

00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:45.960
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: StrubyDoo.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.741
It's good, old faithful.

00:20:48.742 --> 00:20:52.370
I'm a creative person, and I
just always -- at some point,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.271
the idea comes to me.

00:20:54.272 --> 00:20:57.096
And the most important thing,
I think, with creativity is

00:20:57.097 --> 00:21:01.308
that you honor your creativity
and that you don't ever ignore

00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:08.525
it or go against what that
creative image is telling you

00:21:08.525 --> 00:21:12.058
because of what society
is projecting on you.

00:21:12.058 --> 00:21:14.436
I remember when I called Troy
Carter my manager, from

00:21:14.437 --> 00:21:17.061
Amsterdam, and I was, like,
"I want to be on a

00:21:17.062 --> 00:21:22.305
government-owned alien territory
in space, and I want

00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:27.466
to be giving birth to my
own head." [ Laughter ]

00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:28.531
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: I was going
to ask you about the

00:21:28.532 --> 00:21:29.925
kaleidoscope.

00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:35.210
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And you hear the
-- and he goes, like, why?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:40.131
And I said, "Because I see
myself and my fans and I feel

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:42.738
that they give birth to me and
I give birth to them, and the

00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:45.933
egg symbolized the race of the
future, which bears no

00:21:45.933 --> 00:21:50.220
prejudice." So I have my own
-- and I'm like -- then I'm

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.613
showing him Frances bacon
photos, which is, like, all

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:55.595
this bleeding imagery.

00:21:55.595 --> 00:22:01.028
And he was, like, "I don't get
it." With Nick Knight on a

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:04.163
video, if you think I'm bad,
Nick Knight is -- whoo, he is

00:22:04.163 --> 00:22:06.530
so smart, I'm like, "Nick,
I love you, but I don't

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:12.638
understand what you're saying."
But, I just really

00:22:12.638 --> 00:22:14.868
always -- like, just the other
night, last night, I was lying

00:22:14.868 --> 00:22:18.880
in bed and I had this idea for
an outfit, and I made myself

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.955
get up and sketched it
real fast and then I

00:22:20.955 --> 00:22:22.255
went back to sleep.

00:22:22.255 --> 00:22:25.845
I think it's when you
say, "I'm too tired.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.768
Let me just go to bed,"
that's when the

00:22:27.768 --> 00:22:29.883
creativity stops coming.

00:22:29.883 --> 00:22:34.046
If God calls you, pick
up the damn phone.

00:22:34.047 --> 00:22:35.693
Hello.

00:22:35.693 --> 00:22:40.193
I'm listening.

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:42.235
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So on the
topic of videos, you're

00:22:42.235 --> 00:22:44.168
obviously a huge YouTube star.

00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:48.913
I was going to ask, so from
Kentucky, what's your favorite

00:22:48.913 --> 00:22:51.585
YouTube video that
isn't yours?

00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:56.928
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: My favorite YouTube
video that -- it's so

00:22:56.928 --> 00:22:59.465
embarrassing but I love it.

00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:04.095
I love the boy that when he
comes home from the dentist.

00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:10.363
[ Laughter ]

00:23:10.363 --> 00:23:12.833
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I can't -- because
I always -- whenever

00:23:12.833 --> 00:23:16.061
I'm really tired before
a show, I always go,

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:19.668
is this real live?

00:23:19.668 --> 00:23:24.073
Because I'll have been up for,
like, 30 hours straight doing

00:23:24.073 --> 00:23:27.741
interviews, and then I'll
hear the, you know,

00:23:27.742 --> 00:23:31.236
da, da, da, da, da.

00:23:31.237 --> 00:23:32.463
And the show starts.

00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:34.706
And I just go, is
this real life?

00:23:34.707 --> 00:23:36.316
And everybody goes, it is.

00:23:36.317 --> 00:23:37.976
You have to go on stage.

00:23:37.977 --> 00:23:39.143
I love that video.

00:23:39.143 --> 00:23:41.206
That poor boy.

00:23:41.207 --> 00:23:43.033
[ Laughter ]

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:44.856
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: There's also
so many fan remixes and

00:23:44.857 --> 00:23:47.071
remakes of your songs
on YouTube.

00:23:47.072 --> 00:23:48.788
I was wondering if you have
a favorite there.

00:23:48.788 --> 00:23:51.093
I know there's Maria, the young
girl, who I think really

00:23:51.093 --> 00:23:55.203
embodies a lot of what is
interesting about technology.

00:23:55.203 --> 00:23:57.998
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Maria is
just so special.

00:23:57.998 --> 00:24:02.243
And, you know, she's, like, ten
-- she's ten years old.

00:24:02.243 --> 00:24:05.960
But even ten-year-olds today
know how to work a webcam and

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.463
upload a YouTube video.

00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:13.796
And I think that's -- that is
why this -- for myself, my

00:24:13.797 --> 00:24:17.976
campaign with my album has been
so successful, is because

00:24:17.977 --> 00:24:22.125
I, too, am a child of
the dot com era.

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:25.220
Me and my father ran an Internet
company when I was

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.855
really young, so I was
listening to lots of

00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:33.896
technology talk, jargon, over
the dinner table, not

00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:37.006
understanding until much later
what it all meant.

00:24:37.007 --> 00:24:40.675
But she's beautiful.

00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:43.380
She's very young, and she has
a voice in the world.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.611
And she latched onto a song that
was very risky for me to

00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:52.233
put out so soon in my career.

00:24:52.233 --> 00:24:56.303
But if I could just touch maybe
ten ten-year-olds in the

00:24:56.303 --> 00:24:59.146
world in every single continent,
maybe I could make

00:24:59.147 --> 00:25:00.361
a difference.

00:25:00.362 --> 00:25:05.611
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Do we
have the Maria video?

00:25:05.612 --> 00:25:15.296
[ Video. ]

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:20.338
&gt;&gt;&gt; My mama told me when I was
young, we are all born

00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:23.795
superstars.

00:25:23.795 --> 00:25:27.836
She rolled my hair and
put my lipstick on.

00:25:27.837 --> 00:25:33.238
In the glass of her boudoir.

00:25:33.238 --> 00:25:37.646
There's nothing wrong with
loving who you are, she said,

00:25:37.647 --> 00:25:42.536
'cause he made you
perfect, Babe.

00:25:42.537 --> 00:25:46.918
So hold your head up,
and you'll go far.

00:25:46.918 --> 00:25:53.335
Listen to me when I say: I'm
beautiful in my way. 'Cause

00:25:53.335 --> 00:25:55.680
God makes no mistakes.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.830
I'm on the right track, baby.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.201
I was Born This Way.

00:26:00.202 --> 00:26:02.595
Don't hide yourself in regret.

00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:04.880
Just love yourself.
(Video ends).

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.275
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:26:11.275 --> 00:26:13.271
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: She's
just so amazing.

00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:17.698
You know, and that's -- it's
so -- What I would like to

00:26:17.698 --> 00:26:22.310
speak about is the way that
we experience music now.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.605
We experience the music through
the Internet, but it

00:26:24.605 --> 00:26:28.080
has really great effects
and also has

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.746
really negative effects.

00:26:29.747 --> 00:26:32.608
The great effect is Maria.

00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:36.770
The negative effect is you sort
of quite mathematically

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:41.631
input your songs and your soul
into a computer, and out spits

00:26:41.632 --> 00:26:45.868
out charts (indicating).

00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:48.583
[ Laughter ]

00:26:48.583 --> 00:26:53.028
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So my -- the fan
experience now, digitally, is

00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:56.121
they buy the song, and then they
get into chat rooms and

00:26:56.122 --> 00:26:59.171
they watch the song
climb the chart.

00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:02.268
But somebody like Maria
has no pretension.

00:27:02.268 --> 00:27:05.306
She's wildly innocent and
beautiful, and she only cares

00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:07.803
about the music and
the lyrics.

00:27:07.803 --> 00:27:11.231
So what I'm working on doing
now is creating a fan

00:27:11.232 --> 00:27:14.441
experience with the release of
Born This Way that takes them

00:27:14.442 --> 00:27:17.765
a bit away from the computer
in terms of the actual

00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:20.010
purchase of the song.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.825
I want to encourage the fans
to experience the music and

00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:28.445
the lyrics removed
of that sort of

00:27:28.445 --> 00:27:35.510
behind-the-computer banter.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.823
When I was a kid, I was standing
outside of HMV,

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.795
praying that I saw Billy Joel's

00:27:41.795 --> 00:27:47.358
fingernail in the window.

00:27:47.358 --> 00:27:50.600
I was hoping that I would
see Thom Yorke when

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.165
Radiohead came in.

00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:55.825
You know, that is what I want
to recreate for my fans.

00:27:55.825 --> 00:27:58.173
We've done it with the
Monsterball, and now I want to

00:27:58.173 --> 00:28:02.366
do it with album retail.

00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:03.738
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: You've also
shown a lot of things from

00:28:03.738 --> 00:28:05.038
behind the scenes.

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:07.048
So you had Gaga Vision
on YouTube.

00:28:07.048 --> 00:28:10.326
And Gaga info from Twitter would
like to know, please,

00:28:10.327 --> 00:28:11.936
could you bring back
Gaga Vision.

00:28:11.937 --> 00:28:13.113
We miss it so much.

00:28:13.113 --> 00:28:13.881
PS.

00:28:13.882 --> 00:28:16.258
We love you and we're
so proud.

00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:17.941
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I love
Gaga Vision.

00:28:17.942 --> 00:28:19.755
That was the -- they were these
little films that I was

00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:24.516
doing back when I first
began touring.

00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:29.140
But I actually just got so
busy that it was really

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.968
difficult to have a
camera in my face.

00:28:30.968 --> 00:28:33.725
You will never see me do
reality television.

00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:36.053
It will never --
don't even ask.

00:28:36.053 --> 00:28:39.161
It will never happen.

00:28:39.162 --> 00:28:40.536
[ Applause ]

00:28:40.537 --> 00:28:41.975
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: It will
never happen.

00:28:41.975 --> 00:28:43.956
It's just -- I'm not that
kind of person.

00:28:43.957 --> 00:28:47.705
My whole life is a performance
piece.

00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:51.113
So I don't need to have my
picture taken to feel that I'm

00:28:51.113 --> 00:28:54.165
in a moment of art.

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:59.000
So -- But the good news is, as
I'm planning the Born This Way

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.865
Ball, I have been speaking to
Terry Richardson, who's this

00:29:02.865 --> 00:29:04.546
amazing photographer.

00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:08.668
He wanted to film some of the
making of process of what

00:29:08.668 --> 00:29:09.850
we're doing.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:14.555
So I'm hoping we can resurrect
the Gaga Vision videos for the

00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:18.875
creation of the new tour so
you guys can creatively be

00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:23.041
more connected to how
I make things.

00:29:23.042 --> 00:29:24.725
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: That'd
be great.

00:29:24.725 --> 00:29:29.136
[ Applause ]

00:29:29.137 --> 00:29:30.661
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So since we're
at Google, this question

00:29:30.662 --> 00:29:32.221
is apropos.

00:29:32.222 --> 00:29:34.526
TheeJuann from Chicago,
Illinois, asked, have you ever

00:29:34.527 --> 00:29:37.475
Googled yourself just
to see what came up?

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.685
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Yes, of course
I have. [ Laughter ]

00:29:39.685 --> 00:29:41.903
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: When
was the last time?

00:29:41.903 --> 00:29:46.716
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: The last time,
probably -- well, last night,

00:29:46.717 --> 00:29:49.541
I wanted to know if people knew
that I was going to be

00:29:49.542 --> 00:29:54.820
here, because everybody was
telling me not to tweet.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.768
So I Googled, and I didn't see
enough come up, so I said,

00:29:57.768 --> 00:29:59.551
well, I'm tweeting, so....

00:29:59.552 --> 00:30:01.425
[ Laughter ]

00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:02.966
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: That
solved that problem.

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:06.041
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So there.

00:30:06.042 --> 00:30:09.748
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Well, 443
million hits on Google for

00:30:09.748 --> 00:30:11.701
Lady Gaga, which basically means
you don't have very much

00:30:11.702 --> 00:30:13.541
anonymity left at all.

00:30:13.542 --> 00:30:17.778
And I guess from Colorado, asks,
are there ever moments

00:30:17.778 --> 00:30:22.741
the paparazzi doesn't
recognize you?

00:30:22.742 --> 00:30:25.510
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I have to be really
honest. People that say

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:32.033
that they can't escape the
paparazzi are full of shit.

00:30:32.033 --> 00:30:36.801
So let me just be the artist
who -- to throw everybody

00:30:36.802 --> 00:30:39.173
under the bus.

00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:42.753
And my head of security is
standing over there nodding.

00:30:42.753 --> 00:30:45.753
I don't spend money on houses
and lots of cars, but I do

00:30:45.753 --> 00:30:49.358
spend money on security,
and they never find me.

00:30:49.358 --> 00:30:54.288
So, no, it doesn't run my life,
because getting my photo

00:30:54.288 --> 00:30:57.803
taken is not what makes me
feel like an artist; it's

00:30:57.803 --> 00:31:02.403
being in front of 50,000 fans
screaming, "I was born this

00:31:02.403 --> 00:31:05.436
way, baby." That's
why I'm here.

[ Applause ]

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.355

another video question, from

peachdog1224.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.345
These names are great.

&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Peachdog?

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.663
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Peachdog, who
wants to know a little bit

00:31:20.663 --> 00:31:22.803
about regrets.

00:31:22.803 --> 00:31:25.308
&gt;&gt;Video: Hey, mother monster,
my name is Matt.

00:31:25.308 --> 00:31:28.956
And my question for you is that
in the song Born This Way

00:31:28.957 --> 00:31:32.405
that you recently released,
which is awesome, you have the

00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:35.348
lyrics that "Don't hide yourself
in regret." I was

00:31:35.348 --> 00:31:38.093
wondering if you have ever
regretted anything or if there

00:31:38.093 --> 00:31:39.748
was something in your life that
you'd ever want to change

00:31:39.748 --> 00:31:42.318
in the past. Thank you for
looking at my question.

00:31:42.318 --> 00:31:43.308
I really love you.

00:31:43.308 --> 00:31:44.810
Thank you for making music.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:49.716
Bye.

00:31:49.717 --> 00:31:55.140
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Is there anything
that I regret from my past.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.515
Well, I'll begin with the lyric,
and I will say, "Don't

00:31:57.515 --> 00:32:00.736
hide yourself in regret"
is don't perpetuate

00:32:00.737 --> 00:32:02.546
negativity in your life.

00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:05.173
Don't obsess about the things
that you didn't do or the

00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:09.403
things that you may have not
done your best. Obsess about

00:32:09.403 --> 00:32:10.870
the future.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.185
Obsess about today.

00:32:12.185 --> 00:32:17.266
Think endlessly about how you
can pull the inner queen -- or

00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:24.233
king -- out of yourself, and
let that superstar shine.

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:27.106
I don't believe that fame is
something that is obtainable.

00:32:27.107 --> 00:32:29.923
I believe that it's --
it's inside of you.

00:32:29.923 --> 00:32:31.560
It's not something that
you can touch.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.785
It's not tangible.

00:32:32.785 --> 00:32:35.311
Which is why when I speak
about the paparazzi and

00:32:35.312 --> 00:32:38.395
things, it's very meaningless
to me.

00:32:38.395 --> 00:32:40.456
There are days when
I wake up, and I

00:32:40.457 --> 00:32:43.256
don't feel like a superstar.

00:32:43.257 --> 00:32:47.190
And it's those regrets, you say
did you ever wake up and

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.350
feel like a superstar.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.695
The answer is no.

00:32:50.695 --> 00:32:54.191
The regret of some days
waking up and not

00:32:54.192 --> 00:32:56.130
feeling brave enough.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.018
Those are the regrets I have.
Because I have so many things

00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:01.908
to be grateful for, so many
fans looking up to me.

00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:03.741
And the days when
I feel insecure,

00:33:03.742 --> 00:33:05.563
those are my regrets.

00:33:05.563 --> 00:33:07.765
I want to always be secure and
strong for you, because look

00:33:07.765 --> 00:33:09.430
at how sweet they are.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:13.255
They're so -- so genuine, and
they're listening to the

00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:14.748
lyrics, you know.

00:33:14.748 --> 00:33:17.763
And so I guess what I would say
is don't -- don't obsess

00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:19.680
over what you've done wrong.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.806

the answer and be the best you

00:33:22.807 --> 00:33:26.256
that you can be in the future.

advice you've ever received?

piece of

advice I've ever received.

00:33:46.637 --> 00:33:51.368
It is, if you don't have any
shadows, you're not standing

00:33:51.368 --> 00:33:56.198
in the light.

myself every day, every single

day, I say that.

00:34:04.627 --> 00:34:06.846
Because I'm not a squeaky-clean
person, you

00:34:06.847 --> 00:34:11.761
know, so there's nothing about
my music or the Monsterball or

00:34:11.762 --> 00:34:14.918
my fans that -- we're
not squeaky-clean.

00:34:14.918 --> 00:34:16.786
You know, and people always
say to me, "Who's the real

00:34:16.787 --> 00:34:20.108
you?" when, in reality, I'm
pretty much an open

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:23.916
book about my life.

00:34:23.917 --> 00:34:26.233
What you're asking me
about is magic.

00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:30.328
And if you are magical, you
always have shadows.

00:34:30.328 --> 00:34:35.028
If you're in the light, you
must cast a shadow.

talk a little bit

00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:37.233
about the new album.

about the new album.

here on video.

00:34:54.415 --> 00:34:56.574
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Gaga, if you could
describe the Born This Way

00:34:56.575 --> 00:35:00.083
album in just three words,
what would they be?

00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:04.906
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: In three words.

00:35:04.907 --> 00:35:09.071
See how smart my fans are?

00:35:09.072 --> 00:35:22.681
I would call it -- I would use a
-- It is one word, I suppose

00:35:22.682 --> 00:35:25.001
that avant-garde is one word.

00:35:25.002 --> 00:35:31.195
But I would call it avant-garde
technorock.

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:35.520
It's a lot of -- there's a lot
of rock influences on the

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.455
album, but not in a --
this is a rock music

00:35:39.455 --> 00:35:41.378
record kind of way.

00:35:41.378 --> 00:35:45.913
It actually is quite steadfast
in that it is an exploration

00:35:45.913 --> 00:35:50.021
in electronic music and
in technosonics.

00:35:50.022 --> 00:35:56.695
But I have sort of created a
genre of metal dance techno

00:35:56.695 --> 00:36:02.580
pop music with a lot of rock
anthemic choruses, because

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.971
that is the music that I love.

00:36:03.972 --> 00:36:09.213
I'm actually really obsessed
with Bruce Springstein.

00:36:09.213 --> 00:36:12.238
My father used to play Bruce
Springstein records for me all

00:36:12.238 --> 00:36:14.958
the time when he was
a kid, and he

00:36:14.958 --> 00:36:19.400
was, blue collar America.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:24.353
And in a way, I guess I related
to Bruce because I

00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:28.873
watched my father, a blue
collar American citizen,

00:36:28.873 --> 00:36:30.210
relate to Bruce.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:35.135
And I think that in a social
way, my fans feel blue collar.

00:36:35.135 --> 00:36:38.545
They feel like they're the
underdogs that will someday be

00:36:38.545 --> 00:36:40.143
the winners.

00:36:40.143 --> 00:36:43.893
And I took the influence of
Bruce on my father in my life

00:36:43.893 --> 00:36:45.930
to create this album.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:50.603
And, yeah, lots of really big,
almost, like, big Def

00:36:50.603 --> 00:36:54.055
Leopard-style melodies
in the choruses.

00:36:54.055 --> 00:36:56.310
But it's electronic
dance music.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.623
It's very hard, very edgy.

00:36:59.623 --> 00:37:04.800
And I'm very excited
for you to hear it.

[ Applause ]

00:37:09.262 --> 00:37:10.575
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: One of the
things that you face as an

00:37:10.575 --> 00:37:11.916
artist is censorship.

00:37:11.917 --> 00:37:15.576
So from Colorado is asked, how
do you feel about Malaysian

00:37:15.577 --> 00:37:18.320
radio stations editing out your
imperative "no matter

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.208
gay, straight, or bi, lesbian,
transgendered life" line for

00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:25.031
Born This Way.

00:37:25.032 --> 00:37:27.255
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Obviously,
I disagree with it.

00:37:27.255 --> 00:37:31.215
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
specifically put those words

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:37.091
in a song that I knew would
be put on top 40 radio.

00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:39.943
What I would say is, for all
of the young people in

00:37:39.943 --> 00:37:43.803
Malaysian that want those words
to be played on the

00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:48.693
radio, it is your job and it is
your duty as young people

00:37:48.693 --> 00:37:50.940
to have your voices heard.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.428
You must do everything that
you can if you want to be

00:37:54.428 --> 00:37:56.973
liberated by your society.

00:37:56.973 --> 00:37:59.851
You must call, you must not
stop, you must protest

00:37:59.852 --> 00:38:01.566
peacefully.

00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:03.068
No -- I don't believe
in violence.

00:38:03.068 --> 00:38:04.631
I don't believe in negativity.

00:38:04.632 --> 00:38:07.146
There's no reason to
be derogatory.

00:38:07.147 --> 00:38:10.618
You just have to keep fighting
for what you believe in.

00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:13.900
And to be quite honest, honesty
and the truth is

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.370
always what will set you free.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.698
I can't tell you how many times
I get phone calls from

00:38:17.698 --> 00:38:22.271
TV stations, and Troy will call
me and he'll say, "They

00:38:22.272 --> 00:38:25.685
want you to edit out this
section of the video." And I

00:38:25.685 --> 00:38:28.288
say, "Well, just tell them I
won't do it, and if they don't

00:38:28.288 --> 00:38:32.221
want to play it, they don't
have to." That's it.

[ Applause ]

00:38:35.267 --> 00:38:39.843

artist is constantly molding

00:38:39.843 --> 00:38:43.278
ourselves and changing and
bridging -- abridging what we

00:38:43.278 --> 00:38:46.636
do for the machine,
then the artist

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:48.491
becomes part of the machine.

of the machine.

to be part of me.

The next question
-- [ Applause ]

00:39:00.282 --> 00:39:01.458

question is actually a

00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:03.531
composite and we'll open up to
Googler questions if you want

00:39:03.532 --> 00:39:05.270
to move to the microphones
in just a minute.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.313
A composite.

00:39:07.313 --> 00:39:10.728
There were 643 fan questions
asked about the next single

00:39:10.728 --> 00:39:13.446
that comes off of Born
This Way, Judas.

00:39:13.447 --> 00:39:15.556
And so I'm wondering if you can
tell us a little bit about

00:39:15.557 --> 00:39:19.560
the inspiration for it, the
video you have planned.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.630
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I'm very excited.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:26.571
Actually, I can exclusively
reveal here at Google that I

00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:30.638
will be making my directorial
debut with Laurieann Gibson,

00:39:30.638 --> 00:39:40.553
directing this video
with her ourselves.

00:39:40.553 --> 00:39:45.743
It's no surprise to many of you
that Judas is a man of the

00:39:45.743 --> 00:39:48.695
Biblical senses.

00:39:48.695 --> 00:39:53.856
So expect to see some symbolism
in this video.

00:39:53.857 --> 00:39:58.353
But the song is about -- some of
the words in the song I can

00:39:58.353 --> 00:40:02.935
reveal here are, "When he
comes to me, I am ready.

00:40:02.935 --> 00:40:05.980
I'll wash his feet with
my hair if he needs.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.868
Forgive him when his tongue lies
through his brain, even

00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:12.926
after three times
he betrays me.

00:40:12.927 --> 00:40:19.208
I'll bring him down, a king with
no crown." So the song is

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.998
about honoring your darkness
in order to bring yourself

00:40:21.998 --> 00:40:23.881
into the light.

00:40:23.882 --> 00:40:26.216
That's kind of what I just
mentioned to about if you're

00:40:26.217 --> 00:40:29.058
standing in the light,
you cast a shadow.

00:40:29.058 --> 00:40:32.775
I have been haunted by my past
for a very long time.

00:40:32.775 --> 00:40:35.960
And, actually, that's a
recurring theme on the album.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.493
It has a lot to do with identity
and being able to be

00:40:39.493 --> 00:40:41.591
proud and say I was
born this way.

00:40:41.592 --> 00:40:45.960
But I was haunted by being able
to go back to New York,

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.098
being able to go back to my
past, being able to understand

00:40:49.098 --> 00:40:52.056
why I made certain decisions,
that instead of regretting

00:40:52.057 --> 00:40:54.838
them, I chose to embrace
and understand why

00:40:54.838 --> 00:40:56.313
I made those choices.

00:40:56.313 --> 00:41:00.968
And what the song Judas is about
is, you have to look

00:41:00.968 --> 00:41:03.625
into what's haunting you and you
need to learn to forgive

00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:07.440
yourself in order to move on.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.220
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We all
look forward to it.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.161
[ Applause ]

00:41:12.162 --> 00:41:14.726
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And it's really
fun to dance to.

00:41:14.727 --> 00:41:17.320
And it -- and it sounds
like it could be a --

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.705
a pop priest record.

00:41:20.705 --> 00:41:22.401
It's really fun.

00:41:22.402 --> 00:41:23.416
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We'll go ahead
and take some questions

00:41:23.417 --> 00:41:24.755
from the audience.

00:41:24.755 --> 00:41:25.680
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.255
So I understand the fame brought
you a lot of great

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:29.325
things, like your monsters
and everything that's

00:41:29.325 --> 00:41:30.781
happening to you.

00:41:30.782 --> 00:41:32.951
But is there something that the
fame brought you that you

00:41:32.952 --> 00:41:36.735
could do without?

00:41:36.735 --> 00:41:38.696
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: That I
could do without.

00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:40.576
I don't know.

00:41:40.577 --> 00:41:41.400
No.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.425
I would say no.

00:41:42.425 --> 00:41:45.260
I don't want to focus on
anything negative like that.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.203
It's -- there's always --
whether you're famous or

00:41:48.203 --> 00:41:49.835
you're not, there's always
things in your life that you

00:41:49.835 --> 00:41:51.000
could do without.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.325
So I don't think anything is
particularly fame-related.

00:41:54.325 --> 00:41:56.618
I've got a really good family.

00:41:56.618 --> 00:41:59.985
And if anything, I'm grateful,
because my family and I

00:41:59.985 --> 00:42:03.100
wrestled fame to the ground, and
we're stronger than ever.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.235
So no.

00:42:06.235 --> 00:42:09.153
[ Applause ]

00:42:09.153 --> 00:42:09.805
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi, Lady Gaga.

00:42:09.805 --> 00:42:11.295
Thanks so much for coming.

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:13.470
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: You look so cute.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.845
&gt;&gt;&gt; A little background
on this.

00:42:14.845 --> 00:42:18.143
I took the inspiration from
the Kermit the frog one.

00:42:18.143 --> 00:42:19.618
But you can't tell.

00:42:19.618 --> 00:42:20.748
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: That
was so funny.

00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:21.890
&gt;&gt;&gt; I added a little bit
of myself in it.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.241
Bunnies for Easter.

00:42:23.242 --> 00:42:26.050
I thought it would be
a hop-in attire.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.011
You like that?

00:42:29.012 --> 00:42:30.341
I liked it, too.

00:42:30.342 --> 00:42:32.345
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: That's funny.

00:42:32.345 --> 00:42:33.245
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:42:33.245 --> 00:42:34.188
What was that?

00:42:34.188 --> 00:42:35.758
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: That's funny.

00:42:35.758 --> 00:42:39.675
&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought I had to dress up
because I definitely wanted

00:42:39.675 --> 00:42:42.311
to speak to you and give
you a hug or whatever.

00:42:42.312 --> 00:42:45.803
But I think Google as a whole,
and YouTube and the world is

00:42:45.803 --> 00:42:49.275
very excited for you to come
here and be so candid.

00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:52.310
So on that note, I'm at this
point really curious, when

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.620
you're not in the spotlight,
when you're home, you know, in

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.213
New York with your family, what
are some of the things

00:42:59.213 --> 00:43:00.908
you enjoy doing?

00:43:00.908 --> 00:43:02.391
What do you wear?

00:43:02.392 --> 00:43:04.146
What do your pajamas
look like?

00:43:04.147 --> 00:43:07.620
[ Laughter ]

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.348
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Well,
I'm actually --

00:43:11.348 --> 00:43:13.976
I'm very into yoga.

00:43:13.977 --> 00:43:17.500
So I do a lot of that really --
I saw the yoga rooms here.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.836
And -- at Google.

00:43:19.837 --> 00:43:22.570
I was, like, inching my way.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:26.405
But I'm actually really into
the crazy hot yoga in

00:43:26.405 --> 00:43:32.871
100-degree rooms. It's the only
thing that I can, I feel,

00:43:32.872 --> 00:43:36.850
can be really bad at
and nobody knows.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.063
So I sort of take comfort
in the journey of

00:43:39.063 --> 00:43:40.750
becoming good at yoga.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:47.095
Because if I suck one day,
nobody sees it, it's just me.

00:43:47.095 --> 00:43:50.711
I guess that's the thing about
fame that is difficult.

00:43:50.712 --> 00:43:57.750
Is, if you screw up, Google
-- [ Laughter ]

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.300
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: -- is there.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.746
So I love yoga.

00:44:01.747 --> 00:44:04.311
I love cooking.

00:44:04.312 --> 00:44:06.656
I'm a really good cook,
actually, which maybe some of

00:44:06.657 --> 00:44:08.483
you may not know about me.

00:44:08.483 --> 00:44:10.470
I love spending time
with my mom.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.851
I love getting really drunk with
my friends at the same

00:44:12.852 --> 00:44:15.346
bars that we used to go to, and

00:44:15.347 --> 00:44:19.771
listening to AC/DC records.

00:44:19.772 --> 00:44:23.293
And what else do I --
what do I wear?

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:26.015
I mean, to tell you the truth,
it's very funny, because my

00:44:26.015 --> 00:44:31.983
father quite often is like,
"Can't you just put on this?"

00:44:31.983 --> 00:44:37.373
But have you been to any of my
shows, out of curiosity?

00:44:37.373 --> 00:44:38.630
&gt;&gt;&gt; No, not yet.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.111
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: You haven't yet.

00:44:40.112 --> 00:44:44.116
I would say anybody who's seen
me live would tell that you

00:44:44.117 --> 00:44:46.730
whether I'm dressed like
this or wearing a tee

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.916
shirt, I look the same.

00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:51.416
And I know that that
might sound silly.

00:44:51.417 --> 00:44:56.330
But it's not this that you are
responding to anymore.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.758
And I keep talking about this,
because my fans are actually

00:44:59.758 --> 00:45:03.803
quite blind to my clothes now,
because they're so used to it

00:45:03.803 --> 00:45:06.196
that they don't see
it anymore.

00:45:06.197 --> 00:45:08.028
They just see me.

00:45:08.028 --> 00:45:10.365
And I'm excited about that,
because I think with this new

00:45:10.365 --> 00:45:15.743
album, people will wonder less
and less what I look like when

00:45:15.743 --> 00:45:17.365
I'm brushing my teeth.

00:45:17.365 --> 00:45:19.740
But the truth is, I look exactly
like I look right now.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:23.040
I just, you know, probably have
a Mötley Crüe tee shirt

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.785
on, and there's a really
good-looking guy in my bed.

darted out of the room.

Internet sensation.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.513
And it's this 13-year-old girl
who made a video and now it's

00:46:43.513 --> 00:46:46.436
online and everyone's making
fun of it and just kind of

00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:49.083
criticizing it as really
cheesy, which it is.

I'm curious about your

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.348
reaction to YouTube as a forum
for new artists and for some

of the criticism that
maybe young people

there's the Justin Biebers who

&gt;&gt;&gt; My serious question, though,
is, we talk about Gaga

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.383
this and Gaga that and the fame
and The Fame Monster.

00:48:18.383 --> 00:48:20.500
But what about Stefani?

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:23.415
How do you stay Stefani through
-- &gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I love

00:48:23.415 --> 00:48:25.711
this question.

00:48:25.712 --> 00:48:29.438
Who are you looking for?

00:48:29.438 --> 00:48:31.908
I'm right here.

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:34.655
Stefani is also who I am.

00:48:34.655 --> 00:48:36.558
Gaga's just my nickname.

00:48:36.558 --> 00:48:40.358
It's like when you're a kid and
your mom calls you "skip,"

00:48:40.358 --> 00:48:47.566
or -- instead of calling you,
you know, Johnny, she calls

00:48:47.567 --> 00:48:51.256
you Jonathan when you're bad.

00:48:51.257 --> 00:48:52.631
It's the same thing for me.

00:48:52.632 --> 00:48:58.250
It's just -- it was a way for me
to release so many years of

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.828
being told "no" by
this business.

00:49:00.828 --> 00:49:05.588
And it's actually funny, because
I didn't -- I didn't

00:49:05.588 --> 00:49:10.158
shop around to record labels
until I was calling myself

00:49:10.158 --> 00:49:12.801
Gaga, until people in New York
knew me as Lady Gaga.

00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:20.368
But in high school and making
music and choir and being cast

00:49:20.368 --> 00:49:23.158
in the boys' play and all the
girls hated me because I

00:49:23.158 --> 00:49:28.493
always got the lead -- they
hated me for that, because it

00:49:28.493 --> 00:49:30.836
was at the boys' school, so if
you got the lead, you were

00:49:30.837 --> 00:49:33.501
always at the boys' school
after school.

00:49:33.502 --> 00:49:36.108
[ Laughter ]

00:49:36.108 --> 00:49:38.378
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So I guess what
I'm trying to say is, is I

00:49:38.378 --> 00:49:41.780
really make absolutely
no separation

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.963
between Stefani and Gaga.

00:49:43.963 --> 00:49:45.798
It is the absolute
same person.

00:49:45.798 --> 00:49:50.950
It's just it was a way for me in
my life -- and it's a gift

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.116
I wish I could give to anyone,
if you went through hard times

00:49:54.117 --> 00:49:57.573
when you were a kid or when you
were in college, or maybe

00:49:57.573 --> 00:50:00.753
you had a job that really -- you
know, they fired you and

00:50:00.753 --> 00:50:03.446
you were -- you were, you know,
poor for two years and

00:50:03.447 --> 00:50:06.485
then you got -- I wish I could
give that gift to anyone of

00:50:06.485 --> 00:50:10.800
being able to say I rebuke all
of that negativity, and I am

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.895
now a new person, and I'm going
to be the queen I know

00:50:14.895 --> 00:50:16.513
that I can be.

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:19.200
And that's really
all that it is.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.226
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:50:22.155 --> 00:50:23.383
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know you have a
meticulously planned wardrobe,

00:50:23.383 --> 00:50:24.928
but just in case, I'm going
to leave this for you.

00:50:24.928 --> 00:50:27.851
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Thank
you very much.

00:50:27.852 --> 00:50:29.258
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: We will take
two more questions.

00:50:29.258 --> 00:50:34.676

all fashion accessories.

00:50:34.677 --> 00:50:37.460
Thank you.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.278
So sweet.

00:50:38.278 --> 00:50:41.216
&gt;&gt;&gt; Have a great show.

00:50:41.217 --> 00:50:43.183
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I can't --
is that going to fit?

00:50:43.183 --> 00:50:50.393
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Do you want
-- &gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: It's not

00:50:50.393 --> 00:50:53.243
balancing very well.

00:50:53.243 --> 00:50:54.248
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Okay.

00:50:54.248 --> 00:50:55.366
Two more questions.

00:50:55.367 --> 00:50:56.470
Okay.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:57.543
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very
much for coming.

00:50:57.543 --> 00:50:58.596
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Hi.

00:50:58.597 --> 00:51:00.845
&gt;&gt;&gt; So much of your music is as
you kind of labeled it, the

00:51:00.845 --> 00:51:03.378
avant-garde, technorock and kind
of lends itself toward

00:51:03.378 --> 00:51:06.226
this really epic sound.

00:51:06.227 --> 00:51:09.290
And then you take those songs
and you make these amazing

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.038
acoustic versions that are just
this polar opposite in

00:51:13.038 --> 00:51:14.160
terms of the musicality.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.595
And I was wondering if you could
talk about the process

00:51:16.595 --> 00:51:19.445
of building those two songs out
of the same lyrics, same

00:51:19.445 --> 00:51:21.600
chords, same songs.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.981
And is there one that
you like performing?

00:51:23.982 --> 00:51:28.378
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: I guess what I
would like to say is a lot of

00:51:28.378 --> 00:51:32.730
times I will begin
at the piano.

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.943
I will write one of the songs on
the album that is truly one

00:51:36.943 --> 00:51:40.613
of my favorites called "the edge
of glory." And it's kind

00:51:40.613 --> 00:51:41.711
of a sad story.

00:51:41.712 --> 00:51:42.710
Sorry to be a downer.

00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:46.493
My grandpa died about five
months ago and my dad and I

00:51:46.493 --> 00:51:49.236
were going to say goodbye
to him at the hospice.

00:51:49.237 --> 00:51:53.386
And I got out a big thing of
agave tequila, and my dad sat

00:51:53.387 --> 00:51:56.663
next to me at the piano, and
we just started doing shots

00:51:56.663 --> 00:51:57.653
back and forth.

00:51:57.653 --> 00:51:59.696
And I wrote The Edge of Glory
on the piano, and

00:51:59.697 --> 00:52:01.576
my dad and I cried.

00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:05.143
And the song is about your
last moment on Earth, the

00:52:05.143 --> 00:52:07.046
moment of truth.

00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:10.360
The Edge of Glory is that
moment right before

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.131
you leave the Earth.

00:52:14.132 --> 00:52:17.961
So that song can be played on
the piano, but it's actually

00:52:17.962 --> 00:52:23.706
set to this giant, huge
technorock Springsteinesque

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:24.736
dance beat.

00:52:24.737 --> 00:52:27.133
I actually had Clarence Clemons
from the A Street Band

00:52:27.133 --> 00:52:28.923
come in and play saxophone
on it.

00:52:28.923 --> 00:52:33.516
It's fucking beautiful.

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.591
And I do that with a
lot of my songs.

00:52:35.592 --> 00:52:38.805
But it's funny, it's so
interesting to hear your

00:52:38.805 --> 00:52:42.948
perspective on it because that
is really what I wanted to do

00:52:42.948 --> 00:52:46.356
with this album, is I wanted
to show my abilities as a

00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:47.741
songwriter.

00:52:47.742 --> 00:52:49.768
So a lot of songs
are like that.

00:52:49.768 --> 00:52:52.981
There's really no song on the
album that can't be played at

00:52:52.982 --> 00:52:54.320
a piano acoustically.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.681
It's all about the songwriting,
it's all about my

00:52:56.682 --> 00:53:00.348
abilities as a writer from
a melodic perspective.

00:53:00.348 --> 00:53:02.376
And I coproduced every
song on the album.

00:53:02.377 --> 00:53:07.611
So, sonically, it just
smells like me.

00:53:07.612 --> 00:53:13.651
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, in my opinion, all good

00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:19.296
music can be played at a piano
and still sound like a hit.

00:53:19.297 --> 00:53:20.883
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

more question here.

I'm Chris.

00:53:26.412 --> 00:53:28.728
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Hello.

00:53:28.728 --> 00:53:31.938
Why do I feel like some of you
were coaxed into doing this?

[ Laughter ]

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.753
&gt;&gt;&gt; Because we were promised
we would get a prize if we

00:53:34.753 --> 00:53:37.303
were the best-dressed.

00:53:37.303 --> 00:53:39.273
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So you get 200
bucks after you take those

00:53:39.273 --> 00:53:42.593
balls off, huh?

00:53:42.593 --> 00:53:45.501
&gt;&gt;&gt; They're actually loufahs.

00:53:45.502 --> 00:53:47.311
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: They're
what, loufahs?

00:53:47.312 --> 00:53:48.268
I'm sorry.

00:53:48.268 --> 00:53:50.291
Can I take my glasses off?

00:53:50.292 --> 00:53:52.645
You can take a really fancy
shower, then, after this.

00:53:52.645 --> 00:53:54.491
[ Laughter ]

00:53:54.492 --> 00:53:55.866
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:53:55.867 --> 00:53:57.588
So I've got to figure out my

00:53:57.588 --> 00:54:00.608
(inaudible) because I'm nervous.

00:54:00.608 --> 00:54:03.878
What I wanted to ask you, after
hearing you talk, you

00:54:03.878 --> 00:54:07.341
have a very positive
look on life.

00:54:07.342 --> 00:54:09.336
So I was just kind of wondering

00:54:09.337 --> 00:54:10.313
where that came from.

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.105
What happened in your
life to shape that?

00:54:12.105 --> 00:54:15.315
Because not many people are like
you and can always say

00:54:15.315 --> 00:54:17.576
rebuke things that are
bad and, you know,

00:54:17.577 --> 00:54:20.550
always look to the good.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.853
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Well, my mom.

00:54:22.853 --> 00:54:24.828
I have a really good mom.

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:27.795
She really was there for me.

00:54:27.795 --> 00:54:31.780
And she always taught me
to be very gracious.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.495
My mother's the kind of person
that will give you the shirt

00:54:34.495 --> 00:54:37.485
off her back if you're cold.

00:54:37.485 --> 00:54:39.993
And that is how I was raised.

00:54:39.993 --> 00:54:42.060
But I guess I would also say --
I don't know if people in

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.605
this room are religious.

00:54:43.605 --> 00:54:46.476
I always feel kind of awkward
talking about religion,

00:54:46.477 --> 00:54:50.651
because I don't want people to
feel like I'm impressing any

00:54:50.652 --> 00:54:52.481
kind of belief on you.

00:54:52.482 --> 00:54:56.646
But I do see -- I do believe
that God comes in many forms.

00:54:56.647 --> 00:55:00.406
And I don't believe that we
know what he looks like.

00:55:00.407 --> 00:55:05.308
That's something that I actually
address in Judas.

00:55:05.308 --> 00:55:07.735
But I see God in my fans.

00:55:07.735 --> 00:55:10.310
So every night when I look into
the audience, I feel like

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:18.261
I see this -- this force of
beauty and that I don't know,

00:55:18.262 --> 00:55:19.631
it's just faith.

00:55:19.632 --> 00:55:21.485
So I see faith in my fans.

00:55:21.485 --> 00:55:24.625
And that's what keeps
me strong, is them.

00:55:24.625 --> 00:55:27.391
Is I really -- when I go out
there, I don't go out after

00:55:27.392 --> 00:55:30.845
the show and get plastered and
do a ton of drugs and when I

00:55:30.845 --> 00:55:34.001
go on stage the next day
I can barely sing.

00:55:34.002 --> 00:55:36.468
I'm very, very disciplined
and hard-working.

00:55:36.468 --> 00:55:42.080
And I am a -- as a blond woman
with tits and ass, very proud

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.456
of my accomplishments
as a musician.

00:55:44.457 --> 00:55:47.585
And I say that with
lots of strength.

00:55:47.585 --> 00:55:48.988
People call it arrogance.

00:55:48.988 --> 00:55:55.571
But I do believe that women in
pop music have a very bad rap.

00:55:55.572 --> 00:55:58.330
And I think people have learned
to expect very little

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.471
from all of us.

00:56:00.472 --> 00:56:01.936
And it's very unfair.

00:56:01.937 --> 00:56:04.341
It's very prejudiced.

00:56:04.342 --> 00:56:06.850
So me and my tits and my ass and
my brain are very proud to

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.736
be here today.

in your life doesn't have to

be religion or an institution
or a certain kind of God.

It's just you must worship
your faith.

I -- perhaps I'm speaking
in my own Gaga tongues.

But I worship my fans is
what I'm trying to say.

00:57:21.018 --> 00:57:23.543
28th, is your 25th birthday.

00:57:23.543 --> 00:57:26.071
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Yes.

00:57:26.072 --> 00:57:29.041
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:57:29.042 --> 00:57:30.285
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: So
happy birthday.

00:57:30.285 --> 00:57:31.251
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Thank you.

00:57:31.252 --> 00:57:34.461
Can I just keep telling
people I'm 24.

00:57:34.462 --> 00:57:35.511
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer:
We won't tell.

00:57:35.512 --> 00:57:38.256
Google might, but we won't.

00:57:38.257 --> 00:57:40.175
We have a surprise for you,
which you can tell there are

00:57:40.175 --> 00:57:41.831
many people in the audience
dressed up in

00:57:41.832 --> 00:57:43.661
their best Gaga garb.

00:57:43.662 --> 00:57:46.271
We've handed cards
to a few people.

00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:48.888
So why don't the people who
got a card before the show

00:57:48.888 --> 00:57:51.058
come up, and we're going
to have you critique

00:57:51.058 --> 00:57:52.671
the best Lady Gaga.

00:57:52.672 --> 00:57:56.528
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Thank you.

00:57:56.528 --> 00:57:58.730
Oh, my goodness.

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.348
I can't really -- do you
want to come up here?

00:58:01.348 --> 00:58:02.420
Hi.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.523
Can I hug all of you?

00:58:03.523 --> 00:58:06.500
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.050
&gt;&gt;&gt; Group hug!

00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.833
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: That's
really good.

00:58:10.833 --> 00:58:16.188
Hello.

00:58:16.188 --> 00:58:18.003
Thank you.

00:58:18.003 --> 00:58:21.448
[ Laughter ]

00:58:21.448 --> 00:58:22.068
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Thank you.

00:58:22.068 --> 00:58:22.680
Hi.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.538
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:58:23.538 --> 00:58:24.775
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Hello.

00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:25.673
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:58:25.673 --> 00:58:27.195
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: This
is interesting.

00:58:27.195 --> 00:58:29.210
It's very Yves St.-Laurent.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:36.810
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is an ammunition
belt from World War II.

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:37.800
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Hi.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:41.740
You look beautiful.

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.841
You know what's so funny?

00:58:44.842 --> 00:58:47.621
Is when I was on my
first record label

00:58:47.622 --> 00:58:48.561
-- you can go back.

00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:50.103
I'm sorry.

00:58:50.103 --> 00:58:54.291
She's like -- When I was on my
first record label, Def Jam,

00:58:54.292 --> 00:58:57.931
not to bring up a sour story,
but I sent all of the

00:58:57.932 --> 00:59:02.370
employees at Def Jam Disco
balls that I hand-painted

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:08.316
myself, like that, except I
wrote "Gaga" all over them.

00:59:08.317 --> 00:59:12.595
And I sent them huge bags of
candy from the Dollar Store --

00:59:12.595 --> 00:59:14.528
[ Laughter ]

00:59:14.528 --> 00:59:15.688
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: -- with these
Disco balls that

00:59:15.688 --> 00:59:16.891
had my name on it.

00:59:16.892 --> 00:59:19.326
And I got dropped, like,
a month later.

00:59:19.327 --> 00:59:25.380
Somebody in the office was,
like, "Who sent all these

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:31.546
gummy worms and Disco balls
that say 'Gaga?'" I

00:59:31.547 --> 00:59:38.506
hand-painted those suckers,
every one of them.

00:59:38.507 --> 00:59:40.406
Okay.

00:59:40.407 --> 00:59:43.585
Well, this is very good.

00:59:43.585 --> 00:59:47.236
And this is very good, because
it looks almost exactly like

00:59:47.237 --> 00:59:50.580
my Theirry Mugler-inspired
outfit from the

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:53.586
very first Fame Ball.

00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.165
This is amazing, because
it looks just like

00:59:55.165 --> 00:59:57.933
the telephone video.

00:59:57.933 --> 01:00:05.355
However, I have to say that the
mark of a true Gaga fan is

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:08.080
always thinking forward.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.980
And that is you.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.820
[ Applause ]

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.903
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: It's
very detailed.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:17.478
It's very detailed.

01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:19.741
The ponytail looks perfect.

01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:24.918
The shoulderpads, you did a nice
job with the duct tape.

01:00:24.918 --> 01:00:27.895
[ Laughter ]

01:00:27.895 --> 01:00:31.748
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And that is exactly
-- it took me an hour

01:00:31.748 --> 01:00:33.398
to get my makeup
done for that.

01:00:33.398 --> 01:00:34.753
And it's -- &gt;&gt;&gt; 15 minutes.

01:00:34.753 --> 01:00:35.713
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: 15 minutes.

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:37.053
See?

01:00:37.053 --> 01:00:40.238
That's a really glamour girl.

01:00:40.238 --> 01:00:41.528
Well, congratulations.

01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:42.696
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:00:42.697 --> 01:00:44.021
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: You
are the winner.

01:00:44.022 --> 01:00:45.200
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Thank
you, guys.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.403
And as we heard, Gaga is
performing in Oakland tonight.

01:00:47.403 --> 01:00:51.120
So all of our competition here
on stage will get a pair of

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.390
tickets to the concert
tonight.

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:59.166
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Here, you can
have the riding crop.

01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:00.951
You look really, really
wonderful.

01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:04.636
That -- actually, that setup
was -- just to explain it a

01:01:04.637 --> 01:01:08.825
little bit -- Rico, who is in
the video with me, he has the

01:01:08.825 --> 01:01:13.016
same -- he's tattooed
that way.

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:14.545
&gt;&gt;&gt; I read that last night.

01:01:14.545 --> 01:01:15.798
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: Yeah, that's
really -- he's really

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:17.100
tattooed that way.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.105
And I asked him, you know, when
we were on the set, I

01:01:20.105 --> 01:01:23.276
said, "Why did you get" -- it's
kind of like a weird,

01:01:23.277 --> 01:01:25.611
funny question -- "but why did
you tattoo yourself that way?"

01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:29.210
And he said, "Bazooka Gum."
I said, "What do you mean,

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.540
Bazooka Gum?" And he said, "Well
you know how Bazooka Gum

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.125
comes with the stick-on
tattoos?" He said, "I really

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:36.915
liked them and I loved punk rock
when I was a kid, so I

01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:40.330
just used to listen to punk
rock and put Bazooka Gum

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.268
tatoos on, so I tattooed my face
like this." So that's why

01:01:43.268 --> 01:01:46.398
we chewed bubble gum
in the video.

01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:52.106
But I wanted to tribute Rico,
because I believe -- what this

01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:57.390
look represented to me was that
I will not allow society

01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:00.650
or critics to dictate
my beauty.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:05.060
I -- I tell you what I believe
is beautiful about me.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.948
Every person defines their own
beauty for themselves.

01:02:07.948 --> 01:02:11.460
So that's what that makeup
represents to me, is that Rico

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:17.283
was defining who he is in an
artistic way and not relying

01:02:17.283 --> 01:02:22.436
on society to tell him what
makes him valuable.

01:02:22.437 --> 01:02:27.318
[ Applause ]

01:02:27.318 --> 01:02:28.711
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So you
look fabulous.

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:29.781
She's coming to the show?

01:02:29.782 --> 01:02:30.575
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: Yes.

01:02:30.575 --> 01:02:31.416
They're all coming
to the show.

01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:32.241
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: All right.

01:02:32.242 --> 01:02:34.523
You're going to fit right in.

01:02:34.523 --> 01:02:35.856
[ Laughter ]

01:02:35.857 --> 01:02:36.753
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And they
are not the only

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.883
people who are coming.

01:02:37.883 --> 01:02:39.990
So we have 40 more of
these cards taped to

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.708
the bottom of seats.

01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:43.983
So if you look under your
seat, you get a pair of

01:02:43.983 --> 01:02:52.316
tickets to the Gaga concert
tonight. (Screams).

01:02:52.317 --> 01:02:55.091
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: There are
instructions on the back as to

01:02:55.092 --> 01:02:59.451
how to -- &gt;&gt;Lady
Gaga: So cute.

01:02:59.452 --> 01:03:04.650
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And just --
someone found one over here.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:07.440
Just so no one leaves
empty-handed, we actually have

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.173
special edition Google
Goes Gaga tee shirts

01:03:10.173 --> 01:03:13.000
for everyone here.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.093
They are in Benghazi in building
43, they're there

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:19.735
now, so you can stop by
on your way leaving.

01:03:19.735 --> 01:03:21.958
I just want to say thank
you, thank you to the

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:27.431
Haus of Gaga for this.

01:03:27.432 --> 01:03:30.318
There have been an unbelievable
number of people

01:03:30.318 --> 01:03:32.675
here at Google who have helped
out, but mainly Andrew

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:36.555
Schulte, along with
(saying name).

01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:41.960
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: And, actually, some
of you don't know this,

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.496
but Andrew was an RA at third
north where I went to college.

01:03:46.497 --> 01:03:48.901
And he wrote me up for
drinking in my room.

01:03:48.902 --> 01:03:52.933
[ Laughter ]

01:03:52.933 --> 01:03:56.451
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: And she
came to Google anyway.

01:03:56.452 --> 01:04:00.240
&gt;&gt;Lady Gaga: So we go
way back, Google.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.815
&gt;&gt;Marissa Mayer: I just want
to say, a huge thank you to

01:04:01.815 --> 01:04:03.495
you from all of us and
from your fans.

01:04:03.495 --> 01:04:07.790
Thank you so much for
being here today.
