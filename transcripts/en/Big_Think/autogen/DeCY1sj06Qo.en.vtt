ID agonists are the best treatments that
 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.590
ID agonists are the best treatments that
we have for opioid addiction and what

having you know there's a million things

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
having you know there's a million things
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.809
having you know there's a million things
that could look like oh you think they

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
that could look like oh you think they
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.250
that could look like oh you think they
have a drug problem and there's

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
have a drug problem and there's
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.470
have a drug problem and there's
something else going on so if you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480
something else going on so if you
 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.220
something else going on so if you
approach the person with respect and not

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230
approach the person with respect and not
 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.920
approach the person with respect and not
assuming that you're going to find a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930
assuming that you're going to find a
 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.140
assuming that you're going to find a
drug thing unless you know I mean

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
drug thing unless you know I mean
 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.550
drug thing unless you know I mean
obviously in some situations it's

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560
obviously in some situations it's
 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.129
obviously in some situations it's
completely obvious but in most

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139
completely obvious but in most
 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.509
completely obvious but in most
situations it isn't and so the best way

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
situations it isn't and so the best way
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.509
situations it isn't and so the best way
I think is to say I've noticed XYZ I'm
