00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.209
Voiceover: Talking about
pensions isn't always

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.026
viewed as the most
interesting thing to do,

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:08.204
but hopefully this video and the next one

00:00:08.204 --> 00:00:10.590
might convince you that
it is at least worth

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.667
talking about and
understanding because it has

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.207
major implications for
the fiscal situation

00:00:15.207 --> 00:00:18.820
of many, many, many states in the U.S.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.024
A pension is essentially
a defined benefit plan.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:27.371
Defined benefit plan for retirement.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.406
We can compare that to a
defined contribution plan.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:37.036
Defined contribution plan.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.855
The defined contribution plan, and this is

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:44.456
more typical in a lot of
private companies right now,

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:48.022
every year that you work,
let's plot a little graph here.

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.125
This is years that you're working,

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:54.974
and this is kind of compensation.

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:56.898
This is compensation right over here.

00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:59.392
In a defined contribution,
every year that you work,

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.333
you're obviously going
to make your salary.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.927
Let's say you're making $60,000 a year.

00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:04.134
You're obviously going to make

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:05.959
your salary every year that you work.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.787
In a defined contribution plan,

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:09.055
let's say this is when you retire,

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:10.770
let's say for simplicity, we're assuming

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.393
that you're going to retire at 65.

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:14.391
At 65, you're no longer going to be

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:16.130
making your salary anymore.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.961
You're not working for
that company anymore.

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.300
What the company will
do is set up some plan,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.213
and a lot of these are 401(k)s, IRAs,

00:01:23.213 --> 00:01:25.308
where some combination of you and

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:27.417
the company will set some money aside,

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.338
and it's usually done
in a tax-deferred way,

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:31.525
so you don't have to pay
taxes on it in that year.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.795
Every year, you're going
to set some money aside,

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:35.010
and I'll do that in green.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.991
You're going to set maybe
10% of your income aside

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:40.834
in every year, so these are every year.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.121
Actually, the years are
going to be much smaller

00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:44.639
than that, if we're thinking
this is about 30 years.

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:48.062
Over the 30 years,
you're setting some level

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:50.055
of money aside, and you're investing it:

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:51.640
you're putting it in the
stock market; you're buying

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.426
bonds with it; you're buying mutual funds.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:54.922
Who knows what you might be doing with it?

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:58.128
You're setting this money
aside, so that when you

00:01:58.128 --> 00:02:02.011
retire, it will hopefully have grown.

00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:04.260
Well, one, it's there,
and you've invested it.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.856
Hopefully, if you've invested
it well and the stock

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:07.994
market didn't do anything
crazy, it will have grown,

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.813
and it will be just a
big lump sum of money.

00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:13.922
Let's say that you set aside $6,000 a year

00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:19.151
on average for 30 years,
so you set aside $180,000.

00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.755
Let's say you invested it
pretty well, and now that has

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:25.735
grown to, I don't know,
let's say it's grown

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:28.198
to $1 million, because
it was invested well.

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:29.436
We could do the math to figure out what

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.132
it could grow based on
different growth rates.

00:02:31.132 --> 00:02:34.745
You have this huge lump sum of money now.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:36.945
I'm not even drawing it to scale.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.142
You have this huge lump sum of money,

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.195
$1 million, assuming it was invested well.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:42.634
If it was invested badly,

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:47.892
maybe that $180,000 is still $180,000.

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:49.794
In theory, maybe if it
was invested really badly,

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.142
it could be even less than $180,000.

00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:54.492
Whatever that number is,
whether it's $1 million

00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:57.060
or whether it's $200,000, or whether it's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.726
something smaller, that's
essentially the money

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:01.886
that you have to live
on for your retirement.

00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:03.659
Regardless of how long you live,

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.144
regardless of what the
cost of living might be,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.327
regardless of what your needs might be,

00:03:08.327 --> 00:03:12.965
regardless of how expensive
your healthcare might be,

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:17.326
this is going to be the money
that you have to live on.

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.267
It might be more than enough money, if you

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.344
invest it well and you
put enough money aside;

00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:22.839
it might be a lot less than you need,

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.665
in which case you're
going to be in trouble.

00:03:24.665 --> 00:03:27.591
A defined benefit plan,
and this is typical;

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:30.258
a lot of state employees
have defined benefit plan,

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:33.063
a lot of more traditional industries

00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:34.664
oftentimes that are unionized.

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:37.394
You also have a defined
benefit plan or a pension,

00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:39.664
and the situation is a little different.

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:43.964
Just like any organization,
you will get your salary

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:46.453
every year that you
work; and let's just say

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:48.943
that this is over the course of 30 years.

00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:52.037
Once again, you retire at age 65.

00:03:54.866 --> 00:03:58.547
In defined benefit plan,
the employer is going to

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:00.321
set aside some money, and sometimes

00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:02.531
the employee sets some
money aside as well,

00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.481
so some money is set aside.

00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.461
Once again, the money is set aside,

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:12.269
and it is invested,
hopefully in a safe way.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.106
But regardless of what that
money and regardless of

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:18.123
what that turns into
through an investment,

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:21.056
you are guaranteed a
certain degree of benefits.

00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:24.992
In this case, you are
guaranteed; let's say that

00:04:24.992 --> 00:04:27.527
if you'd done more than
20 years of service here,

00:04:27.527 --> 00:04:30.989
you get 60% of your
last five years' salary.

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:33.621
There's different ways of
defining that defined benefit.

00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:37.052
It could be like that, it
could be you get $100 per month

00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:39.473
for every year that you
worked at the organization.

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:42.919
You get $100 per month
extra when you retire.

00:04:43.672 --> 00:04:46.470
But they tend to be for life,
for the rest of your life.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.737
So from 65 until you pass away,

00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:55.898
you are guaranteed this defined benefit.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:01.138
If the money is set
aside, if it was set aside

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:03.410
and invested well and
happen to be a lot more

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.682
money than necessary,
that's great, but all

00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:09.022
the employee would get is
this kind of guarantee.

00:05:09.022 --> 00:05:10.732
If the money is less than necessary,

00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:14.270
then the company is still promising that

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.520
they are going to pay this benefit.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730
They'll probably have to
put more, or the state,

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.686
or whoever is doing
this, would have to put

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:25.868
more money in in order
to pay this compensation.

00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:28.446
Now, what are the things
that you would have to

00:05:28.446 --> 00:05:30.174
estimate if you are the
person setting aside

00:05:30.174 --> 00:05:33.266
this money, to figure out
what you have to set aside

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:36.748
in order to give this defined benefit?

00:05:36.748 --> 00:05:39.258
You're going to have to hire
a bunch of statisticians,

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:41.006
essentially actuaries,

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:43.458
to say how long are people going to live.

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:45.940
You're going to have to
care about life span.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.424
Obviously, you can't predict
any one person's life span,

00:05:48.424 --> 00:05:49.836
but if you're doing this for hundreds

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:52.064
of thousands of employees, maybe you can

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:54.335
figure out what a likely life span is.

00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:56.270
You're going to have to
figure out cost of living.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.948
Inflation is a measure of cost of living,

00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:00.917
but it might be more
specific to the region, or it

00:06:00.917 --> 00:06:03.206
might be negotiated in
some ways with the union.

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:06.605
You're going to have cost of living.

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:09.068
This is a cost of living adjustment.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.475
When people talk about COLAs,

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.424
if they're not talking about soda,

00:06:12.424 --> 00:06:15.585
they're talking about cost
of living adjustments.

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:16.869
You're going to have to think about

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.930
this money that you set aside.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.446
What is the assumed growth rate?

00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:26.730
What is the assumed growth rate?

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.331
If you make very optimistic
estimates of how well your

00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:32.912
investments will do, you
can set aside less money.

00:06:32.912 --> 00:06:35.153
If you think that your
money isn't going to

00:06:35.153 --> 00:06:37.135
do well investment-wise, you're going to

00:06:37.135 --> 00:06:40.203
have to set aside even more money.

00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:43.395
This is one of the cruxes of the issue,

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:44.875
because you could imagine,

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:46.653
let's say that we're
talking at a state level,

00:06:46.653 --> 00:06:50.453
and people are, right now let's say that

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:53.116
your current actuaries or
statisticians are saying,

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:55.548
"Look, for this person,
in order to guarantee them

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:57.866
60% of their salary when they retire,"

00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:01.123
so that's $36,000, "In
order to guarantee that,

00:07:01.123 --> 00:07:03.454
we have to put aside ..." and I'm just

00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:06.457
estimating these number right over here.

00:07:06.457 --> 00:07:09.223
Let's say we have to
set aside $6,000 a year,

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:11.787
especially when we're 30 years in advance.

00:07:11.787 --> 00:07:13.281
Actually, let me do a
little more than that.

00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.075
Let's say $10,000 per year.

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:18.146
Let's say that the person in charge,

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.056
the state official, goes
to those actuaries and say,

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:21.735
"What are you assuming
about how much we're

00:07:21.735 --> 00:07:23.797
going to get on our investments here?"

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:25.148
The actuaries are saying,

00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:28.672
"We're going to assume
a fairly conservative.

00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:30.429
"We're going to assume that

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:35.794
we're going to get 3%
return on our money."

00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:36.996
But then the state official says,

00:07:36.996 --> 00:07:39.398
ideally, they would want some of this

00:07:39.398 --> 00:07:41.965
$10,000 per year to spend on other things,

00:07:41.965 --> 00:07:44.397
and so they would like this to be lower.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:47.266
They say, "That seems very conservative.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.174
"In the last 10 years in the stock market,

00:07:49.174 --> 00:07:51.860
"we've gotten 10% return," or, "I know an

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.535
"endowment that's
recently gotten 6% return.

00:07:54.535 --> 00:07:56.662
"Why don't we assume a higher return here?

00:07:56.662 --> 00:07:58.890
"If we assume a higher return,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:04.200
"why don't we assume a 5% return?"

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.263
All of a sudden, if we're
assuming a 5% return,

00:08:06.263 --> 00:08:09.559
then we'll have to set
aside less money that year.

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:11.554
$8,000 a year.

00:08:11.554 --> 00:08:13.222
Sometimes, it's not even this,

00:08:13.222 --> 00:08:15.210
it's not even this playing
with the assumptions,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.100
making more optimistic
assumptions that allow you

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.867
to spend less money in that current year,

00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:22.605
sometimes you might know
that you have to spend

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:26.267
$10,000 a year to kind of be able to

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.823
properly fund these
pensions in the future.

00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.669
You do have some type
of unfunded pensions;

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:33.217
but, in theory, a
responsible party should try

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:36.307
to fund these as much as possible.

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.460
You might know that you
have to fund $10,000 a year

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.810
in order to credibly
give this defined benefit

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.336
for this employee 30 years in the future.

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:47.474
But 30 years in the future is a long time.

00:08:47.474 --> 00:08:49.610
You have present difficuties;

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.045
you have present shortfalls
in your budget, and say,

00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:54.315
"I recognize that I have
to put $10,000 a year,"

00:08:54.315 --> 00:08:55.908
but you still don't do that,

00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:57.595
so you underfund the pension.

00:08:57.595 --> 00:09:00.346
Even if you recognize this,
or if you recognize this,

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:03.693
you still only put $5,000 a year.

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:06.202
Really just kind of kicking
the can down the road,

00:09:06.202 --> 00:09:08.800
hoping that the next guy or
gal who's in your position

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.130
is going to figure out
something; or maybe you'll just

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.003
be very optimistic that
the growth will turn out,

00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:17.145
or that the state will
eventually work things out.

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.404
What we'll see over the next video,

00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:27.793
this notion of underfunding
pensions is a big, big,

00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:30.199
big, big problem because we've had decades

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:32.397
of underfunded pensions, and it's been

00:09:32.397 --> 00:09:34.464
especially pronounced
in particular states.

00:09:34.464 --> 00:09:37.202
Because of that, those
states, in order to fund

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:40.269
the pension obligations
that are hitting now,

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:43.468
those expenses for
employees that are retired

00:09:43.468 --> 00:09:46.465
are starting to grow beyond their budgets

00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:48.696
for the employees that
are working right now.

00:09:48.696 --> 00:09:49.797
It's a tough issue.

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.538
You can't cut these things very easily.

00:09:51.538 --> 00:09:52.743
People expected these.

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:53.538
These are retirees.

00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:54.661
These are people who've been working

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.862
their whole life based on this assumption.

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:58.555
But, at the same time, they're starting to

00:09:58.555 --> 00:10:01.744
squeeze out key services
that the state is doing.

00:10:01.744 --> 00:10:05.744
It turns into a major, major hairy issue.
