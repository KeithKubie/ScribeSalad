00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's our last random graph of this unit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to again generate a graph on n nodes recursively.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Same structure as before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If there's 1 node, we just return that node.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Otherwise, we do it recursively.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So we generate a graph on n/2 nodes--call that G1.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We generate a graph on n/2 nodes and call it G2--different graph.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now we randomly scramble the nodes in those two,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
keeping the edges in their appropriate way.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Just consider them in a particular order.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Then we connect the first node in this ordering in G1 to the first node in this ordering in G2,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the second one in this ordering in G1 to the second one in G2,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
third one to the third one, forth one to the forth one, and so on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now we get a set of edges that now breach across these two graphs,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we call this G and return it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So based on this random generation process we can ask,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what kind of graph structure did we make?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Is it a ring, a tree, a hypercube, or maybe none of these?
