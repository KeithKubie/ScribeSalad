00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
&gt;&gt; Thank You all for coming to today's
very special Musicians@Google event.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
We have the wonderful Josh Ritter

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.834
who's releasing his new album
"So Runs the World Away".

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:24.066
[audience applauding]

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.734
Ah, we're very lucky that Josh is actually here.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:30.200
Josh managed to get into Dublin
this morning at 9 o'clock was it?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yes, yeah

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.867
&gt;&gt; He's probably extremely jetlagged

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.667
but is being extremely kind
to come in and play for us all.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:38.834
So Josh before you play a few tracks
from the new album,

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:40.600
ah, we're just going to have
a quick chat with you.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.567
&gt;&gt;Josh: Sure, yeah

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:42.533
&gt;&gt; Dave, your manager,

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.834
was saying you actually have a bit
of history kind of around this area.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.433
Did you write part of "Hello Starling"
or something?

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:52.967
Josh: Yeah, I wrote a lot of songs here
and in "Rings End", yeah.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:54.834
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.967
&gt;&gt;Josh: Jetlag is amazing for that.

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:01.800
It takes, you know,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.600
I would wake up at 5 in the morning
in Dave's house where he was living,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.700
and it was just filled with CD cases.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.100
And I would wake up and Metallica
would be looking at me in the face,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400
and I would get up and write songs.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.200
[laughing]

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.967
&gt;&gt; So, we'll just have a quick chat
about the new album.

00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:23.367
&gt;&gt;Josh: Sure

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:29.533
&gt;&gt; So on your website you said that this was
by far the most difficult album for you to make.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.934
In what way was it like so tough to make?

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:36.133
&gt;&gt;Josh: Well, I don't really believe in tortured art.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.033
You know I think that most of the time
if you're happy,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.033
you make good stuff that can, you know,

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.967
you know, just because you're happy
doesn't mean you write happy songs,

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.400
but if you're content,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.900
you know, things will come out one way,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.834
and if you're kind of battering your head against
a wall things will come out another, you know?

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.133
Sometimes the--, you know,

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.600
any good work is,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.166
you do an enormous amount
of work just to get to the spot

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.367
where it starts to feel a little bit
more effortless, you know.

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:08.133
And that anything that's kind of done,

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.900
that's done elegantly that had
a lot of work that went into it;

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.367
I feel that's something that
I learned with this record.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:15.834
And I don't know,
it's probably something you guys

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.400
do quite a bit of yourself, you know.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.433
&gt;&gt; Hmmm.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:23.767
That tumbleweed [laughs].

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:29.834
You mention that you had this kind of creative
blockage for awhile and that "The Curse";

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.100
the third song on the album,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.033
seems to have been the thing that
got the creative juices flowing again.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:38.633
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yeah. Yeah. Well I grew up in Idaho
in a place pretty far out of town,

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:47.633
and I moved to New York and I wasn't prepared
for living in a city with so many dump trucks.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:54.066
Um, they go by the window like a parade,

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.300
ah, maybe 30 a night I feel like.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.900
And I was used to hearing
other sorts of sounds outside,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.200
so I would wake up in the night
with these dump trucks going by

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.934
and I'd felt like I had writer's block forever.

00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:09.066
I never believed in anything like writer's block,

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.100
I never thought it was a thing,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.633
um, I sort of scoffed at it,
and then I got it.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:17.333
And nothing I wrote felt right,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.000
and everything was feeling,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.300
I felt terrible and then one night, you know,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.400
30 dump trucks went by and I woke up and
I had this idea for this story about a mummy

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.667
who comes to New York and he's, you know,

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:37.266
he falls in love with an archeologist and
[laughter from audience]

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:41.333
&gt;&gt; So it all flowed from there then?

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.100
&gt;&gt;Josh: [laughing] yeah, yeah it was obvious.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.333
[audience laughing]

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.433
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of sort of,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:54.133
I get a sense of loneliness
or something from the album.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.233
A lot of the characters in songs
like "Southern Pacifica",

00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:00.900
they're staring out into an abyss
kind of separated from it.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.033
Is that a reflection of the sort of writer's
block that you were having at the time,

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:05.200
either directly or indirectly?

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.900
&gt;&gt;Josh: Well, I think that once I got that song,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.033
once I got "The Curse",
and I wrote it in the bathroom ,

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:11.767
I was sitting on the edge of the tub,

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:12.934
writing really quietly,

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:16.967
but then after that I realized
what I really liked about a lot of songs,

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:19.500
and a lot about the stuff that I was reading,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.133
a lot of books that I was reading was that it
always felt like everything was on the precipice

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:27.433
and that maybe bad things
were about to start happening,

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:32.667
but they hadn't quite happened yet
but they were about, you know,

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:36.734
and that's what I like in good fiction
and other things,

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.233
you know, the chance that something,

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.900
the tenseness [laughs]

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.467
&gt;&gt; You mean, you got married
roughly this time last year

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:46.734
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yeah, yeah

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.533
&gt;&gt; Do you think, thank you Wikipedia [laughs],

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:55.000
Do you think that sort of being
in the stable and strong relationship

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.934
like that gave you the confidence or the
foundation to explore those things of like,

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:01.066
unease and loneliness.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.200
Do you think you would have been able
to explore that, say if you had been

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.533
on your own in the world or something?

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.033
&gt;&gt;Josh: I think that um,

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:09.600
I'm just speaking for myself and you know,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.000
but I do think that getting married
has made me smarter, you know.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.033
[Laughter from audience]

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:17.900
&gt;&gt;Josh: I know that's not saying that, you know,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.767
there was no where to go but up there,

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:21.500
but uh,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.900
but there was uh,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.300
yeah, you can concentrate
on other things you know.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.166
&gt;&gt; This album, to me like kind of sounds,

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:33.433
it's a big sonic leap forward, I think.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:38.166
It's like, I know Peter Murphy in "Hot Press"
this week describes it as being really like

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.967
Mercury Rev's deserter's songs.

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.934
It's a really good comparison
but so much for that,

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:45.700
this is the same producer
for the second album in a row,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.400
does that allow you to kind of get
your vision across of what you want,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.767
like more easily or ...

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.767
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yeah, you know, for one thing,

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:57.300
just being with the same group
of people for such a long time.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.700
I've played with people in my band,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.333
some of them for over a decade.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:04.500
From the time I was in the middle of college.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.333
And those common experiences
are much more important

00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:12.000
than being able to talk in a musical theory language.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.967
You know, you can describe a chord progression,

00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:19.700
but if you have a common experience
that surrounds it,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.066
maybe you drove 15 hours listening
to one record,

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:25.600
because it was stuck in the van,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.133
everybody knows that such and such a sound,

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:31.633
and you can describe that
and say that you want that,

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:34.000
then we know what we're going for,
rather than, you know.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.967
So this is the first time I have every
worked with the same producer twice.

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:39.867
It's an amazing experience.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:40.934
I love it.

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.834
I'd rather play with my friends
than anybody else.

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:45.000
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.133
Well, would you be kind enough
to play us a few tracks?

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:49.200
&gt;&gt;Josh: Sure, yeah, yeah.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.667
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
